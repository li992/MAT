REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE Our remuneration principles Our Remuneration Policy is designed to support our overall vision to become the most dynamic, creative and trusted soft drinks company in the world.
At the heart of our vision is our people, which the company is required to attract, engage and retain from across our global sector.
To determine the shape, size and variability of each element of pay the Committee follow five key remuneration principles: Competitive market positioning To attract, retain and engage the executive talent we need to realise our vision and deliver our andopportunity strategy our remuneration arrangements need to be sufficiently competitive but not excessive.
Pay aligned with sustainable The mix between both fixed and variable pay as well as the balance between rewarding short long-termperformance versus long-term performance are critical to ensure they are correctly balanced and reward those behaviours that will lead to the realisation of our long-term vision without compromise for short-term gain.
In addition, all forms of variable pay are only fully delivered in return for performance materially above the standards required by the company and our shareholders: In other words the superior pay opportunity available can only be realised in return for superior performance.
Incentive metrics aligned with The performance measures selected to determine both our annual bonus and long-term ourstrategy and key KPIs incentive plans have been carefully considered to focus on a simple and effective selection of those key drivers of our strategy and long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Alignment of executive and To ensure the continued alignment of executive and shareholder interests, the greatest potential shareholderinterests pay opportunity for executives is via our long-term incentive plans.
Awards are based in shares and are dependent on a balance of absolute and relative growth in long-term value creation for shareholders.
In particular, the mix of share options and performance shares is designed to ensure that executives are only rewarded for superior market performance and the realisation of our vision.
This is further reinforced by meaningful shareholding guidelines for executives so that their long-term wealth remains tied to Britvics sustained long-term success.
Mindful of our wider stakeholder In support of our vision our Executive Directors pay arrangement are not only focused on responsibilities financial returns but also mindful of performance against our wider long-term stakeholder goals.
The Committee takes great care to set appropriate targets that do not compromise our wider stakeholder aspirations.
Both malus and clawback provisions are in place to address potential inappropriate actions or risk taking when determining incentive plan pay-outs.
