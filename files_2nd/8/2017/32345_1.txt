With Babcock, Im being given the chance to do exactly that.
My PhD in Marine Toxicology certainly had a nuclear element to it, which comes in handy when Im fixing a technical problem or making sure that people stay safe.
A typical day involves writing reports just as it did when I was a research scientist but it also includes talking to colleagues inside Babcock and to clients about safety or technical queries that might have been raised.
Im also likely to get my overalls on to go and examine a submarine.
As chair of Plymouth Women in STEM Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, Im very involved with sending our STEM Ambassadors to events and schools.
Teaching was an enjoyable and integral part of my role as a postdoctoral research scientist.
My STEM work allows me to continue teaching people about why science is so important to society and the great careers that women can build in the sector.
