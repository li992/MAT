Three of these are controlled by third parties: Photobox through co-investment with Exponent, and both Knight Square and Sentinel through management by Epiris as a result of co-investment.
Secondaries Secondary investments consist of limited partnership interests in third-party private equity funds purchased from investors exiting their positions prior to the end of the funds life.

Debt Debt investments consisted of loans to UK or international borrowers acquired in either the primary or the secondary market as either individual or portfolios of assets.

At 30th September 2017, Electra held investments in fifteen funds with an aggregate value of 35 million.
