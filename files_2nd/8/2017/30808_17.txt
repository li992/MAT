OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Record annual results driven by strong performance across all businesses In its final year before the forthcoming demerger, supported by the continued macroeconomic performance of Georgia, BGEO Group has delivered another year of strong earnings momentum.
Growth and returns in both the Banking Business and the Investment Businesses, now renamed Georgia Capital, continue to be high.
Following the completion of the demerger, we are confident both companies are independently extremely well positioned to continue their excellent recent track record for many years to come.
In line with IFRS requirements, the Group reviewed the classification of its operating segments at 31 December 2017.
Given the expectation, in line with Georgia Capitals strategy it is highly probable the Group will own less than a 50% stake in GHG at the end of 2018.
As a result, and in line with IFRS, the Group classified GHG as disposal group held for sale and its results of operations are reported under discontinued operations line as a single amount in the consolidated income statement.
Comparative periods have been restated accordingly to reflect reclassification of GHG from continuing operations into discontinued operations.
Assets and liabilities held by GHG are also presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2017 under assets of disposal group held for sale and liabilities of disposal group held for sale.
