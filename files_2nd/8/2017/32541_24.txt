Remuneration outcomes for Directors during the year In this section, we explain the pay outcomes for Directors in relation to the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
Table 47 shows the payments we expect to make and then tables 49 and 50 give more detail on how we have measured the performance outcomes with respect to the annual bonus and LTIP in the context of value created for shareholders.
1.1 Directors emoluments Audited The basis of disclosure in the table below is on an accruals basis.
This means that the annual bonus column includes the amount that will be paid in June 2017 in connection with performance achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
It should be noted that the annual bonus figure has been estimated for the purposes of the table, as final data on the Companys Total Property Return versus the peer group using the benchmark i. e. allMarch-valued properties will not be available until after the date of this reports publication.
The estimate has been derived from the most upto-date performance information available, and any payment made will be based on the final performance data when received and verified.
The values shown for the 2014 LTIP awards vesting for the three year performance period ended 31 March 2017 are based on estimated achievements against the performance measures and calculated using the average share price for the quarter then ended.
The actual share price is not known at the time of writing as the awards do not formally vest until July 2017.
Basic salary is stated as a per annum figure based on current annual salary at the end of 2016 17.
Actual salaries paid in the year were 766,156 Robert Noel and 498,724 Martin Greenslade.
Benefits consist of a car allowance, private medical insurance, income protection and life assurance premiums.
The pension allowance shown is a cash emolument of 25% of base salary.
The annual bonus for 2015 16 was estimated in last years report and therefore the amounts for the bonus deferred into shares have been adjusted to reflect actual values.
The impact of the adjustment was a reduction of 3,527 for Robert Noel and a reduction of 2,296 for Martin Greenslade.
The long-term incentives for 2016 17 have been calculated using a share price of 10.35 which is the three-month average to 31 March 2017.
The long-term incentives vesting in 2015 16 were estimated in last years report, so have been adjusted to reflect actual values.
The impact of the adjustment was a reduction of 31,076 for Robert Noel and a reduction of 21,021 for Martin Greenslade.

Of this, 130% was dependent on meeting Group targets and 20% dependent on meeting personal targets.
All targets were set at the beginning of the year.
The following table confirms the targets and their respective outcomes.

Awards granted in 2014 under the LTIP for this period are subject to performance conditions that measure and compare the Groups relative performance against its peers in terms of Total Property Return TPR and Total Shareholder Return TSR, with each measure representing 50% of the total award.
Please see table 61 for more detail on how vesting levels are determined.
The performance calculation for awards granted in 2014 and vesting in 2017 are illustrated below: Long-Term Incentive Plan and Matching Share Plan outturns Table 50 Outturn Percentage of base Percentage of Target salary maximum Assessment maximum 1 Ungeared Total 75 75 maximum The Groups Total Property Return over the three year period was 12.7% 50.0 Property Return shares pledged per annum compared with the performance of the sector-weighted IPD Quarterly Universe of 11.5% per annum.
Therefore, this element vests in full.
Total Shareholder Return 75 75 maximum The Groups Total Shareholder Return over the three year period was 9.2% 0.0 shares pledged versus that of the comparator group at 16.2%.
As this return was below the benchmark, this element of the total award does not vest.
The outturn is adjusted to take account of the performance of trading properties and the capital and income extracted from Queen Annes Gate, SW1, through a bond issued in 2009.
In total, therefore, 50% of the awards made in 2014 will vest in July 2017.
For awards granted in 2015, the Groups performance over the two years to 31 March 2017 would, if sustained over the three year period to 31 March 2018, result in 0% of the LTIP share awards vesting.
For awards granted in 2016, performance over the one year period to 31 March 2017 would, if sustained over the second and third years of the period to 31 March 2019, result in 22.4% of the LTIP share awards vesting.

Application of Policy for 2016 17 3.1 Executive Directors base salaries Having conducted a detailed benchmarking exercise of both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer roles in 2015, the Committee concluded that no formal exercise was necessary this year, in line with emerging best practice.
It has therefore awarded both Executive Directors a base salary increase of 2%.
This is in line with the average increase received by employees across the Group, excluding promotions and exceptional increases.

Comparison of Chief Executive pay to Total Shareholder Return The following graph illustrates the performance of the Company measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends paid against a broad equity market index over a period of eight years.
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graph.
An additional line to illustrate the Companys performance compared with the FTSE 100 Index over the previous eight years is also included.
Adjacent to this chart is a table showing how the single figure of total remuneration for the Chief Executive has moved over the same period.
Itshould be noted that Robert Noel became Chief Executive in March 2012.

Dilution Awards granted under the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which cover those made under the LTIP, MSP, Deferred Share Bonus Plan and the Executive Share Option Plan are satisfied through the funding of an Employee Benefit Trust administered by an external trustee which acquires existing Land Securities Group PLC shares in the market.
The Employee Benefit Trust held 792,556 shares at 31 March 2017.
The exercise of share options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all employees who have completed more than one months service with the Group, can be satisfied by the allotment of newly issued shares.
At 31 March 2017, the total number of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 354,783 shares, which represents significantly less than 1% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Remuneration Committee meetings The Committee met four times over the course of the year, and all of the members attended all meetings.
Simon Palley chaired the Committee, and the other members during the year were Dame Alison Carnwath, Edward Bonham Carter and Cressida Hogg.
The Committee meetings were also attended by the Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director, and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who acted as the Committees Secretary.
Over the course of the year, the Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary legal matters from Aon Hewitt.
It has also made use of various published surveys to help determine appropriate remuneration levels and relied on information and advice provided by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director.
Aon Hewitt has voluntarily signed up to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective.
Aside from some support in benchmarking roles below the Board for pay review purposes, Aon Hewitt has no other connection with the Group.
