References to an underlying profit measure throughout this report are made on this basis and, in the opinion of the Directors, aid the understanding of the underlying business performance as they exclude items that are either unlikely to recur in future periods or represent non-cash items that distort the underlying performance of the business.
Underlying measures are presented on a consistent basis over time to assist in comparison of performance.
Where we make reference to constant currency amounts, these are prepared using exchange rates which prevailed in the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that applied in the prior year.
Where we make reference to organic measures we exclude the impact of currency translation movements, acquisitions, disposals and closures of subsidiary businesses.
In respect of acquisitions, the amounts referred to represent the amounts for the period in the current year that the business was not held in the prior year.
In respect of disposals and closures of subsidiary businesses, the amounts referred to represent the amounts for the period in the prior year that the business was not held in the current year.
