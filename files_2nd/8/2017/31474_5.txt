Throughout the Annual Report, including the Strategic Report, adjusted measures are used to describe the Groups financial performance.
These adjusted measures are not recognised under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles GAAP.
The Executive Committee and the Board manage and assess the performance of the business on these measures and believe that they are more representative of ongoing trading, facilitate year-on-year comparisons, and hence provide additional useful information to shareholders.
Throughout this Report these non-GAAP measures are clearly identified by an asterisk where they appear in text, and by a footnote where they appear in tables and charts.
Definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the relevant GAAP measures can be found in the Group Financial Review on pages 41 to 44.
Lost-time accident frequency has been subject to assurance by ERM Certification and Verification Services.
