GROUP AT A GLANCE Operational delivery continues to be resilient Concentrate that currently cannot be exported and sold is stockpiled in Tanzania.
PRODUCING MINES PROGRESS FUTURE POTENTIAL Bulyanhulu 175,491oz At Bulyanhulu, gold production of 175,491 Whilst the mine is on reduced operations 2017 gold production ounces was 39% lower than the prior year.
we are taking the opportunity to progress This stemmed from a 34% decrease in essential capital spend, primarily on US$1,373 oz run-of-mine tonnes for the year primarily the process plant, together with an due to the decision to transition Bulyanhulu optimisation study designed to ensure 2017 All-in sustaining cost into reduced operations at the end of Q3 that when the mine restarts it does so 2017 2017 due to losses occurring as a result in an optimised manner.
We are targeting 54% 1 of the concentrate export ban.
Gold sales a phased restart through 2019 assuming PRODUCTION GOLD BARS DOR for the year were 107,855 ounces, 39% the concentrate ban is resolved in 2018. behind production due to the impact of 46% the concentrate export ban.
The impact GOLD COPPER of the lower sales and production base CONCENTRATE led to AISC per ounce sold being 30% higher than 2016 at US$1,373.
production at Bulyanhulu PROGRESS Buzwagi 268,785oz FUTURE POTENTIAL Buzwagi delivered record gold production Buzwagi is transitioning to a stockpile 2017 gold production of 268,785 ounces for 2017 which was processing operation in 2018 as we seek 66% higher than in 2016 mainly due to responsibly manage the closure of the US$667 oz to a 75% higher head grade.
The higher mine in three years time.
Our No Harm production drove lower AISC of 2017 All-in sustaining cost 2020 project will ensure our business, US$667 oz, 39% lower than 2016. our people and the communities around 2017 58% Due to the inability to export concentrate, the mine are best prepared for the 1 PRODUCTION in September 2017 Buzwagi ceased mines closure.
GOLD BARS DOR operating the flotation circuit which had previously been planned to run into the 42% first part of 2018 but continued to run GOLD COPPER the existing gravity and CIL circuits which CONCENTRATE resulted in gold production for the last four production at Buzwagi months of the year being solely in dor form.
PROGRESS FUTURE POTENTIAL North Mara 323,607oz North Mara continued its solid delivery, As North Mara solely produces gold 2017 gold production producing 323,607 ounces and generating in dor form it was unaffected by the strong free cash flow.
Our successful concentrate export ban.
In 2018 we US$803 oz drilling programme at the mine has more expect production to be broadly in line than doubled the Mineral Reserve at the with 2017 at approximately 325,000 2017 All-in sustaining cost Gokona Underground to 1.3Moz at a grade ounces as the continued increase in 2017 of 6.3 g t. Mining of the Nyabirama Stage 3 production from the Gokona Underground 100% PRODUCTION open pit was substantially completed is offset by lower open pit tonnes and grade GOLD BARS DOR during 2017 and we continued to progress as ore is sourced from the beginning of production at North Mara waste stripping at the start of the Stage 4 the Stage 4 pit.
Our strategic objective for open pit which will provide the majority the mine is to deliver more than 300,000 of the mill feed going forward.
ounces of production for at least a ten-year period from twin underground mines.
1 D ue to operating changes neither Bulyanhulu nor Buzwagi now produce concentrate and instead solely produce gold bars dor.
