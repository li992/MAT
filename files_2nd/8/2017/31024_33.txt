This policy applies to Non-Executive Directors and is designed to ensure that Non-Executive Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to their responsibilities.
A summary of the policy is set out on pages 118 to 120 and a report on the implementation of that policy in 2017 is set out in the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report on pages 106 to 108.
Although the Directors Remuneration Policy does not apply to executives, the Company voluntarily reports the CEOs remuneration as if he were a member of the Board and provides additional information on the structure and components of the other Executive Committee members and wider Group remuneration in the 2017 Executive Remuneration Report on pages 109 to 117.
The CEO and the Executive Committee receive a base salary and benefits in line with market conditions in Chile and taking into consideration international factors, as appropriate.
They participate in the Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plans which are designed to align remuneration with overall Group performance and promote outcomes which are for the long-term benefit of the Group.
As explained on page 68, market conditions and remuneration structures available in Chile are a central consideration when setting executive remuneration and some elements of the Groups LTIP may therefore differ slightly from arrangements that would typically be expected for UK-listed companies.

Given these expenses are incurred by Directors in connection with the fulfilment of their duties, the Company also pays the professional fees incurred to complete individual tax returns and the actual tax incurred by Directors on these expenses, the latter of which has led to the higher reported figures for the Companys UK resident Directors.
Figures are reported in the year that they are paid, or would be payable, by the Company.
