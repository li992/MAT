BONUS The annual bonus rewards the achievement of financial and strategic business targets and the delivery of personal objectives.
Annual bonus is capped at six months salary and is paid on the basis of metrics set out in the remuneration policy.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of our business rather than being seen as something extra.
BENEFITS Benefits are provided in line with the Groups policy on employee benefits.
PENSION The Group operates a defined contribution scheme.
Executive Directors and key management are entitled to membership of the defined contribution scheme.
SHARES The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because this continues not to be a common form of remuneration in Mexico.

RECOVERY OF BONUS The absence of long-term incentives makes it difficult to adopt claw-back and malus MALUS CLAW-BACK arrangements.
