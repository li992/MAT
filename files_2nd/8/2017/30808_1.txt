FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS The effectiveness of our strategy is reflected in the record 2017 financial results highlighted below.
Tier 1 Capital Ratio NBG Basel III at 31 December 2017 12.4%.
In 2017, we changed the Groups accounting policy in relation to subsequent measurement of office buildings and service centres from revaluation model to cost model.
We have accordingly restated the balance sheet accounts for affected periods, while the change did not have any material impact on the income statement.
In addition, we started presenting Aldagi as part of the Investment Business since 2Q17.
Therefore, Banking Business balance sheet and income statement accounts, and the ratios have been updated accordingly for prior periods presented to reflect these changes.
