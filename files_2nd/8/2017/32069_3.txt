April 16 381.4m We have invested over 300m in property over the last year, and I am pleased to report that early April 15 383.2m indications show that trading in our new flagship 331.1m April 14 stores is exceeding expectations.
April 13 287.9m We will continue to invest and make decisions for the long term, whilst trying to conservatively manage the currency volatility that is reflected in our full year 1 Underlying PBT results.
As previously announced, the devaluation of -58.7% Sterling against the US dollar has led to a significant impact on EBITDA and profits in FY17.
We have put in April 17 113.6m place hedging arrangements to minimise the short- 275.2m April 16 term impact of currency volatility, but like many UK retailers we remain exposed to medium long April 15 300.3m term currency fluctuations.
Our results were also April 14 249.3m impacted by provisions and depreciation charges.
208.1m April 13 I would like to thank all our people at Sports Direct for ensuring that we continue to move forward together whilst elevating our retail proposition.
