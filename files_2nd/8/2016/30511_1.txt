We have a multichannel strategy, with equity stores, franchise stores and stores operated by joint ventures, as well as a wholesale operation.
Costa was founded in London by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa in 1971 and we attribute much of our success to the quality of our coffee and our ability to open coffee shops in the most convenient locations.
All the coffee we serve in the UK, and most of that served by Costa in the rest of the world, is roasted at our Roastery in Lambeth, London.
Our new Costa Pronto concept is a high speed coffee store, designed to allow our customers to quickly pick up a Costa coffee on the move, while Costa Fresco is a new foodled concept.
Costa Express was founded in 2011, after the acquisition of Coffee Nation.
Our selfserve units provide customers with the same famous Mocha Italia blend as that enjoyed in our coffee shops and make drinks with fresh milk.
Costa Express gives us access to a range of locations where customers are on the move and want a quality coffee on the go.
