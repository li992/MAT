Highlights 2016 in context Our industry is experiencing a number of persistent themes, with investors globally broadening their requirements as they look to diversify risk.
The shift from products to solutions requires a full investment suite and scale to deliver cost effective answers and while investing globally adds complexity, it is better supported by managers who can combine global investment with local engagement.

We close the year with 312.1 billion of AuM and are confident that, with the measures taken to develop strong product capabilities across all asset classes and to develop our distribution team, we remain well positioned to identify and grasp opportunities to deliver further profitable growth.
