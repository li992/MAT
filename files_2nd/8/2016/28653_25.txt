A performance multiplier is calculated for each measure, calculated by the extent to which the performance for that measure is achieved.
On behalf of, and subject to approval by, the Board of Directors, the These multipliers can be up to 1.89 for outperformance of the Committee primarily: stretching range set by the Committee.
Sets and regularly reviews the Companys overall remuneration The two individual multipliers are then multiplied together to provide strategy: the total performance multiplier.

In respect of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and members of The performance multiplier can range from zero for performance at the Executive Committee sets, reviews and approves: threshold or below, to 3.57 for truly exceptional performance on Remuneration policies, including annual bonuses and long-term both metrics i. e. 1.89 x 1.89. incentives: Individual remuneration and compensation arrangements: Adjusted Net Individual benefits including pension and superannuation Net Revenue Threshold 0x Income Performance arrangements: Multiplier x Target 1.0x Multiplier Multiplier up to 1.89x Max 3.57x Terms and conditions of employment including the Executive up to 1.89x Directors service agreement: Participation in any of the Companys bonus and long-term Performance Final bonus x Target Bonus incentive plans LTIPs : and Multiplier outcome The targets for any of the Companys performance-related bonus and LTIPs.
The effect of the multiplicative approach means that a high performance multiplier can only be achieved for outperformance on both top line and The Executive Directors are responsible for evaluating and making bottom-line growth.
Similarly, underperformance in one of the recommendations to the Board of Directors on the remuneration of performance metrics will reduce the overall bonus payout, despite the Non-Executive Directors.
For example, if we grow Net Revenue above the stretching requirement for maximum performance but fail to convert it into profit growth the bonus payout will be zero i. e. 1.89 x 0.

The actual value at vesting will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report 2 The share option award made to Rakesh Kapoor in December 2013 included 627 options awarded under an HMRC approved option scheme.
As set out in the 2014 Annual Report, following the demerger of Indivior PLC exercise prices of outstanding share option awards were adjusted.
The exception to this was the HMRC approved options, for which the exercise price remained unchanged 3 The vesting percentage shown is the total vesting percentage of an award.
Under the vesting schedule of awards, the vesting percentage applies to the combined total amount of an award which may be split into HMRC approved and unapproved parts.
Where a portion of an award has been granted under the HMRC approved part of the scheme, those shares are counted first when assessing the vested number of shares 4 CAAG in adjusted EPS was 10.8% p. a. over the performance period, when measured on actual currency basis.
The Committee therefore determined vesting in line with vesting schedule at 100%.
The Committee exercised discretion to reduce vesting for the CEO to 50% Single total figure of remuneration for Executive Directors Audited The table below sets out a single figure for the total remuneration received by each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2016, based on the information set out in the previous sections.
During 2016 Rakesh Kapoor received an award under the all employee sharesave scheme.
He participated on the same terms as all UK employees, receiving a 20% discount to the share price and full details are set out on page 91.

The shareholding requirements for our Executive Directors are amongst the most demanding in the market and ensure a focus on delivery of sustainable creation of value for Shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to acquire significant numbers of shares over eight years and retain these until retirement from the Board.

Pension The CEO and CFO are eligible to receive pension contributions, or equivalent cash allowances, of 30% and 25% of pensionable salary, respectively.
Annual bonus in respect of 2017 performance For 2017, there will be no changes to the annual bonus opportunities for Executive Directors.
Bonuses will continue to be based on RBs Net Revenue growth and Adjusted Net Income growth, measured in GBP at a constant exchange rate, with the outcome under each of the measures combined multiplicatively to give a maximum bonus outcome of 3.57x the target bonus opportunity if both stretch targets are met.
We have not disclosed the performance targets for 2017 as we consider them to be commercially sensitive.
However, we commit to retrospectively disclosing the performance ranges in the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ending December 2017.
LTIP Audited The Remuneration Policy approved by Shareholders at the AGM in May 2016 sets out the operation of the LTIP.
Whilst the structure for the awards made to Executive Directors remained in line with the approved Policy, the Committee made a significant reduction in the size of the awards granted for FY 2017.
The number of performance shares awarded to the CEO was reduced by 37.5% and the award of share options is 25% lower than the previous year.
For the CFO the LTIP award was reduced by 15%.
The table below sets out the awards made to Executive Directors on 1 December 2016.
These awards do not accrue dividends during the vesting period.
Vesting of these awards in full requires achievement of stretching performance conditions over the three-year period.

For share options the face value at award was zero as the exercise price is higher than the market price at time of award.
The face value of shares under option is 19.88 million for Rakesh Kapoor and 5.07 million for Adrian Hennah if calculated as the number of shares multiplied by the market price at date of award Reckitt Benckiser Group plc RB Annual Report and Financial Statements 87 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements In line with RBs Directors Remuneration Policy, vesting of the LTIP awards is dependent on the achievement of stretching targets relating to growth in EPS over a three-year period, which require outperformance of peer benchmarks.
EPS is measured on an adjusted diluted basis, as shown in the Groups Financial Statements, as this provides an independently verifiable measure of performance.
However, the Remuneration Committee maintains the discretion to make adjustments to the measure if this is considered to be appropriate and intends to do so for the proposed acquisition of Mead Johnson, as set out earlier in this report.
Any adjustments will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Awards granted in December 2016 will vest on the following schedule, which requires significant compound annual growth in EPS in order for the awards to vest, as follows: EPS CAAG 6% 6% Between 6% and 10% 10% Equivalent to three-year EPS growth of 19.1% 19.1% 33.1% Proportion of awards vesting % Nil 20% Straight-line vesting between 20% and 100% 100% Rakesh Kapoor also received an award of share options under the all employee sharesave scheme.

Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all UK employees who form part of the management team Top400.
This group has been chosen as it represents the most appropriate comparator group for reward purposes for our UK-based Group Chief Executive.
The analysis excludes part-time employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i. e. the same individuals appear in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 populations.

The Committee exercised discretion in determining the CEOs 2016 pay outcomes, resulting in a zero bonus.
Had they not exercised discretion the change in the CEOs annual bonus between 2015 and 2016 would have been -81%.
The percentage change in taxable benefits for other employees excludes international transfer benefits as this is volatile from year to year based on each individuals circumstances.
During 2015 a cash payment was made in respect of the Indivior demerger to all participants in the HMRC approved share option and sharesave scheme and is included as a taxable benefit for 2015.
This was a one-off payment in 2015 and causes volatility in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 change in benefits: excluding this payment from 2015 the year-on-year change in benefits for all employees would have been 3%.
For 2016 the CEOs benefit value set out in the single figure table and above includes 7,490 14% of his total benefit value in respect of participation in sharesave.
As this is not a taxable benefit, sharesave participation is not included in benefit values for all other employees.

The Committee believes our remuneration packages are simple, reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy and drive a strong alignment between executives and the interests of our Shareholders.
The enhanced Directors Remuneration Policy implemented by the Committee was supported by our Shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
The Committee continues to have ongoing dialogue with Shareholders with a view to obtaining Shareholder support for our remuneration arrangements.
In particular, over recent years following consultation with our major Shareholders, we have made a number of changes to the Remuneration Policy, to further align executives with Shareholders.
These are set out in more detail in the letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair, on page 76.
The Committee has made further changes to the implementation of the Remuneration Policy during 2016 and 2017, which are set out in more detail earlier in this report.
We discussed our proposals with Shareholders and the Committee is grateful for the feedback provided by Shareholders throughout our engagement on these matters.
