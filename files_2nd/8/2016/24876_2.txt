References to an underlying profit measure throughout this report are made on this basis and, in the opinion of the Directors, aid the understanding of the underlying business performance as they exclude items that are either unlikely to recur in future periods or represent non-cash items that distort the underlying performance of the business.
Underlying measures are presented on a consistent basis over time to assist in comparison of performance.
Where we make reference to constant currency amounts, these are prepared using exchange rates which prevailed in the current year rather than the actual exchange rates that applied in the prior year.
Where we make reference to organic measures we exclude the impact of currency translation movements, acquisitions, disposals and closures of subsidiary businesses.
