ABOUT US At a Glance Building value at a local and national level our Group structure We are proud of our headquarters in Newcastle upon Tyne, from where we started 70 years ago and we now operate from 19 trading divisions which are located in the main population centres in England, Scotland and Wales.
This structure enables our divisional management teams to use their local knowledge and working relationships to buy land, design, build and sell homes which are attractive to our customers and help to build local communities.
The divisional teams are in turn supported by our three Regional Chairmen, who are each responsible for the oversight of a number of divisions, and by our specialist CR, finance, HR, IT, land, legal, planning, sales and technical Head Office teams.
Building value locally our product and customer mix We build and sell high quality homes to suit local housing styles and our customers budgets from one-bedroom apartments up to five-bedroom family homes, as well as providing social housing to housing associations.
Our focus is on providing desirable traditional family housing outside of London and apartments within the London boroughs, predominantly in zone 2 and beyond.
