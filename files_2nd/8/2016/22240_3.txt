04 Centamin plc Annual report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT CENTAMIN AT A GLANCE Production Centamin remained focused on its drive for productivity and efficiency at the Sukari Gold Mine and ongoing optimisation of the processing and mining operations offers scope for further increases in productivity and production growth.
SUKARI GOLD MINE Open pit Process plant The Sukari plant processed 11.6 million tonnes Mt of The open pit delivered 62.2Mt of total material movement ore in 2016, a 9% increase on the prior year 2015: 10.6Mt.
in 2016, an increase of 8% on the prior year 2015: 57.8Mt.
The total annual processed tonnes were 5% above our base This increase was related to improved mining productivity case forecast plant throughput of 11.0 million tonnes per and equipment utilisation.
The average mined grade of annum Mtpa and metallurgical recoveries of 89.4% were 0.93g t was below the reserve average of 1.03g t. an increase on 88.8% in 2015.
This performance reflected the ongoing improvements in productivity as the various areas of the operation were further optimised.

a number of additional prospect areas have been During the second half of 2016 we began development of a identified by reconnaissance field work, including new exploration decline within the north-eastern Cleopatra geophysical geochemical surveys and first-pass drilling.
The initial project is aimed at developing These prospects offer the potential for satellite deposits infrastructure with the capacity to support mining rates of up to feed the existing processing plant with both high-grade to one million tonnes per annum from this area, which would and low-grade bulk tonnage ore. Exploration at these prospects is ongoing.
