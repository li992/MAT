1 EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, onerous leases and other non-recurring charges, impairments and reversals of impairments, transaction and reorganisation costs, profit on disposals of assets and the settlement of the defined benefit pension liability.
2 To provide information on a comparable basis, where % change vs. prior year information includes performance generated in currencies other than sterling, the % is presented on a constant currency basis.
Constant currency movements have been calculated by applying the 2016 average exchange rates to 2015 performance.
3 ROW is defined as Rest of the World and includes Poland, Israel, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
4 Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets excluding acquired movie distribution rights, and certain nonrecurring, non-cash items and foreign exchange as set out in Note 5.
Adjusted profit before tax is an internal measure used by management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the Group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance from period to period.
Adjusted profit after tax is arrived at by applying an effective tax rate to taxable adjustments and deducting the total from adjusted profit before tax.
5 Statutory profit after tax was impacted by the following items: a one-off cost of 4.8m in relation to the buy-out of the defined benefit pension scheme, removing all risks in relation to the scheme: adverse currency movements of 6.1m compared to an exchange rate gain of 7.7m in the prior year due to the translation of the Euro Term loan at the Balance Sheet date: and no one-off gains, such as the gain on the disposal of Cambridge for 6.4m in 2015.
