It was the year of our oatation on the London Stock Exchange.
But 2003 was significant for us in other ways.
Our revenues doubled again over the course of the year, made possible by an intensive R&D programme and progressive development of our critical operations functions.
The year also saw the opening of new ofces around the world and the acquisition of a new operations and engineering facility in Edinburgh.
We believe our drive for growth will continue in 2004.
