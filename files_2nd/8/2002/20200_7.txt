Where external prices are not available, market values are derived using in-house pricing models appropriate for the components of the trading position.
Where instruments such as over-the-counter derivatives are valued using pricing models, the value of the instrument and changes in that value are affected by the model and its underlying assumptions.
Valuation adjustments are made for derivative instruments and cover credit and market liquidity risks and future administration costs.
d Long term assurance business The value of the shareholders interest in the long term assurance business is determined with reference to assumptions relating to future mortality, persistency, investment return for various categories of investments and levels of expenses both salary and non salary based on experience of the business concerned.
The surplus expected to emerge in the future is discounted at a riskadjusted discount rate after provision has been made for taxation.
e Impairment of goodwill The carrying value of goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
The carrying value of goodwill is written down by the amount of any impairment, and the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which this occurs.
Should an external event reverse the effects of a previous impairment, the carrying value of the goodwill may be written up to a value no higher than the original amortised cost.
Impairments are calculated with reference to the discounted cash ows of the entity or income generating unit.
Assumptions about expected future cash ows require management to make assumptions about interest rates, the health of the economy and operating costs.
This involves significant judgement because such factors have uctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so.
