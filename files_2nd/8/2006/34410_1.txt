We have exceeded the IPD UK Annual Industrial Index by a factor of nearly 3 times and on new lettings the 9.2% enhancement is over 7 times the benchmark level.
We judged that rental growth would be more muted and yield compression would end sooner for secondary industrial property so we sold more than 560m worth of such stock during the year.
Whilst this has a transitionary effect on some numbers, through the reduction in the size of the business, we did create 70m worth of surplus value in 15 months on the Industrious acquisition.
By our close focus, particularly in our core markets in West London where we have an unrivalled position and an enviable development programme, and with the balance sheet capacity we have in place Brixton is well positioned to continue to capitalise on its market leading position.
