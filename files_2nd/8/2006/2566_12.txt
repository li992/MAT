Internal External There were two regulatory price changes during the year.
The rentals price was reduced by 50p per month on 1st August 2005.
Further price changes followed from 1st March 2006, with another 35p per month reduction in the rentals price, an increase from 1.41 to 2.00 in the transfer price and Key Market Changes a reduction from 91.99 to 88.00 in the connection price.
This was following a consultation on costs with Ofcom which replaced the previously agreed price with a further voluntary price The reduction in revenue and costs is as a result of the overall decline in rental volumes due to reduction.
The move of customers to other cable and mobile operators who are using the Wholesale Line Rental WLR product as a means to deliver services to their customers has resulted in the growth in external rentals as a percentage of internal rentals.
Revenue was also 9 Wholesale Access Markets Performance Summary by Market reduced by the price changes implemented in the year.

The internally sold LLU to downstream BT lines of business the IPstream and Datastream products can be seen in the Broadband Origination and Conveyance markets.
There has been increased investment in the LLU market by other communications providers in 2005 06 as they locate their equipment into BTs telephone exchanges, as can be seen from the volume growth in the services for MPF room build which excludes up front capital costs and hostel rentals in the service performance table above.
The total revenue and total costs have increased at a similar rate during the year.
Increased investment in the access network infrastructure has resulted in a lower return on capital employed year on year.
During the year, BT introduced a special offer price for communication provider bulk migrations from IPstream or Datastream to Shared MPF to stimulate the market.
BT also implemented a simplified pricing structure for its MPF product.
The unit costs across the LLU markets are still largely above the average prices for the services for the year, even with the general reduction in average costs as a result of the increased volumes.
The main cost increases are in accommodation, reflecting the build out costs required and general management costs which increased due to the increased activity in this market.
