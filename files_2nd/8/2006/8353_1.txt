We also made the exciting acquisition of MacLellan Group plc, which opens up new markets, augments the range of services we can offer to existing clients and enables us to bid for work using the combined skills and scale of the two organisations.
The integration of MacLellan and of the Industrial Services division into our Facilities Services operation is well advanced.
In addition to trading strongly we won a notable amount of new business during 2006 which will generate revenue going forward.
Our future workload at 31 December had grown to 5.6 billion, up 17 per cent on 2005 4.8 billion.
With the underlying strength of the business demonstrated in our 2006 performance, our record future workload and the opportunities created by our acquisition of MacLellan, Interserves future prospects are encouraging.
