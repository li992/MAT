MALCO, in Tamil Nadu, producers in the world.
The main at the Tuticorin smelter was increased is the only aluminium producer in operations are in Rajasthan, north west in April 2005 from 180,000 tpa to Southern India with capacity of 40,000 India.
In May 2005 the facilities were 300,000 tpa.
The output is refined into tpa.
The more substantial operations at expanded to take capacity to 400,000 copper cathode and rod at Tuticorin BALCO, in Chhattisgarh, are close to tpa of finished zinc.
major supplies of bauxite and coal.
Capacity at BALCO is being expanded KCM is an integrated copper operation to around 350,000 tpa, with progressive based in the heart of the Zambian commissioning.
VAL, in Orissa, will copper belt.
It was acquired in mine bauxite and refine alumina mainly November 2004. for the new aluminium capacity.
VEDANTA RESOURCES PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 07 Year in Review 2005-06 April 05 August 05 Copper smelter in Tuticorin commissioned, taking total Announcement of Konkola Deep Mining Project KDMP, capacity from 180,000 tpa to 300,000 tpa.
New 90,000 tpa rod which will substantially increase output from Konkola Copper plant also commissioned at Tuticorin.
Mines KCM and extend the existing mine life.
This project will realise the potential of one of the worlds most important copper deposits, with 215 million tonnes of resources at 3.8% May 05 copper.
Copper output at the mine will be increased from New 170,000 zinc smelter commissioned in Chanderiya, 2 million tpa to 6 million tpa.
increasing total capacity to 400,000 tpa, supported by Rampura Agucha mine expansion.
This was completed at a November 05 record time of 22 months and at a cost of 25% below forecast costs of $425 million.
New capital project for the expansion of the Nkana smelter in KCM, at a total cost of $125 million was announced.
After detailed feasibility study, the concept has been modified to August 05 establish a new smelter at Nchanga with a capacity of New 170,000 tpa brownfield zinc smelter expansion project 250,000 tpa at a cost of $280 million.
The existing Nkana due in early 2008 was announced.
Pre-construction activities smelter will continue to operate at its capacity.
The expansion, at a budget of $300 million, will include investment in a further 77 MW of capacity at the December 05 existing thermal power plant.
The expansion will further improve Vedantas already globally competitive cost position Announced a US$2.1 billion green-field 500,000 tpa, and increase total capacity to around 570,000 tpa.
