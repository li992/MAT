Danas strong foundation has enabled it to take a major growth step through the recently announced acquisition of Devon Energys business in Egypt.
Post completion of this transaction, Dana will be producing from 29 fields, providing a strong and balanced base of cash flow enabling the Company to deliver its intensive drilling programme throughout the next two years, with up to 32 wells currently being planned to target new reserves.
The next 12 months will see the most exciting stage of the Companys development so far.
