MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Message from the Chairman Three years ago your Board, along with the Managers, reviewed investment strategy.
The result of this scrutiny was to reduce the number of holdings and to take a more global approach which, above all, focused upon companies rather than geographic asset allocation.
I am happy to say that this approach has borne fruit, as demonstrated this year by a 46% increase in net asset value, a 57% increase in the share price and a 15.6% increase in the dividend.
