The basis of preparation of statutory IFRS basis results and supplementary IFRS basis information is consistent with that applied for the 2005 full year results and financial statements.
Consistent with previous reporting practice, the Group analyses its EEV basis results and provides supplementary analysis of IFRS profit before tax attributable to shareholders, so as to distinguish operating profit based on longer-term investment returns from other constituent elements of total profit.
On both the EEV and IFRS bases, operating earnings per share are calculated using operating profits from continuing operations based on longer-term investment returns, after tax and minority interests.
These profits exclude goodwill impairment charges, short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the shareholders' share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
Under the EEV basis, where additional profit and loss effects arise, operating profit based on longer-term investment returns also excludes the mark to market value movements on core borrowings and the effect of changes in economic assumptions and changes in the time value of cost of options and guarantees arising from changes in economic factors.
After adjusting for related tax and minority interests, the amounts for these items are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share.
