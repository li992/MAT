Spanning five states, the business operates within 13 markets, all of which have strong long term demographic prospects.
We traditionally build a wide range of single family homes and in response to changing demand within the market, we have introduced more compact townhomes to our product range.
Over the last few years Morrison Homes has benefited from the strong market conditions in the US.
2006 proved to be more challenging as the housing market slowed considerably.
The competitive market conditions look set to continue in the short term until the current oversupply in the housing market returns to normal levels.
Despite its short term weakening, we feel confident about the long term outlook for the US housing market with strong demographic trends likely to drive demand for housing.
As the market stabilises Morrison Homes is well placed to strengthen its regional positions to deliver long term growth.
