Our mission To remain Britains foremost urban regenerator Creating places and communities Berkeleys passion and energy blend innovative vision with a relentless focus on detail, transforming neglected land into places that its customers choose as destinations for work, for pleasure and for making their home.
Motivating our people Berkeleys demanding management philosophy and divisional structure has created a unique sense of purpose for the people in each business, building both talent and loyalty, and nurturing the entrepreneurial flair essential in land development.
Building on our expertise What Berkeley creates inherently benefits the wider community and the issues of sustainability and environmental performance are at the heart of its philosophy.
This enables Berkeley to add value to its sites, to obtain planning consents that would otherwise be withheld, and to continue matching the expectations of its customers and therefore to maintain competitive advantage.
Delivering on our promise to our shareholders Berkeley is on target to make the 2 per share 2006 B share payment to shareholders in January 2007 and is ahead of its business plan as it works towards achieving the 2008 and 2010 B share payments due under the Scheme of Arrangement approved by shareholders in autumn 2004.
