The rate applicable for 2004 05 was 13.5%.
During 2005 Adjusted for year on year CCA movements and estimated full year effect of price cuts of 170m.
06 Ofcom determined a new rate of 10.0%, applicable from September 2005.
The comparable regulatory rate used in the unit cost information in this document, for 2005 06 was therefore proWHOLESALE ACCESS MARKETS PERFORMANCE SUMMARY rated to approximately 11.5%.
7 Wholesale Access Markets Performance Summary Key Market Changes The Wholesale Access Markets has seen a continuing migration of internal revenues from BTs traditional Wholesale calls and lines business into other communication providers and other forms of communication product.
This effect has been more than compensated by the growth in revenue for external wholesale line rentals and wholesale local access i. e. external local loop unbundling markets.
The market by market view can be seen in Annex 2 of this report.
The revenues within the Wholesale Access markets has also been affected by the price cuts imposed by Ofcom during 2005 06, particularly the WLR markets.
The full year effect of these price cuts will be felt in 2006 07, which will reduce profits by approximately a further 170m.
The total costs have remained relatively stable through the year, with the exception of accommodation which has increased as a result of changes in the treatment of leased properties by the adoption of IFRS accounting standards by BT.
As detailed in Annex 1 2004 05 comparatives have not been adjusted for the impact of IFRS, as the main IFRS adjustments related to pensions and dividends are excluded and the other adjustments when allocated across the services were deemed immaterial.
The main change in the cost base can be seen in the current cost accounting adjustments CCA.
Here, the effect of a large rise in the market price of copper has led to a material year on year CCA movement within those markets using copper, thereby creating a one-off profit and loss credit of approximately 180m.
The overall return across the Wholesale Access markets will therefore be affected by the full year of price cuts going forward and a stabilisation of the cost of copper prices.
If both of these effects were accounted for in 2005 06 the returns would reduce by approximately 350m, leading to a return on capital employed of approximately 10%.
The balance sheet or Mean Capital Employed has seen an 3% reduction due to reduced investment in the switch and transmission assets, prior to the effect of the CCA revaluation on the copper and duct assets, and a lower working capital base as a result of the pension prepayment no longer being allocated across the markets under the IFRS rules.
It should be noted that these balance sheet values exclude the effects of the Regulatory Asset Valuation RAV adjustment which, in August 2005, Ofcom concluded should reduce the CCA value and associated depreciation of the BT copper assets.
This copper revaluation was undertaken in order to better reflect Ofcoms position on price setting as annual depreciation levels and the asset value of copper were adjusted.
BT maintains that its CCA value of the copper assets are appropriate in this regulatory financial report, however the RAV adjustments would raise the RoCE by less than 1%.
