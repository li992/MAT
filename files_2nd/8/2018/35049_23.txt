Legacy equity arrangements the Private Incentive Plan PIP The President & CEO, along with certain members of the ContourGlobal plc management team, have interests in a Private Incentive Plan PIP.
As disclosed at the time of IPO and in last years Directors Remuneration report, the PIP is a legacy equity arrangement established by Reservoir Capital Group the major shareholder in the Company in connection with its original investment in the business.
The Company is not a party to the PIP and has no financial obligation to pay cash or issue shares to settle the PIP.
All shares thatmight bedelivered to the President & CEO under the award would be funded by Reservoir Capital Group.
Consequently, theRemuneration Committee has no authority over the plan, or the allocation and release of awards.
The PIP is not an ongoing element of the executive remuneration policy at ContourGlobal plc, and no new allocations will be made under the plan.
History Joseph C. Brandt, the current President & CEO, founded the Company together with Reservoir Capital Group in 2005.
Around thattime, incentive arrangements were established which enabled the President & CEO, along with other senior management, toparticipate in thereturn on invested capital above a required return hurdle.
To date participants have not received any payments asa result of these arrangements.
The PIP therefore relates to legacy commitments connected with the founding of ContourGlobal and the growth of the Company inthe years prior to its listing on the London Stock Exchange, and modified in anticipation of the listing.
As disclosed in the 2017 DRR, the allocation and terms of the award remained subject to finalization.
The allocations and terms of thePresident & CEOs award were substantially agreed prior to listing.
Reservoir Capital finalized the implementation of his allocation on 27thDecember 2018.
Overview of the PIP The award is in the form of partnership units in Contour Management Holdings LLC which is a partner in ContourGlobal L. P. thelimited partnership through which Reservoir Capital Group owns shares in the Company.
The award comprises Class S units, Class C units and Class B units.
Under the terms of the PIP, these units entitle the award-holder to receive from Contour Management Holdings LLC cash or shares inthe Company if certain financial performance conditions are achieved.
Basis of awards Class S Units These units are similar in nature to a restricted stock award of 6,943,864 ContourGlobal plc shares, subject to an underpin share price.
Class C Units These units represent a value share between management and Reservoir Capital Group.
Class B Units Illustration of value receivable under the PIP for Joseph C Brandt The value of Class C and Class B Units will be dependent on the timing of the disposal of Reservoir Capital Groups holding in ContourGlobal plc, the share price at that time as well as any dividends received in the interim.
The table below illustrates the value to Joseph C Brandt under various sale price scenarios, assuming Reservoir Capital Group will have disposed of its shareholdings within three years following Admission.

3 The number of shares delivered under the Class C units and Class B units increases above 12.8m in higher sale price scenarios.
ContourGlobal plc Annual Report 2018 98 Annual Report on Remuneration continued PIP interests awarded audited information While the allocations and terms of the President & CEOs award were substantially agreed prior to listing, Reservoir Capital finalized the implementation of his allocation on 27th December 2018.
Details of the award are as follows: Value of award Date of award Form of award at date of grant Vesting date Joseph C. Brandt 27th December 2018 Class S units Up to 6,943,864 12,228,145 Units vest in equal tranches over ContourGlobal the three year period from IPO.
plc shares The date of full vesting is 27thDecember 2020 Class C units Value share between Units vest in equal tranches over management and Reservoir the three year period from IPO.
Capital Group The date of full vesting is see below 27thDecember 2020 Class B units Fully vested Additional information on PIP awards Class S units deliver an award of shares in ContourGlobal plc subject to certain thresholds.
These units are similar in nature to arestricted stock award of 6.9m ContourGlobal plc shares, subject to an underpin share price.
At final implementation Reservoir CapitalGroup set the underpin share price for the Class S units at $2.23 c. 1.75 threshold to $2.28 c. 1.79 maximum, assuming nodividends, to reflect the share price at the time of final allocation rather than the 2.57 threshold referred to in the Prospectus.
Thisunderpin may be tested at any time from December 2020.
Class C units and Class B units are structured as a value share between management and Reservoir Capital Group, and deliver anaward of ContourGlobal plc shares subject to certain thresholds after deducting the value arising from the Class S units.
Distributions from Class C units and Class B units are subject to Reservoir Capital Group realizing value from its investment inContourGlobal plc, and the scheme stays in effect until Reservoir Capital Group has disposed of all its ordinary shares in ContourGlobalplc.
Class B units are fully vested and are not forfeitable.
Class C units and Class S units vest in equal tranches over the three year periodfrom IPO.
A third of the units are therefore already vested, subject to the achievement of thresholds, and the full vesting dateis27thDecember 2020.
Unvested units will ordinarily be forfeited in the event of resignation or termination for cause.
Carried interest in Brazilian assets unaudited On 30th June 2008, Joseph C. Brandt was awarded a carried interest, funded by Aguila Ltd, a minority shareholder in Kani LP, whichisan entity formed to develop and acquire hydroelectric and associated cogeneration assets in Brazil.
The Company is not party to the carried interest and has no financial obligation in relation to the interest.
Under the arrangement, funded by Aguila Ltd, management receive in aggregate 18% of the value created above an IRR hurdle of9%.
Payments would be made on the occurrence of a final liquidity event in respect of the assets.
Since ContourGlobal plc has acontrolling interest in Kani LP, sale of the assets would require the approval of the ContourGlobal plc Board.
The President & CEOs carried interest amounts to 46% of the 18% total carried interest.
These interests are not considered to relate to director qualifying services in the period prior to IPO.
Payments from the carried interest are uncapped.
