Underlying performance differs from the statutory IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of Special Items, which are detailed in note 3.
The Boards view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity for the Groups investors and stakeholders and so it is the primary focus of the Groups narrative reporting.
Where appropriate IFRS performance inclusive of Special Items is also described.
References to unit margin and margin are used in the commentary on Underlying performance.
Unit margin or margin is calculated on selling price less variable raw material and logistics costs.
