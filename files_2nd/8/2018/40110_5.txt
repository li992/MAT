BRAND Strengthening relationships with our third party brand partners to offer a greater range of choice The Group continues to work closely with our key third party brand partners, such as adidas, Nike, Puma and Under Armour.
The elevated retail space within our new generation stores, along with our enhanced social and digital platforms, opens the door for brands to use their expertise to connect with our consumers.
This is strengthening our commercial relationships and enables brand partners to adopt a marketing approach that is consistent across all our channels.
Crucially, it also enables the Group to increase the range choice available to customers to include a dynamic mix of good, better and best product.
For example, at our Half Year presentation in December we were pleased to give an overview of how our key suppliers are providing increased support for our elevated stores across all categories.
In addition to offering good, better and best product in the football category, we are also enhancing the fashion-led apparel in our USC fascia within megastores.
We are also focused on working closely with our third party brand partners towards increasing the range of choice in sports retail across other categories, including women's, young athletes, and running.
This included welcoming Asics into our new generation stores in early 2018.
Meanwhile, the Group continues to make good progress towards building significant relationships with luxury fashion brands that sit comfortably within the premium environment provided by our Flannels fascia.
