Awards granted in 2015 under the LTIP for this period are subject to performance conditions that measure and compare the Groups relative performance against its peers in terms of Total Property Return TPR and Total Shareholder Return TSR, with each measure representing 50% of the total award.
Please see table 54 for more detail on how vesting levels are determined.
The performance calculation for awards granted in 2015 and vesting in 2018 are illustrated below: Long-Term Incentive Plan and Matching Share Plan outturns Table 46 Outturn Percentage of basic salary Percentage Target maximum Assessment of maximum 1 Ungeared Total 75 75 maximum The Groups Total Property Return over the three-year period was 6.6% per annum 0.0 Property Return shares pledged compared with the estimated performance of the unweighted IPD index including all March-valued properties at 8.8%.
Therefore, this element does not vest.
Total Shareholder Return 75 75 maximum The Groups Total Shareholder Return over the three-year period was -18.3% 0.0 shares pledged versus that of the comparator group at 0.5%.
As this return was below the benchmark, this element of the total award does not vest.
The outturn is adjusted to take account of the performance of trading properties.
In total, therefore, no portion of the awards made in 2015 will vest in July 2018.
For awards granted in 2016, the Groups performance over the two years to 31 March 2018 would, if sustained over the third year to 31 March2019, result in 0% of the LTIP share awards vesting.
For awards granted in 2017, performance over the one-year period to 31 March 2018 would, if sustained over the second and third years of the period to 31 March 2020, also result in 0% of the LTIP share awards vesting.

Application of Policy for 2018 19 3.1 Executive Directors base salaries A formal salary benchmarking exercise was conducted this year for boththe Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer roles.
The Managing Director roles were not formally benchmarked this year, as both received salary increases based on market information in 2017.
Theconclusion of the 2018 benchmarking exercise was that the current remuneration arrangements for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer continue to be competitive.
The Committee has therefore awarded all four Executive Directors a basic salary increase of2%.
This is slightly below the average increase received by employees across the Group.
Accordingly, the following salary increases will take effect from 1June2018: Executive Directors Table 52 Average percentage Current From 1June 2018 Percentage increase over five years Name 000 000 increase including 2018 19 Robert Noel 784 800 2.0 Martin Greenslade 510 521 2.0 Colette OShea 415 423 2.0 N A Scott Parsons 415 423 2.0 N A 3.2 Non-executive Directors fees The fees for Non-executive Directors were last increased in 2016.

An additional line to illustrate the Companys performance compared with the FTSE 100 Index over the previous nine years is also included.
Adjacent to this chart is a table showing how the single number of total remuneration for the Chief Executive has moved over the same period.

Dilution Awards granted under the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which cover those made under the LTIP, MSP, Deferred Share Bonus Plan and the Executive Share Option Plan, are satisfied through the funding of an Employee Benefit Trust administered by an external trustee which acquires existing Land Securities Group PLC shares in the market.
The Employee Benefit Trust held 1,178,179 shares at 31 March 2018.
The exercise of share options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all employees who have completed more than one months service with the Group, can be satisfied by the allotment of newly issued shares.
At 31 March 2018, the total number of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 304,582 shares, which represents less than 0.1% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Remuneration Committee meetings The Committee met four times over the course of the year, and all of the members attended all meetings.
Simon Palley chaired the Committee, and the other members during the year were Dame Alison Carnwath, Edward Bonham Carter and Cressida Hogg.
The Committee meetings were also attended by the Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director, and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who acted as the Committees Secretary.
Over the course of the year, the Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary legal matters from AON Hewitt.
It has also made use of various published surveys to help determine appropriate remuneration levels and relied on information and advice provided by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director.
AON Hewitt has voluntarily signed up to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective.
Aside from some support in benchmarking remuneration for roles below the Board, AON Hewitt has no other connection with the Group.
For the financial year under review, it received fees of 71,035 in connection with its work for the Committee.
The increase on last year can be explained by the support provided by AON Hewitt for the review of the Directors Remuneration Policy.
