The latter included adjustments for exceptional items.
As explained in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the adoption of IFRS 9 has removed the principal cause of such exceptional items and the Company is therefore not disclosing a separate underlying profit measure for 2018.
The comparison in this table is made to the underlying profit in 2017 as this presents the best like for like measure.
Years F13 F17 show underlying net profit, a non-statutory profit measure used by the Company until the F18 financial year when the adoption of IFRS 9 made it obsolete.
F14 and F15 CASK include exceptional items.
2018, F18, FY18 and FY 2018 in this document refer to the financial year ended 31 March 2018.
2017, F17, FY17 and FY 2017 in this document refer to the financial year ended 31 March 2017.
Equivalent terms are used for prior financial years.
