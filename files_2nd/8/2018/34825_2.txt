2 Pro-forma results reflect the Group and US performance had Regal been consolidated for the entirety of the period from 1 January 2018.
For the purposes of percentage movements, the same comparative period has been applied.
Performance against the comparative period has been calculated by taking the Regal performance, converted to IFRS, for the same period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December2017, to present the consolidated performance as if Regal had been acquired on 1 January 2017.
3 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Operating profit plus share of profits from joint ventures using the equity accounting method net of tax adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, onerous lease charges and releases, impairments and reversals of impairments, transaction and reorganisation costs, gains losses on disposals of assets and subsidiaries, share based payment charges, and share of profits received from associates in excess of distributions or any undistributed such profits.
Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by adding back amortisation of intangible assets excluding acquired film distribution rights, and certain non-recurring or non-cash items and foreign exchange difference arising on monetary assets and liabilities as set out in Note 6.
Adjusted profit before tax is an internal measure used by management, as they believe it better reflects the underlying performance of the Group and therefore a more meaningful comparison of performance from period to period.
Adjusted profit after tax is arrived at by applying an effective tax rate to taxable adjustments and deducting the total from adjusted profit before tax.
