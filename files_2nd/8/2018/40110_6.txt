PEOPLE Working together towards a bright future for all Sports Direct owes its success to the great people who work here - and when our people are strong our business is strong.
We are committed to treating all staff in a manner that is dignified and respectful, regardless of age, gender or ethnicity.
We are also proud to be one of the first public companies in the UK to embrace the idea of introducing a Workers' Representative who attends meetings of the Board.
During FY18, company shares worth approximately 45.5m were vested to eligible employees in our staff share bonus scheme.
We also have generous commission arrangements in place and other incentives that enable our people to benefit fairly from the business.
It remains our policy to pay all our people at rates that are above statutory wage bands in the UK, and we strive to also be a responsible employer internationally.
We place a strong emphasis on staff training and career development, whilst also constantly striving to attract new talent.
You can read more about how we are working towards a bright future for our people in the Our Business section of the Strategic Report and also within our Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
