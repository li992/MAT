The central case projections published by many economists are based on the assumption of an orderly Brexit and forecast a temporary slowdown in GDP growth while other key economic indicators remain broadly stable.
The Group is well prepared for that outcome and has also undertaken contingency planning for alternative scenarios.
Following the acquisition of Virgin Money on 15 October 2018 the Group begins FY2019 strongly capitalised and well funded with a bigger, broader business that is well prepared for the year ahead.
The short-term outlook for the Groups key lending markets UK homeowners and SMEs is more subdued than in recent years.
In addition, the UK household savings ratio continues to decline, limiting growth in the supply of deposits.
However, the Groups proven ability to win market share through superior product offerings and customer service, and to optimise its liability mix across a range of sources of funding means we expect to continue to deliver sustainable growth in customer balances.
We expect to see strong competition for mortgages and deposits in the year ahead that will feed through into margin pressure.
However, the Groups broad range of lending businesses allied to its diversified funding model will enable us to continue to manage margins effectively.
The Net Interest Margin for FY2019 is expected to be between 1.6 and 1.7%, having been rebased following the combination with Virgin Money.
Our strong track record in delivering cost efficiencies will help to underpin the Groups profits and capital generation.
We expect the Groups underlying operating expenses to be less than 950m in FY2019, down from an estimated pro forma combined cost base of 985m in FY2018.
The Group expects to update stakeholders on strategy and other matters, including the development of medium-term performance targets, at a Capital Markets Day in June 2019.
