This bonus reflected 2018 in full and was not pro-rated for time served 6.
David Arden new CFO joined the Company on 19 March 2018.
To compensate David for the lapsing of deferred awards that were made to him by his former employer under itsannual and long-term incentive plans, if he had not resigned, share options have been granted to him to the value of 300,000, with no performance conditions other than continued service.
The share options will vest pro-rata over five years.
To recognise the loss of payments that would have been made to him by his former employer, a one-off payment of 160,000 was also made.
In determining the level of compensatory awards, the Company has taken account of the value of the awards forfeited, the time horizons ofthe awards and the performance hurdles attached to them.
This award does not relate to the 2018 performance year Details of the single figure Salary salary salary as at as at total salary 1 January 1 April paid in 2018 2018 2018 Craig Donaldson 650,000 750,000 725,000 Mike Brierley left 31 March 2018 375,000 n a 93,750 David Arden joined 19 March 2018 n a 400,000 315,152 2018 variable reward outcomes As set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the AGM on 25 April 2017, the Executive Directors variable reward in relation to performance during 2018 was based on a balanced scorecard of performance measures and objectives, weighted between financial 30%, risk 20%, customer 35% and people 15%.
Amounts shown reflect the total awards under the variable reward scheme paid in 2019, based on performance in the financial year ending 31 December 2018, including the value of any deferred element.
In addition to the Company multiplier, a further multiplier based on individual behaviours and performance was also applied to the balanced scorecard remuneration outcome.
The tables below illustrate performance against each of the balanced scorecard measures.
As set out on page 91, this approach and multiplier are consistent with that applied for all colleagues across the Bank.

The weighted performance outcome does controls not take into account the impact of the RWA adjustment as this was 20% 18.3% not an objective under the 2018 scorecard.
As mentioned above, the Committee has decided to freeze vestings of share options and awards for the Executive Directors and Executive team, including share options for 2018, pending further internal analysis and any external investigations into the RWA adjustment.

This weighting was applied for all eligible colleagues across the Bank, including the Executive Directors.
Following our announcement in January 2019 regarding the RWA adjustment, the Committee decided to freeze vestings of share options and awards for the Executive Directors and Executive team, including share options for 2018, pending further internal analysis and any external investigations into the RWA adjustment.
Individual behaviours and performance multiplier A discretionary multiplier was applied to variable reward for all eligible colleagues, by reference to each colleagues individual behaviours and performance for the year.
Below, we set out details of the individual multipliers, in respect of our Executive Directors for 2018, which were determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Following our announcement on 23 January 2019 regarding the RWA adjustment, Craig Donaldson asked that the Committee did not consider him for variable reward for 2018.
Individual behaviours and performance executive director Key achievements in 2018 multiplier Craig Donaldson Craig led the Company through another year of significant growth and delivery with profits up to 65%1 50 million, loans up 48% and a 4 billion increase in deposits, all against stretching targets.
This was balanced with a Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ratio of 13.1% and a high-quality loan book.
TheCompany continued to invest in its physical, people and digital capabilities and in 2018 opened a further 10 stores, giving customers more choice about how, when and where they bank with MetroBank.
Customer data from internal measures and also the Competition and Markets Authority rankings were very strong.
Craig was recognised as one of the highest-rated CEOs on Glassdoor, and the Company was ranked among Glassdoors best places to work evidencing the customer-focused leadership he provides to colleagues and the Company.
Narrow margins and higher than anticipated costs meant profits were lower than budgeted and we adjusted the risk weighting of certain commercial loans secured on commercial property and certain specialist buy-to-let loans that had the combined effect of increasing our RWAs by 900 million, as announced in January 2019.
The Remuneration Committee had provisionally determined a personal multiplier of 65%1 for Craig Donaldson in recognition of these issues 134% for 2017.
However, as referenced above Craig asked that the Committee did not consider him for variable reward for 2018 so he received zero variable reward for 2018.
David Arden David has made a strong start in his role as CFO.
He oversaw significant growth in profitability during 100%1 another year of exceptional investment in growth and customer experience.
Davids team manage capital, costs and revenue aligned to the Companys short, medium and long-term goals.
Asset and liability management remain conservative.
The financial control environment is strong as attested by both internal and external review.
In addition, the Finance, Treasury, Legal and Company Secretarial, Procurement and Investor Relations teams that David is accountable for delivered high levels of service to their internal customers and external stakeholders.
As mentioned above the Committee has frozen vesting of share options for 2018 for the Executive Directors and Executive Team, including David, pending further internal analysis and any external investigations into the RWA adjustment Calculation of variable pay for the Executive Directors As set out in the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report, each Director was eligible for an on-target variable reward opportunity of 100% of salary in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2018.
Mike Brierley the former CFO who left on 29 March 2018 was not awarded any variable reward for 2018.
In line with the above and our approach for all colleagues, the variable reward for the Executive Directors was as follows.
on-target company performance Individual behaviours and executive director variable reward multiplier performance multiplier total variable reward Craig Donaldson 750,000 72% 65% 01 David Arden 400,000 72% 100% 288,000 1.
Following our announcement of 23 January 2019 regarding the RWA adjustment Craig Donaldson asked that the Committee did not consider him for variable reward for 2018 Metro Bank Plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2018 89 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED How variable reward is paid In line with the Policy approved by shareholders at the AGM on 25 April 2017, at least 50% of all variable reward for Executive Directors must be deferred into long-term share awards, and a further 25% is deferred into one-year vesting share awards.
The remaining 25% is paid in cash.
As mentioned above, following our announcement in January 2019 regarding the RWA adjustment Craig Donaldson asked that the Committee did not consider him for variable reward for 2018.
Share awards in respect of the year ending 31 December 2018 were deferred into market price share options, the fair value of which was informed by the Black-Scholes methodology.
Market price share options are implicitly performance related, as they will not accrue any value unless MetroBanks share price increases over the long term.
Our approach to deferring into market price share options is operated for all colleagues it supports our reward principle to make everyone an owner, and aligns all colleagues with the Banks long-term vision.

The focus is on simplicity, rewarding the right behaviours and outcomes for customers and the business, focusing on long-term growth and discouraging unnecessary risk-taking.
Our Directors Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders at the AGM on 25 April 2017, was developed by reference to our reward principles, which apply to all colleagues: Pay fair salaries and offer strong career and growth opportunities in an AMAZEING culture Make everyone an owner aligning them to the Banks long-term vision Reward colleagues based on MetroBanks culture and performance and how they behave and deliver, both as part of the team and as an individual Keep reward as simple as possible, with one approach for all Take a retail approach to variable reward: no excessive cash bonuses or linear incentives which can skew behaviours and encourage unnecessary risk-taking Summary of the remuneration structure for employees below Board level salary Benefits pension Variable remuneration We have a normal inflationary All colleagues are eligible for The table below shows All employees are eligible for private medical insurance funded the minimum and share options or an equivalent, and performance-related pay pot of 2.2% at different rates of cover maximum employer in line with our strong ethos of depending on their level of pension contributions employee buy-in and ownership The quantum of salary increases are primarily driven by individual seniority payable by MetroBank We apply the same Company All colleagues, including the year-on-year performance multiplier to behaviours We also review salaries for roles Executive Directors, receive allcolleagues abenefit of death in service For all colleagues whose that we deem are growing rapidly in scale and or lifecover of four times their personal behaviours and basesalary delivery are as expected or complexity and are critical to thebusiness and for those better we apply a multiplier upto a maximum of 200% colleagues which market data suggests are falling behind the market rates for their roles Pension contributions 2018 2017 % increase employer contribution as a % of salary Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum CEO 10% 10% 10% 10% 0% 0% Executive Directors & Executive Leadership Team 10% 10% 10% 10% 0% 0% Senior leaders and experts 9% 10% 8% 10% 11.1% 0% Managers and specialists 8% 8% 7% 8% 12.5% 0% Entry-level roles 6% 6% 6% 6% 0% 0% 1.

Due to the significant growth at MetroBank, data has been calculated using the same colleagues over the two-year period.
This only includes colleagues who were employed by MetroBank on or before 1 January 2017 and still employed on or after 31 December 2018.
Any colleagues who joined or left the Bank within this period have been excluded from the analysis.
Salary is taken as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 2.
As mentioned above, following our announcement in January 2019 regarding the RWA adjustment, Craig Donaldson asked that the Committee did not consider him for variable reward for 2018.
The CEO received a 15.4% pay increase in 2018 but did not receive a pay increase this year 3.
The CFO is not included in this figure as neither David Arden nor Mike Brierley were employed across the entire same store period i. e. between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018 4.

This methodology was chosen as it is the purest approach.
Three colleagues were identified whose full-time equivalent total remuneration places them at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles.
Colleague total remuneration includes salary, allowances, employer pension contributions, Company-funded health and risk benefits, referral bonuses as well as total variable reward awarded in 2019 in respect of the 2018 performance year.
All elements were calculated on a full-time equivalent basis.
We are confident that the colleagues identified are representative of the lower, median and upper quartiles and the median pay ratio is consistent with the Companys wider policies on colleague pay, reward and progression.
As this is the first year using the revised reporting requirements, we have provided the CEO pay ratio for 2017 as a comparison.
The Committee recognises that the CEO pay ratio will be volatile.
The ratio has decreased in 2018 partly as a result of Craig Donaldson asking the Committee to not consider him for variable reward for 2018.
Relative importance of spend on pay The table below shows total remuneration of all employees for 2018 compared to 2017.
This data is taken from the people costs on page 119 and excludes social security costs.
2018 2017 % million million change Employee costs 128.0 102.0 25.5 The costs have increased as a result of the growth in the average number of employees from 2017 to 2018.
We made no distributions by way of dividend or share buy-back during the preceding year, or made any other significant distributions.
We therefore consider that at this time there is no information or data which would assist shareholders in understanding the relative importance of spend on pay.
Total shareholder return The chart shows our total shareholder return TSR relative to the FTSE 250, FTSE 100 and the FTSE 350 banks which is  index of all bank stocks in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250.
These indices have been chosen as they represent a cross-section of UK companies and banks.
This chart shows the total return to MetroBank investors since our listing on the London Stock Exchange in March 2016, compared with the total return on an investment made in the FTSE 250, FTSE 100 or FTSE 350 banks over the same period, assuming an initial investment of 100.

The figure for 2018 takes into account zero variable reward for Craig Donaldson in light of his request that the Committee does not consider him for variable reward for 2018 2.
As disclosed in the Prospectus and 2016 Annual Report, Craig Donaldson received a higher variable reward for 2015 in the form of Share Awards, granted in March 2016, in recognition of his significant contribution to the successful private placement and admission of MetroBank to the London Stock Exchange, as well as his performance in 2015.
Noother variable reward for the 2015 performance year was awarded.
The Listing Share Award is subject to continued employment and no further performance conditions apply tovesting.
Further details are included in the shareholding table on page 94 and outstanding share awards table on page 95.
As mentioned above the vesting of these share awardswill be frozen pending further internal analysis and any external investigations into the RWA adjustment 3.
Our Directors Remuneration Policy containing a maximum variable reward outcome was first approved by shareholders at the AGM on 25 April 2017.
Under our Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders in 2017, variable reward is capped at 200% of salary 4.
Prior to approval of the Policy this cap was not in place Non-Executive Directors remuneration chairmans fees The fees for the Chairman remain unchanged at 385,000. non-executive Directors fees The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee, with further fees payable to reflect Board Committee memberships and chairmanships and or additional responsibilities such as Senior Independent Director.
The fees are benchmarked against financial services and other FTSE 250 companies.
The basic fee for Non-Executive Directors, which was last increased in April 2018, remains unchanged at 52,500.
The latest fees are shown below including the fee attracted by the new Deputy Chairman role and also the Designated NED for Workforce Engagement: Annual fee role 000 Non-Executive Director basic fee 52.5 Senior Independent Director or Deputy Chairman 30.0 Chairman of Audit or Risk Committee or Designated NED for Workforce Engagement 20.0 Chairman of Nomination or Remuneration1 Committee 10.0 Member of Audit, Risk or Remuneration Committee 10.0 Member of Nomination Committee 5.0 1.
In the 2017 Annual Report we misreported the fee for Remuneration Committee Chair as 20,000.
