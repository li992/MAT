It also describes how the Board has applied the principles of good governance as set out in the Corporate Governance Code AUDITED SINGLE FIGURE OF DIRECTORS REMUNERATION TABLE The remuneration of the Directors for 2018 is set out below in US dollars.
Unless otherwise noted, amounts that are denominated in Chilean pesos have been converted at the exchange rate on the first day of the month following the month in which the entitlement to payment accrued.
Any additional fees payable for serving on subsidiary and joint venture company boards are also included in the amounts below.
As explained in the Directors Remuneration Policy, Directors do not receive pensions or performance-related pay and are not eligible to participate in the LTIP.
During 2018, remuneration of $695,000 2017 $569,000 for the provision of services by Ramn Jara was paid to Asesoras Ramn F Jara Ltda.
As reported in the2017 Annual Report, Mr Jaras time commitments and the hourly rate payable under his contract were increased by 8% with effect from 1 January 2018.
The reportedincrease in 2018 is due to this increase and, to a lesser extent, the annual adjustment for inflation in Chile.
This amount is included in the amounts attributable to RamnJara of $991,000 2017 $863,000.
Amounts for Jean-Paul Luksic include the provision of life and health insurance.
Amounts for Ramn Jara include the provision of life insurance.
Except as described in footnote 2, all benefits amounts included in this table arose in connection with the fulfilment of Directors duties and, in particular, the cost of attending Board meetings.
These calculations have been based on what the Company believes would be deemed by HMRC to be taxable benefits if the Non-Executive Directors were UK tax resident and domiciled, relating to the costs of flights for attending Board meetings in Santiago, Chile and associated hotel and subsistence expenses, and for the cost of flights for attending Board meetings in London.
Given these expenses are incurred by Directors in connection with the fulfilment of their duties, the Company also pays the professional fees incurred to complete individual tax returns and the actual tax incurred by Directors on these expenses, the latter of which has ledto the higher reported figures for certain Directors.
Figures are reported in the year that they are paid, or would be payable, by the Company.

In determining whether Ivan Arriagadas individual performance score should also be reduced, the Committee considered the safety leadership that had been demonstrated during the year, including the leadership and measures taken in response to the fatality.
The Committee determined that very strong safety leadership had been demonstrated throughout the year and decided that a further downward adjustment to Ivan Arriagadas personal performance score was not warranted on this occasion.
Based on performance achieved against targets during the 2018 financial year, the Committee determined that Ivn Arriagada would receive a bonus payment of $578,560 for 2018.
