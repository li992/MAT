2018 Annual Bonus Plan ABP Strategic Objective Given the Companys focus on electric vehicles, a single strategic objective, weighted at 20% of the ABP was introduced for 2018.
This strategic objective was to achieve new business Thermal awards in 2018 which support the Companys EV strategy with key OEMs on new EV platforms.
The Company, with direct personal involvement of the Executive Directors achieved significant awards and expected orders for the design, engineering and supply of thermal products with two leading Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs.
The total lifetime revenue opportunity of these thermal awards is estimated at 700 million based on customer planning volumes, and we anticipate having approximately 50% share on these two EV platforms.
These portions of the thermal awards are expected to be for an eight to ten year life of the vehicles.
Production for these platforms is expected to launch in 2019 and 2020, although vehicle life and production start dates are subject to change by these OEMs.
Taking into account the strong performance against this objective the Remuneration Committee determined that the strategic objective had been achieved in full.
