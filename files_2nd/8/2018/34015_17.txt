Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Fair value measurement Financial assets and liabilities continued The Group measures financial instruments, such as trading and investment securities, certain loans to customers, Changes to classification and measurement derivatives and non-financial assets such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments and derivatives, to be assessed based on a combination Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 28. of the Groups business model for managing the assets and the instruments contractual cash flow characteristics.
The IAS 39 measurement categories are replaced by: Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between fair value through profit or loss FVPL : market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI with recycling to profit or loss upon disposal for debt transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: instruments: in the principal market for the asset or liability: or fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI without recycling to profit or loss for equity instruments: and in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability The accounting treatment for financial liabilities is largely the same as the requirements of IAS 39. is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into Under IFRS 9, embedded derivatives are no longer separated from a host financial asset.
Instead, financial assets are account a market participants ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use classified based on the business model and their contractual terms as explained below.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data Classification and measurement implementation are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of From 1 January 2018, the Group classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets unobservable inputs.
and the assets contractual terms.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised Measurement of financial instruments at initial recognition within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, adjusted, in the case of instruments Level 1 Quoted unadjusted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: not at fair value through profit or loss, for directly attributable fees and costs.
Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable: The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price.
Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement If the Group determines that the fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, then: is unobservable.
if the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability i. e. a Level 1 input or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the Group recognises the difference For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price as a gain or loss: and whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation based on the lowest in all other cases, the initial measurement of the financial instrument is adjusted to defer the difference between the level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole at the end of each reporting period.
fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price.
After initial recognition, the Group recognises that deferred difference as a gain or loss only when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.
Financial assets and liabilities Subsequent measurement of financial instruments IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group has not restated comparative information for 2017 for financial instruments in the scope of IFRS 9.
Therefore, the comparative Financial instruments measured at amortised cost information for 2017 is reported under IAS 39 and is not comparable to the information presented for 2018.
Differences From 1 January 2018 the Group measures due from credit institutions, loans to customers and other financial assets arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been recognised directly in retained earnings as of 1 January 2018 and are at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: disclosed below.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Subsequent measurement of financial instruments continued Subsequent measurement of financial instruments continued The assessment of business model requires judgement based on facts and circumstances at the date of the assessment.
Equity instruments at FVOCI option The business model is not assessed on an instrument by instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios Upon initial recognition, the Group elects to classify irrevocably its equity instruments as equity instruments at FVOCI per instrument type and is based on observable factors.
The Group has considered quantitative factors e. g. the expected when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading.
frequency and volume of sales and qualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the Such classification is determined on an instrument by instrument basis.
financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the key management personnel: the risks that affect the performance of the business model and, in particular, the way those risks are managed: and how managers Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit or loss.

Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.
Solely Payments of Principal and Interest SPPI Financial assets at FVTPL If a financial asset is held in either a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model, then assessment Groups of financial assets for which the business model is other than held to collect and held to collect and sell are to determine whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount measured at FVTPL from the date of initial application of IFRS 9. outstanding at initial recognition is required to determine the classification.
The SPPI test is performed on an individual instrument basis.
Derivatives recorded at fair value through profit or loss The Group enters into derivative transactions with various counterparties.
These include interest rate swaps, Forwards Contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and other similar instruments.
Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive are consistent with basic lending arrangements.
Interest is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Net changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in net gain loss associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time.
It can also include consideration for from financial instruments measured at FVTPL, excluding gain loss on foreign exchange derivatives which are presented other basic lending risks e. g. liquidity risk and costs e. g. administrative costs associated with holding the financial in net foreign currency gain.
asset for a particular period of time, and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement.
Financial guarantees, letter of credits and other financial commitments In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers whether the contractual terms of the Financial guarantees, letter of credits and other financial commitments are initially recognised in the financial statements financial asset contain a term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows arising over the life at fair value, being the premium received.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the Groups liability under each guarantee of the instrument which could affect whether the instrument is considered to meet the SPPI test.
is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in the income statement and an ECL provision.
If the SPPI test is failed, such financial assets are measured at FVTPL with interest earned recognised in other interest income.
Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position Interest income recognition when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, For Financial Instruments in Stage 1 and Stage 2, the Group calculates interest income by applying the Effective Interest or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Rate EIR to the gross carrying amount.
Interest income for financial assets in Stage 3 is calculated by applying the EIR to the amortised cost i. e. the gross carrying amount less credit loss allowance.
For Financial Instruments classified Cash and cash equivalents as POCI only, interest income is calculated by applying a credit adjusted EIR to the amortised cost of these POCI assets.
As a result of the amendments to International Accounting Standard 1: Presentation of Financial Statements IAS1 Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, amounts due from central banks, excluding obligatory reserves with following IFRS 9, the Group will present interest revenue calculated using the EIR method separately in the income central banks, and amounts due from credit institutions that mature within 90 days of the date of origination and are statement.

Debt instruments at FVOCI Borrowings From 1 January 2018 the Group measures debt investment securities at FVOCI when both of the following categories Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities, where the substance of the contractual are met: arrangement results in the Group having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder, or to The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved by both collecting contractual satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number cash flows, selling financial assets and holding such financial instruments for liquidity management purposes: and of own equity instruments.
Such instruments include amounts due to credit institutions and amounts due to customers The contractual terms of the financial asset meet the SPPI test.
These are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using These instruments comprise assets that had previously been classified as investment securities available-for-sale the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the borrowings under IAS 39. are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
FVOCI debt investment securities are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between in fair value recognised in OCI.
Interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss in the the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
same manner as for financial assets measured at amortised cost.
On derecognition, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified from OCI to profit or loss.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Subordinated debt Staged approach to the determination of expected credit losses Subordinated debt represents long-term funds attracted by the Bank on international financial markets or domestic IFRS 9 introduces a three-stage approach to impairment for Financial Instruments that are performing at the date market.
The holders of subordinated debt would be subordinate to all other creditors to receive repayment of debt in case of origination or purchase.
This approach is summarised as follows: of the Banks liquidation.
Subordinated debt is carried at amortised cost.
Stage 1: The Group recognises a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.
This represents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected within 12 months of the reporting date, assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition.
For those Leases financial assets with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, a PD is used that corresponds to the remaining i.

Leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the lease item to the lessee are Stage 2: The Group recognises a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses LTECL classified as finance leases.
The Group recognises finance lease receivables in the consolidated statement of financial for those Financial Instruments which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since position at a value equal to the net investment in the lease, starting from the date of commencement of the lease term.
This requires the computation of ECL based on lifetime probability of default LTPD that In calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments, the discount factor used is the interest rate implicit in the represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the Financial Instrument.
Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivables.
Lease payments received for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk and the impact of a longer time horizon are apportioned between the finance income and the reduction of the outstanding lease receivable.
Finance income is being considered compared to 12 months in Stage 1.
Financial Instruments in stage 2 are not yet deemed to be creditbased on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding.
Stage 3: If the Financial Instrument is credit-impaired, it is then moved to Stage 3.
The Group recognises a loss ii.
Operating Group as lessee allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, reflecting a Probability of Default PD of 100% Leases of assets under which the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified for those Financial Instruments that are credit-impaired.
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in other administrative and operating expenses.
Financial instruments within the scope of the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are classified into one of the above three stages.
Unless purchased or originated credit impaired, newly originated assets are classified as Stage 1 and iii.
Operating Group as lessor remain in that stage unless there is considered to have been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, The Group presents assets subject to operating leases in the consolidated statement of financial position according at which point the asset is reclassified to Stage 2. to the nature of the asset.

CAEIR takes into account all contractual terms of the financial asset and expected credit losses.
ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses where ECLs are calculated based on lifetime expected credit loss.
Once the Financial Asset Impairment of financial assets is recognised as POCI, it retains this status until derecognised.
Changes to the impairment estimation The adoption of IFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Groups accounting for loan loss impairment by replacing Key judgements and estimates used under IFRS 9 are disclosed in Note 4.
IAS 39s incurred loss approach with the forward-looking expected credit loss ECL approach.
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record ECL on all of its debt financial assets at amortised cost or FVOCI, finance lease receivables, as well Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities as loan commitments and financial guarantees.
The allowance is based on the ECL associated with the probability of default in the next 12 months unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case Derecognition of Financial Assets the allowance is based on the ECL over the life of the asset.
If the financial asset meets the definition of purchased A financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is or originated credit impaired, the allowance is based on the change in the lifetime ECL.

This contrasts to the IAS 39 impairment model which was not applicable to off balance sheet financial commitments, as these were instead covered by IAS 37: Provisions, Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset and has neither transferred nor retained Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

Under IFRS 9, the Group first evaluates individually whether objective evidence of impairment exists for loans that are individually significant.
It then collectively assesses loans that are not individually significant and loans which are significant but for which there is no objective evidence of impairment available under the individual assessment.

Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.
When assessing whether or not to derecognise a financial instrument the Group considers the following factors: Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one year Change in currency of the loan from the date of the classification.
Change in interest rate type Introduction of an equity feature Immediately before the initial classification of the asset as held for sale, the carrying amount of the asset is measured Change in counterparty in accordance with applicable IFRSs.
If the modification is such that the instrument would no longer meet the SPPI criterion.

The current income tax expense is calculated in accordance with the regulations in force in the respective territories in which BOGG and its subsidiaries operate.
Derecognition of financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
