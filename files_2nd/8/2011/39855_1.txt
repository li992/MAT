This underpins the long term growth in the value of our property assets and is delivered to our shareholders through rising distributions.
We achieve this through our focus of investing exclusively in Londons West End, a location which in our experience has demonstrated great resilience over many years.
Within the West End, we concentrate on central locations which have enduring appeal, vibrancy and creativity, and which continue to attract huge numbers of visitors from across the world.
Our wholly owned holdings now extend to 12 acres of freeholds, across over 500 buildings, and comprise 1.55 million sq.
ft. of commercial and residential space.
Shops, restaurants, bars and leisure space now account for 71% of our current income, whilst offices provide 19% and apartments 10%.
The Longmartin joint venture, in which we have a 50% interest, owns a 1.9 acre island site in Covent Garden with 269,000 sq.
Our portfolio is now valued at almost 1.7 billion.
