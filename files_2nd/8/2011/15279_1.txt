Underlying performance The Groups management uses underlying performance to plan for, control and assess the performance of the Group.
Underlying performance differs from the statutory IFRS performance as it excludes the effect of special items, which are defined in note 2.
The Boards view is that underlying performance provides more meaningful information for the Groups investors and so it is the primary focus of the Groups narrative reporting.
Where appropriate, statutory performance inclusive of special items is also described.
