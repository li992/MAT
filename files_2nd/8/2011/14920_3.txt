fiNANCiAl HigHligHts we start 2012 against a backdrop of increased economic uncertainty.
while demand is lower than in the prior year, it is also undoubtedly the case that overall, market conditions remain in far better shape than those we saw Russell Clements Chief Executive Officer in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
It is also true that just as sentiment can deteriorate very quickly, it can also move in a positive direction equally rapidly.
whatever 2012 has in store for us, we remain confident that we will make the best of it.
Our seasoned management team has seen all market scenarios and has become increasingly adept in recent years at driving the best available result in uncertain circumstances.
we will manage the business prudently but we will not lose sight of the great medium term prospects for our business and where appropriate we will invest to ensure that the groups future lives up to its potential.
