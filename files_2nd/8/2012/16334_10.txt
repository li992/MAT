There were major shortfalls in two divisions, Aircraft & Vehicle Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems.
In contrast, Information & Power Systems reported a significant increase.
The shortfall in Aircraft & Vehicle Systems arose primarily in the aircraft controls business due to lower sales in the noise and vibration segment because of the phasing of aircraft deliveries as well as lower reported sales at AMI in the gap between the cessation of funded development work and the beginning of full production.
Tactical & Sonar Systems was a mixed picture.
While sales into the UK crypto programme and to antisubmarine warfare in the US were robust, this was overshadowed by a significant reduction in sales of tactical radios, both to the export and particularly the US market.
