New 2013 long-term incentive plan LEAP was one of a number of innovative co-investment plans which have served the Company well since the introduction of the first co-investment plan in 1994.
The final awards under LEAP III were made in 2012.
As a result, a new plan is being recommended to share owners for approval at the AGM in June 2013.
Thisplan adopts a simpler structure while retaining some of the key features of LEAP such as a five-year performance period, clawback and pro-ration of awards for early leavers.
Three independent measures will be used to assess performance over each five-year period: relative TSR against an industry peer group: earnings per share EPS growth: and average return onequity ROE.
These measures aim to capture and reward stretching performance in growth, capital efficiency and returns to share owners.
Threshold vesting will reduce from 30% to 20% of an award.
These proposed changes in plan design accord with much of the feedback received from share owners during the extensive consultation process.
As the Company is moving from a co-investment plan structure to a more standard performance share plan design, Share Ownership Guidelines are also being introduced.
These share ownership requirements will be amongst the highest in the UK.
