The year saw fast-changing, volatile market conditions around the world, with sentiment amongst our clients and candidates varying from quarter to quarter.
As such, our approach to managing thebusiness has been nimble and responsive to reflect this volatility, most notably in terms of prioritising appropriate areas of investment.
We have continued to grow our business to maximise fees in more buoyant markets, such as the resource-based regions of Australia and our global IT, Engineering, Life Sciences and Oil & Gas specialisms.
Equally, we have continued to invest in order to capitalise on structural growth markets such as Germany, Japan and Brazil.
At the same time, we have taken appropriate action to defend the profit of the Group by focusing on strong cost control in more challenging markets, and leveraging our best-in-class IT systems to drive consultant productivity.
