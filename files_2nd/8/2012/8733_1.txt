20 21 Introduction Executive Chairmans Following the acquisition of Blacks in January 2012, the Group Statement now comprises four divisions being Sports Fascias, Fashion Fascias, Outdoor and Distribution.
Our core business is retail and our other businesses largely support the retail proposition and offer benefits to the Group from a strategic standpoint.
During the period, we have invested significantly in brands, businesses, multi-channel and other infrastructure to strengthen the platform for future development of the Group.
Beyond the UK we have also expanded by acquisition in Ireland and Spain and opened further JD stores in France.
In addition, the first JD store in Spain was opened in Granada on 30 March 2012. International development will be a key foundation for our future and further investment in our infrastructure overhead will be required to deliver longer term sustained profitability from this activity.
Our new centralised warehouse in Kingsway, Rochdale is a further example of the investment that we have undertaken.
This will be fully operational in Summer 2012 and we anticipate that almost all stock for the core UK Sports and Fashion retail fascias will be channelled through one warehouse, improving service to retail and reducing transportation time and costs.
In April 2011, we noted that the increased proportion of gross takings represented by VAT combined with increased commodity costs and low consumer confidence would inhibit potential earnings growth in the year just ended.
Therefore, taking into account these factors and the scale of the investment activity in the year, it is pleasing to report that the final group profit before tax adding back exceptional items of 76.0 million 2011: 81.6 million exceeds the market expectations set at that time.
Within the Group there have been positive results notably the contribution from our newly acquired Spanish retail business Sprinter which has contributed to a further enhancement in the overall performance from the Sports Fascias.
Group operating profit adding back exceptional items and excluding share of results of joint venture for the year was 76.5 million 2011: 79.9 million and comprises a Sports Fascias profit of 74.3 million 2011: 73.3 million, a Fashion Fascias profit of 3.3 million 2011: 6.4 million, an Outdoor loss of 2.2 million 2011: nil and a Distribution profit of 1.1 million 2011: 0.2 million.
Net cash at the year end was 60.3 million, a decline of 25.8 million reflecting both the level of acquisition activity and an increase in capital expenditure for the fit out of the Kingsway warehouse facility.
However, the Group continues to generate significant amounts of cash at the operating level.
The ongoing strength of the Groups Balance Sheet, together with confidence that the Groups operations are fundamentally cash generative, mean that the Board is able to propose another significant rise in the level of the total dividend to shareholders with a final proposed dividend up 10% to 21.2p 2011: 19.2p.
This brings the total dividends payable for the year to 25.3p 2011: 23.0p and means that annual dividends payable have now risen by 198% over the last four years.

The proposed final dividend will be paid on 30 July 2012 to all shareholders on the register at 4 May 2012.
The final dividend has been increased by 10% with total dividends payable for the year increased by 10%.
The dividend has therefore increased by 198% in 4 years.
The adjusted earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items were 105.89p 2011: 116.86p.
The basic earnings per ordinary share were 96.27p 2011: 114.84p.
Employees In difficult trading conditions we are more reliant than ever on the skills and energy of our employees around the world to drive performance and the whole Board would like to thank them for their commitment.
We remain totally committed to their training and career development and the ongoing development of the Group internationally should enhance their prospects.
Current Trading and Outlook Whilst we expect some improvement in consumer confidence from the forthcoming international sporting events, we remain cautious for well reported reasons.
Trading in the early part of the current financial year has been satisfactory in the core UK and Ireland fascias with net like for like sales for the 9 weeks to 31 March 2012 of 1.2% Sports Fascias 1.0%, Fashion Fascias 2.3%.
Margins remain under pressure as consumers continue to be offer driven.
It is clear that the recently acquired Blacks business will be dilutive to earnings this year whilst we resolve the challenges across the business, particularly with regards to stock and property.
We envisage that the majority of the earnings dilution will come in the first half of the year.
The Group is exceptionally well positioned with its retail proposition, financial resources and management experience to take advantage of any opportunities both in the UK and internationally.
Whilst the Board recognises that current expansion activity is likely to impact returns in the short term, it remains confident that the Group is being positioned to deliver longer term earnings growth and increasing shareholder returns.
A further update will be made in our Interim Management Statement no later than 15 June 2012.
