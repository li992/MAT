Proceeds from portfolio realisations, made at good uplifts to carrying values, were almost double those achieved in the previous year.
With its experience of successful investment through a number of economic cycles, Electra Partners has the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and the ability to structure deals creatively so as to work around vendor constraints.
The Board believes these factors will ensure that Electra continues to deliver value over the difficult period ahead.
Overview Electra continued to make good progress over the year to 30 September 2012.
Over the same period financial markets showed some improvement, although they continued to be volatile and there have been continuing weaknesses in demand in some sectors.
Despite this the value of portfolio realisations by Electra, made at good uplifts to carrying values, was double that achieved in the year to 30 September 2011.
Results At 30 September 2012 Electras diluted net asset value per share was 2,473p compared with 2,225p at 30 September 2011, an increase of 11% against a FTSE All-Share increase of 13%.
Over the ten years to 30 September 2012, the diluted net asset value per share, inclusive of Special Dividends, has increased by 232% and Electra achieved an annualised return on equity of 13%.
For the first four months of the year Electras share price broadly tracked the volatile movement in the FTSE All-Share.
Since February 2012, Electras share price has outperformed the FTSE All-Share and increased by 30% over the year.
The year end share price of 1,770p represents a discount to diluted NAV of 28%, better than the average discount of the Companys peer group and a significant improvement from the discount of 39% at 30 September 2011.
Electras share price has increased by nearly four times over the 10 years to 30 September 2012.
Investment Activity The first six months of the year saw a surge in demand for quality investments as private equity houses approaching the end of their investment periods sought to complete portfolio purchases before raising their next funds.
The resulting price increases gave Electra the opportunity to realise a number of investments at significant premiums to their carrying values.
During the year, 301 million was received from the sale of investments, compared with 137 million realised in the previous year.
Over the year Electra Partners had a strong flow of new deal opportunities although the rate of conversion to investment was relatively low due to a number of factors including the large gap between buyer and seller price expectations.
Electra invested a total of 150 million in the year compared to 136 million in the previous year.
Of the deals completed, a total of 69 million was invested in acquiring term debt in Park Resorts, one of the UKs leading caravan park operators, and 22million was invested in Peverel Group, one of the leading UK property management service groups.
Towards the end of the year Electra acquired a portfolio of debt positions in five companies for 30 million, of which 15 million is included in the 69 million total investment in Park Resorts.
These are good examples of Electras ability to take advantage of distressed opportunities and make investments across the capital structure.
Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2012 3 Further information Governance Financial statements Business review Overview Capital Base As previously reported, Electras existing multi-currency revolving credit facility was refinanced at the start of the year, increasing its size to 195 million and extending the loan term to June 2016.
This was part of the on-going strategy to diversify the sources of funding and maturity of Electras capital base, which started in 2009 with the raising of 46 million of ZDPs and continued in 2010 with the issue of 100 million of 5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds.
Together with the Corporate Governance substantial realisation The duty of the Board is to act in our shareholders interests at all times.
We report in proceeds received in the detail on corporate governance matters later in this Report and Accounts.
We have last year, Electra is in a noted the new UK Corporate Governance Code, Guidance on Audit Committees and strong position to acquire UK Stewardship Code that were published at the end of September 2012 and, where new investments on appropriate, will report on our compliance with these next year when they come attractive terms.
Articles of Association Shareholders last approved a number of changes to the Articles of Association at the Annual General Meeting held in 2010.
The Board has decided to seek shareholders approval to update the Articles again this year.
The main reason for this is new legislation for investment trusts which has been introduced recently: in particular, one of the legislative changes which has resulted in the removal of the prohibition on the distribution of capital profits by way of dividend.
The Board therefore intends to seek shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to amend the Articles of Association to permit the distribution of capital profits by way of a dividend.
It should be noted however that this does not indicate that there is likely to be a change in the Companys dividend policy, which is not to pay dividends unless required to do so to maintain the Companys investment trust status.
Further details are set out in the Directors Report.
We are also taking the opportunity to update some minor administrative matters in the Articles, details of which are set out on page 68.
Shareholders will be asked to vote on all these changes at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 7 March 2013.
Board Changes As I reported in my statement to 31 March 2012, Michael Walton retired from the Board on 28 May 2012 and Roger Yates was appointed as a non-executive Director on the same day.
Michael had been a non-executive Director since 2000 and Chairman of the Valuations Committee since its inception in October 2007, and has made an outstanding contribution to the development of Electra.
Roger has 30 years experience as an investment professional and a business manager in the fund management industry.
Roger has been appointed a member of all the Boards committees.
4 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2012 Kate Barker was appointed Chairman of the Valuations Committee at the end of May in place of Michael Walton and as a result has stood down from the Management Engagement Committee.
I am sorry to report that Lucinda Webber has decided to retire from the Board with effect from the Annual General Meeting to be held on 7 March 2013.
She has been a Director for six years and Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee since March 2011.
We shall greatly miss her wise counsel and her knowledge of private equity.
She has made an outstanding contribution to the Board.
The Board has started the process of searching for a Director to replace her on the Board and we hope to make an announcement in due course.
Outlook The Board believes that Electras deal flow will increase in the period ahead, driven by a greater number of distressed sales and the need for companies to refinance debt, dispose of non-core assets and simplify their businesses.
Further opportunities are also expected to become available from the banks as a result of new banking capital requirements.
Electra first identified these potential developments in 2009 and took steps to broaden and diversify its capital base.
Together with the substantial realisation proceeds received in the last year, Electra is in a strong position to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
With its experience of successful investment through a number of economic cycles Electra Partners has the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and the ability to structure deals creatively so as to work around vendor constraints.
