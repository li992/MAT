Its uncoated fine paper plant at Ruomberok in Slovakia is just one example of how experience was transferred from one plant to significantly improve the performance of another.
As part of a Group-wide benchmarking process, it became apparent that productivity at Ruomberok was falling behind.
Mondis containerboard mill at wiecie in Poland with production at 890 tonnes per employee was identified as the perfect partner to provide ideas on how Ruomberok at only 317 tonnes per employee could improve its performance.
The objective was to achieve maximum possible output per employee to achieve the lowest cost production.
The two plants management teams collaborated on an ambitious programme to improve Ruomberoks processes, methods and working capital: the operations team worked on improving equipment utilisation and the administration team looked particularly at improving efficiency in IT systems.
The result was a marked operational improvement at Ruomberok, which achieved a targeted 22% improvement in productivity.
This is a perfect illustration of how the exchange of experience and best practice across The finishing Mondis businesses can produce real efficiency gains.
