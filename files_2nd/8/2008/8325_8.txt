In 2008 we achieved technical availability of 89.1%, a decrease from the 90.0% achieved in 2007.
The extension of the outage at Rugeley was the key contributor to the reduced technical availability this year.
If technical availability at Rugeley had been consistent with its average performance over the last three years, the technical availability of the portfolio as a whole would have been 90.3%.

A discussion of the policies we believe to be most critical in considering the impact of estimates and judgements on the Groups financial position and results of operations are set out on pages 52 to 61.
In order to allow a full understanding of the financial information presented within the consolidated financial statements, and specifically the Groups underlying business performance, the Group presents its income statement such that it separately identifies: the results excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements the effect of the exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements the total result The basis of preparation is outlined more fully in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 107 to 108.
However, in summary, those items that the Group separately present as exceptional are items which, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order to enable a proper understanding of the financial information.
Those items that the Group separately present as specific IAS 39 mark to market movements are those mark to market movements recorded in the income statement which relate to: derivative contracts into which the Group has entered in order to economically hedge certain of its physical and financial exposures: and fair value gains and losses on equity conversion features embedded within convertible bonds, so as to separately identify a non-cash movement which, if the conversion option is exercised, will ultimately be extinguished by the issue of equity.

Earnings per share 2008 EPS excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements at 32.4p is 20% ahead of 2007.
This increase principally reflects those items discussed under the heading profit from operations and also reflects an increase in interest expense and a smaller increase in tax expense both of which are discussed on page 53.

Free cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 513 million, a decrease of 140 million compared with 2007.
This decrease is driven by an increase in maintenance capital expenditure of 37 million, principally at Rugeley, Hazelwood and Saltend: and an increase in net interest paid of 87 million.
In addition, there was a working capital increase in the year of 109 million due to stock building at Rugeley and a reversal of some one-off working capital benefits in 2007.

Payment of this final dividend to shareholders registered on the Company share register on 5 June 2009 is due to be made on 9 July 2009, following approval at the 2009 AGM which will be held on 21 May 2009.
Outlook We have a well established portfolio of long-term contracted assets which continues to perform well.
We are also well positioned in our key merchant markets, although forward pricing in the UK and the US does not reflect the attractive long-term market fundamentals.
In the absence of a significant improvement in pricing in these two markets, it is likely that Group profitability in 2009 will be lower than in 2008.
However, our assets are well placed to capture value, from both market recovery and short-term pricing volatility.
The financial position of the Group remains strong, with good corporate liquidity and no material refinancings in 2009.
We expect to continue to deliver strong free cash flow in 2009.
