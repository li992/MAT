Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic earnings per share are before fair value movements on biological assets, amortisation of intangible assets, share based payments and exceptional items, also excluding other gains and losses.
Both measurements include share of profits of joint ventures and associates.
The results at constant currency for the year ended 30 June 2007 reflect the rates which applied during the year ended 30 June 2008.
We have again delivered strong profit growth and have exceeded market expectations despite harsh market conditions in the livestock farming sector.
Our performance demonstrates the robustness of the Genus business model and the strength of its management team.
Net debt was materially reduced by the successful divestment of non-core assets and a fund raising at the time of the Companys move to the main market, leaving us able to invest in expansion to meet the strong forecast growth in an improving agricultural economy.
40% Adjusted profit We view the market prognosis as being increasingly before tax favourable in both the short and medium term and remain confident for the year ahead.
