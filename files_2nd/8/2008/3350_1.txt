Since October 2008 there has been a marked deterioration in global economic and financial conditions which had led to reduced demand for ESAB welding consumables and equipment.
Notwithstanding this slowdown, as we progress through 2009, we can take confidence from the global presence, market leadership positions, strong technology and flexible cost bases of both ESAB and Howden, which are supported by Charters strengthened balance sheet and positive long-term dynamics in the businesses key end-user segments.
All of these we believe will assist Charter to resume growth as and when economic and financial conditions improve.
