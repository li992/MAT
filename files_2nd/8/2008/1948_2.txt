Annual Report & Accounts 2008 03 People In these extremely testing times our employees, sub-contractors, suppliers and partners have contributed more than ever to the production of these results and the Board is extremely grateful to all of them, including those who have now, sadly, left the business.
The Board Leo Finn, our senior independent non-executive director, steps down at the forthcoming AGM on 16 January 2009 and will not seek re-election.
Leo has given thirteen years of sterling service to the Group and the Board would like to thank him for all his efforts on behalf of Bellway.
He is to be replaced on 1 February 2009 by Mike Toms whose current directorships include the role of non-executive director of UK COAL PLC and whose past directorships include the role of executive director of BAA plc.
We wish Mike every success in his new role, which will incorporate the chairmanship of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration.
Peter Johnson will become senior independent director from 16 January 2009.
Outlook In its long experience, the Board has never witnessed such a swift change in the housing market as has been seen in the last twelve months.
The Board has a clear strategy, aimed primarily at conserving cash and reducing the cost base, whilst maintaining the essential operational fabric and protecting shareholder value so that growth may commence when the market returns to more normal conditions.
