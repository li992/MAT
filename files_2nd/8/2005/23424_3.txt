Overview Electra Background to Recent Changes Since listing in 1976, Electra has specialised in investing in the private equity market and, through the adoption of a flexible investment policy, has achieved returns substantially in excess of the FTSE AllShare Index over the last ten years.
As an investment trust, Electra has a number of advantages over limited partnership funds which invest in private equity.
Between 1976 and 2005 Electra invested over 3,000 million in private equity investments.
Inclusive of a capital injection of 32 million, Electras assets grew from 58 million in 1976 to 1,145 million by 30 September 1998, the financial year end immediately preceding the hostile takeover bid for Electra by 3i plc in 1999.
This bid failed when shareholders voted in favour of a scheme which involved the controlled realisation of the portfolio over a five year period under which new investment was restricted to existing portfolio companies.
Since the start of the realisation programme in 1999, Electra has returned 1,123 million to shareholders leaving a residual portfolio valued at 618 million at 30 September 2005.
This compares with the stock market value of Electra of 975 million immediately before the announcement of the takeover bid.
Over the six and a half years to 30 September 2005, 571 million has been invested in portfolio companies and 1,950 million has been realised from the portfolio.
Shareholders approved proposals in June 2001 which retained the emphasis on realising the investment portfolio at that date but made provision for Electra to continue as an investment vehicle.
In 2004, the Board, with input from its advisers and Electra Partners, reviewed Electras investment strategy and concluded that it should continue unchanged from the investment strategy approved by shareholders in 2001.
