Basis of preparation of pro forma results In preparing its annual results, the Group has taken advantage of the option in IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards to implement IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 and IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts IFRS 4 from 1 January 2005 without restating its 2004 income statement and balance sheet.
However, given the importance of these standards, the Group has provided detailed pro forma information for the year ended 31 December 2004 reflecting the estimated effect of these standards to facilitate inter-period comparison.
This pro forma information has been prepared on the following basis: i The requirements of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 have been applied from 1 January 2004 except for the requirements relating to hedge accounting: no hedge ineffectiveness has been recognised in profit or loss.
ii Impairment provisions reflect the information and estimates on which previous GAAP provisions were established.
iii Classification of financial assets into held-to-maturity, held-for-trading, available-for-sale, loans and receivables or designated as at fair value through profit or loss at 1 January 2004 is consistent with the approach adopted on 1 January 2005 on implementation of IAS 39. section 01 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review
