The Company has achieved substantially improved results with adjusted operating profits having increased by 78 per cent to 97.5 million, pre tax profits increased by 152 per cent to 103.5 million and adjusted earnings per share by 117 per cent to 43.0 pence per share.
The excellent results achieved in 2005 reflect the strength of the key markets in which ESAB and Howden have traded and the significant benefits that have arisen from the programme of restructurings, plant and business closures and cost reduction and other initiatives implemented in recent years.
These two factors have certainly contributed to the substantial improvements in ESABs and Howdens 2005 adjusted operating margins of 10.3 per cent 2004: 7.9 per cent and 9.7 per cent 2004: 5.9 per cent, respectively.
ESAB and Howden have started the year strongly and in the first two months of the year are ahead of the Boards previous expectations in both operating profit and cash flow terms: furthermore, since year-end Howdens order book has continued to grow.
For these reasons, and given the excellent results achieved in 2005, the Board views the Companys trading prospects for 2006 with confidence.
