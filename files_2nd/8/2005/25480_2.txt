Presentation of financial information Under the contractual arrangements implementing the Dual Listed Companies Structure DLC structure, Investec plc and Investec Limited effectively form a single economic enterprise, in which the economic and voting rights of shareholders are equalised.
In accordance with this structure, the directors of the two companies consider that for financial reporting purposes, the fairest presentation is achieved by consolidating the results and financial position of both companies using merger accounting principles.
Accordingly, the results for Investec plc set out on pages 160 to 166 presents the results and financial position of the combined DLC group under UK GAAP, denominated in Pounds Sterling i. e. Investec's consolidated results.
Investec had previously reported its consolidated results both in accordance with SA GAAP, denominated in Rands and UK GAAP, denominated in Pounds Sterling.
The group is now only required to report its consolidated results in accordance with UK GAAP denominated in Pounds Sterling.
However, because SA GAAP differs in certain respects from UK GAAP, the group sets out a high-level reconciliation and summary of these principal differences on pages 229 to 230.
The financial information contained throughout this document has been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
All references in this document referring to Investec or the group relate to the combined DLC group comprising Investec plc and Investec Limited.
