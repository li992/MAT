Previously the Group has reported embedded value based supplementary information on the achieved profits basis.
Operating earnings per share is calculated using operating profit from continuing operations based on longer-term investment returns after related tax and minority interests.
This profit excludes goodwill impairment charges, the post-tax effects of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, the shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses of defined benefit pension schemes, the effect of changes in economic assumptions, and changes in the time value of cost of options and guarantees.
The amounts for these items are included in the calculation of EEV basis basic earnings per share.
IFRS basis results The basis of preparation reflects the formal adoption of IFRS basis reporting for the 2005 results.
This basis of reporting was anticipated in the Companys interim reporting in July 2005 and, on all substantive matters, the basis of measurement and presentation of IFRS basis results included in this Annual Report is the same as applied at that time.
References to statutory IFRS basis results throughout this Annual Report reflect results contained in the statutory basis financial statements for 2005.
These statements incorporate changes from the basis of preparation for the 2004 financial statements that were included in determining the interim 2005 results.
These changes reflect: i Measurement changes arising from policies the Group has applied on the adoption of all IFRS standards, other than IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, from 1 January 2004.
The 2005 results include the effect of adoption of those three standards from 1 January 2005. ii Changes to the format of the results and other presentational changes that the Group has applied in its 2005 financial statements.
iii A discretionary change of policy for the basis of determining longer-term investment returns included in operating profit based on longer-term investment returns.
The pro forma IFRS basis results included in this Annual Report are included as supplementary information and are not results that form part of the Groups financial statements.
The pro forma IFRS results reflect the application of the statutory IFRS changes noted above and the estimated effect on the Groups results for 2004 if IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4 had been applied from 1 January 2004 to the Groups insurance operations.
This profit excludes goodwill impairment charges, the post-tax effects of short-term fluctuations in investment returns, and the shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
The amounts for these items are included in the calculation of IFRS basis basic earnings per share.
