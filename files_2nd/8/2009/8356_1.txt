Whilst the Group is not immune to the current economic challenges, it benefits from a solid and balanced UK position, continued opportunities internationally, good revenue visibility and a strong balance sheet.
Given the risks in the external environment, 2010 will be a challenging year, particularly in the first half.
However, we are focused on taking advantage of the opportunities for renewed growth, as and when our markets recover.
Our confidence in the Groups future prospects is reflected in the Boards recommendation of the continuation of our progressive dividend policy.

Whilst there is no impact on Group earnings per share it has resulted in a reduction in reported operating profits from associate companies, matched by an equal reduction in the Group tax charge.
Applying the current basis of taxation to 2008, the reported operating profits from associate companies in that period has been reduced by 3.8m.
