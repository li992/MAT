Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Performance at a glance In 2009 National Express faced many challenges and resolved its major issues reducing debt, ending our rail losses, navigating takeover interest, progressing our refinancing and recruiting a new Chief Executive to take us forward.
Whilst 2010 will be another challenging year in a difficult economic environment, we are focused on delivering margin improvement through cost reduction, continuing strong cash generation, and building on the foundations that we have laid in 2009.
With significant scope to improve our business, especially in UK Bus and North America, while building on our successes in Spain and UK Coach, we will drive forward our performance and deliver value for our shareholders.
