MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Message from the Chairman The months between September and November were very dif cult for markets and Scottish Mortgage as the historic magnitude of the financial crisis developed and then swamped the real economy.
Many holdings in the portfolio were marked down in an often apparently indiscriminate way by markets that were gripped by fear and panic.
The extent of the fall was exacerbated by the level of gearing.
On a positive note, earnings rose, the dividend has been increased for the 27th successive year and many of our holdings have enjoyed a good recovery in recent months.
We continue to concentrate on the long term prospects of individual companies rather than trying to predict shorter term market movements.
The portfolio has been carefully reviewed and a strategic assessment made in the light of the rapid change in markets.
The broad conclusion is that the overall strategy to invest in equities on a worldwide and long term basis is sensible given the increasingly global nature of economic trading activity as the in uence of countries outside of the Western economic area increases.
During the year, some companies operating conditions deteriorated but a large number continue to operate effectively and many actually enjoy strengthened relative positions.
The survivors of this severe shock may be in dominant positions for many years to come.
The Managers Review on pages 8 to 10 gives a more detailed account of the investments over the past financial year.
This is our Centenary Year.
A 100 year record is signi cant as it underlines the enduring aims and encouraging resilience of the Trusts business over the long term.
