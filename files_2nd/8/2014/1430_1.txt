Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 VALUE TOGETHER ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 Introduction Financial highlights VALUE TOGETHER Associated British Foods is a diversified international food, ingredients and retail group with sales of 12.9bn, 118,000 employees and operations in 47 countries across Europe, southern Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australia.
At the heart of the way we operate is a principle of value together the benefit that the group gains from each of the businesses being part of the larger organisation.
This is manifest in how the corporate centre provides support to its operations and in the advantages that individual businesses gain from collaboration with each other.
Our businesses benefit from working alongside other group operations in relatedmarkets allowing them to share knowledge, skills and best practice.
The model also allows them, for example, to make joint investments, which would otherwise deliver insufficient returns.
The businesses also work with each other to provide practical support such as making introductions in new countries and markets, hiring and developing people, providing back-office services and sharing office space, to name but a few.
