Following the successful integration of Makro into the Group and a period of strong cash generation, the Board is proposing to implement a capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share at a cost of approximately 61m, based on the current issued share capital of the Company.
It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue of a new class of B shares which shareholders will be able to redeem for cash.
The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 9 July 2014.
Further details of the proposed return of capital will be set out in a circular to shareholders which will accompany the notice convening this years Annual General Meeting.
We currently anticipate returning a similar amount to shareholders in July 2015 and will provide an update on this at the 2015 Final Results announcement in May 2015, in light of circumstances prevailing at that time.
