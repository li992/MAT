2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Directors remuneration report Our executive remuneration at a glance Prudential plc Annual Report 2014 97 What this performance means for executive directors pay At Prudential, the remuneration packages are designed to ensure a strong alignment between pay and performance.
As you can see from the charts on page 94, sustained growth across all of our key performance metrics has delivered substantial value to our shareholders.
This has been reflected in both the annual bonuses paid and the release of long-term incentive awards, as set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In particular, the long-term incentives awarded to executive directors in 2012 had stretching performance conditions attached to vesting and were denominated in shares.
The value generated for shareholders through share price growth and dividends paid over the last three years is therefore reflected in the value of the 2014 long-term incentive plan LTIP releases, as illustrated in the chart below.
