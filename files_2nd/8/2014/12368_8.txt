Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices Development project Kyzyl In September 2014, Polymetal completed the acquisition of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
The addition of this worldDeveloping a world-class class asset to our high-quality portfolio will provide us with a considerable expansion of our existing reserves and mine asset life, as well as a significant exploration upside.
Location: Northeastern Kazakhstan The Kyzyl gold project consists of the Bakyrchik and Bolshevik gold deposits.
Bakyrchik is one of the largest untapped Bakyrchik and Bolshevik gold deposits in the Former Soviet Union and globally.
With gold reserves of 6.7 Moz at 7.5 g t JORC, this will double Polymetals gold equivalent reserves.
Inferred resources of 2.9 Moz gold at 6.6 g t at Bakyrchik are expected to provide 6.7Moz 7.5 g t Au a life of mine of 20 years and there is the potential for further exploration on adjacent properties, which is covered by Gold reserves Average reserve grade Bakyrchik and Bolshevik licences.
JORC Kyzyl is located in northeastern Kazakhstan, 75 km from the industrial centre of Oskemen Ust-Kamenogorsk.
This is a traditional mining region with an established infrastructure 20 years which gives us good access to power and rail.
Estimated life of mine Open-plan mining planned Current outline of the project Bakyrchik The previous owners had only considered underground mining of primary ores, with full processing flowsheet to Dor production including roasting and BIOX technologies.
Polymetal believes that the challenging underground mining conditions make open-pit mining a more attractive option from the point of view of risk mitigation and capital expenditure reduction, despite the expected high stripping ratio.
Open-pit mining is judged to be the better option for the first ten years to mine 18 Mt of ore with 120 t of gold, followed by a switch to underground mining at a later stage.
Initially, we plan to build a flotation plant for ore processing, selling the concentrate to third-party offtakers.
We will then review the options of either processing the concentrate in our POX hub in Amursk or, alternatively, building a new POX plant on-site.
This sequencing will reduce risks, split capital expenditures and, ultimately, increase the return on invested capital.
The initial capital expenditure for the flotation plant and open-pit mine is estimated at US$440-530 million.
This will be revisited once the feasibility study has been completed in Q4 2015.
In 2014, Polymetal submitted documents for open-pit Open-pit and underground mine development to the regulatory authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan for examination.
The Company also carried Gold deposits out a preliminary assessment of the environmental impact and 1 Bakyrchyk New infrastructure In Q4 2015, we will finalise the audit of the updated feasibility 2 Bolshevik held a series of public consultations with the local Bakyrchik The decommissioning of the old infrastructure, site clearing and study with the inclusion of the estimate of the resources required community with positive outcomes.

This signals the potential to improve on the parameters achieved in the previous test work.
