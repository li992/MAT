Pricing for the first quarter of 2010 was largely based on the annual benchmark price to 31 March 2010 while for the remainder of the year quarterly and six monthly pricing was agreed with the customer base.
Overall Ferrexpo achieved an 88.4% increase in its average DAF FOB price in 2010.
Higher sales volumes and prices resulted in Group revenues almost doubling to US$1.3 billion 2009: US$648.6 million.
In 2010, over 90% of sales volumes from own ore were based on long term volume agreements compared to 70% in 2009 as the Group witnessed a return in demand from its Traditional Markets customer base in 2010.

The Group experienced Net debt reduced by 60% to US$104.4 cost increases from commodities used in the production million as at 31 December 2010 and processing of iron ore such as oil and steel, as well as local PPI inflation of 20.9%.
The C1 cash cost per tonne once more benefited from production at full capacity throughout the period under review.
This allowed for efficient absorption of the fixed cost base which along with the Business Improvement Programme BIP helped mitigate inflationary cost pressures.
As a result, the increase in C1 cash costs was lower than the local PPI inflation rate.
Just over half of the C1 cash costs are denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia.
The Hryvnia remained on average broadly stable in 2010 compared to 2009 at around UAH8.0 to the US Dollar.
Approximately half of Ferrexpos C1 cash costs are energy related.
Electricity tariffs increased by 21.5% in 2010, and diesel cost increases reflected higher oil prices.
Costs for grinding media, which are 10.0% of the C1 cash cost, increased inline with higher steel prices.
The increase in steel prices was more than reflected in higher sales prices for our iron ore pellets during the period under review.
The breakdown of the Groups C1 cash cost is shown in the table on page 28.
Since the inception of the BIP in 2006, the cumulative productivity gains have reduced costs by approximately US$5.27 per tonne of pellets produced, or US$47.6 million Ferrexpo plc 27 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Summary of financial results Year ended Year ended US$ 000 31.12.2010 31.12.2009 Change Revenue 1,294,900 648,667 99% EBITDA 585,297 138,136 324% As % of revenue 45% 21% Profit before taxation 498,126 80,850 516% Income tax 73,002 9,852 641% Profit for the period 425,124 70,998 499% Diluted earnings per share US cents 72.24 12.05 500% Final dividend per share US cents 3.3 3.3 0% to the 31 December 2010.
