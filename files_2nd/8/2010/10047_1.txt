A new chapter 01 In 2010, after more than 150 years of delivering smart engineering for extreme environments, we ushered in a new chapter in Meggitts history.
We engaged in one of the most significant reorganisations we have ever undertaken.
Each of the distinguished companies that make up the group is now becoming a dedicated manufacturing facility, managed under five Meggitt divisions focusing on common technologies and key markets.
At the same time, we launched a radical overhaul of our business processes, standardising our approach across the group.
Together, these initiatives will provide customers with a common experience of Meggitt that enables them to do business with us more easily.
We are equipped as never before to succeed in our fiercely competitive and increasingly dynamic global markets, ensuring that many more chapters will be written in Meggitts history of engineering excellence.
