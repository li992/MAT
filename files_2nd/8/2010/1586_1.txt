Autonomy allows computers to process this information automatically, instead of relying on a human being.
This technology is useful in almost every industry and software sector.
As a result, Autonomy is a rare example of a pure horizontally applicable technology company.
We make technology for use by others, and thus generate high gross and operating margins on behalf of shareholders.
