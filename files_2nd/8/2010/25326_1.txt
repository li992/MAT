1 Net Asset Value NAV as shown above is fair market valuation of the Groups economic interests, calculated utilising 2, adjusted for IPEV International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association discounted cash flow methodology guidelines, a methodology considered appropriate, given the special nature of infrastructure investments.
Estimated future cash 3 flows accruing to each economic interest have been discounted using discount rates that reflect the risks associated with that interest.
The Net Asset Value referred to above and on other pages differs from the basis of recording net assets utilising International Financial Reporting Standards as set out in the balance sheet included in the financial statements.
The key differences are that the IFRS balance sheet includes assets and liabilities valued initially on acquisition at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Further the IFRS net assets have been impacted, amongst other things, by changes in the fair value of financial hedging instruments that are entered into by the Group to minimise risk associated with changes in interest rates.
2 The only current exception to this methodology is with respect to the valuation of the stapled units in RiverCity Motorway project.
These have been valued using the closing share price at 31 December market value.
The Net Asset Value also includes: the Strathclyde and Hereford and Worcester senior debt interests which have been valued at the loan principal outstanding at 31 December plus the costs associated with terminating the underlying fixed interest rate arrangements at 9 November 2006.
Cash, cash equivalents and assets and liabilities attributable to the Company and intermediate holding companies at 31 December.
3 The Groups economic interests at 31 December are set out in the Portfolio Interests section of this annual report and financial statements.
