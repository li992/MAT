However, in summary, those items that are separately presented as exceptional are items which, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order to enable a proper understanding of the financial information.
Those items that are separately presented as specific IAS 39 mark to market movements are those mark to market movements recorded in the consolidated income statement which relate to: derivative contracts into which the Group has entered in order to economically hedge certain of its physical and financial exposures: and fair value gains and losses on equity conversion features embedded within convertible bonds, so as to separately identify a non-cash movement which, if the conversion option is exercised, will ultimately be extinguished by the issue of equity.

Net finance costs Net interest expense at 392 million is 47 million lower than 2009.
This was driven by a reduction in average net debt, mainly as a result of the disposal of the Czech business, and the impact of paying down US$769 million of debt secured on five US merchant plants located in Texas and New England in December 2009, partially offset by increased interest costs in Australia when reported in sterling arising from a strengthening of the Australian dollar.
Foreign exchange The impact of the weakening of sterling on the results of our overseas operations, compared to the same period in 2009, is an increase in EPS of 1.0 pence.
This relates primarily to the translation of profits from Australian dollar operations.
Tax The Group tax charge has decreased by 51 million to 64 million 2009: 115 million.
The effective rate of tax for the year is 16% 2009: 24%.
The tax rate has benefited from a release of deferred tax balances arising from the tax rate reduction in the UK and other jurisdictions and, as in 2009, the tax rate has benefited from the resolution of some historic tax issues.

Good progress has been made on integration and towards the delivery of anticipated synergies, which will also benefit our financial performance in 2011. International Power has a robust financial position with an investment grade credit rating and a cash generative business that is strongly positioned to deliver sustained future growth.
