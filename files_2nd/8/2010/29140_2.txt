MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Message from the Chairman In the 12 months to 31 March 2010, not only did stock markets stage a remarkable recovery from the lows of Spring 2009, Scottish Mortgage also delivered an exceptional performance and more than made up the ground that was lost in the previous year.
In keeping with the long term approach, the five year record is much more relevant than one years individual figures: over five years the share price total return both capital and dividends has been 104% or 15.3% on an annualised basis and the net asset value return 86% 13.2% per annum.
These can be compared to 58% returned on the same basis by the FTSE All World Index.
Experience suggests that Scottish Mortgage shares will be volatile against the comparative index, sometimes considerably so in the short term: Scottish Mortgage does not attempt to track any index but instead strives to deliver to its owners long term absolute and relative returns that are well above average.
The Managers conclude that there is no current shortage of companies with exciting growth prospects.
These are often, but not exclusively, those exposed to domestic growth in countries where wealth is increasing and being spread rapidly.
As ever there is considerable uncertainly about precisely how economies and trade patterns will develop but your Board takes a positive long term view of the global outlook.
