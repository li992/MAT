The first increase in Group gross pro t was seen in Q4 2009 and this trend continued throughout 2010, delivering revenue up 15% in constant currency to 832m and gross pro ts up 24% to 442m.
The recovery has been largely in permanent placements, where we have grown gross pro t 35% in constant currency in the year.
As a result, the proportion of gross pro t from permanent and temporary placements has increased from 71:29 in 2009 to 78:22 in 2010.
As we are a highly operationally geared business and maintained spare capacity following the downturn, the recovery in gross pro ts has dropped rapidly through to operating pro ts, which increased 3.5 times to 71.5m.
With the bene t of the VAT refund of 17.1m and related interest of 11.3m, the pro t before tax for the year was 100m.
Excluding the bene t of the VAT refund, earnings per share increased from 3.9p to 15.1p.
In terms of the cash we generate, the first use of our cash is always to support and grow the business.
Our next priority is the dividend to shareholders, where we aim to either grow or at least maintain the level of dividend payment.
Given the recovery in our pro ts, our strong cash position and our con dence in the future, the Board are recommending an increase in the full year dividend for 2010 of 12.5% to 9.0p.
After dividends and while maintaining a strong balance sheet, we use surplus cash to repurchase shares.
Repurchases made via the employee bene t trust are either to cover share plan commitments or to reduce the dilution of share option awards.
Alternatively, repurchases are made by the company, following which the shares are cancelled.
During 2010, we spent 100m in dividends and share repurchases and still ended the year with a very strong balance sheet with net cash in excess of 80m.
Michael Page International 3 PROFILE OF OUR BUSINESS: Geographical and discipline diversi cation, the foundation of our continued growth GEOGRAPHIC DEVELOPMENT With recruitment being driven by the economic cycle and overall business con dence, our strategy of diversi cation, both by geography and discipline, aims to diversify the Groups exposure away from any one geographic area or business sector.
During 2010, we achieved growth across all our geographic regions, with both the Americas and Asia Paci c having exceeded their previous peaks.
Within each region, different countries reacted in different degrees and timings as their economies and con dence levels recovered.
Being in 29 countries at the end of 2010 and now 32 with businesses opening in India, Malaysia and Chile, we now have the bene t of being in many faster growing economies where outsourced recruitment is relatively new and still developing, it is also where competition is limited.
Today, the UK, which only 10 years ago was more than 50% of the Group is now 26%.
Ten years ago the Americas and Asia Paci c had barely registered: they are now 30% of the Group and growing fast.
Geographic diversi cation achieved by organic growth Reduced dependence on individual geographic markets 32 COUNTRIES 148 OFFICES As at February 2011.
4 Michael Page International OVERVIEW OVERVIEW DISCIPLINE DEVELOPMENT As we have bene ted from our geographical diversi cation we have also bene ted from our discipline diversi cation, as different disciplines reacted in the recovery at different times and to different degrees.
Finance and accounting remains our largest discipline, as it is the heritage of the business and also the discipline we tend to start with when we enter new countries and cities.
As we have diversi ed into an increasing number of professional disciplines today, these now account for over half the Groups gross pro ts.
As well as rolling out our Michael Page disciplines, we continue to invest in Page Personnel, our business focussed on the more junior professional recruitment markets.
Page Personnel is now a global brand, across 19 countries with over a quarter of our fee earners.
At the end of February 2011, the Group had a total of 239 country discipline businesses, up 23 from the start of 2010.
Even within these many disciplines our teams are further specialised, with, for example, businesses such as Michael Page Oil & Gas launched within Engineering and Michael Page Logistics within Supply Chain & Procurement.
Bene ting from discipline diversi cation Discipline roll-out continues with increasing specialisation PAGE PERSONNEL, A GLOBAL BRAND, NOW IN 19 COUNTRIES Michael Page International 5 A BUSINESS STRUCTURE FOR GROWTH: Focus on expanding in faster growing and less-developed markets with limited competition ORGANIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS In order to grow rapidly you have to have the platform or foundations to support it.
We believe we have that, with over 2,100 years of Michael Page Director experience spread over 32 countries.
This ensures we meet the needs of global or international clients and candidates who have increased geographic mobility, with a consistent quality, culture and values worldwide.
With a meritocratically, home-grown, management team it creates a high level of trust, retains our entrepreneurs, as we are constantly launching new businesses, and makes lines of communication clear and simple.
As we go through cycles, we protect the platforms and in downturns invest modestly, increasing the rate of upturns.
Last year our headcount grew by nearly 1000, as we grew existing of ces and countries and launched one new one, Chile.
In the first two months of 2011, headcount is up by a further 258 and we have opened in three new countries, Qatar, Malaysia and India.
Organic development of the business Geographic and discipline diversi cation Protecting and expanding the platform through economic cycles 6 Michael Page International OVERVIEW OVERVIEW MORE THAN 40% OF FEE EARNERS OPERATE IN LESS DEVELOPED, HIGH GROWTH RECRUITMENT MARKETS POSITIONED FOR GROWTH Our growth is organic, but strategically as well as growing existing business, our objective is to expand into less developed recruitment markets where, as a result, competition is far more limited.
Many of these markets are emerging economies and are growing far faster than established ones, such as the UK.
Only 10 years ago, 58% of our gross pro t came from the most developed and competitive Australian and UK markets, whereas only 9% was from the least developed and least competitive markets.
Our ability to grow fastest is naturally where markets have the potential to develop and where competition is weakest.
At the end of February 2011, we have 41%, or to be precise 1,345, of our fee earners in these higher potential markets and that gure is growing fast.
Our track record of growth in this underdeveloped category is over 40% compound annual growth rate of gross pro t. In 2010, it was 46%.
Focus on expanding in faster growing and less-developed recruitment markets with limited competition More than 40% of fee earners now in these markets Michael Page International 7 DEVELOPING LATIN AMERICA: Market leading business representing nearly 10% of Group gross pro t In 10 years, we have organically grown a market leading business All of this has, and continues to be, achievable because of the strength across four countries, 14 of ces, with a headcount of 448 that and depth of our Michael Page management experience in the region.

In addition, many more managers and consultants are transferred around in a similar way, helping with their career development and retention.
This movement of talent has continued so that we could exploit new markets, such as India, and where we needed to strengthen management teams, such as Holland.
We believe this strength and depth of Michael Page management experience in each of the regions in which we operate is the key factor that has enabled us to achieve what we have and it gives us the con dence that we can achieve a lot more.
CHILE Michael Page launched its new business in Santiago, Chile with the Finance, Financial Services, Marketing and Sales disciplines in January 2011 and is the first specialised recruitment rm in the market.
Chile is ranked as one of the safest offshore locations in the world, with a world-class telecommunications infrastructure and high uptake of higher-level education.
Having gauged and ful lled client requirements through a team based elsewhere in the region, in late 2010 demand reached appropriate levels for Michael Page to deploy a local presence to further service the growing need for professional specialist recruitment.
