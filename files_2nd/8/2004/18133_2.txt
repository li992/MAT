FRS19 requires a tax provision to be made in respect of capital allowances to the extent that they are not covered by available tax losses brought forward.
In practice we consider it likely that the benefit of these capital allowances will continue to be available whether or not the properties are sold in the future.
The Board has complied with pronouncements from the APB, ASB and Listing Authority in showing NAV and Earnings per share including the FRS19 provision with equal prominence to the adjusted figures.
The effect of FRS 19 has been excluded from those statistics that are described as adjusted, a reconciliation of which is set out on the final page of this document.
