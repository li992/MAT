Cairns vision was that Rajasthan had the potential for the discovery of in place reserves of several billion barrels of oil.
Our focus was to capture as high an equity position as possible in the area and our competitive edge was to absolutely concentrate and dedicate all our top resources into the dream.
By constantly being out of step with conventional thinking, encouraging diversity of opinion, and recognising failure as a piece of the jigsaw towards success, Cairn has opened up a major new hydrocarbon province.
