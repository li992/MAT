2004 was, by any measure, a remarkable year for Tullow.
The Group more than doubled in size, driven largely by the acquisition of Energy Africa in May.
This acquisition, combined with sustained high oil and gas prices and good operational performance throughout the business, allowed the Group to deliver a strong set of results in terms of growth, profits and development.
The key 2004 figures may be summarised as follows: Turnover up 74% to 225.3 million 2003: 129.6 million Operating profit before exploration activities up 88% to 83.2 million 2003: 44.3 million Basic earnings per share up 112% to 6.18 pence per share 2003: 2.92 pence per share Dividend per share up 75% to 1.75 pence per share 2003: 1.0 pence per share Operating cash flow up 82% to 154.3 million 2003: 85.0 million Working interest reserves amounted to 173 mmboe 2003: 70 mmboe.
Tullow consolidated Energy Africa with effect from 28 May and, had Energy Africa been included for the full year, pro-forma turnover for 2004 would have been of the order of 310 million.
PROGRESSIVE DIVIDEND POLICY Tullow paid a dividend of 1.0 pence per share for 2003.
The Groups policy is to maintain a progressive dividend, that reflects both the cash generated by the business and the capital investment and acquisition opportunities available.
A final dividend of 1.25 pence per share is being recommended by the Board which, following an interim dividend of 0.5 pence per share, brings the total dividend for the year to 1.75 pence per share.
