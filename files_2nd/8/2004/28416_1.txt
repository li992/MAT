The directors believe that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
Profit on ordinary activities and basic earnings per share include these items together with actual investment returns.
This basis of presentation has been adopted consistently throughout these financial statements.
Earnings per share and dividend per share figures for 2003 have been restated to take account of the Rights Issue in 2004.
In addition, the achieved profits and statutory basis shareholders funds for 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the implementation of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
