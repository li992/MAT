Business review Business Highlights Strategy 2 Adjusted profit margin 18.5% We are now two and a half years into the transformation 2013 and growth strategy announced in 2011.
This strategy has 2012 16.5% two main priorities: continued strong growth and increased efficiency.
These priorities are underpinned by a series of initiatives to transform the business, ensuring it is best placed to enhance client service, meet regulatory demands and generate shareholder returns.
To improve shareholder returns and value, we have added two further strategic priorities: Discretionary funds 21.3bn 1 ensuring we maintain sufficient capital to deliver our 2013 strategy: and 2012 18.2bn 2 aligning dividend growth with underlying earnings.
This year we announced a new operating margin target of 25%, which we aim to achieve by the end of the financial year 2016.
Total managed funds 28.2bn 2013 Capital 2012 25.9bn We successfully raised 38.6m through an equity placing in May 2013 to improve our capital strength and investment capacity.
This will allow us to accelerate the strategy, capitalise on our competitive position and drive future growth in earnings and shareholder returns.
