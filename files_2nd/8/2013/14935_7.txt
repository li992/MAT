Ben Whawell I Chief Financial Officer I 16 May 2013 Stobart Group Annual Report 2013 15 Case Study I Stobart Automotive As part of Stobart Groups ongoing plan to evaluate and invest in methods of improving customer service and operating efficiency, an opportunity has been identified to develop a semitrailer car transporter for use on certain operations.
We have worked with several manufacturers to contribute to the design of a trailer that can be pulled by any Stobart tractor unit.
Key advantages include: The improved aerodynamic characteristics of the semi-trailer gives improved fuel efficiency compared to more traditional car transporter designs, not only reducing operating costs but also cutting carbon emissions.
The loading process is greatly simplified and speeded up so, despite a reduced load from 11 cars to around 6-8, the operational efficiencies result in greater overall capacity of the transporter fleet, allowing us to meet the peaks of customer demand.
The ability to easily switch the transporter tractor units allows us to replace them within our usual three year tractor life, enabling this fleet to benefit from the reliability and efficiency that the rest of the Stobart fleet enjoys.
