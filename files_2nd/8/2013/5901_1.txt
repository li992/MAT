The first half of the financial year saw a robust response by both ECS and AEP to difficult trading conditions in certain key markets.
Our financial performance recovered strongly in the second half of the year as conditions showed some signs of improvement.
Fenner is well positioned as we enter our 2014 financial year, with the benefit of the investments made in both divisions over recent years, a strong financial position and a mixed but generally improving global economic environment.
Overall, we continue to expect that the current financial year will see a return to growth.
