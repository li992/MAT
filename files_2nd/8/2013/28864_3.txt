RBS at a glance 11 We must become a company that knows what it means to obsess about our customers.
This is a fundamental challenge that will involve the whole organisation.
RBS at a glance RBS is rooted in the UK, serving personal, business and institutional customers in the UK and many other countries.
Our businesses are strong players in the markets in which we choose to compete.
The businesses are stronger together than apart, to the benefit of customers and shareholders.
RBS is now safer and the day when we will be able to offer shareholders a decent return is closer.
But making RBS a really good bank demands more.
That is why we are still investing more effort in all of our businesses to serve customers well.
