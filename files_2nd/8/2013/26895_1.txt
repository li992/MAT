Financial Highlights Net asset value per Earnings per ordinary Dividend Yield ordinary share share 466.5p 22.9p 23.2p 5.6% 2012 402.1p 2012 22.0p 2012 23.0p 2012 6.3% 16.0 % 4.1% 0.9% Investment Policy The companys investment performance is assessed by comparison with other investment trusts within the UK Growth and Income sector.
Performance is benchmarked against the FTSE 100 Index, reflecting the emphasis within the portfolio.
Gearing The companys policy is to remain substantially fully invested.
The company has the facility to gear borrow money with the objective of enhancing future returns.
Historically, the gearing has been in the form of long term, fixed-rate debentures.
The board monitors the level of gearing and makes decisions on the appropriate action based on the advice of the manager and the future prospects of the companys portfolio.
The companys authorised borrowing powers set out in the Articles of Association state that the companys borrowings may not exceed its called up share capital and reserves.
In normal market conditions, it is unlikely that gearing borrowings as a percentage of net assets will exceed 35%.
Risk Diversification The company will aim to achieve a spread of investments, with no single investment representing more than 15% of assets.
The company will seek to diversify its portfolio into at least five market sectors, with no one sector comprising more than 35% of the portfolio.
