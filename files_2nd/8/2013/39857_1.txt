CHARING CROSS ROAD REGENT STREET TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD Shaftesbury at a glance 04 London s West End, where all our investments are located, has a renowned concentration ofworld-class historic and cultural attractions together with an unrivalled variety of shops, restaurants, cafs, bars and clubs which bring huge numbers of domestic and international visitors.
It is also an important location for businesses, particularly those in the media, creative and IT industries, and a popular place tolive.
Shopping and leisure are important elements of the local economy, serving visitors as well as the local working population and residents.
In the West End, there is a long history of occupier demand exceeding the availability of these uses, which is often restricted by planning policies and space constraints.
Consequently, we focus on central locations and buildings where the predominant uses are retail and leisure-related.
These elements now provide 70% of our current income.
