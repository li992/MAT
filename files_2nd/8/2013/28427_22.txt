Remuneration report Our executive remuneration at a glance Prudential plc Annual Report 2013 93 What 2013 performance means for executive directors pay At Prudential, the remuneration packages are designed to ensure a strong alignment between pay and performance.
As you can see from the charts on page 90, sustained growth across all of our key performance metrics has delivered substantial value to our shareholders.
This has been reflected in both the annual bonuses paid and the release of long-term incentive awards, as set out in the annual report on remuneration.
In particular, the long-term incentives awarded to executive directors in 2011 had stretching performance conditions attached to vesting and were denominated in shares.
The significant value generated for shareholders through share price growth and dividends paid over the last three years is, therefore, reflected in the value of the LTIP releases, together with the achievement of performance conditions, as illustrated in the chart below.
