Electra Partners has delivered a total return, including favourable currency movements, of 222 million on Electras investment portfolio, an increase of 26% for the year.
Electra Partners deal flow continues to grow with the improving economic outlook and the gradual contraction of competition from other private equity funds.
With a flexible investment strategy, a sound capital base and substantial cash resources, Electra is well positioned for future growth.
Commenting on Electras position, Hugh Mumford, Managing Partner of Electra Partners, said: Electras flexible investment strategy has once again proved to be key to its continued success.
The ability to adapt to market conditions has allowed Electra to make a record level of new investment in the year at attractive pricing levels, despite a challenging market.
Electra has also been able to take advantage of strong demand for high-quality assets to achieve a number of major realisations during the year.
The high level of recent realisations has reduced the maturity of the investment portfolio.
Despite this we expect to continue to add value growth in the short term through our strategy of purchasing at discounted values as well as in the longer term through investing in growth.
