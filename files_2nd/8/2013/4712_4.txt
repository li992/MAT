As a result of this change, Diageo reports the following geographical segments both for management reporting purposes and in the external financial statements: North America: Western Europe: Africa, Eastern Europe and Turkey: Latin America and Caribbean: Asia Pacific: and Corporate.
Diageo has also made changes in respect of the allocation of specific corporate items and the allocation of the operating profit before exceptional items of Global Supply, to better reflect the geographical segment to which the cost relates.
