Financial Highlights Financial Highlights On 30 March 2007 the Group Board announced the proposed Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange of a majority interest in Brokerage, to be renamed MF Global.
The IPO is expected to take place in the third calendar quarter of 2007, subject to shareholder approval and market conditions remaining favourable.
As a result, Brokerage has been reclassified as a discontinued operation in these financial statements.
Following the IPO, and subject to shareholder approval, the net proceeds will be distributed to shareholders in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.
Also at this time the Board will inform shareholders of the appropriate changes to the Groups capital management and distribution policy.
