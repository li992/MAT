24 Key performance indicators and financial highlights KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Key performance indicators KPIs We use a range of performance indicators, both financial and non-financial, to measure the delivery of the Companys strategic objective growth in shareholder value through the efficient operation, financing, and trading of output from our power generation fleet, whilst maintaining the highest levels of safety and environmental performance and to manage the business.
The most important of these measures are considered KPIs and their targets are determined annually during the business planning process.
The KPIs are used by management to compare actual performance during the year, and the latest monthly forecasts, against the annual budgeted targets.
Our KPIs, both financial and non-financial, are set out below.

Reportable environmental incidents Technical availability The environment and how we care for it is central Technical availability measures when a plant is to the business of International Power.
We have available for dispatch.
Each of our plants will generally always had a policy of complying with all applicable be unavailable during some periods in the year due to environmental regulations.
Our power plants are a combination of planned outages for maintenance issued with environmental licences by the relevant and unplanned outages due to operational problems.
Environmental licences require that any environmental incident is reported.

planning is a key factor in this regard.
The year-toyear variance in the profile of planned outages influences both the achieved and targeted availability.
In 2007 we achieved technical availability of 90%, an increase above the 89.6% achieved in 2006.
Taking account of the outage plans for 2008 it is appropriate to set a target of 90% for the plant portfolio.

28 Key performance indicators and financial highlights Financial highlights The financial information included in the consolidated financial statements has been prepared on the basis of all applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
A discussion of the policies we believe to be most critical in considering the impact of estimates and judgements on the Groups financial position and results of operations are set out on pages 58 to 60.
In order to allow a full understanding of the financial information presented within the consolidated financial statements, and specifically the Groups underlying business performance, the Group presents its income statement such that it separately identifies: the results excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements: the effect of the exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements: the total result.
The basis of preparation is outlined more fully in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 106.
However, in summary, those items that the Group separately presents as exceptional are items which, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence in order to enable a proper understanding of the financial information.
Those items that the Group separately present as specific IAS 39 mark to market movements are those mark to market movements recorded in the income statement which relate to: derivative contracts into which the Group has entered in order to economically hedge certain of its physical and financial exposures: and fair value gains and losses on equity conversion features embedded within convertible bonds, so as to separately identify a non-cash movement which, if the conversion option is exercised, will ultimately be extinguished by the issue of equity.
A summary of the Groups financial performance during the year is as follows: Income statement Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 m m Excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements: Revenue including joint ventures and associates 3,872 3,645 Profit from operations from subsidiaries 718 565 from joint ventures and associates 186 208 Profit from operations 904 773 Interest 308 248 Profit before tax 596 525 Tax 113 122 Profit for the year 483 403 Minority interests 77 71 Profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 406 332 Earnings per share basic 27.1p 22.4p Including exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements: Profit from operations 518 898 Profit for the year 529 477 Profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 503 410 Earnings per share basic 33.6p 27.6p International Power Annual Report 2007 29 Cash flow Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 m m Profit for the year 529 477 1 Depreciation, amortisation and other movements 515 322 Dividends received from joint ventures and associates 145 113 Capital expenditure maintenance 71 128 Purchase of intangible assets 48 Movements in working capital 4 15 Tax and net interest paid 413 313 Free cash flow 653 456 1 Depreciation, amortisation and other movements include income statement charges for interest, tax, depreciation, specific IAS 39 mark to market movements and the share of profit of joint ventures and associates.

Earnings per share EPS 2007 EPS excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements at 27.1p is 21% ahead of 2006.
This increase principally reflects those items discussed under the heading profit from operations and also reflects an increase in interest expense offset by a reduction in tax expense both of which are discussed on page 54.

This increase was driven by full year contributions from Coleto Creek, Levanto, Tihama and Indian Queens, together with strong profitability of the UK assets.
In addition, dividends from associates and joint ventures increased year-on-year by 32 million.
Maintenance capital expenditure was also 57 million lower than in 2006.
This was partially offset by an increase in net interest and tax payments of 100 million, mainly as a result of acquisitions.
Free cash flow was also enhanced by working capital reductions, including reduced margining and investment deposits with counterparties.

Dividend During the year, the Board introduced the payment of an interim dividend.
The interim dividend of 2.77 pence per Ordinary Share, was paid to shareholders on 30 October 2007.
This interim dividend was calculated on a fixed percentage 35% of the previous years full year dividend.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 7.39 pence per share, bringing the full year dividend to 10.16 pence per share 2006: 7.9p, an increase of 29% year-on-year and representing a pay-out ratio of 37.5% of EPS pre-exceptional and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements.
This increase is in line with the Groups policy of progressively moving towards a dividend pay-out ratio of 40%.
Payment of this final dividend to shareholders registered on the Company share register on 23 May 2008 is due to be made on 26 June 2008, following approval at the 2008 AGM, which will be held on 13 May 2008.
Outlook We believe 2008 will be another year of growth after taking into account reduced output at Rugeley due to the fitting of FGD equipment, lower UK coal spreads, and in the US subdued summer spark spreads following the cool summer in 2007.
We remain well positioned to finance and deliver on organic and acquisition growth opportunities across our international portfolio.
