Through focus, and by concentrating on prime West London industrials, we have demonstrated rental growth of 5.0% and a capital surplus of 0.7% over the year, with a higher volume of lettings and a reduction in underlying vacancies.
We remain confident with our positioning at this stage in the economic cycle and the prospects for the business going forward.
