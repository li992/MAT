Results bases The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the European Embedded Value Principles issued by the CFO Forum of European Insurance Companies in May 2004 and expanded by the Additional Guidance on EEV disclosures published in October 2005.
The basis of preparation of statutory IFRS basis results and supplementary IFRS basis information is consistent with that applied for the 2006 results and financial statements.
Operating profit based on longer-term investment returns Consistent with previous reporting practice, the Group analyses its EEV basis results and provides supplementary analysis of IFRS profit before tax attributable to shareholders, so as to distinguish operating profit based on longer-term investment returns from other elements of total profit.
On both the EEV and IFRS bases, operating earnings per share are calculated using operating profits from continuing operations based on longer-term investment returns, after related tax and minority interests.
These profits exclude short-term fluctuations in investment returns and the shareholders' share of actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
Under the EEV basis, where additional profit and loss effects arise, operating profit based on longer-term investment returns also excludes the mark to market value movements on core borrowings and the effect of changes in economic assumptions and changes in the time value of cost of options and guarantees arising from changes in economic factors.
After adjusting for related tax and minority interests, the amounts for these items are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share.
Discontinued operations The results for continuing operations shown above and throughout this preliminary announcement exclude those in respect of discontinued banking operations.
On 1 May 2007, the Company sold Egg.
Accordingly, the presentation of the comparative results for 2006 has been adjusted from those published in March 2007.
