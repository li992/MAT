Both are world leaders in their chosen spheres.
Spirax Sarco at a glance As a heat source, steam is the natural choice in many industrial processes due to its high heat-carrying capacity, controllability, sterility and eciency as a heat transfer medium.
The specialist knowledge within the Spirax Sarco business enables us to apply our products to improve the eciency of our customers process heating, thereby improving the output of the process or reducing running costs, most notably energy consumption, helping to relieve the pressures on the environment.
Similarly, the unique properties of peristaltic pumps make them ideal for dicult pumping applications.
They are highly accurate and controllable, and virtually maintenance-free making them a very cost-eective solution.
Watson-Marlow Bredel are specialists not only in the manufacture of the best and most advanced peristaltic pumps but also in the application of those pumps to customers processes, the objective being to improve the performance of the end users plant.
The peristaltic pumping market is a small part of the global pumping market but it is also one of the fastest growing parts.
It is important that we make the specialised knowledge of our two businesses easily available to our customers so that they can improve the performance of their processes.
We do this through extensive training courses and through our highly trained force of over 1,100 direct sales and Steam service engineers worldwide who build long-term Natural choice in most industries relationships with our customers.
We also provide Most ecient and eective heat transfer extensive technical literature and our websites medium include comprehensive commercial, technical and Carries large amounts of heat energy educational material which is widely used within Generated from range of fuels - gas, oil, waste industry.
materials or waste heat Flows naturally from high pressure to low Our business is spread very broadly across the pressure globe and across virtually all manufacturing Very controllable temperature proportional to industries.
No industrial sector makes up more pressure than 10% of Group sales and no individual Environmentally friendly customer represents more than 1% of the Groups Clean and sterile sales.
Peristaltic Pumps Our sales engineers are trained to understand Pump of first choice where uid is: applications in a comprehensive range of - abrasive, corrosive or aggressive industries, to analyse customer problems and then - sensitive, valuable or pure to supply the solution through the application of - delicate and must not be degraded our products.
Over many years both our businesses Contamination free pumping have expanded the range of products through Virtually maintenance free - no seals, check both in-house development and acquisitions: we valves, diaphragms or rotors are well placed to be able to address any problems Accurate and reproducible ow faced by customers in their respective steam and Highly controllable peristaltic pump-using processes.
