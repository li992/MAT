3 See note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Loss earnings per share.
Earnings per American Depository Share ADS is calculated by multiplying earnings per ordinary share by ten, the number of ordinary shares per ADS.
Dividend per ADS is calculated on the same basis.
4 2005 net loss includes the cumulative effect of accounting changes related to intangible assets and post employment benefits that increase net loss by 6,372 million or 9.63p per ordinary share.
5 The final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2007 was proposed by the directors on 29 May 2007.
6 For the purposes of calculating these ratios, earnings consist of profit before tax adjusted for fixed charges, dividend income from associated undertakings, share of profits and losses from associated undertakings and profits and losses on ordinary activities before taxation from discontinued operations.
Fixed charges comprise one-third of payments under operating leases, representing the estimated interest element of these payments, interest payable and similar charges and preferred share dividends.
7 The deficits for the 2003 and 2004 financial years are presented on the same basis as the Form 20-F for the year ended 31 March 2004.
These deficits have not been restated for the effect of discontinued operations, because the UK GAAP information, which forms the basis of the US GAAP information presented, has not been restated.
Even if any such adjustments were made, it is expected that the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would still show a deficit.
