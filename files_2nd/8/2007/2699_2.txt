2 Cadbury Schweppes believes that underlying profit from operations, underlying profit before tax, underlying earnings and underlying per share provide additional information on underlying trends to shareowners.
The term underlying is not a defined term under IFRS, and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements of profit see Note 1 y, page 94.
3 In 2006 EPS is presented on a basic total group basis including earnings contributed by Europe and South Africa Beverages.
