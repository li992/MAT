Following the successful integration of Makro into the Group and a period of strong cash generation, the Board implemented a capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share at a cost of approximately 61m in July 2014.
Given the continued successful development of the Group, the Board is proposing a second capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share at a cost of approximately 62m, based on the current issued share capital of the Company.
It is again proposed that this is achieved by the issue of a new class of B shares which shareholders will be able to redeem for cash.
The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2015.
Further details of the proposed return of capital will be set out in a circular to shareholders which will accompany the notice convening this years Annual General Meeting.
We currently anticipate returning a similar amount to shareholders in July 2016 and will provide an update on this at the 2016 Final Results announcement in May 2016 in light of circumstances prevailing at that time.
