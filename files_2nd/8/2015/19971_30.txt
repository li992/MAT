The annual bonus was based on two elements: 75% on operating profit and 25% on individual objectives.
Operating profit 2015 operating profit of 291.4m was below the threshold of 300.6m and therefore none of the operating profit element of bonus was payable.
Individual objectives despite strong performance against individual objectives, as the Group did not meet the threshold level of operating profit nobonus was payable.

Half of the award was based on relative TSR performance and the other half on a cumulative EPS target.

EPS: Aggregate EPS of 83.4p over the period 20132015 was below the target range of 89.0p to 99.3p and therefore the EPS element lapses.
