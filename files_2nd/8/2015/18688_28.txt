106 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration policy for Executive Directors Policy overview Salary Lower Quartile Fixed Pension to Compensation Median Benefits Median Total to Upper Quartile Cash bonus A EIP Performance Share award Upper Quartile Based Compensation Matching B Restricted C The maximum that can be paid to each Director is up to the median position for the Fixed Compensation elements and the Upper Quartile position for the Performance Based Compensation against the Comparator Group The Committee encourages executives to perform to the highest of their abilities through a strong bias on Performance Based Compensation The Committee benchmarks compensation against comparable companies Comparator Group, which currently consists of: Actavis Endo International Pacira Pharmaceuticals Actelion Genus Perrigo Akorn Pharmaceuticals Impax Laboratories Qiagen Alexion Pharmaceuticals Jazz Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Alkermes Lonza Group Salix Pharmaceuticals Almirall Medicines Company UCB Biogen Idec Merck KGaA United Therapeutics Biomarin Pharmaceutical Mylan Vertex Pharmaceuticals Celgene Myriad Genetics Cubist Pharmaceuticals Novozymes Acquired merged during 2015.
The Committee has within the policy the discretion to amend this Comparator Group, but did not do so during the year.
The criteria taken into account when selecting the current Comparator Group included: - Type of pharmaceutical specialism - International nature of Hikmas operations - International nature of the executive team - Market capitalisation and turnover - Number of employees - Consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry affecting the number of comparable companies - UK listing environment The Committee is cognisant of the limitations of benchmarking.
While it forms the upper limit of compensation, other factors are taken into account when determining awards and rises The Comparator Group is used to assess the Total Shareholder Return TSR of Hikma in relation to the performance target for the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP 107 HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Remuneration report Continued New UK Combined Code The Committee is comfortable that its policy is in line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code applying for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2014.
The following table sets out the key elements of the revised Code and how the Companys remuneration policy for Executive Directors is in line with the Code: Code provision Remuneration policy solution Executive Directors The EIP contains three Elements: remuneration should - Element A is a cash based bonus be designed to promote - Element B provides a rolling deferral in shares for two years and an ongoing the long-term success of performance based risk adjustment the Company.
- Element C provides shares subject to a three-year vesting period - 50% of shares earned under Elements B and C cannot be sold for five years from the date of award It is the Committees view that the EIP provides a holistic approach to ensuring Executive Directors are focused on the long-term success of the Company.
Schemes should include The EIP includes best practice malus and clawback provisions.
The circumstances provisions that would enable in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows: the Company to recover sums - Discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited paid or withhold the payment consolidated accounts of the Company of any sum, and specify the - The assessment of any performance target or condition in respect of an award circumstances in which it to be based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information would be appropriate to do so.
- The discovery that any information used to determine the number of shares subject to an award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information - Action or conduct of an award holder which, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to employee misbehaviour, fraud or gross misconduct - Events or behaviour of an award holder have led to the censure of the Company by a regulatory authority or have had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group Company provided that the Board is satisfied that the relevant award holder was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to him Malus will apply up to the date of the determination of the award and clawback will apply for three years from the date of payment and the vesting of awards.
The Committee is comfortable that the rules of the Plans provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback if required.
For share-based remuneration, The policy contains the following relevant features: the Remuneration Committee - Minimum shareholding requirement of 300% of salary for the should consider requiring Executive Directors Directors to hold a minimum - Five-year period from award to sale for 50% of Elements B and C of the number of shares and to hold EIP which continues to apply following cessation of employment shares for a further period after vesting or exercise, including The Committee, therefore, believes that its policy is in line with best practice.

108 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Policy implementation 2016 Comparator Group With the exception of Actavis, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Genus and Salix Pharmaceuticalswhich ceased to be independent companies, the Comparator Group is unchanged since the prior year.
Salaries During 2015, the Committee undertook the annual benchmarking of executive packages.
The Committee reviewed the data and concluded the executives should receive the same salary rise as the average employee of 3% for 2016.
Salary Increase Executive Director 2016 2015 % Chief Executive $1,236,000 $1,200,000 3% Vice Chairman $696,267 $675,987 3% Benefits and pension No change from 2015.
Executive Incentive Plan EIP During 2016, the EIP will be operated on the same basis as 2015, as described in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 110 and 115 to 117.
The performance conditions and their weighting, which are unchanged, are set out below: Weighting % of maximum subject Forfeiture Threshold Target percentage Maximum to performance percentage of percentage of of element of percentage of Performance condition condition element of award element of award award element of award Profit Before Tax 50% 0% 25% 50% 100% Strategy 40% 0% 25% 50% 100% Personal 10% 0% 25% 50% 100% lose 50% of outstanding Element B and C 109 HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Remuneration report Continued For each performance condition the Committee has established measurement criteria which determine the level of reward that executives may receive: Performance condition Performance level Description Measurement Forfeiture Threshold Target Max Profit Before Budget Budget 30% Budget 10% Budget Budget 10% Tax - Generics division expansion Acquisition - Strengthening and Product approvals broadening our Bedford transfer product portfolio - Maintaining high-quality and efficient manufacturing FDA approval for facilities to maximise key facilities profitability New strategic No strategic Some strategic Most strategic All strategic - Expanding partnerships partnerships development targets met targets met targets met Strengthen within core markets - Consolidate MENA Manage environmental factors - Developing a highly skilled, Employee satisfaction No personal Some personal Most personal All personal Personal effective and diverse workforce survey development targets met targets met targets met 0% award lose 100% 250% 400% Performance Remuneration Outcome Total 50% prior two award award award years shares Element A 0% 25% 100% 150% Outcome breakdown Element B 0% 25% 100% 150% Element C 0% 50% 50% 100% The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity of the detailed financial, operational and strategic targets used for the EIP, disclosing precise targets for the EIP in advance would not be in shareholders interests.
This avoids the risk of the Company inadvertently giving international competitors an unfair advantage because they are not required to report to the same disclosure standard as a UK listed company.
Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made are published at the end of the performance period in order that shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the EIP.
110 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Illustration of policy The following charts show the value of each of the main elements of the compensation package provided to the Executive Directors during 2015 and the potential available for 2016 dependent upon performance.
Elements A, B and C of the EIP are made in the year after the performance is achieved i. e. for the 2016 illustration, awards will be made in 2017 and Elements B and C vest in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Please note that the Remuneration and performance summary on page 105 uses share awards vesting i. e. actual shares received, not those granted during the period.
111 HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Remuneration report Continued Non-Executive fees The Board has determined that the basic fees for the Non-Executive Directors will be increased by 3% in line with the general salary rises for employees in the Group.
The Committee membership and chairmanship fees are unchanged.
Advice and support  LLP PwC have provided independent advice to the Remuneration Committee since the listing of Hikma and during the year under review.

The total fees for advice to the Committee during the year were $138k 2014: $90k.
PwC adheres to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, which provides a clear framework for our relationship with our advisers while setting high professional standards.
The Committee reviewed the performance of PwC during the year and the fees received.
The Committee concluded that PwC remained independent and continued to provide high-quality service to the Committee.
During 2015, the Company undertook an audit tender process that led the Board to recommend the appointment of PwC as auditors with effect from 12 May 2016.
The Board requires the auditors to minimise non-audit services and noted that remuneration services are prohibited under legislation that is to come into force.
Therefore, PwC would not be able to provide advice to the Committee once they became auditors.
Accordingly, Michael Ashton Chair and Dr Pamela Kirby Chair designate led a tender process for remuneration advice.
The conclusion of this process was that Willis Towers Watsonshould be appointed to conduct remuneration advice going forward.
The Committee thanks PwC for their commitment and diligence and welcomed Willis Towers Watson to Hikma.
The Committee seeks the assistance of senior management on matters relating to policy performance and remuneration and maintains a strong link with management to ensure that its deliberations are fully informed.
The Committee ensures that no Director, executive or employee takes part in discussions or advice relating to his own remuneration or benefits.
Shareholder approval The Committee actively seeks the engagement of shareholders in the setting of remuneration policy and practice.

In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Investment Association of British Insurers, Hikma can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten-year period to employees under all its share plans and a maximum of 5% of this 10% for discretionary share plans.
The following table summarises the current level of dilution resulting from Company share plans following the Listing of Hikma in 2005: Granted in a rolling ten-year Granted during Type of plan period the year Discretionary Share Plans 5% Limit 3.87% 0.32% Equity position of the Directors & Executive Management The Committee believes that its share ownership policy strongly links executive and shareholders interests.
All Executive Directors are required to build and maintain a minimum shareholding equal to three times base salary.
The limits under and compliance with this policy are reviewed periodically by the Committee.
The table below demonstrates that the target shareholdings as a percentage of salary were met in full by the Executive Directors.

Said Darwazah 300% 38,200% Yes Mazen Darwazah 300% 37,300% Yes Share ownership requirements also apply to Hikma executive management who are required to build and maintain a minimum shareholding equal to at least two times base salary.
In certain cases the shareholding requirement has been increased in order to reflect local executive remuneration practice.
Compliance with the shareholding requirement is measured annually at the time of this report.
Executive managements shareholdings as a percentage of salary were: Requirement Date Requirement Lowest Highest Average Total shares fulfilled?

Element C of the EIP has been excluded from the table because it does not qualify as a scheme interest defined in the Regulations due to the performance period being a single year.
The LTIP and Element B of the EIP have been included because they have performance periods of three years and one year plus a two-year forfeiture condition, respectively: Vested but Exercised Type of interest Performance measures unexercised during the year Director Shares Share options Yes No Said Darwazah 233,000 206,000 27,000 97,000 Mazen Darwazah 149,000 129,000 20,000 65,000 Robert Pickering Breffni Byrne Michael Ashton Ali Al-Husry Ronald Goode Pat Butler Dr Pamela Kirby Jochen Gann John Castellani Remuneration table The following table sets out the total remuneration, including amounts vesting under short-term and long-term incentive plans, for each financial period in respect of the Directors holding the positions of Chief Executive and Vice Chairman.
Important note: The total figures for the financial years 2015 and 2014 are higher due to the change from a LTIP award subject to future performance to an EIP based on prior year performance.
In accordance with the Regulations, the 2014 and 2015 totals include LTIPs vesting during the relevant period which were granted three years before and Element C of the EIP which was granted in respect of the relevant period.
The Regulations require Element C to be treated as a cash bonus, although it is an award of shares that will not vest for three years after grant.
The final LTIP awards vest in 2017, after which point the totals in the above table will include Element C only.

External appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector and not-for-profit appointments, and that these can broaden the experience, network and knowledge of the Director, from which Hikma can benefit.
Executive Directors may accept external appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest and are allowed to retain any fees.
During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of $10,000 2014: $10,000 and $10,000 2014: $10,000 respectively relating to external appointments which are detailed in their Director profiles on page 69.
The process for controlling these appointments is described in the governance statement on page 78.
Closing statement We have continued to develop our approach to remuneration reporting this year and the Committee hopes that this has aided your understanding of our remuneration policy and practices.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or observations.
