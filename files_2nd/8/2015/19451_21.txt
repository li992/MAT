Further details on LTIP vesting Based on the performance assessment above, combined with the excellent sustained share price growth over the period, the 2013 LTIP awards to the CEO and CFO may vest to the following extent on 5 May 2016 for performance over the completed three-year period: 4 Interests Exercise Vesting Interests Share Estimated 1 CEO Awards held price % vesting price value Shares 205,643 n a 164,514 62.19 10,231,126 80% Options 411,286 38.06 329,028 62.19 7,939,446 CFO Awards Shares 46,270 n a 37,016 62.19 2,302,025 2 Options 704 42.61 80%3 704 62.19 13,784 Options 91,816 41.44 73,312 62.19 1,521,224 Audited 1.
As the share price on the date of vesting is unknown at the time of reporting, the value is estimated using the average market value over the last quarter of 2015 of 62.19.
The actual value at vesting will be disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report.
The share option award made to Adrian Hennah in February 2013 included 704 options awarded under a HMRC approved option scheme.
As set out in last years Annual Report, following the demerger of Indivior PLC exercise prices of outstanding share option awards were adjusted.
The exception to this was the HMRC approved options, for which the exercise price remained unchanged.
The vesting percentage shown is the total vesting percentage of an award.
Under the vesting schedule of awards, the vesting percentage applies to the combined total amount of an award which may be split into HMRC approved and unapproved parts.
Where a portion of an award has been granted under the HMRC approved part of the scheme, those shares are counted first when assessing the vested number of shares.
Compound average annual growth in adjusted EPS was 8.1% p. a over the performance period, when measured on actual currency basis.
The Committee therefore determined vesting in line with vesting schedule at 80%.

EPS is measured on an adjusted diluted basis, as shown in the Groups Financial Statements, as this provides an independently verifiable measure of performance.
However, the Remuneration Committee maintains the discretion to make adjustments to the measure if this is considered to be appropriate.
Any adjustments will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Awards granted in December 2015 will vest on the following schedule, which requires significant compound annual growth in EPS in order for the awards to vest, as follows: EPS CAAG 6% 6% Between 6% and 10% 10% Equivalent to three year EPS growth of 19.1% 19.1% 33.1% Proportion of awards vesting % Nil 20% Straight-line vesting between 20% and 100% 100% Adrian Hennah also received an award of share options under the all employee sharesave scheme.

In particular we consulted our major Shareholders, and taking into account feedback provided, are proposing changes to the Remuneration Policy, to further align executives with Shareholders.
The Committee believes our remuneration packages are simple, reinforce our remuneration philosophy and drive a strong alignment between executives and the interests of our Shareholders.
The requirement for Senior Executives to build up significant shareholdings in the Company ensures this alignment with Shareholders, which is being further strengthened with the proposed changes to the Policy to require a two year holding period on LTIP awards after leaving the Company.
Advisors Deloitte LLP Deloitte was appointed by the Remuneration Committee as independent advisor effective from 1 January 2014 following a review of the advisors in late 2013.
The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Deloitte remains independent of the Company and that the advice provided is impartial and objective.
Deloitte is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at www.
During 2015, Deloitte provided support to the Committee in relation to benchmarking executive remuneration structure and levels, remuneration related matters in respect of the demerger of Indivior PLC and the consultation of Shareholders on remuneration matters.
Deloitte also provided the Group with financial advisory support, international transfer tax compliance, global mobility services, ad-hoc advice on employment share schemes matters as well as international corporate and indirect tax advisory services during 2015.
These services are provided under separate engagement terms and the Committee is satisfied that the provision of these services did not impair Deloittes ability to advise the Committee independently.
Their total fees for the provision of remuneration services to the Committee in 2015 were 140,950 on the basis of time and materials.
