Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices exploration 232 km 774 Koz GE Drilling volumes Initial resource estimates in 2015 Standalone -14% exploration Our sustained investment in both greenfield and brownfield Our key greenfield exploration targets for 2015 were: exploration is one of the core pillars of our strategy as our continued exploration for platinum group metals PgM continued growth is conditional on the replenishment and deposits in the Karelia and ekaterinburg regions in order projects further increase in our ore reserves and mineral resources.
to establish new hard-rock PgM resources sufficient We continue to explore areas adjacent to our processing for a standalone mining operation: and and potential hubs brownfield exploration in order to extend exploration at key greenfield gold assets including the life of mine of existing operations.
at the same time, we the newly acquired lichkvaz armenia and Dolinnoye maintain an active portfolio of greenfield exploration projects Kazakhstan, north Kaluga and Tarutin urals.
with the potential to become sizeable standalone operations.
The advancement of each exploration project is subject to a rigorous review through pre-established project stages that are linked to our estimate of its resource potential and economic prospects.
at any stage, a project may be terminated, suspended or moved to the next exploration stage.
