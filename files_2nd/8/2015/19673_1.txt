However, with our ongoing focus on providing customers with exceptional quality and unbeatable value, we have continued to grow Group revenues and EBITDA and have succeeded in surpassing our fourth and final EBITDA target under the 2011 Share Scheme.
The first of these awards will vest with participants in September 2015 and the second in September 2017.
We owe our continued success to the commitment and hard work of those participants and we are delighted that we are able to reward them in this way.
3 Trading since the period end has been in line with management expectations and will continue to be driven by improvements in product range and availability, optimisation of both our in-store and web offerings, the introduction of Click and Collect in the UK and further investment in our store portfolio.
