qxd:13481SPEEDYHI 5 6 07 14:00 Page 7 Outlook The momentum in the business remains strong.
We carefully monitor a series of indicators covering both the economy and construction activity, as well as the comments of our major customers.
These all indicate a positive and progressive level of activity.
Increased Health and Safety legislation, which in the past few years has seen new regulation introduced on Hand Arm Vibration and Working at Height, has been extended to include noise and dust emissions.
When combining legislative requirements with customer demands for continued improvements in supply chain management and quality assurance programmes, there is increasing impetus towards the hiring of tools and equipment.
To meet these demands, we see further consolidation of the hire sector as both desirable and necessary.
Speedy Hire remains a well balanced business.
No one customer accounts for more than 4% of income and the diversity of markets, source of revenues and range of activities coupled with a national footprint brings added strength to the business.
Faced with favourable markets, a strong financial position and an outstanding team, and subject to no material change in the economic outlook, I am confident of reporting further progress in the year ahead.
If you have any comments on any aspect of this letter or indeed, any part of the Annual Report, I would be delighted to hear from you, either by writing to me at Haydock, or by e-mail at david.
