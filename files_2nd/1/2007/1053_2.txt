Strong demand, with China still playing a leading role, together with supply growth constraints is expected by most analysts to support copper prices for the next two years at least, as no large copper projects are expected to come on stream for some time.
The overall long-term outlook for copper is, therefore, very positive.

The results of this programme in the area to the south-east of the open pit have been encouraging and additional drilling will be required to define the resource and to evaluate its economics in relation to the long-term mine plan of Los Pelambres.
Negotiations with the mine and plant unions representing the whole labour force were due to take place in September 2007 and July 2008 respectively but in fact, contracts were agreed ahead of time with both unions for up to four years reflecting the excellent relations between Los Pelambres and its work force.
