Reserves associated with our development project in the Natuna Sea Gajah Baru which commercialises previous exploration successes have been booked for the first time.
A major achievement in 2007 was the progress made in advancing new projects both technically and commercially.
Agreement with gas customers in Singapore, Batam and North Sumatra has been reached on attractive terms.
These projects are scheduled for final investment approval during 2008, together with our oil development in Vietnam.
Our exploration programme in 2007 delivered four successes from 11 exploration and appraisal wells.
The Chim So formerly Blackbird sidetrack, drilled early in 2007, encouraged us to move into the development stage for that project.
We are returning to Vietnam to drill the Chim So North appraisal well in March 2008 and continue a potentially high-impact programme for a further three wells.
Altogether we plan around 13 exploration and appraisal wells and 18 development wells in 2008.
We also continue to build our programmes for future years with new licence awards in Norway and Vietnam, seismic surveys under way in Norway, Vietnam and Indonesia and a two-well exploration programme planned for Congo in late 2008 or early 2009.
Our efforts on improving our health, safety and environmental performance standards have again resulted in us beating our internal targets.
We seek continued improvements year-onyear in this area.
For the first time our policies will include a focus on carbon emission targets.
Our 2007 Social Performance Report will be published in April 2008.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 03 A major achievement in 2007 was the progress made in advancing new projects both technically and commercially.
Shareholder returns During 2007, Premier shares increased in value by 6 per cent, contributing to an increase of 352 per cent over the five year period to 31 December 2007.
This strong performance and the attractive returns expected from our investment programme have reinforced our policy to reward shareholders principally through share price growth and to utilise cash flows within the business.
Board changes We were pleased to announce the appointments of David Lindsell and Michel Romieu as non-executive directors in January 2008.
Both have had distinguished careers in their respective fields and will provide invaluable input to the Board.
Two non-executive directors, Scott Dobbie and Ron Emerson, will retire in June 2008 after combined service of 14 years on the Board.
We are enormously grateful for their outstanding contributions over a long period of time.
Outlook Current production has exceeded 40,000 boepd during the early months of 2008.
Significant milestones have already been achieved on our key development projects.
We have commercialised previous exploration successes and added to our booked reserve base.
This gives us increasing confidence that our production target of 50,000 boepd by the end of 2010 will be achieved.
Further significant progress will be made on these projects during 2008.
2008 also offers potential to add a new generation of projects with drilling campaigns in Vietnam, Norway and Congo being planned and executed.
This combination of exploration, appraisal and development projects offers shareholders a wide portfolio of growth opportunities which our strong financial position allows us to pursue.
