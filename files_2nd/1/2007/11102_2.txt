Chairmans Statement I am pleased to report that NEXT has had another solid year.
In a difficult and competitive year both sales and profits have grown to record levels.
Earnings per share have risen by 14.7% to 146.1p, enhanced by the beneficial effect of share buybacks over the past two years.
In the seven years since January 2000 we have returned 2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which is more than the market value of the whole company at that time.
In order to deliver our primary financial goal of long term sustainable growth in earnings per share our emphasis in the year ahead will be to improve the performance of our existing operations.
In his report, Simon Wolfson lays out some of the steps which are being taken to ensure the vitality of the NEXT Brand.
Of these the most important is our constant desire to improve the product we offer our customers.
The achievement of this objective and the intention to continue our buyback programme, where appropriate, offers us the best opportunity to deliver superior returns to our shareholders.
Derek Netherton, who has served 10 years on the Board, has signalled his intention to step down in 2008 and we have commenced the search for a new non-executive, who will also take over from Derek as Chairman of the Audit Committee in due course.
I am confident that our strategy of being a highly focused operation combined with the continued return of cash to shareholders will continue to deliver great product and service to our customers and a healthy return to our shareholders.
I would like to thank our staff, suppliers and in particular our management team, who have led us through a challenging period.
