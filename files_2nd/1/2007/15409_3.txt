01 Overview of the year Chairmans statement Tate & Lyle performed well in the 2007 financial year, delivering a third consecutive year of double-digit pre-tax profit growth.
Results Tate & Lyle performed well in the 2007 financial year, delivering a third consecutive year of double-digit pre-tax profit growth despite the headwinds of energy cost increases, EU sugar regime reform and adverse currency movements.
The latter was more than offset by a lower depreciation charge arising from the impairment of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europes assets in 2006.
Following the sale of Redpath, our Canadian cane sugar refining business, and the surrender of quota at Eastern Sugar, these businesses have been classified as discontinued.
Growth this year has been driven substantially by our Food & Industrial Ingredients businesses, which together achieved a 36% increase in adjusted operating profit.
Last year we set a demanding target for the contribution from value added products to grow by 30% in the year to 31 March 2007.
Although we did not achieve the target, profits from value added products were 14% higher than in the previous year on a constant currency basis.
We remain committed to and confident in our strategy to achieve further growth from this part of our business.

Strategy The pie chart opposite shows the time spent by the Board at its meetings in the last financial Operations 38% 13% year allocated between its various responsibilities.
As can be seen, 50% of the Boards time was spent on strategy and investment.
The Board meets eight times per annum and aims to hold at least two of its meetings on the sites of its major operations, providing the opportunity for it to meet senior operating management and carry out plant visits.
During the year, the Board carried out its annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, led by myself.
The 2007 evaluation involved one-to-one performance Capital expenditure evaluation meetings with each director, the Company Secretary and the Group Human Finance and risk and investment Resources Director.
The main themes and comments arising from the meetings were 27% 12% presented as a report to the Board for discussion and certain suggestions made are being or will be implemented.
Outlook The closure of Eastern Sugar and the advanced discussions on the partial disposal of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe if completed as anticipated will significantly reduce the Groups exposure to the new EU sugar regime which came into effect during the year.
These actions, together with the 131 million disposal of Redpath, our Canadian cane sugar refining business, after the end of the year, and the proposed 79 million investment in the German speciality food ingredients group G. C. Hahn & Co. represent further significant steps in repositioning and strengthening our business for future growth.
On the assumption that an agreement on the terms currently contemplated for the partial disposal of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe is entered into at the end of the summer, the Board is now actively considering the utilisation of the proceeds as part of a return of capital to shareholders and expects to be in a position to update shareholders in this regard at the AGM on 18 July 2007.
As we look forward to the year to 31 March 2008, a number of factors will impact our profits in comparison with the year to 31 March 2007.
We do not expect a repeat of this years unusually high profits in ethanol.
We anticipate that the continuing oversupply of sugar in the EU market will have a further negative impact on our sugar refining businesses.
The anticipated partial disposal of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe will reduce operating profits, and the commissioning of the Singapore SPLENDA Sucralose facility will increase fixed costs, offsetting the benefits of expected continued growth in sales in this division.
On the other hand, we anticipate making further progress in value added products as we bring on stream new capacity at our Sagamore and Loudon facilities, and as we continue to grow sales of SPLENDA Sucralose.
We will also benefit from the improved sweetener pricing secured at Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas in the 2007 calendar year pricing round.
Furthermore, were the EU Commissions most recent proposals for stabilising the EU sugar market to be adopted, market sentiment for the next pricing round would improve and the threat of a quota reduction for our European Sugars business for the sugar year commencing 1 October 2007 would be removed.
Over the last few years the Group has embarked on a strategy of building a stronger value added business from a low-cost commodity base whilst, at the same time, reducing the impact of our exposure to volatile markets.
Our strategy continues to be successful and, whilst the coming year will essentially be one of transition, it has provided the Group with a stronger base from which to take advantage of the growth opportunities that lie ahead.
