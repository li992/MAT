Chairmans Statement Overview Electras return to full investment in October 2006 was followed by a busy period of investment activity, both in terms of successful realisation of portfolio companies and through new investments.
Successful realisations during the year have resulted in Electras net liquid resources at the year end amounting to 156 million despite investments this year totalling 322 million.
These resources, together with unutilised borrowing facilities, will enable Electra to make new investments in a time when a troubled financial market may require a greater equity capital commitment.
Results Over the last year Electra once again delivered both strong net asset value growth and Over the five years to 30 September 2007... good share price performance.
This continued the success of the previous four years.

Over the same period the share price rose by 263.2% and the FTSE All-Share Index increased by 84.1%.
Investment Activity Since October 2006, Electra Partners, the Companys Manager, has quickly developed a strong dealflow which has resulted in the completion of a number of new investments during the year.
In certain cases these investments were structured to give greater downside protection through an emphasis on debt like instruments.
For much of the year readily available bank finance greatly assisted realisations on attractive terms before the sub-prime crisis in the United States led to banks adopting a more cautious approach.
322 million was invested during the year and 303 million was realised from portfolio investments.
Full details of the investment activity are set out in the Managers Review from Electra Partners.
Investment Strategy Under new FSA listing rules Electra, like other closed-ended investment funds, is required to include in the annual financial report details of its investment policy and give additional information relating to its portfolio.
Electras shareholders approved the new investment strategy at the Extraordinary General Meeting held in October 2006 and details of Electras objective and investment policy are set out elsewhere in this Report.
Other information is also given under the new rules in relation to the continued appointment of Electra Partners and the principal terms of its compensation arrangements.

Further Authority to Buy Back Shares During the year ended 30 September 2007, Electra made on-market purchases at a cost of 22 million and cancelled 1.47 million shares.
The Company currently has the ability to buy back and cancel up to a further 5.4 million shares during the remaining period of this authority which will cease at the Annual General Meeting when Directors will seek to renew this general authority.
Special Dividend In the year ended 30 September 2007 Electra again received distributable revenue at a level which requires it as an investment trust to pay a dividend.
Accordingly the Board is proposing a special dividend of 25p per share which will be paid on 7 March 2008 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 25 January 2008 subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
This is the third year in which a dividend has been proposed for this reason.
Shareholders should note that this is not a variation in the policy of maximising capital growth.
The Board would not expect dividend payments to continue on a regular basis.
Articles of Association Following a review of Electras Articles of Association, the Board has decided to seek shareholders approval to certain changes to Electras Articles of Association in the light of provisions of the Companies Act 2006, dealing with electronic communications and Directors conflicts of interest.
It is also taking the opportunity to increase the limit on Directors ordinary remuneration which was last agreed in 1997.
Full details of these proposals are set out in the Directors Report and in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
The Articles of Association will be reviewed again after the remaining provisions of the Companies Act have come into effect.
