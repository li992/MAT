Chairmans statement 4 Rio Tinto 2007 Annual report U54670 pp4-pp9 5 3 08 23:49 Page 4 Chairmans statement 2007 was another record year for Rio Tinto characterised by continuing strong demand and prices for our metals and minerals, a change in chief executive and the transformational acquisition of Alcan.
Once again Rio Tintos consistent strategy, focused on value creation and business excellence, delivered significant returns for our shareholders and major benefits to the countries and communities in which we operate.
The purchase of Alcan, announced in July and completed in October created a world leader in aluminium.
Alongside this major acquisition we continued to invest heavily in our existing business with a programme totalling US$5.0 billion, further strengthening our platform for future production and earnings growth.
The Alcan acquisition, and the many other initiatives which the new executive team launched in 2007, further demonstrated the strength and depth of Rio Tintos managerial capability to deliver value to shareholders.
Results and dividends The Groups underlying earnings in 2007 were a record US$7,443 million, one per cent above 2006.
Net earnings were US$7,312 million compared with US$7,438 million in 2006.
Cash flow from operations increased 15 per cent to a record US$12,569 million.
The total dividends declared for 2007 of 136 US cents per share represent an increase of 31 per cent over the 2006 dividends.
We have committed to further increases in the dividends of at least 20 per cent in each of 2008 and 2009.
This underpins our confidence in the growth of our business and is a strong signal of our belief in the strength of future demand and prices.
We have Paul Skinner Chairman always said that our priority for excess capital after meeting our investment in profitable growth is the ordinary dividend, and we are pleased to reinforce this commitment to our shareholders.
Our growth potential is further evidenced by our planned capital expenditure in 2008 and 2009 of US$9 billion in each year, including the commitments we have made to completing Rio Tinto Alcans growth projects.
This indicative programme will, of course, be subject to rigorous appraisal of each investment.
Strategy Our acquisition of Alcan was fully consistent with our long standing strategy.
We remain focused on large, long life, low cost resources capable of delivering superior returns across the economic cycle.
Alcans extensive global asset base has among the lowest cost aluminium smelters in the world and is an industry leader in production technology and self generated energy, particularly hydro-electricity.
This will be important in a carbon constrained world.
Creating value for shareholders is Rio Tintos primary objective and the addition of Alcan enables us to capture value from growing aluminium demand alongside our established leadership positions in iron ore and copper.
Sustainable development A successful business is one that is sustainable.
It is one that maintains long term profitability by pursuing value creating projects which recognise the importance of good social and environmental outcomes.
Moreover, I believe making our business sustainable is about recognising and managing the full spectrum of risk, thereby making the best opportunities available to us.
The value of this approach was demonstrated in the agreed transaction to acquire Alcan.
Our positive reputation for social and environmental responsibility was welcomed by the Alcan board and led to the Government of Quebec readily agreeing to Rio Tinto continuing Alcans commitments to social and economic development in Quebec.
For our part we recognised the strategic advantage of expanding our position in aluminium, a recyclable metal which, in the case of Rio Tinto Alcan, is produced with a high proportion of hydrogenerated electricity.

Paul Skinner Chairman Ill health led to the resignation of Ashton Calvert from the board in November and we were deeply saddened to hear of his death shortly afterwards.
Ashton joined the board in 2005 following a long and distinguished career in the Australian foreign service.
He made a major contribution to Rio Tinto and provided valuable insights across a range of major strategic issues, notably in relation to our businesses in Australia and Asia.
Forward outlook We are seeing a dramatic change in the worlds centres of economic power, with rapid growth, urbanisation and industrialisation in many parts of the developing world.
We expect a large part of the worlds population billions of people to move through increasingly metal intensive phases of economic development.
This will transform our industry and underpin future growth in markets.
Commodity markets are entering the fifth straight year of growth with mineral and metal prices at levels well above their long term average.
Projections for Rio Tintos main product groups iron ore, aluminium and copper suggest that demand could potentially triple over the next 25 years.
While it is premature to say that the current price cycle has peaked, we are mindful of short term risks associated with the expected slowdown in the US economy.
However, the US is now somewhat less important in world commodity demand than it was five years ago.
Our analysis suggests a sharp slowdown in the US would have only a modest impact on growth in China and India.
In the short term, with low commodity stocks and a likely continuation of supply side challenges, we expect solid global
