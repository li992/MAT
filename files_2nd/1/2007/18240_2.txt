Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2007 Chairmans Statement It gives me great pleasure to present the Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2007, a year which has seen a very satisfactory continuation in the growth of our Group with Profit before Tax increasing to 198.3 million 2006 162.7 million.
These accounts are prepared on the IFRS basis following our adoption of this system in 2006.
As I mentioned in my report last year, by including valuation gains in our Income Statement the IFRS approach has the potential to inject volatility into our reported profits, with every percentage point change in annual revaluation producing a swing of some 12 million in Profit before Tax.
It is important to remember that our Consolidated Income Statement includes Net Valuation Gains of 156.5 million 2006 132.3 million which arise mainly from fluctuations in market values rather than as a direct result of our operating activities.
This year has also seen healthy growth in our profits before net valuation gains to 41.8 million 2006 30.4 million.
As can be seen from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Net Cash from Operating Activities has reduced to 14.6 million 2006 17.1 million although this increases to 34.2 million 2006 29.3 million when the proceeds from sales of property are included.
We must never lose sight of the fact that it is net rental income and realised gains which generate the cash with which we run the business and pay dividends to shareholders.
In our day to day efforts we continue to focus on the core business of generating value from our portfolio of investment properties.
This requires a steady, long term approach and it is pleasing to be able to report on another year of good progress in both profit and the Groups net worth.
The revaluation of our Investment Properties at 31 March 2007 produced an overall uplift of 153.9 million 2006 131.0 million : this is equivalent to 14% 2006 14%.
The table below shows an analysis of the revalued portfolio, by type of property.
Valuation Percentage March 2007 Change Commercial Property UK 653.5m 15.8% USA 32.7m -4.4% Residential Property UK 405.5m 15.9% USA 142.2m -6.7% Total 1,233.9m 14% Above: An architectural detail at Kensington Church Street London W8 Right: Langlands House Harlow Essex Page 2 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2007 Left: Sainsburys Watford Hertfordshire The apparent fall in value of the Groups US properties is entirely due to the current weakness of the US dollar against sterling.
In dollar terms the US commercial and residential properties increased by 7.9% and 5.6% respectively.
Notwithstanding short term currency movements, we remain committed to the gradual long term expansion of our US portfolio.
Dealing now with the results for the year, our Gross Rental Income at 73.9 million is somewhat down on last years figure of 77.5 million.
However, as mentioned in my statement last year, the 2006 rental income received a non-recurring boost from the settlement of a long outstanding rent review: the comparison has been further distorted by the current weakness of the US dollar.
These factors mask underlying year on year rental growth in both the UK and US of 3% and 5% respectively.
This year has seen expenditure on repairs at 19.5 million which is some 3.0 million down on last years total.
Whilst there has been a modest reduction in the UK of 1.1 million, the greater part of the reduction is attributable to the US which has reverted to a more normal level of spend following completion of the abnormal hurricane damage repairs in 2006.

The Group continues to benefit from a strong balance sheet, with shareholders funds increasing to 861.7 million 2006 745.3 million.
It has long been the Boards policy prudently to increase dividend payments in line with the continued progress of the Group.
The Board therefore has pleasure in recommending an increase in the total dividend for the year from 65p to 70p: equivalent to 7.7% 2006 6.6%.
This year has seen unprecedented movement in the Groups share price.
Following a review by FTSE International Limited in December 2006, our shares have, for the first time, been included in a number of their indices including the FTSE 250 and the All Share Index.

By 31 March 2007 this initial surge of activity seemed to have passed with the share price back to previously prevailing levels.
Since the 31arch the shares have suffered from the downward pressure which has afflicted the property sector as a whole.
Both the upward and the downward movements have been quite detached from the underlying reality of your companys steady long term growth.
As I anticipated last year, our further consideration of the Real Estate Investment Trust REITS structure has confirmed that the Group is unable to take advantage of the legislation as presently drafted.
Left: the new entrance to 164 Shaftesbury Avenue and below left: the original design So far as general market conditions are concerned, it is possible that we may see a change in market sentiment with an upward movement in yields and a corresponding downward pressure on capital values.
The recent increases in interest rates and their possible impact on economic activity over the coming year reinforce this concern.
On the positive side this may bring forward better priced purchase opportunities than we have seen in recent years.
With gearing at 8.8% 2006 12.7% and undrawn facilities of 152 million 2006 144 million we are well placed to take advantage of any such opportunities.
We continue to concentrate on identifying opportunities to enhance rental and capital values within our existing portfolio.
In practice development projects tend to take a considerable time to bring to fruition and as always we temper enterprise with Page 7 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2007 Chairmans Statement continued prudence in pursuing such projects.
During the year, the projects we have been actively progressing included the following: 164, Shaftesbury Avenue, London WC2: this major refurbishment will create 29,000 sq feet of prime office space and is due to complete by the end of the year.
2529, Worship Street: this development close to Broadgate in the City of London will create 22,000 sq feet of modern office space: work commenced on site in June 2007.
Africa House: a planning application is being submitted for a major refurbishment of this office block in central London which will create 115,000 sq feet of high quality space.
This project is likely to span a number of years.
I remain constant in my belief that our well tried business approach means that we are well placed to continue to deliver the long term steady progress that has come to characterise the Group.
As ever my thanks must go to our dedicated and hard working staff for helping to deliver another successful year.
