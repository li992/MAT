Your Companys diluted net asset value total return rose by 12.4% in comparison to 11.1% for the FTSE All-Share Index.

Final Warrant Exercise During the year under review, holders of warrants had a final opportunity to exercise the right to convert their warrants into ordinary shares at 100p.
The subscription period in which conversion was possible closed on 31 August 2006 the final subscription date.
Following the final subscription date, the Company appointed a Trustee to act on behalf of those warrantholders who had not exercised their right to convert.
The Trustee undertook a review of the remaining warrants and concluded that it was within warrantholders interests to convert them into ordinary shares.
The Trustee then sold the ordinary shares in the market and distributed the funds less costs to those warrantholders to whom they were due.
On 14 September 2006, as a result of the exercise of all the Companys outstanding warrants, 13,620,201 new ordinary shares were issued.
Subscription Share Exercise During the period under review, subscription shareholders had their first opportunity to exercise their right to subscribe for one ordinary share of the Company at a price of 218.94p.
The subscription period ended on 31 August 2006.
As a result, 758,886 ordinary shares were allotted on 14 September 2006.
Subscription shareholders will have further opportunities to convert their holdings in each of the years 2007 to 2013.
Issued Share Capital As a result of the first subscription share exercise and the conversion of all the remaining warrants, your Company issued 14,379,087 ordinary shares.
The issued share capital of the Company at the time of writing is therefore 206,860,637 ordinary shares of 10p each and 18,136,367 subscription shares.
Corporate Governance The Board remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of Corporate Governance and is accountable to you as shareholders for the governance of the Companys affairs.
PIGIT pp01 10 13 6 07 8:00 pm Page 06 06 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT continued The Directors believe that, during the period under review, they have complied with the provisions of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance as endorsed by the Financial Reporting Council, save in respect of matters discussed in the Corporate Governance statements contained on pages 24 to 29.
AGM At the AGM there are five items of Special Business to be proposed: Share Issuance First your Directors are asking for the usual authority to issue up to an aggregate nominal amount of 6,895,354 a third of the Companys issued share capital as at 12 June 2007 in new ordinary shares.
This will allow Directors to issue shares within the prescribed limits should any favourable opportunities arise to the advantage of shareholders.
The powers authorised will not be exercised at a price below Net Asset Value so that the interests of existing shareholders are not diluted.
This authority will expire at the AGM in 2008.
Secondly, your Directors are also asking for the usual authority to issue new ordinary shares pursuant to a rights issue or otherwise than in accordance with a rights issue of up to an aggregate nominal amount of 1,034,303 5% of the Companys issued share capital as at 12 June 2007 of new ordinary shares dis-applying pre-emption rights.
This will allow shares to be issued to new shareholders without having to be offered to existing shareholders first, thus broadening the shareholder base of the Company.
Share Buybacks Thirdly your Directors are seeking to renew the authority to buy back up to 31,008,409 14.99% of the Companys issued share capital as at 12 June 2007 subject to the restrictions referred to in the notice of the AGM.
Your Directors are proposing that shares bought back by the Company either be cancelled or alternatively, be held as treasury shares with a view to their resale if appropriate, or later cancellation.
The holding of treasury shares is restricted to 10% of the Companys issued share capital and any resale of them will only take place on terms that are in the best interests of shareholders.
Electronic Communications and Amendments to the Articles of Association Fourthly, your Directors are seeking general authority from shareholders to send or supply documents or information to shareholders in electronic form e. g. by e-mail or by means of a Web site, so taking advantage of new company legislation regarding electronic communications with shareholders, which became effective on 20 January 2007.
The resolution also makes various changes to the Articles of Association to reflect the new legislation on electronic communications, and to make a number of minor consequential changes required by the Companies Act 2006.
Increase in Authorised Share Capital Finally, your Directors are seeking authority under s. 123 of the Companies Act 1985 to increase its authorised share capital to 300,000,000 ordinary shares of 10p each by the creation of 60,000,000 additional ordinary shares of 10p each.
One of your Companys longer term objectives is to increase the size of the assets of the Company in a manner consistent with seeking to maximise returns for shareholders.
Should the opportunity arise to issue new shares, the current authorised share capital may not be adequate to both cover such a new issue and the potential exercise of all 18,136,367 subscription shares currently in issue.
Your Directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the Notice to the AGM and in their opinion, consider them all to be in the best interests of shareholders as a whole.
Your Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each resolution.
The AGM of the Company will be held at the Henley-on-Thames office of INVESCO Asset Management Limited on 19 July 2007 at 11.30am.
I do hope that as many shareholders as possible are able to attend.
This will be an opportunity not only to meet the Directors, but also to hear the views of Mark Barnett, who is the investment manager at Invesco Perpetual with the day-to-day responsibility for managing the Companys share portfolio.
