Chairmans statement Our artists, songwriters and employees continue to be key to EMIs success.
Talent is fundamental to EMIs business and we believe that, by nurturing both our creative and executive talent, we will be able to develop EMIs artists and their careers as well as our offering to them, to their fans and to our business partners.
Piracy, both organised and casual, continues to take a large proportion of potential earnings from the pockets of our shareholders and artists.
Protecting our intellectual property remains a top priority for EMI.
We continue to press governments and industry bodies at the highest levels around the world to respect entertainment content by having in place and enforcing the right legislation.
We believe that a dual approach of educating consumers and offering them a better proposition will also help to fight piracy.
It is important that we serve the communities in which we operate and that we behave in a way which is socially responsible.
We sponsor many activities within the wider music community and support charities which aim to improve the provision of music.
The year has seen a number of changes to the Board.
Kathleen ODonovan stepped down in November and I would like to thank her for her nine years of service to the Board.
Kevin Carton has replaced Kathleen as chairman of the Audit Committee.
Looking forward, David Londoner will be stepping down from the Board John Gildersleeve at the AGM and I thank him for his contribution.
Finally, I welcome Non-executive Chairman the appointment of Sly Bailey to replace me as Senior Independent Director.

In April 2007, the Board announced that, in view of EMIs current funding requirements, it would suspend future dividend payments until the benefits of the restructuring process have been fully realised.
Our restructuring plan has been designed to enable EMI to operate most efficiently and effectively in the current environment John Gildersleeve while best positioning us to maximise future growth opportunities.
Non-executive Chairman The breadth and depth of our recorded music and music publishing catalogues continues to be a valuable asset and we are maintaining our investment in expanding and exploiting these rights.
The recorded music industry is becoming increasingly digitised.
We continue to explore and invest in a large number of digital initiatives which includes entering into partnerships that will improve the consumers experience as well as enhancing both shareholder and artist value.
In April 2007, EMI Music became the first major record company to offer consumers its entire digital download catalogue free from digital rights management DRM and with a significantly higher sound quality.
This initiative will, we believe, enhance the consumers experience of digital music, enable true interoperability of music and video downloads between services and devices as well as removing a significant barrier to the realisation of the full potential of the digital music business.
3 Corinne Bailey Rae EMI Music Since signing to EMI in 2005, Corinne Bailey Rae has developed into one of the UKs leading female artists.
The last 12 months have seen her build on her success in Britain and Europe by breaking in both Asia and America, with her debut album reaching number two in the US charts and earning her three Grammy nominations.
We believe in nurturing talent The long-term development of musicians and songwriters on a local and global level, dedication to working in collaboration with artists, and an emphasis on creative excellence and integrity are the principles that underpin everything that EMI does.
These principles have enabled us to build a roster of artists and writers, and a catalogue of recordings and songs, that span all key musical styles and genres.
With this philosophy still at our core today, EMI has in the last year broken a number of major new artists and songwriters including EMI Musics Corinne Bailey Rae, Lily Allen and 30 Seconds To Mars, and EMI Music Publishings The Fray, Panic!
At The Disco and the Fratellis.
4 We believe in listening to consumers EMI is committed to providing music fans with the best possible experience, and to anticipating and fulfiling consumer demand for compelling content.
In the rapidly expanding digital market, it is essential that music companies foster change in order to develop products and services that music fans really want to purchase and use.
It was this consumer focus that led to EMIs groundbreaking launch of premium DRM-free higher sound quality downloads earlier this year, and which will continue to guide our thinking over the years ahead.
5 Norah Jones EMI Music & EMI Music Publishing Already one of the most successful artists of the 21st century, Norah Jones became a digital music pioneer in December 2006.
Her single Thinking About You was one of the first DRM-free tracks to be made available for retail by a major record company, when it was offered for sale as an MP3 file on the Yahoo!
We believe in innovation The music market is changing more quickly than at any point in its history, and EMI is working with new and existing partners to foster innovation and capture the imagination of the consumer through compelling services and products.
Over the last year, EMI Music and EMI Music Publishing have signed groundbreaking deals covering business models including advertisingsupported streams and videos, legal peer-to-peer, preloaded devices, mobile gaming, and of course premium DRM-free downloads.
We will continue to be collaborative, flexible and open to innovation in all its forms, and to work with our partners across the music value chain to drive new and exciting revenue streams across all areas of our business.
6 We believe in our people In the last year, EMI has redefined both its leadership and its entire structure to align the business more closely with the developing digital landscape.
This has made the Company a more effective and efficient organisation while maintaining the focus on creativity and artistic excellence which is at the heart of what EMI people do.
At all levels of the business, we have creative, passionate and committed people with the necessary skills and experience to realise the opportunities that lie ahead of us.
