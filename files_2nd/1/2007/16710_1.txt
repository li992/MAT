Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 01 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Once again, I am pleased to report another year of good progress for the Group.
As expected, exchange rates had an adverse impact of 2.0m on profit before tax compared to 2006.
Underlying profit before tax excluding this impact was 17% up on 2006.
Basic earnings per share were up 14% at 44.9p 2006: 39.4p.
In recognition of this performance the Directors are recommending a final dividend of 12.6p 2006: 10.2p per ordinary share, making a total of 17.3p 2006: 14.4p per ordinary share for the year, an increase of 20% over last year.
During 2007, we have continued to drive product and market development activities forward.
A record number of new applications were commercialised while we continued to broaden our product offering and, as a result, our penetration into new markets.
The completion of our second polymer plant and new film manufacturing facility, together with the ongoing uprates of our raw material and downstream production facilities will support the further development of the business.
We recognise that our talented and dedicated employees are a key element of our success.
Our continued progress is principally the result of their efforts and I would like to thank them for their significant contribution.
