Total dividend 7.0c 5.0c 40% 3 ROCE 28.3% 21.5% Sir Ian Wood, Chairman Markets We expect continuing growth in demand for energy, primarily driven by the worlds developing economies.
Oil & gas operators remain focused on developing their reserves through new discoveries, often in deep water and harsh environments: through developing unconventional reserves, including heavy oil and shale sources: through achieving better routes to market for previously stranded reserves, which is contributing to the growth in the LNG market: and through maximising recovery from existing elds.
Deepwater developments, subsea completions and pipelines, and production enhancement are all signi cant growth areas in which Wood Group has strong market positions.
The growing global economy is also leading to increasing investment in electricity generation around the world.
This is greatest in the developing economies, where the pace of economic development can also lead to serious power shortages and the need for fast track power solutions, a sector in which Wood Group is well placed.
The relative environmental bene ts of gas among traditional energy sources and shorter development lead times is expected to lead to an increasing share for gas in world electricity generation and growth in the gas turbine population.
In the current global market we believe that oil prices will stay above $65, which is stronger than our prediction last year.
There should also be continuing strong demand for gas, the most environmentally friendly fossil fuel, the price of which will become more global and increasingly in uenced by the oil price.
Accordingly, we expect continuing robust exploration & production E&P spending programmes and are continuing our investment programme both organically and through acquisitions.
