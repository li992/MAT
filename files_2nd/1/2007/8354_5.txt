Board There were no changes to the Board during the year.
We appointed two new directors to the Board in January 2008.
Both were internal appointments involving the managing directors of two of Interserves divisions: Bruce Melizan, who is responsible for the Facilities Management division, and Steven Dance, responsible for Equipment Services.
They have made valuable contributions to the development of Interserve and their appointment will allow the Group to benefit further from their abilities.
