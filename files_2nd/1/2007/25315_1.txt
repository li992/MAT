Medium-term strategy Our strategy for the business has four key components.
Christopher Rodrigues John Harnett The first is to continue to build the profit from our established Executive Chairman Chief Operating Officer Central European markets of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
Our immediate target is to achieve pre-tax profit of at least 95 million by 2010.
The second component is to realise the sizeable profit potential of the two markets currently under development Mexico and Romania.
We expect Mexico to be in profit for 2009 and Romania for 2010.
The third component is to take our successful business model into new emerging markets.
Our recent acquisition of a small bank in Russia is evidence of this strategy moving forward and we are near to completing our pre-pilot research on India and the Ukraine.
Either looks to be a good candidate for a pilot entry towards the end of 2008 or in early 2009.
Finally, we will seek to manage our capital and balance sheet when the current turmoil in credit markets has passed.
Meanwhile, we are glad our growing lending book is funded through to 2010 and we have a high equity to receivables ratio.
Both factors stand us in good stead in the current market.
