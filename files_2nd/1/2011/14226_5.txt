SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 chaIrmans statement Revenues from continuing operations grew by nearly 8%, a strong performance in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment.
I am pleased to report that 2011 was a year of significant progress for SIG.
The Group returned to sales growth, and based on this good financial performance and a further strengthening of its balance sheet, reinstated its dividend as promised.
Revenues from continuing operations grew by nearly 8%, a strong performance in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment.
Profit benefited not only from the operational gearing on the additional sales but also from an improved gross margin, which was increased by 20 basis points.
As a result, the Groups underlying operating margin improved to 3.5% and underlying profit before tax increased by 27.3% to 81.7m.
SIGs Return on Capital Employed also improved significantly, by 230 basis points to 7.9%, measured on a post-tax basis.
As a result of non-underlying charges totalling 74.2m 2010: 145.0m the Leslie Van fide Walle Chairman Group recorded a total profit before tax of 7.5m 2010: loss of 80.8m.
Including these charges, statutory loss after tax amounted to nil 2010: loss of 76.8m.
In summary As well as increasing returns, the Group continued to reduce net debt Revenues from continuing operations grew by 69.1m to 115.9m, with leverage net debt underlying EBITDA falling by nearly 8% to less than 1x and interest cover now above 7x.
Underlying profit before tax increased stRateGy by 27.3% to 81.7m While improved trading conditions, particularly in Mainland Europe, certainly Return on Capital Employed improved helped to drive growth, the Groups strong performance can also be attributed to the delivery by the management team on a number of key objectives and significantly, by 230 basis points to 7.9% self-help measures.
The Group recorded a total profit before Operationally, SIG continued to outperform the market, as it has done over tax of 7.5m recent years.
This was due to improved performance at existing sites, driven by new sales resources and increased cross-selling, together with the increased contribution from recently opened branches.
New branches are an important element of SIGs organic growth strategy and the Group opened another 18 sites in 2011.
In addition to capitalising on growth opportunities, SIG is continually looking to improve efficiency and the Group recently announced that it had identified an additional 5m of future operating cost savings from the further rationalisation of its branch network, mainly in the UK & Ireland.

Conversely, demand for construction products in the RMI market tends to be more constant and in some markets can even be counter-cyclical to the macroeconomy.
Although current economic conditions are subdued, SIG believes that the medium to long term drivers for its products remain strong given that the current relatively low levels of residential and private non-residential building activity do not appear sustainable when compared to demographic growth trends.
Given the Groups strong market position in the majority of the countries in which it operates, SIG believes that it is well positioned to benefit from any upturn in demand over the medium term.

Sales per day in constant currency so far this year were around 1% ahead of strong prior year comparators, despite the impact of severe weather across Mainland Europe in February this year.
Given the ongoing uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, the Group continues to expect market volumes to be slightly down overall in 2012.

The field of risk management is constantly evolving within SIG, and following the comprehensive review of the Groups risk management processes undertaken during 2010, the process was reviewed again during 2011 to ensure that it remained robust and that emerging risks are identified, assessed and managed effectively.
The review process involved the consideration of the objectives and targets of the Groups strategic business plan, the ongoing development of a risk universe, and the identification of key strategic risks.
These risks are then continually evaluated using consistent measurement criteria, mitigating controls identified and opportunities for the enhancement of the Groups control environment implemented.
Further information on our risk management procedures is included in the Corporate Governance section on pages 59 and 60.
