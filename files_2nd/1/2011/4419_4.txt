SECTION 1 OVERVIEW CHAIRMANS STATEMENT David Newlands Chairman Dear fellow shareholders Welcome to the Annual report for the year ended 30 April 2011.
I am pleased to report that overall the Group has continued to demonstrate its resilience to the continued difficult market conditions.
Darty France and Vanden Borre have both performed well and we are starting to see the benets of implementing the Darty concept across the Group.
The improved adjusted earnings and continued strong cash generation have enabled us to recommend a final dividend of 4.75 cents, bringing the total dividend for the year to 7.0 cents per share, which is a 6.1 per cent increase on last years total dividend and is 1.6 times covered by adjusted earnings.
Comets recent results have been neither satisfactory nor acceptable.
As a result, changes to management have been made and a strong turnaround plan to restore profitability in the medium term is being prosecuted vigorously.
We believe that Comet, with its strong brand awareness, consistent store portfolio and leading back ofce and service infrastructure, is well placed to carve a leading position in a growing cross-channel market.
In parallel, we are escalating shorter term strategic alternatives to determine which deliver the best long-term value for allshareholders.
As ever I would like to thank all our staff across the Group.
It has undoubtedly been a challenging year and their continued dedication is a sign of their professionalism and commitment to the Group.
