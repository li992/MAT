Dividend For the year ended 31 March 2011, the Directors decided to declare dividends on a quarterly basis for the first time.
Three interim dividends of 2.2p each were paid to shareholders in September and December 2010, and March 2011, and a fourth interim dividend of 2.75p will be paid on 30 June 2011.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 9.35p, representing an increase of 6.25% on the previous years two interim dividends totalling 8.8p.
The Boards aim remains for the Company to maintain its policy of real dividend growth over the medium to longer term.
Gearing Gross gearing of the Company was 19% at the year end 2010: 20.4%.
The Boards policy is to allow gearing up to a level of 25%.
During the year ended 31 March 2011, gearing was provided by maximum bank borrowings of 75 million.
Since the year end the maximum limit on bank borrowings has been increased to 100 million, which will provide the Company with additional flexibility.
Further information relating to the Companys gearing policy can be found on page 23.
Subscription Share Exercise During the year under review, subscription shareholders had their fourth opportunity to exercise their right to subscribe for one ordinary share of the Company at a price of 218.94p.
The subscription period ended on 31 August 2010.
As a result, 203,607 shares were allotted on 13 September 2010.
Subscription shareholders will have further opportunities to convert their holdings in each of the years 2011 to 2013.
Issued Share Capital The Board was disappointed to announce in June 2010 that the proposed issue of B shares would not go ahead as planned.
Accordingly, at the year end the issued share capital of the Company was 210,900,504 ordinary shares of 10p each and 17,478,825 subscription shares.
During the year the rating of the Companys shares remained high and occasionally its shares traded at a premium to net asset value NAV.
At times, demand for shares exceeded supply and the Company responded to two requests for issues of new shares totalling 645,880.
Since the year end, a further 250,000 ordinary shares were issued for cash.
As a result, as at 10 June 2011, the issued share capital consisted of 211,150,504 ordinary shares.
Corporate Governance The new UK Code of Corporate Governance, which succeeds the Combined Code, was published in June 2010 and applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 29 June 2010.
In September 2010, The Financial Reporting Council endorsed the new AIC Code of Corporate Governance, which had been updated to reflect the changes made to the UK Code of Corporate Governance.
Your Board intends to comply with the provisions of the new AIC Code of Corporate Governance with effect from 1 April 2011, save in respect of matters which will be explained within the 2012 annual financial report.
Annual General Meeting AGM At the AGM the following items of Special Business will be proposed: Share Issuance 1.
The Directors are seeking the usual authority to issue up to an aggregate nominal amount of 7,038,350 a third of the Companys issued share capital as at 10 June 2011 in new ordinary shares.
This will allow Directors to issue shares within the prescribed limits should any favourable opportunities arise to the advantage of shareholders.
This authority will expire at the AGM in 2012.
The Directors are also seeking the usual authority to issue new ordinary shares pursuant to a rights issue or otherwise than in accordance with a rights issue of up to an aggregate nominal amount of 2,111,505 10% of the Companys issued share capital as at 10 June 2011 of new ordinary 06 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT continued shares disapplying pre-emption rights.
This will allow shares to be issued to new shareholders without their having to be offered to existing shareholders first, thus potentially broadening the shareholder base of the Company.
This authority will not be exercised at a price below NAV so that the interests of existing shareholders are not diluted and will expire at the AGM in 2012.
Share Buy Backs and Treasury Shares 3.
Your Directors are seeking to renew the authority to buy back up to 31,651,461 shares 14.99% of the Companys issued share capital as at 10 June 2011, subject to the restrictions referred to in the Notice of Meeting of the AGM.
Your Directors are proposing that shares repurchased by the Company be either cancelled or, alternatively, held as treasury shares with a view to their resale if appropriate or cancellation.
The holding of treasury shares is restricted to 10% of the Companys issued share capital and any resale of them will only take place on terms that are in the best interests of shareholders.
Notice Period for General Meetings 4.
The EU Shareholder Rights Directive increased the notice period for general meetings of companies to 21 days unless certain conditions are met in which case it may be 14 days notice.
A shareholders resolution is required to ensure that the Companys general meetings other than AGMs may be held on 14 days notice.
Accordingly, Special Resolution 12 will propose that the period of notice for general meetings of the Company other than AGMs shall be not less than 14 clear days notice.
It is intended that this flexibility will be used only for non-routine business and where it is in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
The Board is taking the opportunity to seek shareholder approval to update the Companys Investment Policy, which includes an amendment to allow an increase in the percentage of gross assets that the Manager is allowed to invest in non-UK securities, as referred to in the Managers Report.
The proposed new Investment Policy can be found in the Report of the Directors on pages 16 and 17.
The Board is obliged to offer shareholders an opportunity, every five years, to decide on whether the Company should continue in existence as an investment trust.
The Board considers it to be best practice for all shareholders to have this periodical opportunity to express their views and as a result, Ordinary Resolution 14 asks you to vote on the Companys future.
By way of background, since launch in 1996 to 31 March 2011, the Companys net asset value ex-income has increased by 169.2%.
Dividends, over the same period, have grown by 141.8% source: Thomson Reuters Datastream.
For the year ended 31 March 2011, the Companys shares traded at an average discount of 1.5% source: JPMorgan Cazenove, par value, exincome.
The Directors believe, therefore, that the Company has been achieving its twin objectives of providing shareholders with growth in capital and dividends over the medium term and is well placed to continue to do so in the future.
The Directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the Notice of the AGM shown on pages 56 to 58 and, in their opinion, the Directors consider them all to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
The Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each resolution as they will be so doing with their own shares.
The AGM of the Company will be held at The Lanesborough, Hyde Park Corner, London SW1X 7TA on 19 July 2011 at 11.30 am.
I do hope that as many shareholders as possible are able to attend.
This will be an opportunity not only to meet the Directors, but also to hear the views of Mark Barnett, who is the investment manager at Invesco Perpetual with the day-to-day responsibility for managing the Companys portfolio.
