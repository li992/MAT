JPM Mercantile pp01 17 JPM Mercantile pp01 17 31 03 2011 07:53 Page 2 2 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Chairmans Statement Over the year to 31st January 2011, the Companys total return on net assets ie with net income reinvested was 27.4%, which compares with a return of 26.6% from the Companys benchmark index, the FTSE All-Share excluding FTSE 100 constituents and investment trusts.
The dividend payment to shareholders will, once again, be partially funded from reserves, to the value of 9 million 2010: 10million, which has reduced the total return on net assets by 0.9%.
Returns and Dividends Earnings per share increased by 15.9% for the year, from 23.2p to 26.9p, partly due to an increase in dividend income received.
The Company has paid three interim dividends of 6.0p per ordinary share, and the Directors have declared a fourth quarterly interim dividend of 18.0p, giving a total dividend of 36.0p for the year, maintaining last years dividend of 36.0p.
The Board recognises, as in previous years, that it is essential to make an appropriate distribution, which both meets shareholders legitimate expectations, and is prudent in the light of what may be continuing difficult times ahead.
The Board intends therefore to continue to pay three interim dividends at the current rate of 6.0p per ordinary share throughout the year ending 31st January 2012.
The level of the fourth quarterly interim dividend will be determined by the Board based on the level of income received by the Company during the year and with regard to the Companys revenue reserve of 19.7p per share.
Share Price Discount The share price rose by 29.0% during the year and, including dividends paid, the total return to shareholders was 33.8%.
The discount to net asset value at year end was 10.3% compared to 14.5% with debt at fair value the previous year.
The average daily discount, with debt at fair value, during the year, was 12.3%.
Share Repurchases During the year under review a total of 2,912,249 shares were repurchased for cancellation, amounting to 2.9% of issued share capital at the beginning of the year, at a total cost of 27.3 million.
Share repurchases during the year under review have added approximately 4.1 pence to the net asset value per share.
The Boards objective remains to use the share repurchase authority to manage imbalances between the supply and demand of the Companys shares, thereby reducing the volatility of the discount.
The Board believes that, to date, this mechanism has been helpful and therefore proposes and recommends that the powers to repurchase up to 14.99% of the Companys shares for cancellation be renewed for a further period.
Gearing The Company ended the year with gearing of 108.9%.
During the year the gearing varied between 97% and 115%.
It is the Boards intention to continue to operate within the range of 90% to 120% invested, under normal market conditions, and at the present time, the Board is JPM Mercantile pp01 17 JPM Mercantile pp01 17 31 03 2011 07:53 Page 3 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 3 maintaining gearing in the middle part of the range.
Gearing is regularly discussed between the Board and the Investment Manager.
A new borrowing facility of 45 million was negotiated with ING Bank in January 2011 in order to provide the Investment Manager with adequate flexibility with respect to gearing.
This facility can be used tactically as investment opportunities present themselves.
Board The new UK Corporate Governance Code introduced in June 2010 requires all directors of companies within the FTSE 350 Index to offer themselves for annual re-election, and with this in mind all of the Companys Directors are standing for re-election from this year onwards.
I refer you to the Directors biographies on page 17 for further details.
Investment Managers The Companys investment management team comprises Martin Hudson and Jane Lennard working together with the JPMorgan Asset Management European Equity Group.
The Board continues to monitor the performance of the Manager on a regular basis.
Brokers As part of the Boards regular review of service providers, it was agreed to appoint Oriel Securities Limited, to act as joint broker with Cenkos Securities plc.
VAT Case In my statement last year I reported on two ongoing issues relating to VAT.
First, the Companys intention to pursue a claim for compound interest on the VAT recovered from HMRC, for which only simple interest has so far been paid.
Secondly, the Company is seeking to recover VAT paid over the years 1997 to 2000.
Both these issues are unresolved, and may remain so for several years, but the risk reward ratio is such that it is in the interests of shareholders to see them through to conclusion, although I must emphasise that there is no guarantee of success.
Annual General Meeting The Companys one hundred and twenty fifth Annual General Meeting will be held at Trinity House, Tower Hill, London EC3N 4DH on Wednesday 18th May 2011 at 12noon.

Outlook The outcome of events in Japan and the Middle East is currently unclear, as is the resolution of the debate with respect to sovereign debt in certain European countries.
Conditions in the UK are likely to be difficult due to the Government's imperative of reducing the deficit.
However, the Stock Market in the UK appears reasonable value based on historic parameters, and earnings of UK companies are, on the whole, in positive territory.
The Board is confident that the Investment Managers are well positioned to identify and act on suitable investment opportunities.
