Introduction Executive The year ended 29 January 2011 has been the seventh successive year of Chairmans good progress in revenue and profitability for the Group.
Profit before tax and exceptional items improved by 21% to 81.6 million 2010: 67.4 million.
Statement Such sustained performance continues to reflect the strength and uniqueness of our brand and fascia offers as well as the strength of our management teams.
Our very strong cash position has also allowed us to continue to invest in brands, our store portfolios and new businesses during the year and since the year end.
Group profit before tax increased by 28% in the year to 78.6 million 2010: 61.4 million and Group profit after tax has increased by 31% to 55.9 million 2010: 42.7 million.
Group operating profit before exceptional items for the year was up 19% to 79.9 million 2010: 67.3 million and comprises a Sports Fascias profit of 73.3 million 2010: 64.1 million, a Fashion Fascias profit of 6.4 million 2010: 3.3 million and a Distribution segment profit of 0.2 million 2010: loss of 0.1 million.
The year end net cash position has risen to 86.1 million 2010: 60.5 million.
The Group has recently negotiated terms on new committed rolling credit and working capital facilities totalling 75 million.
These new facilities expire in October 2015 and when combined with our cash resources give the Group the funding capability to continue to develop operationally and by acquisition both in the United Kingdom and overseas.
Confidence arising from the sustained period of results improvement and the strength of our balance sheet has enabled the Board to propose another significant increase in the level of dividends with a final proposed dividend increase of 31% to 19.2p 2010: 14.7p bringing the total dividends payable for the year to 23.0p 2010: 18.0p, an increase of 28% following on from the rises of 50% and 41% in the last two years.
Acquisitions The Sports and Fashion retail offers continue to provide consumers with a unique mix of sports and fashion brands in both apparel and footwear including a substantial range of exclusive products as well as exclusive licensed and own brands such as Mckenzie and Carbrini.
We have continued to invest in increasing the own brand offers through the acquisition of the Sonneti, Chilli Pepper and Nanny State brands for a total consideration of 2.1 million.
Since the year end we have continued this strategy by acquiring the Fenchurch brand for 1.1 million.
The strength of the JD offering gives potential for further replication internationally, albeit in Europe initially.
We see this as a key opportunity wherever brands recognise our strength in developing brands and maintaining their prestige.
We started to exploit this opportunity when we acquired the French retailer Chausport in May 2009.
The first full year since the acquisition contributed 36.4 million of revenue and 0.5 million of operating profit.
Like for like sales grew by 12.5% in the year and gross margin improved by 2.7% but overheads increased to support the opening of three JD stores in France which opened late in the year.
These latter stores are performing to expectations so far.
We are looking at potential acquisitions and joint ventures in other territories on a regular basis and we have no doubt that the Chausport acquisition has enhanced our visibility and credibility as an overseas investor.
Since the year end we have acquired a further Sports Fascia chain in the Republic of Ireland, Champion Sports Holdings Champion, for a nominal amount and have also advanced 17.1 million to allow it to settle all of its indebtedness save for 2.5 million of leasing finance.
This has added 22 stores to the 8 already operated in the Republic of Ireland and gives us a significant market position throughout the whole of Ireland.
It also gives us more local knowledge and a strong management team on the ground.
After the year end we also acquired 80% of Kukri Sports Limited which provides a bespoke teamwear offering across a wide range of sports in a number of countries.
13 Kooga Rugby went through a difficult period under its previous ownership and Sports Fascias a lot of effort has been focused on improving control over the commerciality of the sponsorship properties and the profitability of product ranges and The Sports Fascias total revenue increased by 8% during the period to 667.2 accounts.
An operating loss of 0.3 million was recorded for the year 2010: million 2010: 615.5 million with like for like sales for the year up by a further profit of 0.2 million for the post-acquisition period on sales of 6.5 million 3.8% 2010: 2.3%.
We have strengthened the management team which we believe will lead to improvements in operating performance in due course.
Gross margin achieved in the Sports Fascias increased from 50.6% to 51.0% which we attribute to the continued improvement in the terminal stock position Nicholas Deakins recorded a profit of 0.2 million 2010: 0.0 million on in JD plus the impact from the extension of enhanced Group supplier terms turnover of 3.4 million 2010: 2.5 million in the year.
As a result of this improved margin and continuing enhancement of the store Joint Venture portfolio and its efficiencies, the operating profit before exceptional items of the Sports Fascias rose to 73.3 million 2010: 64.1 million in the year, Focus Brands Limited is involved in the design, sourcing and distribution of including a contribution of 0.5 million from Chausport 2010: 0.7 million.

Our share of operating results for the year was the seasonal losses incurred in the early part of the year which were prean operating profit before exceptional items and after tax of 1.5 million acquisition in the prior year.
The programme of store development has continued with 28 store openings The exceptional items in the current year relate to unrealised gains on foreign and 24 refurbishments or conversions.
These include the opening of our first 3 exchange contracts and the reversal of the impairment of the investment JD stores in France of which 1 was a conversion of a former Chausport store held by Focus Brands Limited in Focus Group Holdings Limited, following in Lille, 5 new Chausport stores, 2 new Size?

We have also opened a JD store at one of the UKs busiest Holdings Limited.

and, if successful, could be replicated in other major stations.
21 Sports Fascias stores were closed in the period including 6 smaller Chausport stores.
After the year end we increased our holding in this business to 80% at an initial cost of 1.0 million with potential further deferred consideration of 250,000 depending on performance.
The performance of this business will be Fashion Fascias included in the Distribution segment in future.
The Fashion Fascias are Bank and Scotts.
Group Performance The Bank Fascia stores sell largely branded fashion to both males and females, predominantly for the teenage to mid twenties sector.
In the year Revenue the store portfolio grew from 65 stores to 74 stores, still based predominantly Total revenue increased by 14.8% in the year to 883.7 million 2010: 769.8 in the North and the Midlands.
Total revenue in the year was 102.4 million million principally as a result of three factors: the Groups positive like for like 2010: 82.8 million.
This represents an organic decrease of 0.9% 2010: sales performance of 3.1%, a net increase of 15 stores and 41.5 million of 4.7% although this decrease came from trading in the first half of the year sales from the pre acquisition period of the Chausport, Canterbury and Kooga when the organic performance was measured against heavy clearance from businesses.
This reduction in clearance activity is reflected in the fact that gross margin achieved improved by a further 0.5% to 48.9% 2010: 48.4% Gross margin after an increase of 2.3% in the prior year.
Operating profit before exceptional Gross margin achieved increased in all segments.

The Board remains confident the participation of the lower margin distribution businesses within the Groups that there is a significant opportunity to grow operating margin in this Fascia overall performance from 5.4% to 9.5% means that the growth in overall Group through better stock management, own brand development and disciplined gross margin was limited to 0.2%.

Its sales progress is encouraging and on schedule financing income of 0.2 million compared to net financing costs in the prior but the marketing and other investment required to achieve this means that year of 0.4 million.
we believe it could take a further two years before it has sufficient critical mass to deliver profits to the Group.
This is not unusual in such businesses Year end net cash of 86.1 million represented a 25.6 million improvement on and we remain optimistic about the long term profitability of this venture.
As the position at January 2010 60.5 million.
a consequence of this, sales rose to 26.6 million 2010: 19.7 million but losses rose to 0.8 million 2010: 0.4 million in the year.
This was in line with our expectations and we subsequently increased our stake in Topgrade from 51% to 80% during the year at a cost of 1.2 million.
14 Net capital expenditure including disposal costs and premia received increased in the year to 32.4 million 2010: 23.0 million with capital expenditure excluding disposal costs increasing by 10.1 million to 33.0 million 2010: 22.9 million.
This increase was focused on the core Sports Fascias where the spend increased by 10.7 million to 25.6 million which included an additional 3.9 million in the French business combined with 3.9 million of spend connected with the new 866,250 sq ft warehouse 616,250 sq ft footprint at Kingsway, Rochdale.
The Board anticipate that approximately 15 million will be incurred in the year to 28 January 2012 on fitting out of the warehouse.
The demonstrable success of investing in the store portfolio means that we anticipate maintaining spend on the stores at the current level.
Spend in the Fashion fascias decreased slightly by 0.7 million to 6.7 million.
This decrease does not mean that the Group is reducing its investment in the Fashion fascias and is more a function of availability of appropriate property and the timing of the projects.
Working capital remains well controlled with suppliers continuing to be paid to agreed terms and settlement discounts taken whenever due.
Store Portfolio We have made a further significant investment in the store portfolio during the year with expenditure on both new stores and refurbishments of existing space.
We have also continued to rationalise our store portfolio wherever possible but, with the current economic climate impacting heavily on retail property occupancy levels, it remains very difficult to dispose of underperforming and or duplicate stores.

portfolios with 21 new stores offset by 15 closures.
Our overall presence has increased in France by 1 store with 7 new stores including 2 JD stores in Paris and Lyon offset by the closure of 6 smaller Chausport stores.
In addition, one Chausport store has been converted to the JD King of Trainers format in Lille and the success of that trial means that we will convert a further 2 Chausport stores in Angers and Amiens to this format in the current period.
There was a net addition of 9 stores in the Bank fascia with 13 store openings offset by the closure of 4 stores.
A loss making duplicate Scotts store in Chester was also closed in the period.
We have refurbished a total of 29 stores in the year including 3 stores where space has been transferred between fascias.
This means that over the last four years we have opened a total of 108 stores and refurbished a further 123 stores.

The proposed final dividend will be paid on 1 August 2011 to all shareholders on the register at 6 May 2011.
The final dividend has been increased by 31% with total dividends payable for the year increased by 28%.
This follows a 50% increase in the full year dividend in the prior year.
The adjusted earnings per ordinary share before exceptional items were 116.86p 2010: 93.64p.
The basic earnings per ordinary share were 114.84p 2010: 88.16p.
Employees As ever, after another record year, it is right to give credit and thanks to all our employees around the world for delivering such exceptional results.
We remain committed to continuing to develop their skills and prospects through our success, training and quality of operation.
Current Trading and Outlook Following successive years of record results for the Group, the retail environment has recently been significantly impacted by adverse fiscal changes in addition to the multiple current economic pressures.
Specifically, the increase in VAT for the year to 28 January 2012 means that the same level of gross takings will produce a contribution of approximately 16 million less than the previous year.
Simultaneously, but quite separately, we anticipate a reduction of real expenditure levels by consumers at a time when product costs, particularly imported goods, are increasing at a material rate.
Trading for the early part of the current financial year has been difficult to gauge when Easter falls three weeks later than last year.
For the 8 weeks to 26 March 2011 gross like for like sales including e-commerce were 0.4% whilst net sales have declined 1.2% Sports Fascias -1.4%, Fashion Fascias 0.0%.
The decline in net sales and the resulting reduced margin are directly as a result of the fiscal changes referred to above.
Our core business already possesses very strong sales densities and margins, being the result of continual growth in both measures for several years.
Against that background, therefore, it is inevitable that the Board is extremely cautious in its outlook, particularly when the profits achieved for the year to 29 January 2011 are effectively rebased purely as a result of the impact of increased VAT.
On the positive side the business delivers strong operating ratios and high levels of free cash generation.
It has a robust balance sheet with 86.1 million net cash balances at the year end which leaves the Group well positioned to extend the retail opportunities which may arise and to continue to pursue a progressive dividend policy.
Management remain highly focused on all avenues of revenue growth, margin protection and cost control available to us to endeavour to deliver the optimum outturn, minimise the impact of the factors above and, with a strong balance sheet and dominant market position in our core business, we expect to be able to deliver operational and financial progress for the Group over the long term.
Opportunities for profit growth overseas and development of our differentiated and own brand proposition, combined with prospects for growth in our Distribution business, all help to reduce the current threats to long term Group profitability and give us the opportunity to maintain positive long term momentum in our business.
A further update will be made in our Interim Management Statement no later than 17 June 2011.
