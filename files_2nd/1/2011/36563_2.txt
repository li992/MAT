The Groups property portfolio produces a high and growing income which we believe is robust, due to the diversity, both geographic and numerical, of the tenant base.
CHAIRMANS STATEMENT I have pleasure in presenting the results for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Since the beginning of the current downturn in European property markets the Board has pursued four key objectives: to maintain the strong and secure financial position of the Group: to take advantage of market weakness to assemble a portfolio of properties with significant vacancies which will show material capital appreciation when there is an upturn in the cycle: to create an operating infrastructure in the countries in which Hansteen owns properties: and to deliver to shareholders growing earnings and dividends.
In 2011 the Group has made good progress in all four objectives.
James Hambro Chairman RESULTS The Board has considered its Key Performance Indicators and intends to use Normalised Total Profit and Normalised Income Profit, as explained in the Joint Chief Executives Review, as a measure of its performance.
Normalised Total Profit for the year to 31 December 2011 was 34.2 million 2010: 26.5 million.
Normalised Income Profit, which excludes profits from the sale of properties and the benefits of a 5.3 million insurance payment at Bremen, increased by 27.2% to 25.7 million 2010: 20.2 million.
Diluted EPRA earnings per share in 2011 was 4.9p 2010: 3.8p, an increase of 28.9%.
This was achieved even though for most of 2011, the equity raised in May 2011 remained un-invested.
The Groups diluted EPRA Net Asset Value NAV was 82p per share 2010: 84p.
Under IFRS, Hansteen showed a 8.9 million pre-tax accounting profit for the year 2010: 33.2 million.
In the Boards view, this does not reflect the underlying returns of the Groups business as it includes a deduction of 19.3 million for the fall in the valuation of the portfolio over the year which is shown in the NAV of the Group.
DIVIDEND The Board intends to maintain its prudently progressive dividend policy for the foreseeable future reflecting the growing realised profits of the business.
Accordingly, the Board increased the interim dividend paid on 24 November 2011 by 14.3% to 1.6p per share November 2010: 1.4p per share and will pay a second interim dividend, also increased by 14.3%, of 2.4p per share May 2011: 2.1p, payable on 23 May 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 27 April 2012.
No PID is included in this second interim dividend payment.
The total dividend relating to the year ending 31 December 2011 will therefore be 4.0p per share 2010: 3.5p per share.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 5 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT THE SPENCER ACQUISITION The most significant transaction during the year was the 150 million acquisition of property assets from the Spencer Group of Companies announced on 22 December 2011.
This acquisition was made jointly with the Hansteen Property Unit Trust HPUT, in which Hansteen has a 33% interest.
One of the great benefits of being in a position to acquire property in a downturn is the chance to buy assets which would not be available at any other stage of the cycle.
This was the case with the Spencer portfolio which had been carefully assembled by the previous owners over 35 years and represents one of the best secondary multi-let industrial portfolios in the UK.
Were it not for the combination of high gearing, much of which had been put in place towards the top of the cycle, and a dramatic drop in values since then, this portfolio would not have been available.
Furthermore it was the combination of Hansteens available capital and a strong relationship with both Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland that enabled the transaction to happen.
The Spencer portfolio comprises 88 assets totalling 381,000 sq m of predominately industrial property and 37 acres of development land located across the UK.
The properties are particularly suitable for Hansteens intensive management approach.
The portfolio was acquired with a high initial yield together with substantial vacancies and development land which should provide opportunities to create significant added value using our expanded UK management team.
The properties purchased by the HPUT mean that the Fund is now fully invested and our investment in the HPUT should materially add to Hansteens earnings and future growth potential.
GROUP FUNDING As stated above, the Board set as an objective a strong and secure financial base for the Group.
As a result, in May 2011, Hansteen announced the successful raising of 146.5 million, net of expenses, in new equity at a very small discount to the Groups NAV and the share price at the time.
The new capital was raised to pursue our second objective of opportunistic property acquisitions arising from the considerable distress in the UK and Continental European property markets.
Generally, property investors with the knowledge, experience, skill and capital to take advantage of distressed property opportunities toward the bottom of the property cycle have made superior returns from those investments in the long term.
In addition, during the year the HPUT arranged new acquisition facilities, with Royal Bank of Scotland, totalling 85.0 million secured against the existing HPUT portfolio and the Spencer properties that it acquired in December 2011.
On its own balance sheet, Hansteen raised a loan of 41.3 million from Lloyds Banking Group to acquire the balance of the Spencer properties.
2011 2010 2011 2010 745m 792.1m 59.6m 66.1m Property Portfolio & Value Rent Roll Wholly owned HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC 6 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Furthermore, the Group concluded twenty sales of its own investment and trading properties, with total proceeds of 24.4 million which showed a profit of 2.7 million over book value.
The net result of this activity is that, notwithstanding the substantial Spencer acquisition during the year, the Group had, at the year end, cash on its balance sheet of 162.5 million.
Assuming gearing of 50% loan-to-value and the retention of appropriate working capital, this creates potential firepower of up to 300 million for further acquisitions.
The Spencer transaction has cemented Hansteens reputation with the banks for dealing with complex and challenging purchases in a reliable and professional manner.
This reputation, together with Hansteens financial strengths, has and is continuing to produce a number of interesting potential property opportunities for the Group to explore.
PROPERTY PORTFOLIO 2011 was a successful year in terms of growing occupancy and rental income.
The Group started the year with 744.6 million of wholly owned property, with a combined rent roll of 59.6 million, with 22% vacancy 408,563 sq m and 262 hectares of development land.
At the year-end the portfolio had a value of 792.1 million, a rent roll of 66.1 million and 19.4% vacancy 398,621 sq m. The year-end figures include the Spencer properties which were 40% vacant.
The rent roll reflects a current yield of 8.4% 2010: 8.0% compared to the Groups average cost of borrowing of 3.6%.
There is a further 3.5 million of rent contracted but not yet being received.
Were all the wholly owned vacant property to be let at current market rents, the rental income would be 85 million reflecting a yield of 10.7%.
Like-for-like occupancy improved by 5.4% of the portfolio or 24.5% of the vacant properties and like-for-like rents increased by 2%.
At the beginning of the year the HPUT property portfolio was valued at 84.04 million with income of 6.76 million per annum and a vacancy of 32% 71,481 sq m. By the year end the HPUT was valued at 168.76 million with income of 13.2 million per annum and a vacancy of 23.48% 83,261 sq m a like-for-like occupancy improvement of 7% of the portfolio or 21.9% of the vacants.
Despite the strengthening occupancy and increased rental income the valuation of the property portfolio fell by 19.3 million in the year to 31 December 2011, mainly as a result of falling values in Belgium and the Netherlands.
We have strengthened our teams in these two countries and believe that this will result in improvements going forward.
FINANCE AND HEDGING Net debt to property value, at 31 December 2011, was 39% 2010: 53%.
Hansteen currently has 470 million of borrowings of which 273 million is swapped at an average rate of 2.6% and 107 million is capped at an average rate of 5.4%.
The average borrowing rate at 31 December 2011 was 3.56%.
Borrowings are in the same currency as the assets secured.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 7 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Hansteen reports its results in Sterling although, at present, of the total net assets of 509 million approximately 47% are denominated in Euros.
To mitigate the risk of a substantial fall in the Sterling value of the portfolio arising from devaluation of the Euro Hansteen has hedged 200 million at a level of 1.2 to the pound until June 2013.
The Board will continue to review the Sterling Euro balance of net assets and consider appropriate hedging strategies.
The Group manages its Euro revenues to ensure that it always has adequate Sterling resources to meet dividends.
GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW Details of how the Company has implemented the UK Corporate Governance Code are provided in the Corporate Governance Report.
As stated in our 2010 Annual Report, the Executive Director and senior management remuneration framework was reviewed this year in consultation with our major shareholders.
Details of the review are contained in the Remuneration Report.
OUTLOOK The Board believes that realising and distributing profits, as well as building a portfolio that will show capital growth as the property market recovers, are key to creating long-term shareholder value.
Vacant property and the undeveloped land in the portfolio provide real opportunities for value growth even in the current difficult market.
The Group has significant resources available and a strong and experienced management infrastructure in place.
This together with a growing reputation for professionalism and performance with the major European banks will provide further excellent acquisition opportunities in the future.
James Hambro Chairman 27 March 2012 The Board believes that realising and distributing profits, as well as building a portfolio that will show capital growth as the property market recovers, are key to creating long-term shareholder value.
HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC 8 Our business model, which aims to generate high generalised income profits irrespective of movement in market rents and yields, is the ideal one for this environment.. 9
