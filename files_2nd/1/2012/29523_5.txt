6 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2012 Chairmans statement Consistent strategy I am pleased to report that 2012 was our tenth consecutive year of income and pro t growth.
Throughout a turbulent decade for the world economy and for banking we have continued to deliver consistent value for our shareholders, and Standard Chartered remains a growth story.
Income rose 8 per cent to $19.1 billion Pro t before tax increased 1 per cent to $6.9 billion Normalised earnings per share were up 14 per cent to 225.2 cents 1 Clearly the settlements reached with the US authorities had an impact on our pro ts, but despite this, we are increasing the total amount of dividend paid to shareholders.
T he Board is recommending a final dividend of 56.77 cents per share.
This brings the total annual dividend to 84.00 cents per share, up 10.5 per cent in line with our long track record of performance.
Over the past decade, Standard Chartered has delivered consistently, not just for shareholders, but for the communities inwhich we operate.
We have tripled the number of people we employ to over 89,000 across our footprint: we have paid in excess of $11billion in corporate tax, and we have increased our lending more than five-fold to $28 9 billion.
Importantly, we have achieved this by sticking to our strategy, Sir John Peace focusing on the basics of good banking in markets we know Chairman well, with clients and customers with whom we have deep, andi n many cases long, re lationships.
2 012 was another year of good performance As 2012 showed, there is still work to be done to rebuild public trust inbanks, and questions continue to be raised about how for Standard Chartered, thanks to a banks reward their management and staff.
We have not consistent strategy, a stable management changed our approach.
We continue to remunerate our people, team, supportive clients, customers and not just for what they achieve, but for how they demonstrate our shareholders, and, above all, our great values, rewarding long-term performance, not failure.
