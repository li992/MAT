Annual General Meeting AGM Shareholders attention is drawn to the special business in the Notice of Meeting which includes the usual renewal of powers to issue and buy back shares and to allow application of the minimum notice required for general meetings other than the annual general meeting by the Companies Act 2006, and in addition, a resolution to adopt new Articles of Association.
This is prompted by the introduction of new investment trust tax rules, which came into effect for the Company on 1 April 2012 and which, amongst other things, no longer prohibit investment trust companies from distributing capital profits by way of dividend.
The changes to the Articles will enable the Company to take advantage of the added flexibility allowed by the new tax rules, however the Directors have no current intention to distribute capital profits as dividends.
The opportunity has additionally been taken to update the articles generally to reflect current law and best practice.
The Directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the Notice of the AGM shown on pages 52 to 55 and, in their opinion, consider them all to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
The Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each resolution.
The AGM of the Company will be held at Perpetual Park, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire RG9 1HH on Thursday 12 July 2012 at 11.00 am.
I do hope that as many shareholders as possible are able to attend.
The Directors and the Portfolio Manager, Mr Mark Barnett, will be available at the meeting to answer shareholder questions.
