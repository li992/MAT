06 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Chairmans statement Carillion has continued to deliver a robust performance, with underlying earnings per share slightly ahead of the market consensus forecast.
Having rescaled our UK construction activities, we have also further improved the risk profile and the overall quality of our business.
Philip Rogerson Chairman 07 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Total revenue, including joint ventures, reduced to 4.4 billion 2011: 5.1 billion, primarily dueto the planned rescaling of our UK construction business, which has been achieved bytightening the criteria we use to select the contracts for which we bid, to ensure that the sizeofthis business remains aligned with the shrinking UK construction market.
Furthermore, rescaling our UK construction activities has supported margins and improved the overall riskprofile and quality of our business mix.
Revenue contributions from the Middle East and Canada were also lower in 2012 due to the timing of our opportunities in those markets.
However, we continue to believe that we can deliver strong medium-term growth in both the Middle East and Canada.
In our pre-close trading update on 12 December 2012, we announced that from 2012 onwardsprofits from the sale of equity investments in Public Private Partnership PPP projectswould betreated as part of underlying profit, instead of non-operating profit, asthisisconsistent withthe treatment now adopted by most of our industry.
PPP equity salesmade modest contributions to underlying profit from operations of 11.5 million in 2011and 13.2 million in2012.
Our 2011 results have been restated to reflect this changeintreatment.
1 In 2012, underlying profit from operations increased by two per cent to 232.4 million 2 2011:227.4 million.
The total operating margin increased to 5.7 per cent 2011: 2 4.9percent, as we continued to benefit from rescaling UK construction and our highly selective approach to the contracts for which we bid, together with an ongoing focus on 1 costmanagement and operational efficiency.
Underlying profit before taxation reduced 2 by fourper cent to 214.7million 2011: 223.5 million, due to a substantial increase in the Groups net financial expense to 17.7 million 2011: 3.9 million, includingan increase in theinterest charge relating to the Groups pension schemes.
For thesame reason, 1 2 underlying earnings per share reduced six per cent to 43.0 pence 2011: 45.7pence.
Reported profit before taxation increased by 26 per cent to 179.5 million 2011: 142.8 million and basic earnings per share increased by 16 per cent to 37.2 pence 2011: 32.0 pence.
Carillion continues to have a strong balance sheet.
Net borrowing at 31 December 2012 was 155.8 million 2011: 50.7 million, which reflected the expected outflow of working capital attendant on rescaling UK construction and the acquisition of the Bouchier Group in Canada.
During 2012, the addition of a further 210 million of private placement funding took the Groups total bank facilities and private placement funding to over 1 billion.
New order intake has remained strong with 5.2 billion of new and probable orders during theyear.
At 31 December 2012, the total value of the Groups order book plus probable Dividend five-year compound orders, which excludevariable work and re-bids, was some 18.1 billion 2011: 19.1 billion, annual growth rate with the reduction due primarily to the sale of equity in Public Private Partnership projects andthe rescaling of UK construction.
The Group continues to have good revenue visibility, which is currently around 75 per cent of anticipated revenue in 2013 2011: 77 per cent 9% for2012.
At 31December 2012, we had a pipeline of contract opportunities worth some35.2billion 2011: 33.1 billion, which continues to support our targetsforgrowth.
2012 17.25p The Board is recommending a final dividend of 11.85 pence per share 2011: 11.6 pence, 2011 16.9p making the total dividend for 2012 17.25 pence, an increase of two per cent on the 2010 16.9pencepaid in respect of 2011.
15.5p 2009 Looking forward, we expect market conditions to remain challenging in 2013.
However, 14.6p witharesilient business model, a strong order book and a substantial pipeline of contract 2008 opportunities, the Group remains well positioned to achieve its targets of delivering annual 13.0p growth in support services and of doubling annual revenues in the Middle East and in Canada, in each case to around 1 billion, in the five-year period from 2010 to 2015.
