Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 01 01 chairmans statement This has been an extraordinary year of change and challenge for Cable&Wireless Worldwide.
In the last year we have had two Chairmen and three Chief Executives culminating in the appointment of Gavin Darby as Chief Executive Officer in November 2011.
Due to the tough trading conditions we also took the difficult decision to suspend the dividend which inevitably ledto a fall in our share price.
Since then Gavin has stabilised the business, renegotiated our revolving credit facility and written a new plan for the development of the business over the next three years.
Trading conditions while tough have been as we expected and in the circumstances we have produced a fair set of results for the year which are in line with our expectations.
The key event of the year however has been the two unsolicited approaches for our Company, from Vodafone and Tata Communications.
After a long and rigorous process the Board felt able to recommend the offer from Vodafone which will enable shareholders to crystallise a value, in cash, that represents a significant premium to recent trading levels and avoids the risks inevitably presented by executing a medium term improvement strategy.
Furthermore, the combining of two great British companies represents an exciting opportunity for our staff, our customers and our partners to reap the rewards of working within one of the worlds largest and most successful communications groups to build a stronger platform for the future growth of the business.
