THE GROUP COMPANY Chairmans Statement Peter Salsbury BSc Chairman Introduction My opening comments reiterate two themes that dominate our investment world the volatility of equity markets and the overarching impact of macro events.
The sell off in European equity markets started at the end of June and continued, with intermittent rallies, into the late autumn.
After a poorly coordinated response between central banks and member states it was a relief to note both the appointment of technocrat leaders in Greece and Italy as well as the increased scope of European Central Bank intervention with the introduction of 3 year Longer-term Refinancing Operations LTROs.
None of these actions are sufficient to solve the crisis but at least they provide us with some evidence of forward thinking amongst governments and central bankers.
The response from the markets was positive with a 20% rally in European equity markets between mid December and mid March.
Clearly the Eurozones problems have not disappeared and at the time of writing markets are, once again, very nervous.
The year end total return figures are a considerable improvement on the Interim position, although disappointingly still negative.
Both share classes experienced positive absolute performance in the second half.
In addition relative outperformance of their respective benchmarks into this market recovery from mid December aided performance recovery.
Although property companies share prices fell over the 12 months to March, their earnings did not and it is pleasing to announce both record revenue earnings and significant increases in the final dividends in both share classes.
