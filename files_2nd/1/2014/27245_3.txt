CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Dear Shareholder, It is my pleasure to present to you the Annual Report of NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Limited the Company for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Portfolio and Company Performance Building on the solid start that your Company has made since April 2011, the Board remains satisfied with the progress made by the Investment Manager during 2014.
The portfolio remains fully invested, with a strong US bias.
As of 31 December 2014, 94.14% of the Company was invested in US Dollar denominated assets, with 2.28% invested in Euro denominated assets and 3.58% in Sterling denominated assets all excluding cash.
The Investment Manager has constructed a diversified portfolio of loan investments, across currencies, ratings and sectors.
At the end of the reporting period, the portfolio had 267 holdings across 206 issuers in 33 different sectors 2013: 234 holdings across 177 issuers in 34 different sectors.
Between 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014, the Companys NAV per share fell by 2.38% and 2.47% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and Sterling Ordinary Shares, respectively.
The NAV return plus dividends paid during the year was 1.23% and 1.16% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and Sterling Ordinary Shares, respectively.
As at 31 December 2014, the share price was trading at a premium of 1.53% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and 2.10% for the Sterling Ordinary Shares.
During 2014, the dividend yield on dividends paid was 3.64% based on the 31 December 2014 share price of $1.0013 and 3.65% based on the 31 December 2014 share price of 0.9975 for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and Sterling Ordinary Shares, respectively, which we believe is relatively attractive given market conditions during the year and is consistent with the Companys objective of targeting income generation whilst seeking to preserve investors capital and giving protection against rising interest rates.
Other Matters On 21 January 2014, the Company's Sterling C Shares merged with the Sterling Ordinary Shares.
The Sterling C Shares were issued late 2013 to seek to manage the premium at which the Companys Ordinary Shares traded, given the high level of demand.
Outlook for the Rest of the Financial Year Looking to 2015, your Board continues to be satisfied with the portfolios performance to date and the strategy that is being applied by the Investment Manager, albeit, it notes the very strong returns of the US and UK treasury gilt markets during the year 2014.
It is in that context that the Board note the Companys shares moved to a modest discount to NAV post year end and a number of share buybacks have taken place in the Sterling share class to ensure price continues to be reflective of underlying NAV.
Notwithstanding this, the Board continues to believe that the strategy is well placed to deliver the attractive risk-adjusted returns expected particularly as the US economy continues to recover and it looks increasingly likely US rate rises will be forthcoming.
The Investment Manager will continue to update you on the Companys progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and Investment Manager updates.
Reflecting the increased size and complexity of the Company and to assist in managing the additional workload, we announced an addition to the Board.
We welcomed Rupert Dorey as the new independent Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2015.
