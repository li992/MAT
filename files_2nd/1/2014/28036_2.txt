STRATEGY CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Performance For the year ended 31 March 2014, on a total return basis the Companys net asset value increased by 18.8%.
This was substantially above the 8.8% rise in the Company benchmark which is the FTSE All-Share Index.
This degree of outperformance by the portfolio manager is to be congratulated and you can read how he achieved this in Mark Barnetts report, which can be found on pages 7 and 8. Dividend For the year ended 31 March 2014, three interim dividends of 2.7p each were paid to shareholders in September and December 2013, and March 2014.
A fourth interim dividend of 3.7p will be paid on 27 June 2014 to shareholders on the Companys register on 6 June 2014.
This gives total interim dividends for the year of 11.8p, representing an increase of 5.4% on the previous year.
With this dividend the Board has maintained its policy of real dividend growth over the medium to longer term.
During the year the Company has received a number of special dividends.
The total for the year is 4,547,000 which equates to 1.9p per share.
Special dividends are, by their nature, non recurring.
However, the Board recognises the importance of dividends to our shareholders and has decided to pay a special dividend of 1.9p.
This will be paid to shareholders at the same time and for the same record date as the fourth interim dividend.
Total dividends for the year, thus totalling 13.7p, an increase of 22.3% on the previous year.
Borrowing and Gearing As announced prior to the year end, on 8 May 2014 the Company issued 60 million of fixed rate 15 year private placement notes the Notes at a coupon of 4.37%.
The interest payment dates are 8 May and 8 November, with a repayment date of 8 May 2029.
The Notes will replace the Companys existing 30 million 6.125% debentures 2014 the Debentures which are repayable on 8 July 2014 and they are secured by a first floating charge over the Companys assets and rank pari passu with the Debentures.
The Notes will provide the Company with a balance of attractively priced, fixed rate long-term debt alongside its variable rate short term bank overdraft facility.
The Boards policy is to permit gearing to a maximum of 25% of net assets and allows the portfolio manager some discretion up to that level.
Throughout the year the portfolio manager has demonstrated faith in his portfolio by using this facility to gear his positions and has varied the gearing between 9.5% and 17.9%.
The Company ended the year with gearing of 14.2% 2013: 14.1%.
Subscription Share Exercise and Issued Share Capital At the half year stage I reported to shareholders that the subscription shareholders had had their final opportunity to exercise their right to subscribe for one ordinary share of your Company at a price of 218.94p per share in August 2013.
As a result, a total of 12,914,737 new ordinary shares of 10p each were issued and allotted.
In addition to this, a further 1,673,378 new shares have been issued during the year, reflecting strong demand for the Companys shares.
Of these 973,378 arose from shareholders choosing to reinvest their dividends and a further 700,000 were issued at an average price excluding costs of 351.86p.
Investment Management Arrangements As I mentioned in my Chairmans Statement to shareholders in the half-yearly report, the Board is delighted that your portfolio manager, Mark Barnett, will continue to manage the Companys investments on your behalf following the announcement of his promotion to Head of UK Equities by Invesco Perpetual.
Your Board, mindful of developments in the investment trust sector and the wider investment market, has been discussing the Companys fee arrangements with the Manager.
These discussions are ongoing at the date of signing this report.
PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 05 STRATEGY CHAIRMANS STATEMENT continued Investment Policy The investment policy has been in place for many years and, whilst the Board does not intend to change the overall meaning of the policy, it has been re-worded into hopefully clearer English.
The new wording can be seen on page 9.
Shareholder approval of this change is not required as it is not material.
However, the Board thought it would be appropriate to seek shareholder approval, and as a result, resolution 2 is included in the Notice of Meeting on page 57.
Annual General Meeting AGM Shareholders attention is drawn to the special business in the Notice of AGM which includes the annual renewal of powers to issue and buy back shares and to allow application of the minimum notice required for general meetings other than the annual general meeting by the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the Notice of the AGM as set out on pages 57 and 58 and, in their opinion, consider them all to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole.
The Directors therefore recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each resolution.
The Companys AGM will be held at Perpetual Park, Perpetual Park Drive, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, RG9 1HH on Friday, 11 July 2014 at 11.00 am.
I do hope that as many shareholders as possible are able to attend.
The Directors and the portfolio manager, Mark Barnett, will be available at the meeting to answer shareholder questions.
