Strategic report Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements Chairmans Statement I am pleased with the progress the business has made this year, re-focusing the UK business and continuing to grow the International businesses.
Over the past 24 months the UK business has increased its focus on service delivery and I am pleased to say that customer satisfaction has increased as a result.
As we announced earlier in the year, the Financial Conduct Authority concluded its investigation in January 2014 and we settled the financial penalty in February 2014.
The International businesses continue to deliver good customer growth.
Customers in Spain more than doubled to 0.8m this year, while customers increased by 19% in the USA.
We have built the business on having strong affinity partnerships and I am delighted that we have signed 12 new partnerships in the USA with utilities that serve over 4.4m households and we have signed a new water partner in Spain that serves 2.6m households.
All of our businesses are progressing in line with our expectations and we continue to expect the Group to deliver modest growth in FY15.
Dividend The Board is proposing a final dividend of 7.67p per share bringing the total dividend for the year to 11.3p 2013: 11.3p.
People On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution over the past year.
