The FTSE 100 Index gave a total return of 0.7% while the FTSE All-Share Index, which is heavily weighted towards large companies, delivered a return of 1.2%.
By comparison, the Numis Smaller Companies Index Excluding Investment Companies NSCI XIC, the Companys benchmark, produced a return of -1.9%.
Over the same period, the Companys net asset value total return was -0.7% while the share price total return was 0.1%.
The Managers Report gives much greater detail to the headline numbers and expands on the influences and factors that have affected the Companys performance in 2014.
Board changes In October 2014 I became Chairman of the Company replacing Professor Paul Marsh.
Paul was an excellent Chairman and Director of the Company over a ten year period.
We will all miss his invaluable contribution and his knowledge of the investment landscape.
He did a superb job for investors in the Company and leaves with our very best wishes.
I am delighted to be the Companys fourth Chairman since its formation in 1990 even though it feels a little like being asked to follow Alex Ferguson!
and, along with my Board colleagues, look forward to working with the Managers to help extend the excellent long term record.
Dividends The Company witnessed a continuation of the recent positive trends with regard to dividend experience from investee companies.
In this context, the Board is pleased to propose a final dividend of 17.0p.
This results in total dividends for the year of 24.75p, representing an increase of 5.3% on 2013.
Based on the year end share price of 1,072p, the Companys shares deliver a historic 2.3% yield.
The Board remains committed to a progressive dividend policy.
The Companys revenue reserves, after adjusting for payment of the final dividend, amount to 38.6p per share up from 36.1p as at 31 December 2013 and provide a degree of flexibility going forward.
The final dividend, subject to Shareholder approval at the 2015 Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 5 March 2015 to Shareholders on the register as at the close of business on 13 February 2015.
The ex dividend date is 12 February 2015.
ASCoT operates a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Details of the plan, including the Form of Election, are available from Capita Registrars.
Contact details can be found on the inside back cover.
Gearing It has been the Companys policy to use gearing in a tactical manner throughout its 24 year history.
As reported in the Interim Report, the previous debt facility expired in May 2014 and this was replaced with a new 125m facility from The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The new facility is on improved terms and is due to expire on 15 June 2017.
The facility provides the Managers with flexibility in accessing liquidity for investment purposes, as well as the ability to fund share buy-ins without disturbing the underlying portfolio.
At the year end, gearing stood at 2.8% of Shareholders funds.
During the year, the level of gearing ranged from 0.2% to 3.6% with an average of 2.3%.
Share buy-in At the Annual General Meeting in March 2014, the authority to buy in up to 14.99% of the Companys Ordinary Shares was approved.
During the year, 38,000 Ordinary Shares 0.04% were bought in at a total cost of 0.4 million.
Those Shares have been cancelled rather than held in Treasury.
Once again, the Board will be seeking to renew the buy-in authority at the Annual General Meeting on 27 February 2015.
Scottish Independence Whilst the outcome of the referendum on Scottish Independence was that Scotland should remain within the United Kingdom, constitutional changes appear now to be a fixture on the political agenda.
The Boards stance on this is unchanged: we will continue to monitor developments and be prepared to take such actions as may be appropriate and in the interest of Shareholders as a whole.

The continuation vote held in 2014 was enthusiastically supported by the vast majority of shareholders.
It is of course an election year and by the time I write to Shareholders with the Interim Report in July the Company will have experienced its sixth General Election and potentially its fifth Prime Minister.
Domestic political uncertainty is at a high level and is likely to remain so at least up to and possibly beyond the date of the election.
Investment trusts, with their fixed capital structures, have a long tradition of navigating both economic and political change.
Regardless of the outcome of the election, the Board continues to have confidence in both the Managers and their value investing style.
The Board has a clear view that this style and the exposure to smaller companies will reward investors in the long term but are very conscious that there will be possibly quite long periods when both may be out of fashion.
However, it is our belief that this combination has been central to generating the excellent long term returns of the Company.
Since our formation in 1990, the NSCI XIC has risen by 11.2% per annum in total return terms.
By comparison, the Companys net asset value total return has been 14.1% per annum.
Finally, the Board very much welcomes the views of Shareholders and is always available to talk to them directly.
