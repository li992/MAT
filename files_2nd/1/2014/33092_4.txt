CHAIRMANS STATEMENT 2014 was another positive year for Derwent London.
We strengthened our income, our largest development programme is well underway and we continued to improve ourstrong financial platform.
Overview I am pleased to report another very positive year for Derwent London in 2014.
Aided by the exceptionally strong London property market the growth in net asset value NAV exceeded our expectations.
Ourlong-term strategy of investing in innovative design-led projects in Londons emerging villages appeals to occupiers and increasingly to investors, as the definition of Londons core office locations continues to evolve.
Our total return was 30% and, over the last two and five years, we have achieved total returns of 58% and 164%, respectively.
We strengthened our income in 2014 through the letting of 188,300 sq ft of space securing 9.2m of rental income.
Overall lettings achieved rents 11.2% above December 2013 estimated rental values ERV with open market lettings 18.1% above that benchmark.
Derwent Londons year end annual net contracted rents have risen to 131.7m up 4.5% in the year, and our ERV to 215.6m up 9.4%.
As a ROBERT RAYNE result of completing a number of developments in CHAIRMAN the latter part of 2014 our December EPRA vacancy rate rose to 4.1%.
This level is higher than in recent years, but only slightly above the ten-year average of 3.3%.
In current market conditions, this creates an opportunity to capture higher rents.
Lettings since the year end, including 34,150 sq ft at 1-2Stephen Street W1, have seen our vacancy ratefallto 2.1%.
Derwent Londons largest development programme to date is well underway having spent 122m on projects in 2014.

In 2015 we have already completed Turnmill EC1 and are soon to deliver 40 Chancery Lane WC2 to Publicis, We see scant evidence so far of who pre-let both office buildings.
The iconic White acommercial property slowdown Collar Factory EC1 is on track for completion in the second half of 2016. in London and we expect to see rental growth at least maintained at 6-8% across the portfolio, and investment yields to remain firm in2015.
