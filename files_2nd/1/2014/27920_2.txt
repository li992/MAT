The increase in profit has also improved the Bob Dench Groups return on equity to 10.7% from 10.1% for the previous year note 6.
Chairman Strong progress has been achieved in the Groups buy-to-let and debt purchase divisions and a banking franchise established.
All of the Groups divisions show strong growth prospects.
Buy-to-let completions increased by 82.5% to 656.6 million 2013: 359.8 million, with the year-end pipeline increasing by 78.9% to 414.8 million 2013: 231.9 million : net debt purchase investments by Idem Capital increased by 89.3% to 175.7 million 2013: 92.8 million : and Paragon Bank launched car finance, second mortgage and buy-to-let operations.
During the year the Group expanded its funding base significantly through the commencement of retail deposit taking and issues of working capital, mortgage funding and Idem debt.
Warehouse facilities for buy-to-let lending were also expanded and enhanced.
The Group again saw a strong increase of 20.2% in net cash generation to 157.8 million 2013: 131.3 million.
Group capital ratios remain strong with a core tier 1 ratio of 19.7% and leverage ratio of 8.3% and in view of this strong position I am pleased to announce a 50.0 million share buy-back programme for the forthcoming year.
In view of the results achieved and in line with our stated dividend policy, the Board has proposed a final dividend of 6.0p per share 2013: 4.8p which, when added to the interim dividend of 3.0p, gives a total dividend of 9.0p per share for the year 2013: 7.2p, an increase of 25.0%, covered 3.5 times by earnings note 6. Review of operations Paragon Mortgages Buy-to-let completions rose 82.5% to 656.6 million in 2014 as the Group broadened its distribution through its Paragon Mortgages and Mortgage Trust brands.
Included within this total was 0.5 million of lending by Paragon Bank, which commenced its buy-to-let operations during September 2014.
The buy-to-let market continues to grow, supporting the Private Rented Sector PRS which now accounts for 18% of the housing stock in England.
Tenant demand has strengthened throughout the year and recent forecasts suggest the PRS share of total housing stock will continue to grow in the future.
The competitiveness of the Groups product offerings reflects the improving funding environment, evidenced by both the increased scale and more attractive pricing of Paragons securitisation programme when compared to 2013, and, more recently, the addition of retail deposit funding through Paragon Bank.

157.8 million The aggregate new business pipeline stood at 414.8 million at the year-end, 78.9% above the level at 30 September 2013, underpinning strong growth rates into the new financial year.
Idem Capital Idem Capital, the Groups debt purchase business, completed its busiest year in 2014, with net investments totalling 175.7 million 2013: 92.8 million and with balances outstanding reaching 426.5 million 2013: 193.7 million.
Idem Capital has established itself as one of the largest acquirers of paying debt in the UK, with a 120-month estimated remaining collections ERC balance of 682.2 million at 30 September 2014 2013: 353.9 million.
ERC is a standard measure of scale in the debt purchase market, reflecting the expected gross future recoveries from purchased assets over the coming ten years.
During the year Idem Capital raised a bi-lateral non-recourse funding facility of 130.6 million from Bank of America Merrill Lynch to support the purchase of a newly acquired portfolio resulting in pre-debt investment levels of 306.3 million for the year.
In addition it completed a 55.0 million non-recourse facility from Goldman Sachs to finance certain portfolios purchased in earlier periods.
The growth in investment levels, strong cash performance and a continued focus on cost control have led to Idem Capital contributing 48.1 million to underlying profit 2013 restated : 34.5 million.
Idem Capital sees a strong pipeline leading into 2015.
Benefitting from a position on the approved purchaser panels of all the major UK banks, Idem Capital will maintain its strategy of augmenting direct investment opportunities with co-investments over the coming year.
Paragon Bank Since its formal authorisation in February 2014 by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA, Paragon Bank has launched three lending product lines and successfully established its retail deposit taking activities.
Paragon Bank provides the Group with an opportunity to diversify both its income streams and its funding sources.
Paragon Banks initial lending businesses: car finance, personal finance and buy-to-let, have now come on-stream, with the primary focus on establishing distribution with lending growth following in due course.
Paragon Bank launched its first internetonly savings products over the summer, initially in pilot mode to test systems and then, more fully, to test the marketing and distribution propositions.
Each proved successful, with Paragon Bank taking 60.1 million of deposits by the year end.
The UK retail savings market, totalling in excess of 1 trillion, is a deep and reliable source of funding for Paragon Bank and is capable of supporting its substantial growth opportunities.
In order to support the volumes anticipated in 2015, the Group injected a further 36.2 million of equity into Paragon Bank at the end of September 2014, taking its aggregate investment to 48.9 million.
The initial costs of setting up Paragon Bank, obtaining regulatory authorisation and developing business systems and processes resulted in a loss of 6.4 million 2013 restated : 1.3 million, in line with expectations.

indd 9 16 12 2014 10:43 A Strategic report A1 Chairmans statement continued Financing and capital The Boards strategy includes the delivery of a sustainable and well diversified funding base.
The most notable development over the past year has been the establishment of Paragon Bank, which is expected to provide a reliable and cost-efficient funding route for new consumer product lines, in addition to financing an increasing proportion of buy-to-let business over time.
The addition of financing facilities totalling 185.6 million into Idem Capital during the year has materially enhanced both the scale and return potential for the debt purchase business.
The Group also completed its second retail bond issue in January 2014, raising 125.0 million with a 2022 maturity.
The past year has seen significant progress in the Groups traditional warehouse to securitisation financing structures, with significantly improved terms for warehouse funding, the addition of a new 100.0 million facility from Natixis and a greater scale of issuance and year-on-year pricing improvements for its securitised bonds.
In addition to financing new originations, the securitisations in 2014 also refinanced two legacy transactions, improving funding costs and releasing inefficient cash reserves.
The creation of Paragon Bank results in regulatory supervision for the bank by the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and also consolidated supervision for the Group.
The Group has extremely strong consolidated capital and leverage ratios when compared to its regulatory requirement, with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 30 September of 19.7% and a leverage ratio of 8.3%.
The Board keeps under review the appropriate level of capital for the business to meet its operational requirements and strategic development objectives.
The strength of the Paragon Mortgages and Idem Capital businesses, the diversification in the funding base in recent years and the further opportunities for growth and sustainability provided by Paragon Bank, have created the foundations on which to develop its next phase of growth.
In view of the strong capital base and low leverage in the Companys balance sheet the Board has determined that the Group balance sheet should be rebalanced to deliver returns at a higher rate to shareholders.
The Group expects to access either the sterling senior unsecured debt market or the UK retail bond market during the coming year to add incremental long-dated debt to the Group balance sheet.
The Group will also commence a share buy-back programme, initially up to 50.0 million, to be reviewed periodically to take account of anticipated investment opportunities and the balance of the Groups debt and equity capital resources.
The Groups dividend policy, established in 2012, is to target a cover ratio of 3.0 to 3.5 times by 2016.
Whilst the top end of this range has been reached as a result of todays announcement, the Group will continue to target reductions in the cover ratio towards the lower end of the range by 2016.
Operating environment Regulation affects the business in a number of ways, with significant developments either completed or proposed during 2014.
The Group is well progressed in the authorisation process for its various operating subsidiaries, necessary as a result of the transfer of consumer regulation from the Office of Fair Trading to the FCA.
Additionally, the Group is well placed to comply with changes in the second charge conduct rules which come into force in 2016.
Finally, Paragon welcomes the debate on appropriate regulation of the buy-to-let market and notes the application of the EU Mortgage Credit Directive to a small subset of the buy-to-let market.
We believe this will have little impact on our activities.
Rising house prices have been the subject of much debate over the last year, although the rate of growth has slowed more recently.
The Group has consistently applied prudent lending criteria and maintains an in-house surveyor team to maximise its understanding of local and regional markets, both from the house price and letting demand perspectives.
This supports the Groups wider credit approach, maintaining its existing tight management of risk, and allows the Group to continue to develop its buy-to-let business with confidence.
It is likely we will see an increase in base rates during 2015 and beyond, albeit gradual, and significantly below pre-financial crisis levels.
The impact of potential interest rate increases on our customers both current and future is kept under close scrutiny: however both the strong credit and affordability metrics displayed by Paragons customer base mean the Group is well positioned to manage this change.

indd 10 16 12 2014 10:43 A Strategic report Corporate governance The Board of Directors is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012.
During the year the Group complied with the present Code and ensured that preparations were made to ensure that the revised Code, which is introduced for the financial year ending 30 September 2015, will be complied with.
As required by law the Groups remuneration policy was put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting earlier this year, where it was approved.
No changes are planned in the policy in the coming year.
Having considered developing best practice, and the tenure of the existing incumbent, the Group has decided to conduct an audit tender exercise during the forthcoming year.
A review of the Groups governance arrangements was carried out in the year, in the light of developing best practice and the increasing size, complexity and regulatory exposure of the Group.
As a result the Board formed a Risk and Compliance Committee, comprising myself and the non-executive directors, to oversee all aspects of risk management within the Group.
Fiona Clutterbuck, an independent non-executive director chairs the Committee.
The Groups corporate governance arrangements are discussed further in Section B of this Annual Report.
Board changes In accordance with the plan previously announced Nick Keen retired as Group Finance Director on 31 May 2014 and was replaced by Richard Woodman.
Nick held the post for 19 years, helping to steer the Group through many significant events.
His contribution has been greatly valued and I am pleased that the Group has retained his services as part-time chairman of Idem Capital.
My fellow directors and I wish him well for the future.
After the year end the Board was strengthened by the appointment of Hugo Tudor as an additional non-executive director.
Below Board level Dave Newcombe became the Managing Director of Idem Capital and Pam Rowland was appointed to the new post of Chief Operating Officer, responsible for the Groups customer servicing and group services functions.
Further details of these changes are given in Section A3.4.
Staff The excellent progress we have made during the year would not have been achieved without the hard work and dedication of our staff and my fellow directors.
I thank them all for their efforts.
Conclusion The strong new lending and debt purchase pipelines, together with the development of Paragon Bank, present significant sustainable growth prospects for the Group, underpinned by our funding diversification programme and improving debt capacity.
At the same time returns for shareholders are being enhanced by higher dividends and our capital management programme.
The Board and I look forward with confidence to the Groups future.
