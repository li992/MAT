Chairmans statement In 2016, we made good progress in a number of our markets, In 2016, Carillions performance while managing and mitigating the effects of more difficult trading conditions in others.
Importantly, the Board maintained its focus was led byrevenue growth on overseeing and developing the Groups strong governance and management framework, on scrutinising the Groups performance, and an increased margin on assessing the Groups risk management and control processes and on constructively challenging the Executive Directors.
In the in support services.
Groups 2015 Annual Report, the Board set three priorities for 2016, namely to oversee the development of the Groups strategy for growth, to develop the Boards effectiveness and to manage Board membership succession, alongside the development of the Groups senior management team.
We report in detail on the progress we have made with these priorities in subsequent sections of this report, but I have summarised here our main achievements in 2016, including key aspects of the Groups performance.
Financial performance Having returned to revenue growth in 2015 for the first time in five years, during which our focus was on managing the impacts of the global recession, the Group has once again delivered strong revenue growth, with total revenue of some 5.2 billion, a 14 per cent increase on 2015.
Thiswas primarily driven by organic growth in all of our four business segments Support Services, Public Private Partnership projects, MiddleEast construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East.
The Groups underlying operating margin reduced from 5.3 per cent in 2015 to 4.9 per cent, due primarily to the expected reductions in profit from the sale of equity investments in Public Private Partnership projects and from Middle East construction services.
However, these reductions were more than offset by increases in profit from Support services and Construction services excluding the Middle East.
Consequently, total underlying profit from operations increased slightly by one per cent to 235.9 million, with underlying profit before taxation and underlying earnings per share also increasing by one per cent to 178.0 million and 35.3 pence, respectively.
Cash flow from operations represented 117 per cent of profit from operations.
Net borrowing at 31 December 2016 increased to 218.9 million 2015: 169.8 million, which was due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements that followed the EU Referendum in June.
Average net borrowing increased to 586.5 million 2015: 538.9 million, but again largely due to the effect of foreign exchange movements.
It is important to note that around half the impact on net borrowing of foreign exchange movements is non-cash, because it relates to our US Private Placement loans for which interest charges and repayments at maturity are hedged.
Going forward, the Board will focus on steadily reducing the Groups net borrowing over the medium term, while continuing to invest to support the development of our business.
The Group continues to have substantial liquidity with some 1.5 billion of available funding, including 112 million of five-year funding raised from the German Schuldschein market.
The latter was secured in January 2017 to replace the 116 million of existing funding that is due to mature in 2017 and 2018.
The vast majority of the Groups 1.5 billion of funding matures in November 2020 and beyond.

Brexit Although the result of the EU Referendum, which will see the UK leave the European Union, has so far not had any significant impact on Carillion, Brexit may in due course present a number of challenges for our industry and for Carillion, although their extent is likely to remain unclear for some time.
However, prior to the Referendum, Carillion conducted an extensive review to identify the potential impacts of Brexit and to develop an action plan that would enable us to monitor potential risks and put us in the best possible position to manage them.
