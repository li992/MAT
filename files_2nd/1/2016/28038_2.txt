PIGIT pp01 16 07 06 2016 13:34 Page 05 STRATEGY CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Performance For the year ended 31 March 2016, the Companys net asset value total return was flat.
This compared favourably to the fall of 3.9 % in the FTSE All-Share Index, the Companys benchmark.
This return should be viewed in the context of the significant market volatility created by sustained political and economic uncertainty during the year, which negatively impacted global markets.
The positioning of the portfolio has largely protected shareholders from this volatility, with net assets broadly flat compared to the prior year.
Your portfolio manager, Mark Barnett, provides further detail on the performance of the portfolio during the year and sets out his strategy and outlook for the coming year in his report on pages 7 to 9. Dividend For the year ended 31 March 2016, three interim dividends of 2.9p each were paid to shareholders in September and December 2015, and March 2016.
The Board is pleased to declare a fourth interim dividend of 4.1p and a special dividend of 2.1p both to be paid on 30 June 2016 to shareholders on the register on 10 June 2016.
This gives a total dividend including specials for the year of 14.9p, representing an increase of 4.9% on the previous year which is especially pleasing given the challenging conditions referred to above.
The Companys dividend for the year excluding the special dividend has more than doubled over the last 10 years, a growth rate exceeding three times the rate of inflation in the same period.
The Board continues to recognise the importance of dividends to shareholders and is seeking to maintain its policy of real dividend growth over the medium to longer term.
Borrowing and Gearing The Boards policy is to permit gearing up to a maximum of 25% of total net assets and the Board allows the portfolio manager some discretion up to that level.
Borrowings are provided by 60 million of 4.37% senior secured notes redeemable in 2029 and a bank overdraft which was increased in the year from 110 million to 140 million to reflect the increased size of the Company.
The Board believes that these arrangements provide the portfolio manager with an optimum balance of fixed and flexible borrowing.
During the year the gearing ranged between 15% and 21%, and ended the year at 16.0% 2015:15.3%.
Issued Share Capital A total of 3,558,099 new shares were issued during the year, reflecting market demand for the Companys shares.
Of these, 998,099 arose from shareholders choosing to reinvest their dividends and a further 2,560,000 were issued at an average price excluding costs of 407.8p.
There have been no further shares issued following the year end and as at the date of this report the Companys issued share capital is 240,432,350 ordinary shares.
The Board The Board has a formal succession plan in place and regularly reviews its composition to ensure that there remains an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience, diversity and importantly for an externally managed investment trust, true independence.
The Board conducted an extensive search and selection process during the year which resulted in the identification of a number of high calibre candidates, of which two were invited to join the Board.
I am delighted to welcome Victoria Cochrane and Alan Giles.
They bring with them a wealth of business and financial experience and I am pleased to report that they have already proved to be most valuable appointments, further strengthening the existing board.

Change of Auditor Deloitte LLP, in its various forms, has been the Companys auditor since inception in 1996.
Having due regard to auditor rotation regulations, the Audit Committee undertook an audit tender during the year.
As a result of this exercise the Board, on the Audit Committees recommendation, invited Ernst & Young LLP to be the Companys auditor for the year ending 31 March 2016.
