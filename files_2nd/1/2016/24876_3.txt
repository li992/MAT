Outlook The Group benefits from the industrial and geographical spread of its markets and businesses, which not only provide a resilient base, but also opportunities for growth.
Generating over 80% of revenue and 90% of underlying operating profit from its UK and US operations, the Group principally operates in niche infrastructure markets where the overall outlook remains positive.
In Utilities, our UK and US activities are well placed to continue to benefit from the significant investment going into the replacement of ageing infrastructure and new infrastructure projects in those countries.
Overall, with wider market conditions remaining favourable, we expect our Galvanizing businesses to consolidate their strong market positions and to take advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves.
In the UK, the implementation of the Department of Transports Road Investment Strategy is entering the third year of the initial five year plan, which provides certainty of funding through to 2020 21.
We therefore have confidence that the Groups road product portfolio will continue to benefit from the increased investment in the UK road infrastructure.
In the US, the new administration has indicated that spending on US infrastructure, including building and repairing roads and bridges, is a priority and our businesses are well positioned to benefit should this increased investment materialise.
Overall, despite political and macro-economic uncertainties, 2017 is again expected to be a year of progress.
