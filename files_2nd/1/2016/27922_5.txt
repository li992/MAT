B6 RISK MANAGEMENT B6.1 Statement by the Chairman of the Risk and Compliance Committee Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Risk and Compliance Committees report as to how we have discharged our responsibilities in the last year.
Fiona J Clutterbuck The Risk and Compliance Committee is the senior risk committee within the Chairman of the Risk and Group.
It operates under an authority delegated by the Board and assists the Compliance Committee Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for risk management across the Group.
As a Committee, our primary responsibility is to maintain oversight of the effectiveness of the Groups risk management framework and of the Groups systems and controls for compliance with its statutory and regulatory obligations.
This includes satisfying ourselves that the Groups risk culture and risk appetite are adequately embedded within the organisation.
In line with my comments at the end of the previous financial year, the Committee has continued to monitor the development of the Groups risk management framework, including the expansion of its independent Risk and Compliance function.
It is pleasing to report that the Group has made effective progress in this area, consistent with its continuing aim of operating as a prudent, risk focussed, specialist lender.
The Committee has again sought to ensure that its agenda is dynamic, balancing standing items of risk management with reviews of new risks that have emerged during the year.
Core components of each meeting have included: Considering and challenging executive managements rating of the various risk categories to which the Group is exposed Reviewing the principal risks facing the Group now and in the reasonably foreseeable future Considering the potential impact of key regulatory developments: and Considering whether the scope and the capabilities of the risk management framework remain adequate given the growing breadth, scale and future plans of the business Specific areas of focus during the year have included reviews of the implications of changes to the fiscal and regulatory regime for buy-to-let lending, cyber security and incident response planning, the potential impacts on the Group of the decision to leave the European Union and progress with the integration of the acquired Paragon Bank Asset Finance business.
In addition, during the year the Committee: Reviewed the Groups ICAAP report prior to submission to the Prudential Regulation Authority Received a presentation on the ILAA report for the Groups banking subsidiary, Paragon Bank PLC PAGE 140 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Monitored progress in relation to the Groups applications for consumer credit, regulated mortgage lending and consumer buy-to-let regulatory permissions Reviewed the annual Money Laundering Reporting Officers report in relation to the adequacy of the Groups financial crime prevention arrangements Regularly reviewed progress against the Groups Compliance Monitoring Plan Considered the root causes and impact of material risk events and the adequacy of actions undertaken by management to address them During the coming year, the Committees priorities will include: Undertaking a full review of the Groups risk appetite prior to referral for approval to the Board Reviewing the Groups stress testing exercises and their results Undertaking a number of detailed reviews in relation to specific risk categories and business areas, including conduct risk, capital and liquidity risk, outsourced supplier arrangements and asset finance lending Monitoring progress with regard to the Groups strategic decision to seek regulatory approval to implement an Internal Ratings Based approach for credit risk Monitoring the Groups adherence to the FCA PRA requirements in relation to the Senior Managers and Certification Regime In summary, whilst the activities of the Committee have continued to evolve during the year, I am pleased to confirm that it has met its key objectives and carried out its role effectively.
This was confirmed by an independent review of the Board and its subsidiary Board Committees conducted in July 2016.
Looking ahead, it is clear that the economic, political and regulatory environment within which the Group operates will continue to be challenging, but the Committee is confident that the Group has the necessary skills and experience to maintain its position as a prudent, risk focussed, specialist lender.
