Chairmans review I am pleased to present Hansteens results and Strategic Report for the year ended 31 December 2016.
This is my first report as Chairman and it has been an exceptional year for the business with our portfolio and our team once again delivering record results.
EPRA NAV growth plus dividends paid in the year of 23.1p per share is a total return to shareholders of 20.8%.
Although the EU referendum provided a period of uncertainty in the property market, we were able to secure the remaining units in the Ashtenne Industrial Fund Unit Trust AIF and refinance both the Dutch and UK banking facilities on improved terms.
However, other opportunities to acquire property that we believe offer excellent value and future growth potential have remained limited due to the strong investment market and so our in-house asset management platform has focused on growing the portfolio occupancy and rent roll resulting in the highest ever number of new lettings and lease renewals, record like-for-like rent growth and the highest ever portfolio occupancy rate.
Results Normalised Income Profit NIP, which excludes profits or losses from the sale of properties, essentially the recurring earnings of the business, increased by 29.4% to 61.1 million FY 2015: 47.2 million.
