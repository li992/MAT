Chairmans Statement 2006 has been a strong year for Brixton in terms of the underlying performance of its portfolio having taken the strategic decision to dispose of a significant element of its portfolio.
The key differentiator remains our ability to outperform in rental growth terms.
The retrenchment to our core markets and the expansion of our development programme should be well timed given the shortage of new development stock and the continued strength of the London economy.
Our 2.1m sq ft development programme should provide significant upside going forward particularly with such important schemes as X2 at Heathrow where we are pioneering multi level development and the Origin site ex Guinness Brewery at Park Royal.
Results The 10.3% increase in adjusted NAV per share to 534p from 484p at the end of 2005 was driven by the continued outperformance from the property portfolio which showed a surplus of 12.3%.
The effect of the disposals during 2006, particularly the 520m of property sold in the first half, was to reduce net rental income over the year by 19.5% to 79.0m.
However, the positive impact from other activities contributed to an increase in investment profit of 8.7% to 47.6m.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 7.9p per share, making a total of 12.2p per share for the year, an increase of 3.4% over the 2005 dividend of 11.8p per share.
The 2006 increase represents 39 years of unbroken dividend increases in line with our policy of achieving consistent, progressive growth each year.
