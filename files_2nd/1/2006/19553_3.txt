08 Savills plc Report and Accounts 2006 Our Business Chairmans Statement 2006 was an excellent year for Savills and I am pleased to report an outstanding set of results following strong performances from our operating businesses.
Underlying results Underlying Group profit is calculated by adjusting reported profit before tax to deduct profits on disposals of 5.1m 2005 0.4m and share-based payment adjustment of 6.1m 2005 1.9m and add back amortisation of intangibles and impairment of goodwill of 1.8m 2005 0.9m.
Underlying Group profit before tax up 31% to 75.0m 2005 57.2m.
Underlying basic earnings per share from continuing operations based upon underlying Group profit up 23% to 40.8p 2005 33.3p.
Reported results Revenue up 38% to 517.6m 2005 373.9m.
Proposed final dividend up 38% to 11p per share 2005 8p.
Dividends In the five years to 31 December 2006 reported earnings have increased by an average of 33% per annum and dividends by an average of 27% per annum.
This year the Board has recommended an increase in the final dividend of 38% to 11p per share to those shareholders on the register on 13 April 2007, payable on 15 May 2007.
This gives a total ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 16p 2005 12p, in line with our current progressive dividend policy.
Major acquisitions During 2006, we continued to grow our range of services through the hiring of individuals and acquisition of businesses in the UK, Europe and Asia Pacific as highlighted on page 44.
Of particular importance was the acquisition of a 55% holding in Korea Asset Advisors and BHP Korea, which reinforces our position in this region.
We also acquired Hamilton Osborne King in Ireland which was later rebranded as Savills Hamilton Osborne King, opening a new market to Savills as well as reinforcing links with Irish investors.
Trammell Crow Company TCC As a result of the acquisition of TCC by CB Richard Ellis Group CBRE, our association with TCC ended and shortly after the year-end their 19.2% holding in Savills was placed in the market.
Share buyback programme and share split At the last Annual General Meeting shareholders gave authority for a limited purchase of Savills shares for cancellation of up to 10% of the issued share capital.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, no shares were repurchased for cancellation under this programme.
On 11 January 2007, coincidental with the placing of the shares previously held by TCC, we purchased 3.5m shares for cancellation.
The Company may make further purchases of shares under this authority up to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 9 May 2007.
09 Savills plc Report and Accounts 2006 Our Business Chairmans Statement As in previous years, shareholders will again be asked to consider a resolution to approve the repurchase of shares.
This is outlined in the Notice of Annual General Meeting which together with these Report and Accounts for year ended 31 December 2006 are distributed to shareholders.
At the Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2006, the shareholders passed a resolution that the existing ordinary share capital of the Company be split: each existing 5p ordinary share was divided into two new ordinary shares of 2.5p.
Board and staff Since the last Report and Accounts, a number of changes have been made to the Board.
First, following the acquisition of TCC by CBRE, the two TCC nominated Directors, William Concannon and Derek McClain, resigned with effect from 20 December 2006 and the entitlement by TCC to retain a Director on the Board lapsed.
Secondly, as planned, a new Non-Executive Director has been appointed.
I am delighted to welcome Martin Angle, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 January 2007.
We welcome the experience he will bring and the contribution he will make to our discussions.
Details of the Board, its Committees and their composition are outlined on pages 58 to 59 and in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 62 to 65.
The Board currently comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, four Independent Non-Executive Directors and five Executive Directors, which the Board considers is an appropriate balance and meets the present needs of the Group.
The Non-Executive Directors have a wide range of business experience and expertise and provide a strong independent element to the Board.
However, the Board will keep under review the need for any changes.
Savills continued growth is a result of the committed and dedicated efforts of our people whose continued ability to provide a professional service to our clients is the basis for the excellent results achieved: I thank them all for their contribution.
Our reward system, which is essentially based on team profit performance is an important mechanism in providing a balance between the interests of staff and shareholders and is more fully described in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 75.
Outlook The commercial and residential markets remain strong and in the absence of a global economic downturn we are confident that we will make good progress in 2007.
