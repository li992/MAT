JKX IFC Sect1 AW:JKX-report 30 4 07 12:23 Page 4 4 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT I am pleased to report that the Company has continued to grow its oil and gas production in 2006 resulting in a substantial increase in both revenues and profitability.
Average daily production during the period rose by 20% to 11,146 boepd 9,309 boepd, in spite of delivery constraints on our Ukrainian gas production.
Oil and gas revenues rose by 59% in the period to $131.7million $82.9million.
This reflects not only increases in production and the continued strength of international oil prices but, significantly, a further 55% rise in domestic Ukrainian gas prices over the period.
Profit before tax more than doubled to $109.2million $51.3million, with a healthy rise in operating cash flow to $75.6million $56.9million.
Profit after tax rose to $77.8million $37.2million.
It should be noted that profit figures include the beneficial effect of a $15.2million reversal of a portion of an impairment provision made in 1998 against Ukrainian producing assets.
Capital expenditure increased to $43.4million $32.3million, with more than 85% expended in development of our Ukrainian assets.
Cash resources at year end totalled $81.1million $56.9million.
Our production base and focus of operations remain in Ukraine with a continuing commitment to raise the level of our investment in the country by fully developing the Companys current assets and broadening its licence portfolio.
A measure of this commitment is the extent of the drilling programme completed in 2006 where a total of 9 new wells were drilled and 5 well interventions workovers completed on our four wholly owned production licences at Poltava.
In addition to development wells, the Company drilled its first exploration well in the third quarter on the Zaplavskoye exploration licence.
The well did not encounter hydrocarbons but subsequent reprocessing of the data has indicated the well may have been drilled off-structure.
The Company was successful in the period in confirming its exclusive rights to existing wells on its Elizavetovskoye exploration licence and continues to seek agreement with the state to acquire these production facilities.
The Chervonoyarske East exploration licence was formally awarded in a Ukrainian government auction in January 2006 and existing seismic data was purchased and Rt Hon Lord Fraser interpreted during the period.
of Carmyllie QC Chairman In Georgia, the Company retains its 4% net profit interest in its large Black Sea exploration licence, where Anadarko is operator and leader of the consortium.
We believe that the first well commitment is unlikely to be met before 2008.
During the reporting period, the Company fulfilled its seismic commitment over two of the prospects identified in its B Golitza and B1 Golitza exploration licences in eastern Bulgaria, and subsequently increased its interest to 50% to become operator.
The Company has contracted a 2,000HP rig to spud a 4,900m well on the B Golitza licence in the second quarter of 2007.
The Company is participating in the three Karakilise onshore exploration licences in south eastern Turkey JKX: 30%.
During the period, the existing oil discovery well was deepened, but failed to find oil in the lower horizons: a 2D seismic shoot is planned for the second half of 2007 in the southern part of the licence area.
The Company added a third licence in the period to its existing two onshore exploration licences in Thrace JKX: 25% : additional 2D seismic will be shot in the second quarter of 2007 to firm up two promising leads with a view to identifying drilling targets for 2008.
In Italy, the Company has continued during the period to develop its onshore asset portfolio which includes the gas discovery at Aglavizza JKX: 100% : exploration permits at Civita JKX: 30%, Fiume Arrone JKX: 10%, Montalbano JKX: 40% : and an application for the Corropoli permit JKX: 100%.
We are currently considering options which would maximise value for our shareholders from this modest, but attractive portfolio which contains assets in an area that is of considerable interest from a number of E&P companies.

The second 1.303 1.184 new Well R102 on the south of the Rudenkovskoye field is scheduled for completion in 1.013 April 2007 and will provide us with an extensive data set from the logging and coring 1 programme undertaken.
Hydraulic fracture stimulation of our producing Well R101 in the north of the field is scheduled for the second quarter of 2007 and will provide us with 0 the information with which to formulate the best development plan for this technically challenging field.
2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Spudding of our first exploration well on the B Golitza licence in Bulgaria is scheduled Dividends $m for April 2007 with a planned drilling duration of 120 days for the 4,900m well.
Further seismic reprocessing and or acquisition work is also scheduled Up 108% over both our Bulgarian and Turkish licences during the year.
Our priorities for expansion of the Companys interests are acquisition of development projects in Ukraine and Russia and farm-in to Our production base and focus exploration projects in eastern and central Europe.
