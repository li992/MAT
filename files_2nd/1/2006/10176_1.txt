MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL Chairmans Statement I am delighted to report on another year of tremendous growth for the Group with record levels of turnover and profits.
At the beginning of April, Steve Ingham was appointed Chief Executive and under his stewardship we have continued our strategy of growing organically, with start-ups in five new countries, opening and expanding offices in our established countries and broadening the disciplines in existing markets.
The Group has many opportunities to continue its growth and is particularly well positioned with its strong brand, international network of offices, multi-discipline offering and, above all, its high quality management and staff.
Financial highlights Turnover for the year ended 31 December 2006 increased 23.9% to 649.1m 2005: 523.8m.
Gross profits from permanent placements grew more rapidly than from temporary placements.
This movement in business mix, together with an increase in margins on temporary placements, contributed to an increase in gross margin to 53.7% 2005: 51.1%.
Given the Groups high operational gearing, combined with managements close attention to costs, operating profits increased by 46.4% to a record 97.4m 2005: 66.5m.
Profit before tax was 97.0m 2005: 66.1m and basic earnings per share increased by 32.4% to 19.6p 2005: 14.8p.
Dividends and share repurchases With strong growth in earnings, it is the Boards intention to continue its policy of continually reviewing the annual dividend with a view to maintaining it at a level which it believes is sustainable throughout economic cycles.
Cash generated in excess of these levels will continue to be returned to shareholders through share repurchases.
With the strong growth in profits, earnings and cash generation, the Board is recommending an increase in the total dividend per share for the year of 20%.
A final dividend of 4.2p 2005: 3.5p per share is proposed which, together with the interim dividend of 1.8p 2005: 1.5p per share paid in October, makes a total dividend for the year of 6.0p 2005: 5.0p per share.
The final dividend will be paid on 5 June 2007 to those shareholders on the register at 4 May 2007.
The total dividend is covered 3.3 times by basic earnings per share of 19.6p.
We continued to make share repurchases throughout 2006 acquiring 23.3m shares for 83.4m, including related expenses, at an average price per share of 355.8p.
At the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2007, we will be seeking shareholders consent for a renewal of the authority to repurchase up to 10% of the issued shares.
16 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 Employees I wish to express my thanks to the staff worldwide for their commitment, loyalty and efforts throughout the year which has delivered this outstanding performance.
Board of Directors On 6 April 2006, Steve Ingham was formally appointed as Chief Executive, succeeding Terry Benson who announced his decision to retire as Chief Executive in December 2005.
Steve Ingham, who has been with the Group for 20 years, has been a member of the senior management for much of that time and a key contributor in establishing the current Group strategy.
Prospects The Group has excellent growth prospects across all of its regions.
We are particularly excited about the opportunities in North America where, having already successfully established a foot-hold, we will continue to roll-out our strategy.
In Continental Europe, market deregulation will continue to have a positive impact on our business.
With its strong brand, international network of offices, multi-discipline offering and, above all, its high quality management and staff, Michael Page is well positioned in all of its markets.
We will make a statement in respect of our trading for the first quarter on 5 April 2007.
