In 2006 we completed the acquisition of a 40% interest in the 910 MW and 30 MIGD gross Hidd power and water plant in Bahrain, the coal fired 632 MW Coleto Creek power station in Texas, the 140 MW Indian Queens oil fired peaking plant in Cornwall, UK and the 436 MW Levanto wind farm portfolio, which has wind farms that are currently operating or under construction in Germany and France plus further potential growth from a pipeline of development opportunities.
These acquisitions all met our financial criteria whilst fitting in with our strategic aims.
The Hidd acquisition continued our growth in the Middle East in a new market for us Bahrain.
Coleto Creek increased our presence in Texas and added good fuel diversification.
The Indian Queens peaking plant increased our ability to provide system support.
Levanto represented our first major renewables business in Europe and, in addition to providing fuel diversification, gives the business immediate scale and credibility in this increasingly important area of electricity generation.

On your behalf I would like to thank them for our business.
This, coupled with a largely forward contracted position all for their contribution to the continued success of the Company.
for our merchant capacity, gives us confidence that 2007 will be a year Whenever I visit our assets and in 2006 I visited plants in Australia of further growth.
We will continue with our disciplined approach to and the Middle East, I have been very impressed by the enthusiasm pursuing value enhancing growth opportunities in our core regions, demonstrated by the employees for our business and the obvious alongside our commitment to increase our dividend pay-out ratio pride they all take in their work.
We take our commitment to safety very seriously.
One of our core values is to instil safe behaviour in everything we do.
We therefore decided to ask DuPont, an acknowledged world authority in this field, to carry out a safety review at a selection of our assets around the globe to ensure that our commitment to excellent health and safety standards, Sir Neville Simms across our portfolio, is checked and challenged and that best practice Chairman is shared by all our plants.
Health and safety is of vital importance in our business and therefore the accident frequency rate is one of the non-financial key performance indicators we use in managing our business.
Once again, I would like to express my thanks to our Non-Executive Directors, whose guidance, challenge and support continues to be invaluable.
During the year there were changes at Board level.
Following the retirement of Jack Taylor, as a Non-Executive Director, at last years Annual General Meeting, John Roberts, formerly Chief Executive of United Utilities plc, has been appointed as a Non-Executive Director.
John brings related power industry and international experience to the Board and has already made a positive contribution to the business.
