Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 3 Chairmans statement At the end of 2006 a number of new directors were appointed to the Board and I was appointed Chairman.
Since that time, the Board as a whole has embarked on an in-depth review of each of the Companys operations.
Since I was not at Spirent during most of 2006 my comments are necessarily limited.
However, it is already clear that the Company has a strong base of technology and customer relationships, reecting a very talented group of employees.
I would like to express our thanks to them for their contributions during a year of transition and some market uncertainty.
We also nd ourselves with a strong balance sheet, largely due to the sale of the HellermannTyton business in February.
Overall the Company has a sound foundation on which to build for which thanks are due to a number of Board members who departed during the year.
As you will read below, conditions in some of our markets are somewhat challenging.
However, in reality the outlook for Spirents financial performance in 2007 and beyond will be more affected by the actions resulting from the Boards review than by any foreseeable market developments.
The major purpose of the Boards review is to decide where to focus our resources and how to be the most efficient and effective competitor in our chosen areas.
We expect to announce the results of the review prior to the Annual General Meeting on 9 May and look forward to communicating with shareholders again at that time.
