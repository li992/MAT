Chairmans statement For Wilson Bowden, 2006 was a year of strong residential sales volume growth in a more stable housing market, coupled with another very successful year in our commercial development activities.
Group turnover increased by 8.2% to 1,331.4m 2005: 1,230.8m and profit before tax, after goodwill impairment, reorganisation costs and costs relating to the potential sale of the Company, rose by 1.9% to 220.5m 2005: 216.4m.
Background to the Offer from Barratt Developments PLC You will be aware that on 5th February 2007 we announced that the Board had agreed the terms of a recommended cash and shares offer to be made by Barratt Developments PLC to acquire Wilson Bowden plc.
The acquisition by Barratt is being effected by a scheme of arrangement.
On 17th July 2006, Wilson Bowden announced that it was aware that an independent review of the Wilson family holdings in Wilson Bowden was being conducted.
In November 2006, the Board commenced a formal process to assess the interest of a number of parties in Wilson Bowden and, following press speculation, Wilson Bowden announced on 26th November 2006 that it was in preliminary discussions with a number of parties regarding a possible offer.
The Board considers the terms of the acquisition to be fair and reasonable and it intends unanimously to recommend that Wilson Bowden shareholders vote in favour of the scheme of arrangement.
The Directors of Wilson Bowden have irrevocably undertaken to vote in favour of the scheme of arrangement in respect of their own beneficial holdings of shares in the Group, which in aggregate amount to approximately 22.2% of the Group's existing issued share capital and the Wilson family holdings are also supporting the acquisition with similar irrevocable commitments.
Further details in respect of the Offer and the scheme of arrangement will be sent to all shareholders in due course.
Group results for 2006 A summary of our 2006 results is shown in the table below: 2006 2005 Group turnover 1,230.8m 1,331.4m Operating profit David Wilson Homes 208.4m 203.3m Wilson Bowden Developments 41.5m 41.1m Total operating profit 244.4m 249.9m Share of loss of joint venture 0.2m - Finance costs net 22.7m 20.7m Adjusted profit before tax 227.0m 223.7m Goodwill impairment, reorganisation costs and costs relating to the potential sale of the Company 6.5m 7.3m Group profit before tax 220.5m 216.4m Net interest cover 10.7 times 11.5 times Earnings per Share 159.2p 162.7p Return on average capital employed 19.5% 20.5% Net borrowings 168.6m 117.0m Gearing at the year end 14.5% 11.2% 2006 dividend no final recommended for 2006 46.5p 16.5p Before goodwill impairment, reorganisation costs and costs relating to the potential sale of the Company.
At the start of 2006, I said that David Wilson Homes had the plots and planning in place to deliver substantial sales volume growth but that the outturn would depend on a mixture of our own efforts and market conditions.
I also said that the outcome in 2006 would depend on the extent to which the market in the north of England showed the same improvement in buyer confidence as had taken place elsewhere.
That did not occur and, as a result, while we delivered improved results, it was at a cost to our operating margins, before goodwill impairment, reorganisation costs and costs relating to the potential sale of the Company, which fell by 1.5% to 18.2%.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2006 1 Chairmans statement continued In the event, David Wilson Homes saw some improvement in the housing market across the country, but this improvement was not sustained beyond April in the northern regions of England.
With the 5.9% increase in average site numbers, and a strong performance in the south, we achieved an excellent 9.1% increase in unit sales.
Average selling price also rose, by 3.2%, to 204,600 2005: 198,200 driven by a mixture of unit size, price increase, and site and product mix.
Coupled with the impact of 23.3m of serviced land sales 2005: 37.3m, these changes increased turnover by 10.9% to 1,145.8m.
In addition, the second half increase in new sites raised the average number of outlets on sale last year to 143 2005: 135.
This not only boosted our full year sales, but also allowed us to exit the year with a Group carry forward order book equivalent to around 26% of our 2007 budgeted sales compared to 19% coming into the year.
We are looking to maintain, and hopefully improve upon that position during 2007.
As a result of the continued efforts made during 2006, David Wilson Homes entered 2007 not only with a much improved forward order book, but also with build which is further ahead than for many years, and a stronger position on land and planning than for some time.
We expect to have in excess of 10% more sites on sale throughout the year than we had in 2006.
I therefore believe that, given a favourable market, David Wilson Homes is capable of delivering another year of strong volume growth in 2007.
On commercial development activities, we had another record year, despite anticipating a year of consolidation.
This result therefore represents another excellent achievement after several years of particularly strong operating profit growth in Wilson Bowden Developments.
The continuation of the strong investor demand for development in prime locations, coupled with the range of projects across all commercial sectors, again produced record operating profits, before costs relating to the potential sale of the Company, at 41.5m 2005: 41.1m : continuing strong margins: and an excellent return on capital.
We also completed on the sales of 142 residential units in Wilson Bowden City Homes 2005: 180, the reduction being entirely due to the timing of site availability.
It has been particularly pleasing to win a new generation of town centre schemes.
During 2006, the business enjoyed further success in securing new opportunities both on its traditional commercial sites and on new longer term mixed-use projects at Barnstaple and Kidderminster, which have been added to our already impressive range of mixed-use, town centre regeneration schemes.
These successes will all benefit the years ahead.
The projects already in place are capable of delivering further profit growth in 2007, assuming the strength of the market.
The overall Group results show, once more, the benefits of a well spread portfolio of activities.
In the case of David Wilson Homes in particular, we have demonstrated the wisdom of the growth strategy we have outlined in recent years.
We foresaw some time ago, the inevitability of a decline in housing operating margins as a result of the combined impact of relatively low selling price inflation and the addition of substantial numbers of new sites coming on stream at margins no higher than that at which they were originally bought.
Our response was to invest in the growth necessary to stabilise and subsequently grow profits.
The benefits of this approach can be seen in the 2006 performance.
I believe that 2007 will again prove the wisdom of that strategy on housing, while on commercial developments we have the quality and quantity of projects to deliver further growth.
Dividend Over the past few years our dividend policy has sought to balance dividend increases with earnings growth and capital needs, while maintaining adequate cover to provide comfort throughout the economic cycle.
In continuance of that policy, we increased the interim payment by 10% to 16.5p 2005: 15.0p.
It is a term of the proposed sale of the Group to Barratt Developments PLC that Wilson Bowden shareholders will not be entitled to any final dividend and accordingly the Board is not recommending the payment of a final dividend for 2006.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2006 2 Chairmans statement continued Balance sheet and land In 2006, we made net land purchases of 378.6m 2005: 297.5m and carried forward a further 275.9m of terms agreed deals into 2007.
At 31st December 2006 our residential land bank stood at 32,808 plots 2005: 31,138, of which 18,389 have planning 2005: 18,069.
The increase has, once again, been delivered by a mixture of traditional land buying, greater concentration on long term and strategic land, success with more recent sources such as Pathfinders, and the winning of preferred developer status on town and city centre regeneration projects.
We also hold 9,367 acres of strategic land, having successfully achieved planning on several significant sites during the year.
In 2006, 1,085 plots were delivered into the immediate land bank from strategic sites.
The strength of our land bank and the assurance it provides as to the deliverability of future plots, give us considerable confidence as to the deliverability of our ambitious sales volume targets over the coming years.
During the year, mainly as a result of increased land spend and investment in work in progress, the Groups borrowings rose to 168.6m 2005: 117.0m.
Despite this, our continued modest level of year end gearing 14.5% 2005: 11.2% provides more than sufficient capacity for the planned further increases in the land bank necessary for future growth of the business.
Long term value creation In the current circumstances, it is worth recording that, since Wilson Bowden was floated on the London Stock Exchange on 12th March 1987: Profit before tax has grown by 1,146% from 1987 to year ended 2006, equivalent to compound annual growth rate CAGR of 14.2%.
There has been 789% growth in Earnings per Share from 1987 to year ended 2006, equivalent to CAGR of 12.2%.
1,000 invested in Wilson Bowden at the time of the Initial Public Offering was worth 17,015 at 31st December 2006, an increase of 1,602%.
Total Shareholder Return TSR over the period has been 1,857%.
Wilson Bowden has increased its housing completions from 1,305 in 1987 to 5,628 in 2006.
Management, staff and suppliers On behalf of the Board I would like to thank our management, staff and suppliers for their efforts and support throughout the last year.
I am conscious that the ongoing sale process has been unsettling and has created some uncertainty for those involved with the Group.
It is a tribute to the loyalty, hard work and professionalism of our staff that, despite the potential diversions, we delivered an excellent result for 2006.
I am also conscious of the ongoing efforts which are being made in the area of health and safety.
This is of prime importance to all of us in Wilson Bowden and I am again most grateful for the contribution made by everyone involved in maintaining our high standards throughout the year.
In addition, I would like to pay tribute to Graham Brown, who left us on 31st December 2006, after 19 years of service to the Company and the Board, first as Company Secretary and Financial Controller and latterly as Group Finance Director.
We are most grateful to Graham for his loyal service, and wish him well for the future.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2006 3 Chairmans statement continued Outlook While this is obviously a time of great change, I am clear about two important things.
The first is that we have put in place the foundations for another excellent years trading in 2007, market permitting.
The forward order books for both residential and commercial, the progress on land, planning and build, and the improvements in the way we manage the business should all make possible a year of further progress.
Secondly I am confident that the proposed transfer of ownership of the business will open up many opportunities, and will ensure the continued growth of the business in the years ahead.
I am convinced that the proposed changes are right for the Company, and I wish the business, and its dedicated staff, every success in the future.
