Chairmans Statement The year ended 31st March 2006 saw further good progress for the Group with market share gains in both divisions.
Sales momentum remained strong, across both the Industrial and Domestic Divisions, supported by a high level of public sector spending, notably in Health, Education, Social Housing and infrastructure projects.
We have continued our focus on the repair and maintenance markets where there is a lower element of discretionary spend than in the improvement sector.
Two acquisitions were completed during the second half of the year for a total consideration in cash of 23.1m: A. Warren & Sons Limited in December 2005 and Peter Warry Price Tool Sales Limited in March 2006.
Both businesses are performing in line Chairman with expectations and are expected to be earnings enhancing in the first full year after acquisition.
The Group remains in robust health.
The Board remains confident that BSS is well positioned to continue to drive improvements in the existing business and that our strategy for growth is sound.
Financial Performance This is the first full set of audited results produced in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
As announced previously the introduction of IFRS has had the effect of reducing our profits compared to those previously reported under UK GAAP, principally as a result of adjustments relating to pensions and a one-off adjustment relating to the treatment of our Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
On an IFRS basis, Group sales of 863.6m were up 15.7% 2005: 746.5m Profit before tax of 36.9m was up by 12.2% 2005: 32.9m Statutory earnings per share of 21.0 pence were up 6.6% 2005: 19.7 pence Under previously reported UK GAAP profit before tax, goodwill, amortisation and exceptional items would have increased by 22.6% to 42.3m 2005: 34.5m.
On the same basis, earnings per share would have increased by 25.2% to 25.8 pence 2005: 20.6 pence.
Good working capital management meant that cash flow before acquisitions remained positive despite high sales growth.
After expenditure of 23.1m on the acquisition of Warrens and Price Tools, net debt increased by 15.6m to 77.9m 2005: 62.3m.
Interest cover improved to a very healthy 11.2 times, compared with last year of 9.3 times, and well in excess of our minimum internal target of 5.0 times.
2 During May 2006, the Group has raised $125m through a private placement of fixed rate guaranteed unsecured notes in the US, with maturities at 7 and 10 years, at competitive interest rates.
The proceeds have been used to pay down existing bank debt.
On a proforma basis, the Group now has 102m of committed but unutilised banking facilities.
Net assets have increased to 122.0m from 94.2m last year.
The Board is recommending a 20.0% increase in the final dividend to 3.525 pence 2005: 2.9375 pence.
This represents an increased total dividend for the year as a whole of 20.0% to 4.950 pence 2005: 4.125 pence.
Management and Employees BSS has cemented its position as an employer of choice.
Our talented, enthusiastic and committed employees remain the cornerstone of our success.
On behalf of the Board I would like to publicly recognise the importance of their contribution.
Since the year end, we announced that Kevin Higginson, Group Finance Director, would be leaving the Group and that Roddy Murray would be joining the Board as Group Finance Director with effect from today.
I would like to thank Kevin for his major contribution over the last 5 years in turning around the fortunes of the Group.
We are delighted to welcome Roddy Murray and believe his wide ranging business experience will be a great asset to the Group as it continues to evolve and expand.
It is good news for all BSS stakeholders that we have been able to effect a smooth succession and attract another top class executive to the BSS Board.
Summary I am proud that BSS today is one of the most highly regarded companies in our sector.
We are focused on growth market sectors and our enviable reputation for service and delivery is winning us market share.
I look forward to the future with confidence.
Peter Warry, CHAIRMAN 30th May 2006 3 The Group has continued to invest in storage solutions to support continued growth.
