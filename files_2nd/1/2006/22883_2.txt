209183 Absolute pp01-pp17 4 5 07 14:00 Page 2 Chairmans Statement Introduction I am pleased to present Shareholders with the Annual Report of Dexion Absolute Limited for the year to 31 December 2006.
It has been another year of significant growth for the Company.
In response to continued existing and new investor demand, the Company raised 226.4 million of net proceeds through a multi-currency issue of C shares in September 2006, the net proceeds of which were substantially invested, or committed to be invested, on 1 October 2006.
These C shares were subsequently converted to new ordinary shares on 15 November 2006.
This issue involved further offerings of Sterling, US Dollar and Euro shares totalling net 151.08 million, net $49.47 million and net 31.22 million and, for the first time, an offering of Australian Dollar shares totalling net A$69.44 million.
The issue was well supported by a substantial number of existing shareholders but, in addition, attracted a broad range of new institutional and private wealth management clients from an increasingly wide range of jurisdictions globally.
The Company begins 2007 with net assets of 791 million and remains, by a considerable margin, the largest exchange listed fund of hedge funds globally and a benchmark for the sector.
As at 1 January 2007, the net assets of the Company were invested in a diversified portfolio of 50 hedge funds across six hedge fund strategies.
Performance Aided by continued strong asset performance and ongoing secondary market demand, each of the Companys share classes traded at a premium to net asset value throughout the reporting period.
Over the year, the net asset value of the Companys shares appreciated by 8.13%: while the US$ and shares appreciated by 8.79% and 6.32% respectively.
The new AUS$ shares returned 4.46% in the three month period from launch to 31 December 2006.
The annualised net asset value return for the shares from inception to 31 December 2006 was 9.56% and annualised volatility remains low at 3.14%.
All of the hedge fund strategies in which the Company invests, with the exception of portfolio hedge, were profitable with a significant contribution coming from the Companys long short equities managers.
The differences in performance between the Companys classes of shares arise from the currency hedging which is an integral part of the Companys investment strategy and eliminates volatility that would otherwise have occurred as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates over the period.
Changes in the level of Sterling, Euro, and more recently, Australian Dollar interest rates versus US Dollar interest rates cause the hedge to have either a positive or negative effect on NAV performance.
Investment outlook The Companys Investment Adviser believes that the majority of the hedge fund strategies in which the Company invests continue to offer significant opportunities to make positive returns.
FTSE 250 Index The Company remains a FTSE 250 Index constituent and this position was consolidated post the conversion of C shares noted above.
Index inclusion has provided an important incremental source of secondary market demand with the Company also benefiting from increased investor interest.
Annual General Meeting I look forward to welcoming Shareholders to the fourth Annual General Meeting of the Company at 9.30 a. m. on 15 June 2007, which will be held at Trafalgar House, Les Banques, St. Peter Port, Guernsey.
