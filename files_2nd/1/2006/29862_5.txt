TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC CHAIRMANS STATEMENT I am pleased to report strong performance by the Company for the year under review.
Net asset value per share at yearend was 348.18 pence, an increase of 75.1% for the year.
The share price at 30 April 2006 was 310.25 pence, compared with 167.25 pence at the beginning of the financial year, an increase of 85.5%.
Over the year, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the S&P IFC Investable Composite Index both increased 71.1% and 73.5% respectively.
Since inception, the net asset value of the Company has risen by 948.4% in Sterling terms compared with a rise of 556.0% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and 503.9% for the S&P IFC Investable Composite Index.
The Managers Report and Portfolio Review pages 15 to 17 give a detailed analysis of the Companys performance over the year.
The portfolio is managed using the value style of investing.
This requires a detailed research of stocks, and the Manager purchases only those trading at less than their assessed value.
At the year end, 99.2% of the Companys total assets were invested in equities, with the remaining 0.8% being held in liquid assets.
The general policy of the Board is to be fully invested.
At 30 April 2006, the Company had total assets of 1,866.20 million, compared with 1,065.96 million at 30 April 2005.
Comparative figures for the year ended 30 April 2005 have been restated to be in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The effect of this is shown in detail on pages 42 and 43.
Whilst the Company is not technically required to adopt IFRS, the Board felt as a leading Investment Trust in its sector and one of the largest in the UK, it would lead the way by fully adopting IFRS for this year end, and released its results for the six month period ended 31 October 2005 under IFRS.
The Board of Directors has proposed a cash dividend of 2.76 pence per Ordinary Share 2005: 2.67 pence.
The dividend will be paid on 4 October 2006 to Shareholders on the register at the close of business on 1 September 2006, subject to the approval of Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, which will be held on 28 September 2006.
The Board keeps the discount under continual review and remains prepared to buy back shares when it believes this to be in shareholders best interests.
It last did this when the share price was unusually volatile in the run up to the continuation vote and warrant redemption exercise in 2004.
The Board believes a discretionary rather than formulaic approach is appropriate.
There continue to be worthwhile investment opportunities, and indeed performance during the year under review as a fully invested Company has produced an excellent performance.
The Board has continued to monitor the Investment Managers performance.
Last year it confirmed the management fee at 1% of net asset value and has subsequently examined the secretarial and administration fees.
These services, since the Companys inception, have been provided by Franklin Templeton Investment Management Limited at a fee of 0.25%.
The Board is satisfied that administration can be carried out effectively and efficiently by continuing these arrangements and has negotiated a reduction in the fee to 0.20%, with effect from 1 February 2006.
This will result in a reduction in fees for the year of 936,000 based on 30 April 2006 closing net assets.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, has increased directors fees.
The increasing workload, including new corporate governance and audit requirements, the potential legal liability to which directors are subject, and the need to attract and retain high quality directors, justifies such an increase.
The new annual figures are: Chairman 50,000, Chairman of the Audit Committee 40,000, and non-executive directors 30,000.
Directors receive no other benefits.
The payment figures shown in this report reflect partial payment of these increases during 2005 2006.
Sam Ginn is retiring from the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 28 September 2006.
He joined the Board in December 2003 at the time of its significant restructuring.
We shall miss his sound business judgment and global experience and we thank him warmly for his contribution.
The Board is proposing to elect to the Board at its September meeting Neil Collins, the former Business Editor of the Daily Telegraph.
Mr Collins, who is 59, will be recommended to shareholders for re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 28 September 2006 and his biographical details appear in the Directors Report.
Since the year end at 30 April 2006, there has been a significant downward adjustment in equity markets worldwide and this has affected both the Companys net asset value and the share price.
At 15 June 2006 the respective figures were 274.28p and 231.00p.
At these levels the net asset value has risen by 37.9% and the share price by 38.3% since 30 April 2005, representing good positive returns to shareholders.
The Board continues to believe that emerging markets offer significant value investment opportunities to a well managed fund.
