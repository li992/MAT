6661 Impax R&A 2010 Text:6661 Impax R&A 2010 Text 31 3 11 13:43 Page 3 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT After a volatile first six months, Impax Environmental Markets plc IEM or the Company ended 2010 strongly to deliver a creditable net asset value NAV return over the year as a whole.
Against a backdrop of improving economic conditions, the Company benefited from its exposure to industrial companies in developed markets, businesses serving demand for clean products and services in Asia and rising commodity prices.
Energy efficiency markets were notably buoyant during the year as many governments introduced measures to curb energy use in the face of rising oil prices and mounting concerns over energy security and climate change.
In contrast, companies active in the renewable energy sector generally disappointed shareholders as the Spanish government announced retrospective reductions in solar power tariffs, prompting concerns that other countries may follow suit.
Investment Performance During the year, the Companys NAV per Ordinary Share taking into account the dilution effect of the warrants in issue at 31 December 2009 increased from 127.2p to 142.7p, a rise of 12.2%.
The share price rose 9.0% from 119.1p to 129.8p.
Over the same period, the MSCI World and the MSCI World Small Cap Indices capital return priced in Pounds Sterling rose by 13.0% and 28.3% respectively.
We have traditionally compared our performance against the MSCI World indices.
During the past year, companies involved in environmental markets have generally performed less well than the MSCI World Small Cap index.
The Companys five year performance track record remains compelling.
During the five years to 31 December 2010, the NAV of IEM plus dividends paid returned 56.4% compared to net total returns in Sterling terms of 23.6% for the MSCI World Index and 36.8% for the MSCI World Small Cap Index.
The Companys investments in six unquoted companies accounted for 4% of NAV at the end of the year, approximately the same proportion as at the end of 2009.
Since the end of the year, the valuation of two unquoted holdings has been written down to reflect specific events that are discussed in the Managers Report.
Continuation Vote In May 2010, the first continuation vote required by the Companys Articles of Association was passed by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting AGM.
Henceforth, the Articles of Association require a continuation vote to be proposed at every third AGM of the Company, the next such vote being in 2013.
Discount During the year under review, the Companys Ordinary Shares traded at an average discount to net asset value NAV of 9.9%.
The Board responded to widening of the discount by buying-in an aggregate of 5,802,032 of the Companys own Ordinary Shares at an average discount of 11.4%.
The Ordinary Shares ended the year at a discount to NAV of 9.0%.
The Board will continue to exercise its powers to buy back the Companys own shares when it considers the circumstances to be appropriate.

As a result 18,666,085 new Ordinary Shares were issued at a subscription price of 96p per Ordinary Share.
The mid-market price of the Ordinary Shares at the close of business on the final subscription date of 15 June 2010 was 114.5p, representing a 19.2% premium to the subscription price.
Dividend The Companys net revenue return for the year was 2.6 million.
As a result, the directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 0.75p per share.
If approved at the Companys AGM, this dividend will be paid on 17 May 2011 to shareholders on the register as at the close of business on 15 April 2011.
As the primary objective of the Company is capital growth, it should not be assumed that this level of dividend will be paid in future years.
Board of Directors The Company was launched in February 2002, when four of the five directors serving during the year under review were appointed.
During 2010, the Companys Nominations Committee conducted a review of the composition of the Board and it was agreed that it was an appropriate time to appoint two new directors.
Following completion of a search, Julia Le Blan and William Rickett were appointed to the Board on 27 January 2011.
The new directors bring a strong set of skills and breadth of experience to the Board.
Julia was a tax partner at Deloitte from 1990 until her retirement in 2009: and William was Director General, Energy in the Department of Energy & Climate Change and chairman of the Governing Board of the International Energy Agency until October 2009.
Bill Brown will retire at the forthcoming AGM and will not stand for re-election.
My Board colleagues and I would like to thank Bill for his valuable input and service since the Companys formation and we wish him every success for the future.
The directors have determined that, in line with current best practice, all directors of the Company will stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM and at every AGM thereafter.
Current Status and Outlook The start to 2011 has been challenging for the Company, with positive performance from many of its largest holdings offset by weakness in Asia and in companies unable to pass on rising costs to their customers.
As at 25 March 2011, the NAV had fallen 0.6% since the start of the year, while the share price had fallen by 5.3%.
The MSCI World Index capital return in Pounds Sterling had risen 0.8% over the same period.

Furthermore, the unfolding situation at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan has led to a renewed debate about the long-term future of nuclear power.
It is too early to accurately assess the long-term impact of these events, although they are undoubtedly positive for both the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors, both of which are performing well.
With a current price earnings ratio of 16x, the valuation of the IEMs portfolio remains at the bottom end of the historical range of 16-22x.
Furthermore, the earnings of the Companys holdings are expected to grow at 25% over the next 12 months on average.
Therefore, the Manager and the Board continue to believe that IEM offers an attractive opportunity for investors.
