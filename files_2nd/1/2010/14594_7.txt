Chairmans Statement We are very pleased with the groups performance in 2010, with trading exceeding our expectations across all four business segments.
Dear Shareholder I am pleased to report that Spectris achieved a record performance in 2010, in terms of both revenue and adjusted operating profit for the year.
Throughout the downturn, we maintained the focus on our strategic objectives.
As a result, our acquisition activity, continued expenditure on research and development, strength in emerging markets and good cost control have enabled us to benefit more quickly from the improvement in the economy than following previous downturns.
Improving customer demand led to revenue for the year increasing by 14.6% to 901.9 million 2009: 787.3 million and adjusted operating profit increasing by 79% to 142.1 million 2009: 79.2 million.
On a reported basis, revenue growth was 14.6%, with acquisitions contributing 1.5% and currency also contributing 1.5%.
On a constant currency organic like-for-like basis, growth was therefore 11.6%.
Operating margins were 15.8%, an increase of 5.7 percentage points compared with the prior year.
The growth in operating profit was due to a combination of increased volume, an expansion in gross margins, and cost benefits resulting from restructuring and integration John Hughes activities we had implemented the previous year.
Chairman Profit before tax increased by 94% to 132.3 million 2009: 68.2 million and earnings per share increased by 91% from 45.4 pence to 86.6 pence.
Cash conversion was robust, with 112% of operating profit converted into operating cash, largely due to a reduction in working capital of approximately 20 million.
Net debt 14.6% decreased by 37.7 million from 123.9 million to 86.2 million, 0.5X EBITDA.
Net interest Increase in reported revenue costs were 9.8 million.
At 31 December 2010, the group had cash of 64.7 million and undrawn committed facilities of 80 million.
This strong financial position gives us the flexibility to continue to pursue our strategic objectives.
28.0p The Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 20.9 pence, which, combined with Dividend up 15% the interim dividend of 7.1 pence, gives a total for the year of 28.0 pence 2009: 24.25 pence, an increase of 15%.
The dividend is covered 3.1 times.
This is consistent with our policy of making progressive dividend payments based upon affordability and sustainability.
The dividend will be paid on 24 June 2011 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 3 June 2011.
