BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Dear Shareholder Following a successful year in 2009, the Company continued to deliver strong financial performance over 2010.
The Company saw an increase in both net asset value per share Sterling Shares: 8.18% and share price Sterling Shares 6.72%.
The Companys shares continued to trade at a premium throughout the year and, with significant investor appetite for the shares, we were pleased to complete two further fund raisings over the year.
The first via a placing and offer for subscription of C shares in June 2010 raised 349 million, whilst the second placing of new Ordinary Shares in September 2010 raised an additional 83 million.
These capital raising exercises have further improved the liquidity of the Companys shares which the Board believes is in the interests of all shareholders.
The aggregate net assets of the Company at the year end across the three share classes in Sterling terms were approximately 914 million.
This represents approximately 26.6% of the net assets of AllBlue, the fund into which the Company invests.
Investment Performance During 2010, the published Sterling Share NAV rose from 152.24p to 164.69p, a return of 8.18% for the year.
AllBlue recorded ten months of positive performance over the year, with six of the seven strategies into which it invested delivering a positive return.
The report by BlueCrest, the manager of AllBlue, on pages 13 to 24 contains a more detailed review of the returns for the year from the different underlying strategies.
