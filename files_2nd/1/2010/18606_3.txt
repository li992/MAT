We see an attractive opportunity to use our core property management skills and broad range of residential activities in both the UK and Germany to enhance the Grainger brand and reputation as a professional and caring landlord for the benefit of our tenants, partners and shareholders.
None of this would be possible without the enthusiasm and commitment of all the staff within Grainger to whom I would like to extend my grateful thanks.
