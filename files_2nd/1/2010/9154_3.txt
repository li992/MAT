King sher plc Annual Report 04 Chairmans statement and Accounts 2009 10 In my fi first year as Chairman I am pleased to report a year of excellent progress at Kingfi sher.
Adjusted pre-tax profi t was up nearly 50% to 547 million, driven by growth in each of our geographic regions of the UK & Ireland, France and Other International.
The focus on debt reduction continued to deliver results, with financial net debt down to 250 million from 1 billion the previous year, underpinned by strong cash generation.
These results were delivered against the backdrop of the worldwide economic recession, with fears about unemployment and possible Daniel Bernard tax increases weighing heavily on consumer con dence.
However, Chairman consumer spending was supported by interest rate cuts, as well as scal measures and other incentives.
I believe King shers key strengths helped us manage our way through this dif cult period.
We have strong retail brands, all with a value heritage.
We have leading market positions, including the number one position in five of the countries in which we trade.
And our international spread, with around 60% of sales and pro ts coming from outside the UK, gives the Group good geographic balance.
In addition, King sher has what I believe to be a strong, experienced management team, led by Ian Cheshire.
Our management took decisive action during the year to improve and grow our business in the face of the downturn.
This self-help programme included a continued focus on our three key priorities of Management, Capital and Returns.
We managed our business tightly, with a close eye on costs, cash and stock.
And we continued to make good progress with our seven point Delivering Value plan.
This is covered in more detail in the Conversation with the executive team on pages 6 to 8.
However, I would highlight the 80% increase in pro ts at B&Q in the UK & Ireland and the very resilient performance in France, where pro ts grew despite a declining market.
In addition, our business in Poland delivered another very strong performance, Spain moved from loss to pro t and Russia continued to expand whilst becoming pro table at store level for the first time.
In China, a well-executed turnaround plan meant that losses were signi cantly reduced.
