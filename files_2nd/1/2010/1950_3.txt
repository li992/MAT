4 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Looking Forward Bellway has seen reservations in 2010 return to a more normal selling pattern with a strong spring selling season.
However, following the change of government in May and the emergency Budget in June, buyer confidence slowly ebbed away during the summer as increasing media coverage was given to the new policies of the coalition Government to tackle the deficit.
Sales in the early part of what is traditionally an active autumn selling period have picked up, albeit only slightly, following the usual summer lull and it seems that potential homebuyers are awaiting the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.
Whilst the Boards desire to increase volumes annually remains, it is ever mindful of past experiences, however, the Group currently has a strong land bank, a forward order book of 397 million and with 59million of net cash, the capacity to grow the business should market conditions allow.
The Board therefore remains confident as to the Groups ability to respond effectively to whatever market conditions prevail over the coming months.
