CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CHAIRMANS STATEMENT The Group performed well during 2010, delivering a strong operating result and making good progress on its asset management initiatives.
Changes we have introduced at the operating level have strengthened the Group, enabling us to find ways to increase revenues whilst continuing to control costs.
2010 was a successful year for the Group, with profits before tax increasing by 57.0% to 128.6 million 2009: 81.9 million and earnings per share up 34.9% to 30.9 pence 2009: 22.9 pence.
Management focused on driving increases in revenue per available room RevPAR across all of our regions.
This was due to two key factors: first, the location of the Groups highest revenue-generating hotels in gateway destinations that were quickest to respond to recovery: and second, a revitalised management structure, enabling our hotel leadership teams to optimise the balance between room rate and occupancy.
Management also succeeded in maintaining strict cost discipline throughout the year, enabling a high proportion of increased revenue to feed through to profits.
The Groups core strategy of owning as well as managing most of its hotels gives it a considerable degree of flexibility when managing direct costs.
Financial performance Average Group RevPAR for the year was 61.06, an increase of 10.7% over 2009 at constant rates of exchange.
Amongst our gateway cities the strongest RevPAR improvements were in Singapore, which enjoyed a strong V-shaped recovery over the year up 29.3%.
London up 7.9% was more stable over the past two years, having experienced only a small drop 2.5% in RevPAR during 2009.
New York was up 8.8%, compared to 2009.
General economic recovery played a key role in our improved performance.
However it was also driven by a dynamic combination of local rate and occupancy strategies that varied throughout the year according to general economic conditions and local factors.
On a consolidated basis, occupancy contributed 46.7% of RevPAR growth whilst rate produced 53.3%.

A high proportion of the cost savings achieved by the Group in anticipation of the severe downturn in 2009 were maintained during 2010, although variable costs increased as a result of greater customer demand for food and hospitality services and in rental charges in Singapore.
Operating costs, including hotel fixed charges, nonhotel expenses, central costs, and excluding redundancy costs and impairment, in constant currency terms rose by 5.9% over the year to 628.7 million.
The good revenue performance combined with successful cost control resulted in a 47.0% increase in headline operating profits to 144.1 million 2009: 98.0 million.

Financial position The Group anticipated the likelihood of constrained credit markets several years ago and continued to pursue a debt reduction strategy during 2010.
We believe that low gearing puts the Company in a strong and flexible position to meet future challenges and take advantage of opportunities.
Over the year, the Group generated 166.9 million from operating activities 2009: 83.4 million reflecting improved performance together with successful cost control.
At 31 December 2010 the Group had cash reserves of 251.9 million 2009: 135.5 million and total undrawn committed bank facilities of 152.4 million, most The launch of our new Studio of which are unsecured.

Asset Management The Groups asset management strategy is focused on enhancing the performance of each of the Groups individual property assets and assessing which asset management options will deliver best value for our shareholders.
Management focus is concentrated on the 20% or so of properties in the Groups portfolio that generate 80% or more of Group earnings, with a view to developing a structured and phased investment programme to enhance returns on certain prime-location assets in the portfolio.
The Group has commenced execution of detailed refurbishment plans at the Millennium Seoul Hilton and the Grand Hyatt Taipei and is drawing up plans for refurbishment of the Millennium UN Plaza.
Plans are underway to re-position the Millennium Mayfair after the London Olympics in 2012.
Additional projects are being considered.
In each case the Group is establishing optimal timing of refurbishment work to minimise revenue impact and capex costs.
The locations of 20 21 MiLLenniUM & CoptHorne HoteLs pLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 MiLLenniUM & CoptHorne HoteLs pLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CHAIRMANS STATEMENT these properties are such that the Group expects each to attract a higher proportion of premium rate customers following refurbishment, thereby increasing hotel earnings and profitability.
The Group announced on 15 September 2010 that it had entered into an agreement to sell a parcel of land adjacent to the Grand Millennium Kuala Lumpur for a consideration of RM210 million 44.2 million.
The sale, which achieved a very good price in current market conditions, is contingent on the Malaysian authorities approval of changes to the land title on such terms and conditions that are acceptable to the company.
The purchasers have paid CDL Hotels Malaysia Sdn.
a deposit amounting to 10% of the consideration price and have agreed to pay certain amounts on specified future dates with the remainder payable on completion, which is expected to occur before the end of the second quarter of 2012.
The Groups carrying value of the land is RM42.8 million 9.0 million.
Based on this value, the sale is expected to result in a pre-tax profit on completion of RM164.1 million 34.5 million after transaction costs.
Until completion our interest in the land will be held on the balance sheet at book value.
The Group announced on 16 June 2010 that it had signed a collective sales agreement CSA with other unit-holders in Tanglin Shopping Centre, a shoppingcum-office development situated within the Orchard prime tourist district in Singapore, in which the Group has a 34% interest in the total strata area.
The CSA requirement for 80% of unit-holders to agree for the sale process to proceed was attained.
However, the first open tender which carries a very high reserve price for the collective sale of the property did not receive any bid.
The sales committee will assess the situation and decide the next course of action.
The launch of our new Studio M brand during 2010 got off to a strong start with the first branded hotel in Singapore achieving good levels of occupancy following its official opening on 17 June 2010.
The hotel was EBITDA-positive within the first three months of operation, which is unusual for a new property in the hospitality industry.
Studio M is a mid-range brand, offering guests contemporary accommodation with high technology specifications and connectivity.
The success of the project is encouraging and further Studio M projects are being considered.
Development of a mid-range hotel in Chennai, India resumed during the course of the year, after plans were suspended in the wake of the 2009 recession.
Construction of the 144-room Studio M hotel is scheduled for completion in 2013.
This will mark a small but significant extension of the Groups activities, being our first hotel on the fast-growing Indian sub-continent.
In November the Group began marketing the Glyndebourne luxury condominium development, to be built on the site of the Copthorne Orchid.
The Orchid is one of our oldest hotels in Singapore and located in a part of the city that has become increasingly residential over the years.
Converting the site will be sympathetic to its location, as demonstrated by the very high take-up of options on the development.
Booking fees relating to the purchase for each unit were collected.
By 31 December 2010 sale and purchase agreements had been signed for 137 out of a total 150 apartments.
Should buyers who have signed S&P agreements not proceed with the purchase of the apartments, the Group would have the choice of either forfeiting 20% of the purchase price or pursuing other remedies at law.
The development is expected to complete no later than 2015.

It is scheduled to close in March 2011.
Sales and marketing costs including show flat construction costs and sales commissions of 4.3 million were expensed to the income statement in 2010.

pipeline The Group has signed four management contracts in the Middle East this year.
The new hotels in Jordan, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will offer 993 rooms on completion between 2011 and 2012.
The Groups worldwide pipeline has 25 hotels offering 7,006 rooms, which are mainly management contracts.
CDL Hospitality trusts reit The Groups interest in its real estate investment trust associate, CDL Hospitality Trusts CDLHT was diluted from 39.0% to 34.8% during 2010.
The dilution occurred when CDLHT raised capital through a private placement of 116.96 million stapled securities, priced at S$1.71 each, raising new capital of S$196.7 million net of fees gross: S$200 million.
Proceeds were used by CDLHT to pay down debt.
The Groups share of net proceeds was greater than its share of net tangible assets diluted by the issue, resulting in a non-cash accounting gain of 7.2 million.
As at 31 December 2010, the Groups interest in CDLHT was 34.9%.
CDLHTs strategy to invest in a diversified portfolio of earnings-accretive real estate, primarily in the hospitality sector, is complementary to the Groups operational and asset management objectives.
Benefits to the Group include a more efficient balance sheet and diversification of revenue through fee income from managing the REIT and some of its individual hotels.
The Group pays lease rentals to CDLHT for the hotels which it leases.
Three of these hotels Orchard, M and Copthorne Kings were sold to the REIT by the Group in 2006.
The REIT also offers a flexible platform through which the Group can extend its hospitality interests.
In 2010 the REIT acquired five hotels with 1,139 rooms in Australia: the Novotel Brisbane, Mercure Brisbane, Ibis Brisbane, Mercure Perth and Ibis Perth, all of which were bought from and leased back to Accor.
As REIT Manager, the Group earned 1 million as an acquisition fee for this transaction.
At 31 December 2010 CDLHT owned eleven hotels with 3,942 rooms, as well as a shopping centre connected to the Orchard Hotel.
China The Group regards the hospitality market in the Peoples Republic of China as a significant strategic development opportunity.
Its first managed hotel in China the Millennium Hongqiao in Shanghai opened in 2006, and today it has six hotels with 2,295 rooms in the country, five of which are managed franchised.
The one owned hotel is the award-winning Grand Millennium Beijing, in which the Group exercised an option to increase its equity holding from 30% to 70% in November 2010 at a purchase price of 26.2 million comprising 18.4 million of cash and 7.8 million of deferred consideration.
22 23 MiLLenniUM & CoptHorne HoteLs pLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 MiLLenniUM & CoptHorne HoteLs pLC Annual Report & Accounts 2010 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CHAIRMANS STATEMENT In addition to its owned, managed and franchised hotels, the Group has a 41.2% effective interest in First Sponsor Capital Limited FSCL.
FSCL is a majority shareholder in Idea Valley Investment Holdings Ltd IVIHL which conducts property and hospitality-related business in the China provinces of Guangdong and Sichuan.
The Group regards FSCL as an effective and capital-efficient platform to grow its hospitality interests in China.
Development of the Cityspring project in Chengdu, Sichuan Province is progressing well.
As at 27 January 2011, 5 out of 6 residential blocks had been formally launched.
569 sale and purchase agreements totalling in excess of US$80 million and 25 option agreements were signed.
This represents a sale rate of approximately 98% of the 608 units formally launched.
Revenue and profit recognition for this project is expected by the end of 2011.
The Cityspring project is a mixed development totalling more than 80,000 square metres and includes a 124 room mid-scale hotel that is intended to be managed by the Group.
The development is scheduled for completion in 2012.
For the year ended 2010, the Groups effective share of FSCLs net profit after tax and minority interest was 0.3 million.
The Groups share of FSCLs provision for assets write-off and legal expenses was 2.3 million mainly incurred in FSCLs dispute with a former shareholder of IVIHL, and the Groups attributable share of fair value gain for investment properties was 4.8 million.
As announced on 5 January 2011, the dispute was resolved through a settlement agreement signed on 31 December 2010.
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the joint venture agreement with the former shareholder Cheung would be terminated and all legal actions commenced by all parties withdrawn.
The joint venture agreement has been terminated and the parties are in the process of withdrawing all legal actions.
FSCL has to-date bought out Cheungs entire stake in IVIHL, thereby increasing its stake to 95% and regained control of two remaining companies previously under his control.
Recovery of the Hainan hotel and another small business will not be pursued.
The Group and the Board of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited consider the settlement to be a favourable outcome and in the best interests of shareholders.
Most of the transactions under the settlement have been completed and those transactions to be accounted for in FY2011 do not have any material adverse P&L impact.
Settlement of the dispute enables FSCL to renew its focus on value creation through mixed development opportunities in China.
These include the proposed acquisition of additional land in Chengdu, for which it is raising US$100 million of fresh capital financing.
During the year, the Group together with its New Zealand subsidiary provided US$25.0 million of new financing, primarily for the purchase of the Chengdu land, and plans to invest a further US$25 million.
As M&C funded the portion of the cash call that the New Zealand subsidiary did not take up, the Groups effective interest in FSCL has increased from 39.8% to 41.2%.

employees On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our employees for their dedication and commitment to the success of the Group in what has been a demanding year.
outlook The current year will present both challenges and opportunities.
Though conditions appear more favourable than this time last year, there are uncertainties that have yet to be dealt with in the world economy, including re-capitalisation of banks, the changing economic balance between East and West and the evident fiscal strains within the Eurozone.
How these issues will be resolved and the commercial impacts of that resolution are not clear.
However, we remain confident that our owner operator business model, our low gearing and the strength and geographical diversity of our assets place the Group in a sound competitive position for 2011.
While it is too early to predict trading performance for the current year, the opening weeks have been encouraging.
In the first 5 weeks of trading this year Group RevPAR increased by 4.5% like-for-like in spite of some significant seasonal factors adversely affecting the period.
