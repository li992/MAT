Current trading and outlook As indicated above, the biggest danger to the pub and catering industry is a continued increase in destructive taxes and regulations.
It is to be hoped that the UK governments attitude towards pubs, in particular, changes and that a co-operative and helpful, rather than a punitive, approach is adopted.
