a Message FroM tHe CHaIrMaN Marstons PLC Marstons House Brewery Road Wolverhampton WV1 4JT Dear Shareholder There are six key points that you should note about this last year and for the future.
First, Marstons has progressed well on all the main strategic fronts set out at the time of our rights issue in 2009: these are to build around 25 new pubs each year, to develop our tenanted and leased estate, to enhance the local franchise of our beers, to reduce debt and to generate higher returns on capital invested.
At this moment, not much is getting worse, and a lot more is getting better.
Second, there is good evidence of high appeal to consumers across all three trading divisions.
Alongside positive sales, the delivery of good margins indicates effective execution.
Our new-build pubs exceeded expectation: the roll-out of the new Retail Agreements for our tenanted pubs has developed good momentum: solid progress was achieved in stabilising our leased estate: and our ales performed well in a difficult beer market.
The team at Jennings Brewery, Cockermouth did a splendid job after the catastrophic floods in supplying our customers in the Lake District, and in restoring the brewery.
Third, a final dividend of 3.7p is proposed, making a total for the year of 5.8p.
Dividend cover has increased to 1.7 times.
Fourth, the Board has made, and proposes changes to its composition.
Robin Rowland, Chief Executive of YO!
His great and very relevant experience in food retailing will help in the execution of our plans.
Derek Andrew will stand down from Marstons on 30 September 2011 after 30 years, we thank him and wish him good speed in his next ventures.
We will then reduce the number of executive directors from five to three: Stephen Oliver will step down from the Board and will be responsible for the management of Marstons Beer Company and Marstons Pub Company.
Miles Emley retires as Chairman of the Audit Committee on 3 December 2010, and Neil Goulden takes over.
Fifth, in May 2010 the Financial Reporting Council recommended that Boards are reviewed by external advisers, and that Directors stand for re-election annually: this latter we propose to you for the AGM in January 2011.
Marstons has conducted annual Board appraisals for many years and in 2010 we engaged Blackwood to conduct a review from an external perspective.
Finally, the environment is not easy.
We share the concerns of our customers about the imminent VAT rise and about economic confidence.
We see the stirrings of other inflationary elements, beyond the immediately visible rise in fuel costs: commodity prices forcing up food and now material costs.
We have contracts to mitigate these effects in the immediate future, but these are finite.
Business rates continue to rise without reference to underlying trading or the costs of living.
We do not yet see the benefits of proposed fide-regulation after years of the burden of imposed costs.
The tone of recent government announcements on alcohol has yet to recognise the benefits of well-ordered pubs and the positive role they play in society.
Nevertheless, despite these challenges, we have good momentum which we aim to sustain through 2011, and we have a clearly defined strategy for continuing profitable development in the future.
