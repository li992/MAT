$IBJSNBO T MFUUFS In the days after the accident in the Gulf of Mexico the company faced a complex and fast-changing crisis.
With oil escaping into the ocean, uncertainty grew around our ability to seal the well and restore the areas affected.
This was an intense period, with the situation worsening almost daily.
Our meeting with President Obama on 16 June 2010 provided reassurance to the US government that BP would do the right thing in the Gulf, and this marked a turning point.

We have set up a $20-billion fund to show our willingness and capacity to pay all legitimate $MFBOJOH UIF CFBDIFT #1 USBJOFE NPSF UIBO claims for compensation.

We do not underestimate the effect of this on small and large shareholders alike.
However, there is no doubt in my mind that this action steadied and strengthened our position at a critical point.
I am pleased that we have been able to resume dividend payments promptly.
The dividend for the fourth quarter of 2010, to be paid in March 2011, is 7 cents per share US$0.42 per ADS.
The scrip dividend programme approved last year is in operation once again, and this presents an opportunity to take the dividend in shares or ADSs rather than cash.
We intend to raise the level of the dividend DV WKH FRPSDQ V FLUFXPVWDQFHV DQG SHUIRUPDQFH LPSURYH 'XULQJ WKH HDU ZH IXUWKHU UHLQIRUFHG RXU QDQFLDO SRVLWLRQ Having taken a total pre-tax charge of $40.9 billion in relation to the accident and spill, we announced our intention to sell up to $30 billion of assets.
We have already secured almost $22 billion.
We intend to reduce the net debt ratio to within the range of 10-20%, compared with our previously targeted range of 20-30%.

BP is fortunate to have an exceptional successor to the role of group chief executive.
Bob Dudley has spent his working life in the oil industry and has proved himself a robust, successful leader in the toughest circumstances.
I am delighted to be working alongside a man of such substance and experience.
Douglas Flint will be standing down at the annual general meeting in April 2011, having taken up a new role as chairman of HSBC Holdings plc.
Douglas has chaired our audit committee for the past year.

DeAnne has chaired the remuneration committee since 2005 and is succeeded in that role by Antony Burgmans.
Both DeAnne and Douglas have been immensely valuable board members.
We thank them and wish them both well.
Boards must evolve if they are to engage effectively with new issues and opportunities.
We have acted to strengthen the board of BP to ensure we have the right mix of skills, knowledge and experience as we work to achieve sustainable success in a fast-changing world.

Clearly, after a very troubled and demanding 12 months, BP is a changed company.
As a board we have much to do, and we are working with the executive team to ensure successful implementation of a refocused strategy built on the pillars of safety, trust and value creation.
Foremost is the need to ensure the right checks and balances are in place across the company.
The full board will continue to maintain close oversight of matters related to safety.
And we will have even greater engagement on the strategic implications of risk.
Looking ahead, we believe that a growing population and rising levels of prosperity will create strong demand for energy.

We will also continue to respond to climate change, and to the prospect of fossil fuels becoming a smaller part of the energy mix.

To achieve this, we must ensure that safety and responsibility are at the heart of everything we do.
We must show that we can be trusted to understand and manage our risks.
And we must demonstrate that we respect the environment and the needs of local communities and society as a whole.
The many strengths of BP are united in our remarkable people, who showed in 2010 that they can rise to the sternest challenge.
I thank them for their efforts.
While we face substantial challenges, shareholders must be in no doubt BP has the determination and strength needed to restore its reputation and deliver long-term shareholder value.
