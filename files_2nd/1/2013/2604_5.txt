CHAIRMANS STATEMENT RESULTS Although there were signs of improving macroeconomic conditions in some of the countries in which we operate, the market conditions in many of our sectors remained challenging throughout 2013.
I am therefore delighted to be able to report an excellent set of results for 2013.
Group revenue increased to 6,097.7 million 2012: 5,359.2 million, an increase of 12% at constant exchange rates, due to organic growth of 2% combined with the impact of acquisitions.
Operating profit before intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs was 414.4 million 2012: 352.4 million, up 16% at constant exchange rates, with the improvement in the Group operating margin being driven by both organic growth and the impact of acquisitions.
Adjusted earnings per share before intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and the vending disposal were 82.4p 2012: 70.6p, an increase of 15% at constant exchange rates.
Positive currency translation movements, principally in the US dollar and euro, which were partly offset by adverse exchange rate movements elsewhere, increased the reported Group growth rates Philip Rogerson by around a further 2%.

This brings the total dividend for the year to 32.4p, up 15% compared to 2012.
