Chairmans Statement Since I last wrote to you in the summer, your Company has seen an improvement in performance.
During the second half of 2013 the net asset value per share rose by 2.5% Sterling class, bringing the return for the full year to 1.8%.
The share price performed more strongly than the net asset value, with total shareholder returns of 3.0% for 2013 as a whole Sterling shares, and returns in excess of 4% in the Euro and Dollar Shares.
As in prior years, the returns from the Companys investment in AllBlue have been produced with very low levels of volatility and low levels of correlation to a broad range of asset classes, such as equities and fixed income.

Performance is from inception to 31 December 2013.
Sterling NAV p and Sterling share price p are for BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited Sterling Share Class.
Equities is the FTSE 100 Index rebased to 100.
Whilst, of course, we would like to see a return to annual performance in double digits, it is noteworthy that AllBlue has continued its unbroken record of generating positive returns over every rolling 12 month period since inception.
Furthermore, in an environment of sustained zero short term interest rates, a double digit net return is unlikely to be achieved consistently without an unacceptable level of risk embedded into the portfolio.
We understand that most of our shareholders own Shares in the Company principally for their consistent return and as an effective portfolio diversifier.
These criteria hold good and both we and BlueCrest as the manager of AllBlue are resistant to an increase in aggregate risk or to change in the shape of the portfolio in pursuit of higher risk and returns at a time when financial markets, and fixed income markets in particular, are fraught with difficulties.
