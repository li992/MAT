CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Dear Shareholder, I have pleasure in presenting you with the Annual Report of NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Limited the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Portfolio and Company performance Building on the solid start that your Company has made since April 2011, the Board remains pleased with the progress made by the Investment Manager.
The portfolio remains fully invested, with a strong US bias.
As at 31 December 2013, 88.14% of the Company was invested in US Dollar denominated assets, with 7.71% invested in Euro denominated assets and 4.14% in Sterling denominated assets all excluding cash.
The Investment Manager has constructed a diversified portfolio of loan investments, across currencies, ratings and sectors.
At the end of the reporting period, the portfolio had 234 holdings across 177 issuers in 34 different sectors.
Between 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013, the Companys NAV per share rose by 0.95% and 0.66% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Share and Sterling Ordinary Share respectively.
The NAV return plus dividends paid during the year was 5.33% and 5.06% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and Sterling Ordinary Shares respectively.
As at 31 December 2013, the share price was trading at a premium of 5.67% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares, 5.41% for the Sterling Ordinary Shares and 3.67% for the Sterling C Shares.
During 2013, the yield on dividends paid during the year was 4.10% based on a share price of $1.0675 and 4.15% based on a share price of 1.0560 for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and Sterling Ordinary Shares respectively, which we believe is consistent with the Companys investment objective of income generation whilst seeking to preserve investors capital and give protection against rising interest rates.
Additional fundraises We are particularly grateful for the strong ongoing support demonstrated by our investors, which led to two new C Share issues over the year.
During the first quarter, the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately 363 million by means of a Placing and Offer for Subscription of C Shares and then an additional 425 million was raised in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Both issues have subsequently been converted into Sterling Ordinary Shares.
In addition, during the third quarter, the Company raised gross proceeds of 45.3 million by means of a tap issue.
We are delighted by the successful results of these issues, which significantly exceeded our target and we believe show that demand for bank loans remains strong.
Outlook for the rest of the financial year Your Board continues to be satisfied with the portfolios performance in the first few months of 2014 and with the strategy that is being applied by the Investment Manager.
The Investment Manager will continue to update you on the Companys progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets, Investment Manager updates and the continuance of the Quarterly Investor Update calls that we introduced during 2013.
ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2013 3 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013 ANNUAL REPORT CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CONTINUED Other Matters Since the financial year ended I am pleased to confirm that on 19 March 2014 the first Continuation Vote, which fell due on or before the third anniversary of the Companys Admission to the London Stock Exchange, was passed by way of Ordinary Resolution.
Additionally we also received approval to make a minor amendment to the Companys Articles of Incorporation to reduce the minimum number of Directors required to form a committee to which the Board may delegate its powers.
More detail on both of these requests can be found in our Circular dated 26 February 2014 and I thank all investors who voted and supported these requests.
At the Board level, as the Company has grown significantly in size during 2013, it has agreed that due to this and the associated additional workload created, it should expand the Board and is now in the process of appointing an additional offshore nonexecutive Director.
We will make a more formal announcement on the successful candidate once we have completed our process.
Finally, I would like to close by thanking you for your commitment and I look forward to reporting to you on the Companys progress later on this year.
