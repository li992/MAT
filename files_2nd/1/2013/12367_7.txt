Annual Report 2013 Polymetal International plc Strategic report 26 27 Strategic report Operating review continued Outlook for 2014 Exploration For the second year in a row, Dukat takes the lead among our The key operational focus in 2014 will be to deliver a full In 2014, our exploration activities will be focused on: mature mines in terms of both production growth and robust DukAt year of robust performance at two of our newest plants cost performance.
Silver production in 2013 was 22.1 Moz, continued resource-to-reserve conversions and resource Mayskoye and Amursk POX and sustain robust operating up 15% year-on-year, and was further supported by category updates at our advanced standalone exploration performances at the Dukat hub and other mature mines.
improvements in average grades at the Dukat and Goltsovoye targets and brownfield targets through in-fill drilling: In doing so, we expect to achieve a production level mines and increased recovery rates.
Despite the full switch additional drilling at the flanks of Ozerny and Avlayakan of 1.3 Moz of gold equivalent, which will be further improved to underground mining, the Dukat hub achieved a further with a view to extend life-of-mine at Khakanja: to 1.35 Moz in 2015 and 1.4 Moz in 2016, based on the reduction in total cash costs of 5% to US$11.6 silver fuRtHeR GRoWtH At RussiAs further increase of resource potential at Albazino through current asset base.

This will include trial processing of concentrate In 2013, underground development at Dukat increased by 26% from Mayskoye at the Amursk POX plant in the first quarter completion of a resource estimate at Burgali and continued year-on-year to 30.7 km, with more than 1.25 Mt of ore mined and negotiation of the potential terms of long-term off-take.
exploration at the other brownfield targets in the Omolon from underground, and average silver grade in ore mined The split between own-processing at the POX plant and hub area: increasing by 9% to 423 g t. This compensated for the 6% off-take sales will be driven partially by the relative economics decrease in the total amount of ore mined after the completion in-fill drilling and finalisation of resource estimates of each of these routes and partially by the prospects of open-pit mining.
Within the mine, we commenced at Olcha with preparation for open-pit mining and of an Albazino expansion, which, if undertaken, will require development of the Eastern zone and further improved exploration for new ore bodies in the area: additional POX capacity.
