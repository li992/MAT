However, maintaining the highest standards of clinical care is a major challenge, one that Smiths Medicals CADD-Solis VIP was designed to meet.
The portable infusion pump was developed specifically to minimise the risk of medication errors.
Used typically for chemotherapy and pain management, the CADD-Solis VIP is the only smart infusion system available for the homecare market.
Its error-prevention software alerts operators or interrupts the infusion process when any setting breaches pre-defined limits.
