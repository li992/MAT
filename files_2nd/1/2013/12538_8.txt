Premier will also pay an exploration carry of up to US$48 million and, subject to field development plan approval, a development carry of up to US$722 million.
In 2013, Premier further increased its equity in licences PL004a and PL004c to 36 per cent via a farm-in with Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd.
Following extensive conceptual engineering and design work on the Sea Lion project, a development scheme was agreed in December 2013.
A phased approach utilising a tension leg platform TLP with a permanent drilling rig was selected.
Phase 1 will recover 293 million barrels of oil over 25 years from 32 wells while Phase 2 will be optimised to incorporate any additional exploration or appraisal success.
Premier will farm-down its equity interest in the project prior to final sanction which is targeted for 2015.
Premier will also explore the remaining potential in the North Falkland Basin and looks forward to commencing a four well exploration and appraisal programme in 2015.
