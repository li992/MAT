I am delighted to say that this proved wide of the mark.
2013 was another excellent year for UK smaller companies, surpassing the substantial returns in 2012.
The FTSE 100 Index gave a total return of 18.7%, while the FTSE All-Share Index, which is heavily weighted towards large companies, gave a return of 20.8%.
By comparison, the Numis Smaller Companies Index excluding Investment Companies NSCI XIC, your Companys benchmark, gave a return of 36.9%.
Over the same period, your Companys net asset value total return was 52.4%, while the share price total return was 62.0%.
From a historical perspective, 2013 returns represent the best absolute annual returns achieved by your Company since its inception in 1990.
The Managers Report provides more detail on 2013s performance and, importantly, will put it into a longer term perspective, with regard to the size and style influences that have prevailed since the 2008 crisis.
It would be remiss of me not to re-iterate what I said last year, namely, that returns of this magnitude require a health warning.
They are unlikely to be matched in 2014.
Continuation vote It is your Companys policy to hold a continuation vote every three years.
The Annual General Meeting on 27 February 2014 brings the seventh such vote in your Companys history.
In performance terms, the three year returns for your Company compared to its benchmark 73.9% vs 61.7% provide a favourable backdrop to the upcoming vote.
That has not always been the case and indeed the future will inevitably involve continuation votes that are set against periods of three year underperformance.
All fund managers, including the most talented, experience runs of poor returns.
This is why performance needs to be assessed over very long intervals in order to distinguish between luck, whether good or bad, and true investment skill.
This is especially true of value investors.
The Managers, Aberforth Partners, have a consistent investment approach based on the value investing style.
This can lead to indeterminate periods of underperformance.
These periods can be both savage, as was the case during the TMT bubble in the late 1990s, and enduring, as has been the case in the post 2008 financial crisis world.
For the value manager, such times represent a clear and present danger.
It is during these periods of extreme underperformance that the temptation to become a little less value and a bit more growth becomes intense.
Yielding to temptation would obviously dilute any outperformance as and when value returned to favour as was the case in 2013.
The Managers consistent investment approach and long run performance record over 23 years, detailed on page 6, are two of the most important facets that your Board has considered in putting forward a recommendation with regard to the continuation vote.
Your Board continues to have confidence in the Managers and believes that their niche offering, coupled with a commitment to restrict the business in terms of funds under management, has served Shareholders well over the past 23 years.
A well resourced and experienced, but evolving, investment team, which holds a significant stake in your Company, brings additional benefits in the opinion of your Board and avoids some of the star manager issues that have characterised the broader fund management industry in recent years.
Your Board is therefore recommending that Shareholders vote in favour of your Companys continuation.
Your Board intends to do so in respect of their aggregate beneficial holdings of 73,686 Ordinary Shares.
Dividends In 2013, despite a lacklustre profits backdrop, the dividend experience from investee companies continued to be generally positive.
In this context, your Board is pleased to declare a final dividend of 16.15p.
This results in total dividends for the year of 23.5p, representing an increase of 5.6% on 2012.
Based on the year end share price of 1,095p, your Companys shares deliver a 2.1% yield.
Your Board remains committed to a progressive dividend policy.
Your Companys revenue reserves, after adjusting for payment of the final dividend, amount to 36.1p per share up from 32.1p as at 31 December 2012, and provide a degree of flexibility going forward.
The final dividend, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014 Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 6 March 2014 to Shareholders on the register as at the close of business on 7 February 2014.
The ex dividend date is 5 February 2014.
Your Company operates a Dividend Reinvestment Plan and details of the plan, including the Form of Election, are available from Aberforth Partners LLP or on its website, www.

The existing 100m facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc has a term expiring in May 2014.
As has been the case in the past the facility term dovetails with the three yearly continuation vote cycle.
After the Annual General Meeting, and providing the continuation vote is duly passed, your Board and the Managers would seek to put in place a new facility which would continue to provide your Company with access to liquidity for investment purposes and to fund share buy-ins as and when appropriate.
In an illiquid, and at times volatile, asset class such as UK smaller companies having access to immediate funds through a credit facility provides the Managers with enhanced flexibility.
At the year end, gearing stood at 2.6% of Shareholders funds.
During the year, the level of gearing ranged from 1.7% to 8.0% with an average of 5.4%.
Board Changes Professor Walter Nimmo, who has been a Director since July 2004, will not be standing for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Walter has been an excellent member of your Board and we will all miss his invaluable contributions.
We wish Walter all the very best for the future.
We are delighted to appoint both Julia Le Blan and Paula Hay-Plumb as directors of your Company with effect from 29 January 2014.
Both bring a wealth of knowledge of the investment world, including investment trusts, and we look forward to working with them.
Share buy-in At the Annual General Meeting in March 2013, the authority to buy in up to 14.99% of your Companys Ordinary Shares was approved.
During the year, 310,000 Ordinary Shares 0.3% of the Companys issued share capital were bought in at a total cost of 2.758 million.
Consistent with your Boards stated policy, those Ordinary Shares have been cancelled rather than held in Treasury.
Once again, your Board will be seeking to renew the buy-in authority at the Annual General Meeting on 27 February 2014.
Regulatory developments As highlighted previously, your Company is an Alternative Investment Fund as defined by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.
Your Board has invited the Managers to act as the Alternative Investment Fund Manager for your Company.
The various steps to be completed to ensure your Company and the Managers comply with the requirements of the Directive are well underway.
Summary In my statement last year I drew attention to tentative signs that investors were returning to both value investing and to the smaller constituents of the NSCI XIC.
Those trends remained largely in place through 2013 to the benefit of your Companys absolute and relative performance.
Encouragingly, historical data might suggest that such shifts can often persist over several years but, equally importantly, historical data would also suggest 2014 returns will be materially below those achieved in 2013.
Irrespective of what 2014 delivers, your Board continues to have confidence in the value investment style and in the Managers consistent application of that style to the benefit of Shareholders.
That consistency lies at the heart of the excellent long term returns achieved by your Company.
Since your Companys formation in 1990, the NSCI XIC has risen by 11.8% pa in total return terms.
By comparison, your Companys net asset value total return has been 14.8% pa.
Finally, your Board very much welcomes your views and we are always available to talk to Shareholders directly.
