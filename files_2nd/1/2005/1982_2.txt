03 Chairmans statement As already mentioned in the Interim Statement, the past year has been one of significant change for the group.
With the sale of Elliott in May, we have completed our reorganisation into a focused European textiles maintenance business with strong market positions on the Continent and in the UK.
At the same time, we announced the return of 151 million of capital to shareholders, which was effected in August.
In June, we refinanced our bank facilities on substantially better terms and conditions and extended them to 2012.
There have also been key changes at board level, with Roger Dye and I moving respectively to Chief Executive and Chairman in May and Kevin Quinn joining us as Finance Director from Amersham in May.
We are supported by a strong team of non-executives in Philip Rogerson, John Burns and Per Utnegaard.
The board has addressed the future strategy of the group.
The markets in which we operate are mature and therefore relatively low growth.
In order to increase our top-line growth, we are cautiously expanding the breadth of our activities within the textile maintenance sector, both Christopher Kemball Chairman organically and through bolt-on acquisitions.
Our focus is on improving our service to customers without compromising our strong operational and financial controls.
Geographically, we are concentrating on Europe.
Results and dividend The UK market has continued to be very challenging this year, especially in the second half.
The Continental European business, on the other hand, has had another good year and coupled with lower financing costs and a lower tax rate has resulted in a satisfactory set of results.
Revenue from continuing operations in the year was 661.7 million 2004: 651.5 million, an increase of 2%.
Operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and amortisation of customer contracts adjusted operating profit was 91.7 million compared with 91.0 million last year, an increase of 1%.

These items, together with a profit on property sales of 0.3 million, are shown as exceptional items.
Amortisation of acquired customer contracts amounted to 2.0 million and operating profit after exceptional items and amortisation of customer contracts was 87.9 million 2004: 94.4 million.

The net proceeds of the sale of Elliott amounted to 160.4 million and in August 2005 we returned 144.4 million to shareholders by way of a B share scheme.

In addition, we made a contribution of 23 million into the UK pension fund to cover the past service liabilities of Elliott and HSS staff.
The board is recommending a final dividend of 11.80 pence, which together with the interim dividend of 5.50 pence paid in October 2005, gives a total of 17.30 pence, an increase of 5% on last year.

We now have a focused European textile maintenance business with leading market positions in most of the countries in which Operating profit m continuing operations we operate.
In Continental Europe we continued our focus on margin enhancement with cost control Before exceptional items and amortisation and operating efficiency gains, further improving margins from 14.5% last year to 15.7% of customer contracts this year.
We have positioned ourselves for future growth by investing in our sales forces 2001 35.7 and by broadening our service offering in our existing markets.
We have also continued to make targeted acquisitions, which expand our market reach, making acquisitions and 2002 64.4 acquiring contracts in a number of countries, including Germany, where we acquired the 2003 83.5 healthcare contracts of Rentokil Initial in the North and East of the country.

2005 91.7 The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2005 04 Chairmans statement continued Within the Sunlight business, our strategy has been to secure increased volumes and improved operating efficiency and we have rationalised our operating base in response to market conditions.
Managements focus is on working with our customers to improve our service offering and to ensure that pricing reflects the cost of delivering that service, particularly in the light of the significant increases in wage and energy costs of our business.
Rentokils withdrawal from UK textiles, announced in January 2006, should result in some opportunities for us over time.
We continued with our two year IT investment programme to provide integrated systems to support operations, customer relationships and business development and we will make further investments to help drive operating efficiency, particularly in our healthcare plants.
Return of capital to shareholders Following the sale of Elliott, the extraordinary general meeting on 15th August 2005 approved the boards proposals to return 151 million of capital to shareholders with a 5 for 6 share consolidation.
In 2005, we repaid 144.4 million to shareholders and have announced to the remaining B shareholders our intention to repay the remaining 6.5 million on 2nd May 2006.
Other financial matters We have made cash transfers of 23.0 million to the principal Davis UK pension fund in respect of past service liabilities of Elliott and HSS staff.
Our post tax deficit on pensions for the group at 31st December 2005 was 57.2 million compared with 71.2 million last year.
We continue to see reduction of the pension liability as a priority and therefore intend to contribute at least 5 million annually for the next five years to the UK fund, with the aim of funding the past service deficit.
In June 2005, the group concluded the refinancing of its banking facilities by signing a 420 million revolving credit facility with an initial term of five years with eight banks on attractive commercial terms, including a reduced margin compared to the previous agreement.
