Chairmans statement Results and dividend We see a return of cash to shareholders through a dividend as part of The increasingly widespread adoption of ARM technology in consumer a package of measures to make the best use of the businesss cash electronic devices was illustrated in 2005 by the 31% increase in the resources.
The board also initiated a share buyback programme in July reported total shipments of ARM Powered products to 1.7 billion units, 2005 and purchased a total of 13.9 million shares at a total cost of up from 1.3 billion units in 2004.
The strong cash generation resulting 16.2 million in the period up to the end of 2005.
The buyback from this robust operational performance, together with our confidence programme is ongoing.
in the Companys long-term prospects, enabled us to increase investments in research and development by 20% and to acquire Keil, The market a microcontroller tools business, in October 2005.
2005 was expected to be a year of flat growth for the semiconductor industry although the year ended with growth of approximately 7%.
The combination of ARM microprocessor IP with the physical IP In face of a slow first half and an improving second half of 2005, ARMs acquired through the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004 has revenue growth of 14% was at a rate double that of the industry.
accelerated ARMs momentum towards becoming the architecture for the digital world.
ARMs strong financial performance continued with Looking to 2006, the industry has started the year with a general revenue growth at twice the rate of the semiconductor industry, feeling that the growth seen in 2005 would continue at a similar year-on-year dollar revenue growth of 14% and operating margins level in 2006, with the possibility of some further improvement.
In the light of this industry backdrop, ARM is well positioned to outgrow the semiconductor industry once again in 2006.
Our confidence in The board decided at the end of 2003 to initiate the payment of an the growth of our business is underpinned by a healthy technology annual dividend.
It is the boards intention to increase the dividend portfolio of both processor and physical IP, consisting of both new and over time, taking into account the opportunity for continued mature products, the prospect of more synergistic deals for the investment in the business and the Companys underlying operational Physical IP Division and continued acceleration of penetration of ARM IP performance.
With this in mind, the board is recommending a final into royalty-generating designs in both the mobile and non-mobile dividend of 0.5 pence per share, bringing the total for the year to market segments.
0.84 pence per share, an increase of 20% over the dividend paid in respect of 2004.
Geographic expansion In 2005, ARM continued to strengthen its position as a global entity across all regions.

ARM a member of the board since 1998 and had planned to step down at received its first royalties from China-based chip designers and ended the 2005 AGM.
He has, however, kindly agreed to stand for re-election the year with four Chinese design teams shipping ARM technologythis year for a further period of up to one year, which will provide based designs.
ARM also signed the first processor licence with a design valuable continuity following the appointment of four new directors team in India and expects continued success in that country in 2006. since December 2004.
Lucio Lanza, who joined the board following the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004, and has considerable Not only did ARM continue to expand its commercial presence around experience of US reporting requirements, joined the audit committee the globe in 2005, but the engineering diversity within the Company with effect from February 2006. also expanded during the year.
We now have 11 design centres, located in Cambridge, Maidenhead, Sheffield and Blackburn, England: Current trading and prospects Sunnyvale, California and Austin, Texas in the USA: Bangalore, India: During 2005, we integrated Artisan into ARM and began to accelerate Sophia Antipolis, France: Leuven, Belgium: and Aachen and Munich, new product development in physical IP.
We also brought three Germany.
During 2005, ARM doubled the capacity of its design team new processor designs to market, completed the acquisition of in India to more than 100 people and expects to increase it to at least a microcontroller tools company and invested further in product 150 people by the end of 2006. development.
As a result, we enter 2006 well placed to build on our market leadership position.
People On behalf of the board, I thank all employees worldwide for the A broad technology portfolio for licensing, increasing royalty contribution they have made to the excellent results achieved in momentum, growth in development systems sales and the prospect of 2005 in the increasingly demanding market in which we operate.
