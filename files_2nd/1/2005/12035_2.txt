We also purchased the net assets of Senator Homes, a small business in Cumbria, for 25 million including borrowings on 13 December 2005.
This has enlarged our Lancashire operation and has already been fully integrated into Persimmon.
As a result of the progress the Group has made, Persimmon entered the FTSE 100 in December, being the first pure housebuilder ever to do so.
