Les Tench Employees Non-Executive Chairman Personal commitment and the personal will to excel lies at the heart of the culture of the Group and I would like to thank all employees for their hard work and valuable efforts during the year.
Prospects The Group has benefited from increased demand and a positive pricing environment in most of the main areas in which it operates during both 2004 and 2005.
Coming into 2006, it is expected that demand will continue to improve modestly, but that the impact of pricing, and in particular that of price inflation, will be less helpful than has been the case for the last two years.
Looking at the three geographic regions in which we have trading operations, beginning with the UK and Ireland, we expect demand from both residential and non-residential new build to continue to be positive, and anticipate some continued weakness in the residential repairs and maintenance sectors.
