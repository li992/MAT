Chairmans Statement I am pleased to report that Carillion made good progress in 2002, with an 11 per cent increase in profit before tax, goodwill and exceptional items.
Earnings per share before goodwill and exceptional items grew by 19 per cent.
The delivery of substantial earnings growth in 2002 is a significant achievement, especially as the general business climate became less certain during the year.
This success reflects not only the Groups good overall operating performance, but the progress being made with implementation of the strategy we have developed and pursued since Carillion was launched as an independent company in 1999, namely to develop our Business Services and PPP Investment activities alongside a well positioned Construction Services business.
The Group has again delivered substantial growth in its Business Services and PPP Investment activities, both organically and through acquisitions, including Citex Management Services in 2002 together with the full year effect of the successful acquisition of GT Railway Maintenance and additional PPP project equity in the second half of 2001.
This growth has more than offset a reduction in activity Chairman, Sir Neville Simms in Construction Services, resulting largely Carillion was appointed preferred bidder from our strategy to focus on higher for the John Radcliffe Hospital PPP added value contracts with long-term project in December 2002. customers.
This has involved downsizing in some markets and exiting others, including the disposal of our social housing business in the second half of 2001 and Maxxiom, our joint venture plant hire business, in 2002.
