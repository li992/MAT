Annual Report and Financial Statements Chairmans Statement As anticipated, 2002 was a challenging year characterised by slowing economies, deteriorating business confidence and political uncertainty.
These conditions have impacted directly upon the professional employment markets and consequently on the results of the Group.
Given these difficult conditions, our results and financial position are testament to our overall strategy of cautious organic development and the strength of the Michael Page brand, its management, staff, systems and processes.
Financial highlights As a consequence of these difficult trading conditions, turnover for the year ended 31 December 2002 was 16.6% lower at 383.5m 2001: 459.5m.
Temporary placement activity has been more resilient than permanent and this shift in business mix contributed to a revenue gross profit reduction of 21.4% to 192.6m 2001: 245.1m.
Given the Groups high operational gearing, operating profit reduced by 49.8% to 32.1m 2001: 64.0m before exceptional items.
Profit before tax was 32.6m 2001: 59.9m before exceptional items and earnings per share were 5.8p 2001: 10.6p before exceptional items.
Cash flow was again very strong during the year with the Group generating 46.7m 2001: 75.9m from operating activities.
At 31 December 2002 the Group had net cash of 21.4m 2001: 14.3m after repurchasing for cancellation 11.3m shares at a cost of 13.7m.
Dividends and share buy back Despite the reduction in profits, the Board is recommending that the dividend be maintained at last years level assuming the shares had been listed for the whole of 2001.
A final dividend of 2.3p 2001: 2.3p per ordinary share is proposed which, together with the interim dividend of 1.1p 2001: 0.275p per ordinary share paid in October, makes a total dividend for the year of 3.4p 2001: 2.575p per ordinary share.
The final dividend will be paid on 6 June 2003 to those shareholders on the register at 9 May 2003.
The total dividend is covered 1.7 times by earnings per share of 5.8p and 2.6 times by cash earnings per share of 9.0p.
In August 2002, following a detailed review of the Groups balance sheet and an assessment of the most appropriate uses for the excess cash generated by the business, we announced our intention to repurchase up to 40m of shares over a 12-month period.
To date we have repurchased 11.3m shares at an average price of 121p.
Our decision to repurchase followed three consecutive quarters of stable revenue generation of around 50.0m per quarter, and an assumption that conditions would not deteriorate.
We have now experienced two slower quarters and as a consequence we cannot now be as definitive about the amount and timing of our repurchase programme.
However, we do anticipate share repurchases being an ongoing use of surplus cash and accordingly will be seeking shareholders consent for a renewal of the repurchase authority at the Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2003.
Employees In January 2002 the Group had 2,657 employees.
As business activity has slowed, staff numbers have reduced to 2,390 at 31 December 2002.
Despite the difficulties of the year, the commitment, loyalty and efforts of the Groups staff have maintained your Companys position as the international leader in the specialist recruitment industry.
Current trading and future prospects Activity levels slowed going into the fourth quarter of 2002 and this weakening has continued into the first quarter of 2003.
We expect revenue for the first few months of 2003 to be approximately 15% below that of the first two months of 2002.
Recruitment is a business that is highly geared to economic cycles.
We have now experienced consecutive years of weakening conditions and lowering of business confidence.
Your Board believes that conditions in the professional employment sector should eventually improve as and when we move through the current cycle.
We therefore remain committed to continuing to make sensible and cautious decisions and investments for the longer-term benefit of the Group and its shareholders.
