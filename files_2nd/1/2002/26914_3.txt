Chairmans Statement Continental European equity markets were in almost continuous retreat during the six months to 30 September 2002, falling by 35.4% in sterling terms as measured by the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index.
Compared with this, the Companys diluted net asset value per share NAV fell by 36.4%, while its share price fell by 40.0%.
Earnings per share in the period were 2.28p, compared with 2.41p per share in the same period of last year.
The Board has declared an unchanged interim dividend of 0.65p per share, which will be paid to shareholders on 3 January 2003.
Over the period to 30 September 2002, the Company has bought back 3.1 million ordinary shares for cancellation.
This added 0.1% to the diluted NAV.
Since 1 October 2002 the Company has bought back and cancelled a further 425,000 shares.
No warrants have been bought back since 1 April 2002.
The 75 million Floating Rate Notes, which were issued in 1997, provide potential gearing of the portfolio of approximately 22%.
However, the fund manager reduced the negative impact of this gearing by holding cash so that the effective gearing at 30 September was limited to 8.3%.
World stock markets experienced one of their worst periods in recent history during the six months under review.
In the third quarter alone our benchmark, the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index, was down 28.8%.
Against this background it will be no surprise, but also no consolation, for shareholders to be reminded that we have suffered substantial declines in our NAV and share price in line with other investment trusts committed to Europe.
Stock markets have been unsettled by weak economic conditions and company profits in the US and Europe, by revelations of accounting irregularities and dubious corporate governance, by dishonest investment banking practices, by enforced selling by insurance companies and, by no means least, by the real threat of war in Iraq.
Following such steep declines, with resultant widespread loss of confidence in an early recovery of the world economy, caution as to the short-term trend of the European stock markets is justified.
However, share valuations now look more attractive relative to historic levels and to the level of bonds than for several years, and we look for better prices in the medium term.
