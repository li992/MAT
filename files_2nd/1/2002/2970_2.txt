Sales for the year were 12% up on last year to 361.5 million, 6.7% up on a like for like basis.

The Board is recommending that the final dividend be increased by 25% to 20p per share, which together with the interim dividend of 13p takes the total for the year to 33p per share 2001: 27p, a 22.2% increase on the prior year.
The dividend will be paid on 27 September 2002, to shareholders on the register on 13 September 2002.
