American pp01-20 23 03 2016 23:00 Page 3 Strategic Report CHAIRMANS STATEMENT As shareholders will be aware, this report covers a particular 12 month period in the life of JPMorgan American Investment Trust.
We publish estimated Net Asset Values daily and our share price is quoted minute by minute.
The Trust has been in existence since 1881.
I therefore see the Chairmans Statement as an opportunity both to bring shareholders up to date with the Boards thinking, and to put the year covered by the annual report and financial statements into a longer term context.
Over the longer term, your Company has performed well and has provided strong returns.
Since the end of the reporting period, markets have seen some turbulence.
In 2015, the US equity market, as measured by the S&P 500 total return Index in sterling terms, provided a return of 6.9%.
In local currency terms, the market was more or less flat, and the gain to investors arose largely from the strength of the US dollar compared with sterling.
Over the period, your Companys net asset value NAV underperformed the S&P 500 by just over 2%.
The 10 year record over which period Garrett Fish has been responsible for fund management remains ahead of the Index and the performance of the NAV of the trust, over the 10 years to 31st December 2015, ranks it in the top 2% of the 270 US large capitalisation blend funds in the relevant Morningstar universe.
Garrett produced a very strong relative performance in 2008, and outperformed in 2013 and 2014 and has started this year well.
He reports upon the reasons behind the performance returns for 2015 in his statement on pages 8 to 12.
Overall, the underperformance in the period was due to his long term preference for value stocks which led him not to invest in some of the strongest performers over the year, such as Amazon, which he considered to be expensive.
In addition, he had one or two stock disappointments.
The share price total return was 2.4%.
This was somewhat disappointing to us as it represents the combination of portfolio underperformance and the establishment of a small discount.
Having issued shares at a small premium in 2014 and early 2015, we saw investors changing preferences in mid 2015.
We have therefore, as we indicated we would, bought back shares and will continue so to do.
From the emergence of the discount in the first quarter of 2015, we have now repurchased 10,468,652 shares into Treasury as at the date of this statement, representing 3.7% of the Companys issued share capital at the beginning of 2015. Dividend growth from the portfolio was again quite significant, helped by the strength of the dollar.
This enables your Company to provide an increased final dividend of 2.5p per share, taking the dividends for the year as a whole to 4.0p per share, an increase of 23.1% on 2014.
Gearing Gearing has remained within the Boards strategic gearing level of 10%, plus or minus 2% over the year.
The investment manager, Garrett Fish, has the ability to hold cash of up to 5% of net assets if he believes there to be a real risk of capital loss and we have indicated that our highest level of gearing would be 20%.
The ability to gear is an important feature of a closed end investment vehicle.
The Board has developed a diversified debt strategy in order to avoid having to refinance all our debt at a particular point, to alleviate the need to time a particular interest rate level and to maintain flexibility.
In April 2015, the Company put in place an additional 25 million of flexible bank debt through a five year facility with National Australia Bank to ensure that the Boards strategic gearing level could be maintained.
The Company now has bank facilities totalling 60 million which are or will be drawn down in dollars, together with a 50 million sterling debenture in respect of which the currency mismatch is hedged.
Repayment dates for the bank debt are December 2016 and April 2020: the debenture matures in June 2018.
For full details of the terms of these facilities please refer to pages 49 and 50.
Dividends US companies continued to provide a reasonably strong dividend flow and the income we received last year showed further gains.
The increase in your Companys income was approximately 12%.
Our analysis shows that, just over 7% of the income increase over the year came from the strengthening of the US dollar vs. sterling.
The remainder was due to an increase in dividends 3 American pp01-20 23 03 2016 23:00 Page 4 Strategic Report continued CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CONTINUED received in the portfolio.
The Company paid an interim dividend in respect of the 2015 financial year of 1.5p on 9th October 2015.
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, a final dividend of 2.5p will be paid on 13th May 2016 to shareholders on the register on 15th April 2016, making a total of 4.0p per share, compared with last years total of 3.25p per share.
After the payment of the proposed final dividend, we will have a balance in the revenue reserves of 13.7 million equivalent to 5.0 pence per share or 1.25 times the current dividend.
It is our intention that such reserves be used to support dividend payments when corporate pay outs are less healthy, or if there are other fluctuations in the revenue account which we assess to be temporary.
Our manager expects further income growth from the portfolio in 2016.
Share Price and Premium Discount In January 2015, the Company issued 600,000 shares.
The shares were issued at a premium to estimated NAV.
In early February 2015, the Companys shares began trading at a consistent discount, having in the main traded at a premium over the prior three years.
Accordingly, having monitored the discount level on a daily basis, the Board authorised the repurchase in 2015 of a total of 5,350,884 shares into Treasury.
So far this year and to the date of this report, the Company has repurchased a further 5,117,768 shares into Treasury.
As evidenced above, and as we have stated in previous years, the Board has this year demonstrated its willingness to buy shares back when they stand at anything more than a small discount.
The Board remains aware of its responsibility not to let the discount widen significantly and therefore the Company will again be asking shareholders to approve the relevant share buyback resolutions at the Annual General Meeting.
We will also be seeking shareholder permission to issue shares, where Directors are confident of sustainable market demand.
The authority, if approved, will allow the Company to issue up to 10% of its issued share capital at prices in excess of the estimated NAV including income with the value of our debt deducted at market prices.
Discount Premium level calculated with debt at fair value and including income.
Investment Manager The Companys objective is to achieve capital growth from North American investments by outperformance of the Companys benchmark, which is the S&P 500 Index with both net asset value and benchmark measured in sterling total return terms.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 American pp01-20 23 03 2016 23:00 Page 5 In 2015, Directors met with the investment managers of both the large and small capitalisation portfolios and the investment company team in London, and had conversations over the teleconference system with our managers in New York if they are not in London.
In 2015, the Board again visited the Managers offices in New York where it held meetings with senior management, the behavioural finance team of which Garrett is a member, the corporate engagement and dealing teams.
In addition to investment management, the Manager provides other services to the Company, including marketing, accounting and company secretarial services.
We have analysed our relationship with the Manager in detail and robustly, as we must, and have concluded that the ongoing appointment of the Manager is in the continuing interests of shareholders.
Costs and Directors Fees In 2015, we have continued to keep our focus on costs through the year, given that it is important that we continue to offer attractive value for shareholders and potential shareholders.
After increasing our fees in 2015, your Directors resolved not to increase the rate of fees for 2016.
The table set out below is in the same format as we have used for the last two years.
It aims to shows the returns generated on the Companys investments, the extent to which the capital base of the Company has grown or shrunk through share issuance and buy-backs, and the full costs of the Companys operations.
Management fees generally vary with the size of the Company and therefore rose.
No performance fee was payable and the Company clawed back prior amounts.
Another significant cost for the Company this year was the payment of the depositarys fees.
This was the first full year that such fees have been paid, subsequent to the regulatory requirement to appoint a depositary arising from the AIFM Directive.
Despite these extra costs, we note that the Companys Ongoing Charges remain relatively low at 0.62% 2014: 0.64%.

From its introduction the fee has been based on the difference between the capital return of the NAV and the capital return of the S&P 500 Index.
We believe that the broad structure of the fee remains in shareholders interests as it is capped and has a mechanism to offset underperformance and thus no fee is payable for 2015, and will not be payable until this years underperformance is recovered, as described below.
However, we have amended the calculation slightly so that outperformance is measured in total return terms, which is better aligned with the returns experienced by shareholders.
That is, the NAV total return is compared with the total return provided by the S&P 500, both in sterling terms.
We believe this is a better measure of performance and removed distortions which can be caused by retained income, particularly as the Companys income receipts are rising.
In our calculations for the 2014 performance fee we removed the retained income element from the capital calculation and have now put in place the new calculation with effect from 1st January 2015.
In relation to the Companys financial year ended 31st December 2015, the Companys NAV total return underperformed the total return of the S&P 500 Index, expressed in sterling terms, resulting in a negative performance fee calculation of 1,818,000.
This amount when deducted from the 507,000 performance fee provision brought forward leaves a balance of negative 1,312,000, which will be carried forward and offset against future outperformance.
Full details of the mechanics of the performance fee payments are detailed on page 23.
The Board The Board has procedures in place to ensure that the Company complies fully with the AIC Code on Corporate Governance and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
In accordance with corporate governance best practice, all Directors will be retiring and seeking re-election at the Companys forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Nomination Committee met formally to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of each individual Director and is satisfied that all retiring Directors possess the experience and attributes required of a Director for this Company.
Accordingly, the re-elections of all Directors at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting are recommended to shareholders.
The Board continues to manage succession so that it has an appropriate balance of skills and diverse approaches to its tasks.
Having served as a Director since 2005, Kate Bolsover will retire from the Board by the end of 2016.
Kate has contributed enormously to the deliberations of the Board over her tenure and we wish her well for the future.
The Board is currently in the process of recruiting a new non-executive Director.
Having chaired the Board since 2012 and having been appointed to the Board in 2005, I plan to step down from the Board during 2017.
The Companys Senior Independent Director, Sir Alan Collins has overseen the process to select my successor and I am delighted to say that Dr Kevin Carter will succeed me at that point.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 American pp01-20 23 03 2016 23:00 Page 7 Annual General Meeting and Shareholder Contact This years Annual General Meeting is the Companys 100th and it will be held on Wednesday, 11th May 2016 at 2.30 p. m. at 60 Victoria Embankment, London EC4Y 0JP.
As in previous years, in addition to the formal part of the meeting, there will be a presentation from our investment manager Garrett, who will answer questions on the portfolio and performance.
There will also be an opportunity to meet the Board, Garrett, and representatives of JPMF after the meeting.
I look forward to welcoming as many shareholders as possible to this meeting.
Last year, following the publication of our results for 2014, I did contact our largest shareholders and had useful discussions with several.
I am pleased to hear from shareholders, and can be contacted through our Company Secretary, whose details are set out on page 69.
Outlook Obviously there is much comment about the forthcoming US elections this year.
There is also concern about rates of growth outside the US particularly in China as well as worries about geopolitical tensions.
Interest rates have finally begun to rise, although how far and how fast is very unclear.
At the same time, the US corporate sector, relative to many other places to invest, looks relatively attractive.
Although there are problems in the energy and resource sectors, elsewhere profits kept growing in 2015.
Profit expectations for 2016 are currently modest but corporate dividend growth is expected to continue.
We expect the US equity market to continue to be a reasonable place to invest given the extraordinary breadth of opportunity it provides.
