The Company Stripping volumes in 2015 were 65.3 Mt of rock moved, extending mine lives at our existing operations: reported another year of strong operational delivery with a decrease of 16% year-on-year due to the completion Okhotsk hub currently the shortest mine life, Dukat, gold equivalent production for the year reaching 1.27 Moz, Dukat 31 Omolon, albazino and voro: of open-pit mining on several deposits, including Dalneye, which exceeded the original production guidance for 2015 Albazino Amursk 17 Sopka and Tsokol Omolon hub and Khakanja Okhotsk 1 extending life-of-mine by resource-to-reserve conversion of 1.22 Moz by 4%.
at varvara, there was a decrease in the amount of ore at Kyzyl through in-fill drilling: Voro 11 mined while processing stockpiles and due to the temporary gold production was 861 Koz, a 9% year-on-year decrease, estimating hard-rock PgM resources at our viksha project Mayskoye 11 shutdown of the flotation circuit.
at the same time, due to mainly as a result of scheduled production declines at mature in Karelia, sufficient for a standalone mining operation: Okhotsk 9 favourable economic conditions, we resumed open-pit mines, including voro, Omolon hub and varvara.
Meanwhile, Varvara 6 mining at Birkachan and commenced mining at Oroch resource estimates for newly acquired exploration projects, silver production increased by 12% reaching 32.1 Moz, driven Omolon hub and Svetloye.
