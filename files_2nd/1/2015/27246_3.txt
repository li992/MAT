CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Dear Shareholder, It is my pleasure to present to you the Annual Report of NB Global Floating Rate Income Fund Limited the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Portfolio and Company performance Against a backdrop of weak global economic growth led by concerns over a slowdown in China and further declines in oil prices, senior loan assets demonstrated dogged resilience relative to other global bourses in the year ended 31 December 2015.
Your Board is content with the progress made by the Investment Manager during this period.
The portfolio remains fully invested, with a strong US bias.
As of 31 December 2015, 93.59% of the Company was invested in US Dollar denominated assets, with 4.61% invested in Euro denominated assets and 1.80% in Sterling denominated assets all excluding cash.
The Investment Manager has constructed a diversified portfolio of loan investments, across currencies, ratings and sectors.
At the end of the reporting year, the portfolio was 95.41% invested in loan investments with 277 holdings across 222 issuers in 32 different sectors 2014: 99.05% invested in loan investments with 267 holdings across 206 issuers in 33 different sectors.
The portfolio also held 4.59% in senior bonds which included positions in collateralised loan obligations.
Between 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, the Companys NAV per share dropped by 3.77% and 3.56% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Share and Sterling Ordinary Share, respectively.
The NAV return plus dividends declared in the year was 0.08% and 0.32% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and Sterling Ordinary Shares, respectively.
During 2015, the annualised dividend yield of the Company on dividends paid during the year 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 was 4.11% based on a share price of $0.9238 for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and 4.13% based on a share price of 0.9175 for the Sterling Ordinary Shares, which we believe is attractive given current market conditions.
As at 31 December 2015, the share price was trading at a discount of 2.66% for the U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and 2.63% for the Sterling Ordinary Shares.
During the year to 31 December 2015, the Company repurchased 1,355,254 U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and 30,575,000 Sterling Ordinary Shares.
Over the same period the Companys U. S. Dollar Ordinary Shares and Sterling Ordinary Shares traded at an average discount to NAV of 1.7% and 2.1% respectively.
The Board notes that, as a result of heightened volatility in the market in the first quarter of 2016, the Companys shares have traded at a discount wider than the Boards previously stated target of 3% in normal market conditions.
Since the year-end and at the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report, the Board has continued to seek to address any temporary imbalances of supply and demand for the shares by reducing the Companys share capital by 10.3% through a series of share repurchases.
It is pleasing to report that the Companys discount has improved steadily since this period of intense volatility and at the latest practicable date prior to publication of this report is 3.94% and 3.86% per U. S. Dollar Ordinary Share and Sterling Ordinary Share respectively.
The Board will remain vigilant in its approach to discount control on behalf of shareholders and reaffirms its belief that it is undesirable for the Companys shares to trade at much wider than a 3% discount in normal market conditions.
ANNUAL REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2015 3 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 ANNUAL REPORT CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CONTINUED Outlook for the rest of the financial year The first quarter of 2016 was a challenging one for credit markets as fears over global growth and diverging monetary policies put pressure on asset values in a period of heightened volatility.
Whilst volatility is likely to remain a theme for the remainder of the year, your Board believes the senior loan market is well positioned to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.
From a macroeconomic perspective, your Board believes U. S. GDP growth will continue at a modest pace and this should translate to future rate rises, albeit on a more gradual trajectory than originally expected.
From a fundamental perspective, your Board believes that the recent pressure on senior loan asset values offers compelling valuations across the asset class which the Investment Manager, through its disciplined investment approach, is well positioned to seek out.
The Investment Manager will continue to update you on the Companys progress by way of the monthly fact sheets and Investment Manager updates.
I would like to close by thanking you for your commitment and support.
William Frewen Chairman 18 April 2016 4 NEUBERGER BERMAN
