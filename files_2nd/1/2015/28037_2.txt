PIGIT pp01 16 PIGIT pp01 16 05 06 2015 14:59 Page 05 STRATEGY CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Performance For the year ended 31 March 2015, the Companys net asset value rose by 11.7% comparing very favourably to the rise of 6.6% in the FTSE All-Share Index, both including reinvested income.
This measure of outperformance by the portfolio manager is to be congratulated and you can read how he achieved this in Mark Barnetts report which follows on pages 7 to 9. Dividend For the year ended 31 March 2015, three interim dividends of 2.8p each were paid to shareholders in September and December 2014, and March 2015.
A fourth interim dividend of 3.9p and a special dividend of 1.9p will be paid on 26 June 2015.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 14.2p, representing an increase of 3.6% on the previous year.
The Companys dividend for the year excluding the special dividend has more than doubled over the last ten years, a growth rate exceeding three times the rate of inflation in the same period.
The Board continues to recognise the importance of dividends to shareholders and is seeking to maintain its policy of real dividend growth over the medium to longer term.
With this in mind, the Board is proposing dividends that will distribute to shareholders a significant majority of the special dividends received by the Company in the year, whilst retaining a small amount in accordance with the Boards policy of retaining a prudent level of reserves.
Investment Management Fees As I mentioned in the Companys Half-Yearly Financial Report, the Board has negotiated a reduction of the management fees paid to the Manager.
With effect from 1 April 2014, the base management fee was reduced from 0.75% pa to 0.6% pa on the first 500 million of assets under management and 0.4% thereafter.
The performance fee cap was also reduced from 0.75% to 0.5% of year end assets under management.
These changes represent a significant reduction in the costs borne by the Company and are reflected in the Companys lower ongoing charges ratio.
Fees and expenses remain, as always, a focus of attention for the Board.
Borrowing and Gearing The Boards policy is to permit gearing up to a maximum of 25% of total net assets and allows the portfolio manager some discretion up to that level.
Borrowings are provided by 60 million of 4.37% senior secured notes 2029 and the Companys bank overdraft facility of 110 million.
Throughout the year the portfolio manager has varied the gearing level of his portfolio, ranging between 11% and 19%, and ending the year at 15.3% 2014: 14.2%.
Issued Share Capital A total of 3,058,076 new shares have been issued during the year, reflecting market demand for the Companys shares.
Of these, 248,846 arose from shareholders choosing to reinvest their dividends and a further 2,809,230 were issued to meet demand.
Board Antony Hardy has informed the Board that he does not intend to seek re-election at the Companys forthcoming AGM and will therefore retire from the Board at its conclusion.
Mr Hardy has been a Director of the Company since its inception in 1996.
His diligent stewardship of the Company during his tenure has been integral to its long term success and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him sincerely on behalf of the Board and to wish him well for the future.
The Board has a formal succession plan in place and having considered the composition of the Board, taking into account the imminent retirement of Mr Hardy at the coming AGM, a search has been initiated to identify a suitable replacement.
Mr Hardy currently holds the position of Senior Independent Director.
The Board has agreed that upon his retirement he will be succeeded in this role by Vivian Bazalgette.
Annual General Meeting AGM Shareholders attention is drawn to the special business in the Notice of AGM which includes the annual renewal of powers to issue and buy back shares and to allow application of the minimum notice required for general meetings other than the annual general meeting by the Companies Act 2006.
PERPETUAL INCOME AND GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 05 PIGIT pp01 16 PIGIT pp01 16 05 06 2015 11:40 Page 06 STRATEGY CHAIRMANS STATEMENT continued The Directors have carefully considered all the resolutions proposed in the Notice of the AGM as set out on pages 59 to 62 and, in their opinion, consider them all to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole.

The Companys AGM will be held at Perpetual Park, Perpetual Park Drive, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, RG9 1HH on Friday, 10 July 2015 at 11.00 am.
I do hope that as many shareholders as possible are able to attend.
