20278 PAT Annual Report:Layout 1 07 06 2018 10:33 Page 2 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Personal Assets Trusts objective is simply stated.
It is to protect and increase in that order the value of shareholders funds per share otherwise known as net asset value per share, or NAV over the long term.
To us this means not just examining performance over five or ten years but going right back to 1990, when the Company became self-managed and so began its existence in its present form.
Since 30 April 1990 the NAV has risen at an annual compound rate of 7.1% compared to 5.0% for the FTSE All-Share Index and 2.9% for the RPI.
The rise in share price at the higher annual compound rate of 8.5% is because at 30 April 1990 the shares sold at a discount to NAV of 30.3%.
Such an objective and timescale are not typical of investment trusts in general and so the Board believes it essential for existing and especially new o. shareholders to be fully aware of what we do and how and why we do it.
Quarterly N 88, enclosed along with this Report, looks in detail at each element of our investment policy as set out on page 4 and explains how we seek to put it into effect.
To measure how far Personal Assets succeeds in achieving its objective the Board looks at investment performance from two angles the result achieved and, just as important, the degree of risk accepted in achieving it.
The result achieved is shown in Key Features on page 1 while the degree of risk accepted is indicated in the bottom chart on page 10.
This shows how over the past eighteen years Personal Assets has been not only less volatile than UK equities in general but also less volatile than any of the investment trusts in the AIC Global Sector in which we were included until December 2015 and the AIC Flexible Investment Sector in which we have been included since January 2016 and which were in existence on 30 April 2000.
In his Investment Advisers Report, Sebastian Lyon highlights the increasing volatility of financial markets while looking towards the buying opportunities we are confident will await us in due course.
Two years ago I reported that as a result of the change in the Articles of Association to permit the Company to distribute realised capital profit as dividend the Board had been able to commit to paying the dividend at the present annual rate of 5.60 per share for the foreseeable future without interfering with the balance and composition of our investment portfolio.
In the year to 30 April 2018 we drew on revenue reserves to the extent of 740,000 leaving us with 422,000 of undistributed revenue available from past years before we would again need to draw on the distributable Capital Reserve Realised see page 13.
During the year we issued 252,306 shares for a total of 102.6 million.
It is the policy of the Board that our shares should at all times be readily realisable by individual holders at as close as possible to their net asset value, and it is reassuring to report that since 8 November 1999, Discount Freedom Day, when investment trusts were empowered to use capital to buy back shares and hence to control the discount to net assets at which their shares sell, Personal Assets share price has risen almost exactly in line with shareholders funds per share while the number of shares outstanding is now six times higher, having grown from 369,121 at 30 April 2000 to 2,212,433 by 30 April 2018.
For some time now we have been planning how best to diversify and strengthen the Board in the years to come.
In 2016 Jean Sharp joined us and was recently appointed Chair of the Audit Committee.
In December 2017 we welcomed Iain Ferguson and Paul Read, both of whom have already made significant contributions to our discussions.
Meanwhile, Frank Rushbrook has intimated that he would like to retire after the 2019 AGM on completing ten years service and in due course Robin Angus and I will also be seeking to retire.
I am 73 and have been Chairman for nine years, while Robin, who has been closely involved with Personal Assets since its inception in 1983 and has been full time Executive Director since 2002, will be 66 this year.
Shareholders can therefore expect further refreshing of the Board during the next few years.
Continuity and collective memory are, however, extremely important to any Board and especially to one with Personal Assets long tradition of independent thought and action, and with this in view we have asked Gordon Neilly, who has been a Director since 1997 but is still, at 57, comfortably below normal retiring age, to stay on subject to re-election as a Director over this period of change specifically in order to provide that much-needed continuity.
To give maximum scope to new Directors as they begin their duties, Gordon will not be a member of any of the Board Committees.
