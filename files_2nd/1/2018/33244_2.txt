As the year progressed, trade wars, politics and slowing economic activity all weighed heavily on markets.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, with Brexit as its companion, small UK quoted companies did not escape.
The Numis Smaller Companies Index excluding Investment Companies NSCI XIC, the Companys benchmark, gave a total return of -15.3%.
The Companys net asset value total return was -15.4%, which reflects the return attributable to equity Shareholders of -235.92p 2017: 279.32p, together with the effect of dividends received by them and re-invested.
The share price generated a total return of -11.8%.
By comparison, the FTSE 100 Indexs total return was -8.7% and that of the FTSE All-Share Index, which is heavily weighted towards large companies, was -9.5%.
The Managers Report provides more detail on 2018s performance.
Board changes I have informed my colleagues of my decision not to stand for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Initially appointed as a Director of the Company on 30 January 2013, and subsequently Chairman on 17 October 2014, it has been my privilege to serve the Shareholders of the Company.
My Board colleagues are a great team guiding the direction of the Company and I have enjoyed working with them throughout this time.
My replacement will further strengthen the Board.
I would like also to record my admiration for the partners and staff of Aberforth.
Their focus and depth of understanding is admirable in a world where so often asset gathering is prioritised over serving the needs of customers.
This is never an issue with Aberforth and I am confident this will remain the case.
We are delighted to appoint Richard Davidson as a Director with effect from 26 January 2019.
It is intended that he will become Chairman following the closure of the Annual General Meeting on 28 February 2019.
Richard brings a wealth of knowledge of the investment world and is looking forward to working with both his new Board colleagues and the Managers.
An independent board of directors is undoubtedly one of the principal advantages and differentiators of investment trusts in the broader UK savings industry.
Dividends The Board remains committed to a progressive dividend policy.
In this context, the Board is pleased to propose a final ordinary dividend of 20.75p.
Total ordinary dividends of 30.25p for 2018 represent a 5.0% increment when compared with 2017.
Since 2015, alongside the ordinary dividend declared, the Company has also paid a special dividend, thereby ensuring that the all-important minimum retention test imposed by HMRC is not breached.
The Board adopted such a strategy to avoid the pitfalls of allowing non-recurring revenue streams to become embedded into the progressive dividend policy, a particular risk given the greater prevalence of special dividends and non-recurring distributions since the financial crisis.
In 2018, the Company was once again a beneficiary of special dividends and the Board has declared a special dividend of 7.75p per share alongside the total ordinary dividend of 30.25p to ensure the retention test is met.
After adjusting for both the final ordinary and special dividends, the Companys revenue reserves will be 68.8p per share, circa 2.3x the ordinary dividend.
Strengthened revenue reserves, and prudent management of the non-recurring revenue streams of recent years, leave the Board optimistic about the sustainability of the progressive dividend policy.
As highlighted in last years Chairmans Statement, the ambition behind this strategy, and perhaps its acid test, will be for the Board to deliver dividend growth through the next downturn.
Dividend growth from small UK quoted companies has been exceptionally strong since the global financial crisis.
There was further progress in 2018, though the overall experience was more mixed than in previous years.
I would reiterate my comments from previous years that the base level for the Companys progressive dividend policy is the ordinary dividend, i. e. 30.25p which excludes the special dividend.
Share buy back At the Annual General Meeting in March 2018, the authority to buy back up to 14.99% of the Companys Ordinary Shares was approved.
During the year, 2,418,826 Ordinary Shares 2.6% of the issued share capital were bought in at a total cost of 32.8m.
Consistent with the Boards stated policy, those Ordinary Shares have been cancelled rather than held in Treasury.
Once again, the Board will be seeking to renew the buy-back authority at the Annual General Meeting on 28 February 2019.

The 125m facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland International has a term expiring in June 2020.
As has been the case in the past, the facility term dovetails with the three-yearly continuation vote cycle.
The facility continues to provide the Company with access to liquidity for investment purposes and to fund share buy-backs as and when appropriate.
In an illiquid, and at times volatile, asset class such as small UK quoted companies, having access to immediate funds through a credit facility provides the Managers with enhanced flexibility.
During the year, the level of gearing ranged from nil to 2.8%, with an average of 0.8%, and at the year end gearing stood at 1.3% of Total Shareholders Funds.
Outlook Throughout my tenure as Chairman, politics has cast a somewhat dark shadow.
Two referendums, two general elections and the rise of populism globally have contributed to a challenging investment environment.
Brexit negotiations are currently centre stage.
The difficulties in reconciling a narrow referendum outcome, which would seem to be at odds with the majority in the Houses of Parliament, should not be underestimated, although it is perhaps the transition from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening that will have more lasting impact on the investment world.
Amidst all this uncertainty, the asset class is getting cheaper!
In October 2014, when I became Chairman, the NSCI XIC sold on a historic price earnings multiple of 14.1x and yield of 2.5%.
As at 1 January 2019, it is selling on a 10.9x p e multiple and yielding 3.6%.
As value investors, the Managers, unsurprisingly, oversee a portfolio that is selling at a lower p e multiple of 9.6x and a yield of 3.7%.
The coming year will undoubtedly bring an array of surprises.
However, after a tough 2018, the Board looks forward with a degree of optimism, which is based upon the attractive valuations and the consistency of approach and professionalism of the Managers.
Finally, the Board very much welcomes the views of Shareholders and we are available to talk to you directly.
