barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 01 Chairmans letter A solid foundation for the future Dear Fellow Shareholders I am pleased to report that Barclays is in a very different place than it has been since the global financial crisis, and with the significant restructuring done, we can now for the first time in the recent past look forward to enhancing shareholder returns and distributions.
We have made significant progress, particularly in the past few years: we resolved a substantial portion of our major legacy matters putting behind us issues that have to date cost us over 17 billion we exited the bulk of our non-core and sub-performing assets at a cost of over 12 billion.
We implemented all elements of structural reform requirements: created a new ring-fenced UK bank from scratch, ahead of competitors and time, that is operating strongly established a service company that is delivering operational and financial efficiencies, creating the capacity to reinvest in the core businesses, as well as being in a position to provide essential services in the event of a failure of the bank finalised the arrangements for an intermediate holding company in the US John McFarlane set up arrangements in the EU and Chairman a transfer process, such that we are one of the most prepared banks for Brexit reflected advanced corporate governance in the major subsidiary banks with new governance arrangements including the introduction of separate boards of directors.
The Chairman presents a review We have also developed a strong values-based of the year and the key events and culture that enables us to serve our customers, impacts on our business.
to make a significant contribution to society, to reward shareholders and to protect ourselves from the reputational damage associated with poor industry conduct.
Against a backdrop of very substantial increases in regulatory capital requirements, over time we have built up sufficient capital and financial strength enabling us to achieve our target capital ratio of c. 13% of riskweighted assets, prudently surpassing our mandatory distribution restriction hurdle, and we are in a position to endure severe future economic stress and yet be in a position to extend credit to our customers in that event.
Some commentators imply because we are at that level but below other more domestic competitors, our capital is inadequate.
The aim is to have the right amount of capital to balance safety and returns, rather than the maximum amount possible.
