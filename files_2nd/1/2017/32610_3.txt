JPM Mercantile pp01 18 05 04 2017 09:40 Page 3 Strategic Report Performance Chairmans Over the year to 31st January 2017, your Company returned 6.1% cum income, debt at par Statement against 12.5% for the benchmark.
Share price total return was 4.3%.
As mentioned in the Half Year Report, your Company underperformed in the first half of the current financial year by being positioned wrongly for the outcome of the EU referendum.
In the second half of the year your Company outperformed its benchmark, both in performance and share price total return, but that did not compensate for the loss incurred by the incorrect positioning of the portfolio for the EU referendum in June.
Returns and Dividends Earnings per share increased from 51.5p to 53.2p, compared with the year ended 31st January 2016.
Your Company has paid three interim dividends of 10.25p per ordinary share over the year under review and the Board has declared a fourth quarterly interim dividend of 15.25p, giving a total dividend of 46.0p per share for the year, a 7.0% increase on last years total dividend of 43.0p per share.
The Board intends to declare the first three interim dividends for the current year ending 31st January 2018 at 10.5p per ordinary share.
The level of the fourth interim dividend will be determined by the Board following the end of the financial year and will depend on the level of dividends received and anticipated by the Company.
The Board recognises the importance to shareholders of a smooth flow of dividends and also of maintaining a strong revenue reserve.
At the year end, taking account of the payment of the fourth interim dividend, the revenue reserve stood at 36.7 million, which is the equivalent to 42.2p per share.
Discount and Share Buybacks Over the year under review, the discount widened from 10.6% to 12.5% on the basis of a cum income net asset value calculation, with debt valued at par.
Using a cum income valuation with debt at fair value, the discount has widened from 7.4% to 8.6%.
I would urge you to refer to page 20 where there is an explanation of the calculation methodologies.
During the year a total of 8,976,621 shares were repurchased, amounting to 9.4% of the issued share capital at the beginning of the year, at a total cost of approximately 150 million.
Of those, 1,507,822 shares were cancelled and the balance held in Treasury.
Share buy backs during the year under review have added approximately 16.13p to the net asset value per share.
The Board intends to continue to use the share repurchase authority to enhance value, to manage imbalances between the supply and demand of the Companys shares and so reduce the volatility of the discount.
The Board believes that, to date, this mechanism has been helpful and therefore proposes and recommends that the powers to repurchase up to 14.99% of the Companys shares, to be cancelled or held in Treasury, be renewed for a further period.
The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 3 JPM Mercantile pp01 18 05 04 2017 09:40 Page 4 Strategic Report continued Gearing Your Company ended the year with gearing of 2.5%.
During the year gearing varied between 8.3% net cash and 2.5% geared using month end data.
It is the Boards intention to continue to operate within the range of 10% net cash to 20% geared, under normal market conditions.
Gearing is regularly discussed between the Board and the Investment Managers.
The Company has long term debenture gearing, details of which are set out on the Features page.
Board All Directors other than myself will stand for annual reappointment, in line with the Companys policy.
See the Directors biographies on pages 23 and 24 for further details.
As announced in last years Annual Report, I will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM and Angus Gordon Lennox will succeed me as Chairman.
Angus Gordon Lennox has very considerable experience in financial services and particularly in the investment trust sector and I am delighted that the Board has chosen him to succeed me as Chairman.
The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its performance, and that of its committees, the individual Directors and myself as the Chairman.
Further details of this are given in the Corporate Governance Statement.
Board Apprentice In 2016 the Board decided once again to participate in the initiative launched by Board Apprentice Limited, a not-forprofit company with the objective of promoting diversity.
Our current Board Apprentice, Anjola Adeniyi, is not paid, although the Company does reimburse reasonable expenses.
Investment Managers The Companys investment management team, which continues to be led by Guy Anderson, had a very good year to 31st January 2016.
Last year it was positioned incorrectly for the outcome of the EU referendum.
The Board continues to monitor the performance of the Manager on a regular basis.
Management Fee Change During the year the Board was very pleased to reach agreement with JPMorgan on a reduction in the management fee.
With effect from 1st February 2017 the fee has been reduced from 0.5% of the Companys market capitalisation to 0.475% and it will further reduce to 0.45% with effect from 1st February 2018.
This agreement recognises the changing conditions within the fund management industry and it ensures that the Companys shareholders benefit from an ongoing charges ratio that remains amongst the most competitive in the investment trust market.
Changes to the Companys Articles of Association The Board is recommending to shareholders that the Company adopt new Articles of Association to update the investment restriction provisions which are set out in the Investment Restrictions and Guidelines in any event.
Although the total fees paid to Directors will fall by 36,000 this year following the retirement of the Chairman, the Board is also proposing an increase in the maximum aggregate annual limit on Directors fees from 300,000 to 400,000.
This will provide scope for future recruitment and fee increases.
Further, there are some minor revisions which accommodate changes to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive AIFMD and to international tax regimes.
Please refer to the Appendix to the Notice of AGM.
4 JPM Mercantile pp01 18 05 04 2017 09:40 Page 5 Strategic Report continued Annual General Meeting Your Companys one hundred and thirty first AGM will be held at Trinity House, Tower Hill, London EC3N 4DH on Wednesday 24th May 2017 at 12.00 noon.
In addition to the formal part of the meeting, there will be a presentation from the Investment Managers who will answer questions on the portfolio and performance.
The meeting will be followed by a buffet lunch which will give shareholders an opportunity to meet the Board, the Investment Managers and representatives of JPMorgan.
I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at the meeting.
Outlook We entered 2017 with a positive macroeconomic backdrop.
Industrial lead indicators suggest that global economic growth is accelerating and this growth appears to be broadly based by region and industry.
However, economic growth will not be without its challenges.
The fall in the value of sterling, combined with an increase in global commodity prices, will lead to imported inflation in the UK this year.
This inflation will need to be absorbed either by the margins of businesses, through higher prices for consumers, or both.
With time this may also result in a rising interest rate environment from which there will be a number of winners and losers.
To date the effects of the EU referendum have had a limited impact on company results.
The fall in the value of sterling has been a net beneficiary to some businesses with UK operations but internationally diverse revenues.
Your Board and our Investment Managers remain positive that the UK market is positioned to perform strongly in the long term and that attractively valued medium and small sized companies are well placed to continue to perform well.

However, as can been seen in the graph below, the trajectory was far from smooth.
Having recovered from the start of year sell-off that was driven primarily by concerns over the pace of Chinese economic growth, the market generated minor gains up until June when the Contributions to total focus turned to the EU referendum.
Following the vote to leave the EU there was an returns in the year ended immediate and sharp sell-off.
This was then recouped through July following a swift political 31st January 2017 transition to Theresa May as Prime Minister and the actions of the Bank of England to reduce % interest rates and introduce a further round of quantitative easing.
The market then entered Benchmark total return 12.5 somewhat of a holding pattern through the third quarter, before regaining momentum in Stock Sector the final quarter, as the UK economy proved itself to be more resilient than had been selection allocation 4.7 expected and as international growth showed signs of acceleration.

However, underlying this aggregate view there was a notable difference between the different components of the market, with the FTSE 100 returning 21.5% compared to 12.5% for those companies outside of the FTSE 100, as represented by the FTSE All-Share Index excluding FTSE 100 constituents and investment trusts the Benchmark.
This divergence was particularly notable in the week that followed the EU referendum as the more internationally focused FTSE 100, buoyed by the depreciation of sterling, outperformed the more domestically oriented Benchmark by nearly ten percentage points.
The chart on page 7 illustrates the geographic mix of the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250, showing just how stark the differences are in end market exposures.

Mercantile performance: a challenging year Following a strong performance in the previous year, your Company had a more difficult twelve months: the return on net assets was 6.1%, behind the 12.5% return from the Benchmark.
The share price total return was 4.3%, reflecting the widening of the discount experienced early in the year that did not fully reverse.
Pleasingly however, this was another robust year for income in the portfolio, which has supported the 7.0% increase in dividend payable as announced.

Our negative relative performance was driven by stock selection as well as the conservative level of market exposure, where holding a net cash position proved to be a drag on returns in what was ultimately a positive market environment.
While this latter component is of course disappointing, we believe that through periods of heightened risk the preservation of capital does merit a greater focus.

While there are of course a myriad of performance drivers, last year there were two significant negative factors that had the greatest impact on relative performance.
The first and lesser of those was Mining, which at a sector level was the largest detractor.
The portfolio had benefitted from not holding any miners in the previous year as the sector was under tremendous pressure due to industry over-capacity and the subsequent weakness of commodity prices.
However, 2016 marked a turning point with commodity prices recovering and the stocks that benefit from this more than doubling in aggregate over the course of the year, and thus driving relative underperformance.
In our outlook piece last year we highlighted that it would be hard to judge the exact timing of our move into this sector, but it is nevertheless disappointing to have been slow in this regard.
The second and more significant driver of performance was an event rather than a single stock or sector: the portfolio suffered significant negative relative performance in the week that followed the outcome of the referendum on EU membership.
As is illustrated in the chart on page 9, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum share price performance at a stock and sector level diverged sharply.
This was due to a combination of the different currency exposures of those companies and the increase in perceived risks for the domestic economy.
In broad terms this led to outperformance of international and defensive earners and the underperformance of domestic and cyclical earners.
As the portfolio was overweight domestic consumer and underweight international, this led to significant underperformance through that week.
Pleasingly, performance has improved since July and the portfolio outperformed the Benchmark in the second half of the year.

Portfolio positioning and the year ahead where are the opportunities?
While our investment approach is primarily focused on company specific analysis and stock selection, we remain aware of the broader macro-economic conditions and trends that may influence the relative attractiveness of different industries over time and this year was a year of adjustment in that regard.
The most material changes to the portfolio positioning occurred after the EU referendum and reflected two factors: on the one hand the increased level of uncertainty over the outlook for the UK economy and therefore domestic consumption, and on the other hand the potentially improving outlook for industrial markets, most of which are more international in nature.
Reflecting these two factors, and as is shown in the charts below, the portfolio has increased its exposure to more internationally facing and industrial companies at the expense of more domestically facing and consumer exposed companies.
For example, we made new investments in Spirax-Sarco Engineering and Fenner, while exiting from holdings in Dixons Carphone, Greggs and Halfords.

Last year we explained our positive view of the domestic consumer, as the slight uptick in earnings combined with negligible inflation has ushered forth a period of sustained real wage growth.
While disposable income has increased and encouragingly consumption has thus far remained robust, this is no longer a prominent theme for the portfolio, given the increasing evidence of inflation and therefore risks to real wage growth and future consumption.
In contrast to this and as highlighted above, we have increased our exposure to industrial companies, where the combination of an improving outlook for global industrial production and increasing inflation should provide a positive operating environment after an extended period of limited activity and minimal growth.
Fundamentally, we remain confident about the investment opportunities that can be found in our market and the structural advantages of investing in mediumand small-sized companies.
Across the portfolio we remain excited about the prospects of our holdings in a broad range of industry sectors, but perhaps none more so than the disruptive business models that are thriving from a host of structural changes underway in the industries that they serve.
Examples would include the online marketplaces such as Just Eat and Auto Guy Anderson Trader two companies that we have held since their Initial Public Offerings and companies that are using technology to increase both their efficiency and the attractiveness of their customer offerings, such as Rentokil and Marshalls.
In terms of aggregate market exposure, the portfolio ended the year 2.5% geared which, while modest, was the highest level of gearing reached in the year.
This reflected several factors: for the past few months global economic growth has shown signs of improvement, forecasts for UK economic growth have been revised upwards from very low levels and there are signs of increasing but crucially still moderate levels of inflation.
These factors combined should provide a positive backdrop for equities.
Counterbalancing this somewhat, there remain a whole host of domestic and international political uncertainties that must be faced in the year ahead and which will inevitably cause periods of increased market volatility.
Martin Hudson Reflecting these factors, we believe that it is appropriate to be modestly but positively geared and are 5.8% geared at the time of writing, leaving us with plenty of capacity to take advantage of any market driven or company specific opportunities for further reinvestment.
