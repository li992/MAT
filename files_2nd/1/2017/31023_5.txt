08 John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT THIS IS MY LAST REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AS CHAIRMAN AND I AM PLEASED TO BE LEAVING THE BUSINESS WELL POSITIONED FOR FUTURE GROWTH.
Since I became Chairman in January 2010, John Laing has evolved significantly in a number of ways: its a simpler business, NAV with non-core activities divested: its a much more international 1,123.9 million business, with three well-established geographical regions and the potential for expansion into further jurisdictions: and its a stronger business, with the ability to access new capital, having undertaken a successful IPO three years ago.
In addition, Profit before tax we have launched two successful independent secondary funds, JLIF and JLEN, which are the purchasers of a number 126.0 million of our investments once the underlying projects reach the operational stage.
Portfolio valuation As well as announcing our results, we are today launching a 1 for 3 rights issue to raise 210 million, net of costs.
The rights 1,193.8 million issue will enable the Group to take advantage of a higher proportion of the attractive opportunities currently available to it and is consistent with the Boards intention to increase the New investment committed scale of the business over the medium term.
We plan to use the proceeds to invest in public private partnership PPP projects, million 382.9 renewable energy assets, and in other appropriate greenfield infrastructure assets which fit our business model and meet our investment criteria.
The Board considers the rights issue to be in the best interests of John Laing and its shareholders as a whole.
During 2017, as in earlier years, we kept our strategy focused but also flexible.
Our business model has stood the test of time and allows the management team to concentrate on the core tasks of origination of greenfield projects: active management of construction and operational risk: and timely realisations in order to monetise investments.
We committed capital to each of our three core regions Asia Pacific, Europe and North America in the year.
The US market in particular is now showing the potential we have been anticipating for some time.
As well as two further renewable energy projects, we invested in the I-66 Managed Lanes project in Virginia.
We continue to see strong demand for new greenfield infrastructure in each of our regions.
John Laing Annual Report and Accounts 2017 09 Our business is in good shape and, based on our investment pipeline, we anticipate a strong level of deal flow over the coming years in each of our core markets.
Phil Nolan CHAIRMAN The business delivered another strong performance in 2017: Our dividend policy has two parts: Net Asset Value NAV grew by 10.5% to 1,123.9 million or a base dividend of 20 million starting from 2015 growing 306p per share at 31 December 2017, from 1,016.8 million at least in line with inflation: the Board is recommending or 277p per share at 31 December 2016: a final base dividend for 2017 of 3.82p per share, before adjustment for the rights issue: and Investment commitments reached 382.9 million, our highest ever and significantly ahead of our guidance of a special dividend of approximately 5% 10% of gross approximately 200 million: proceeds from the sale of investments on an annual basis, subject to specific investment requirements in any one year.
Realisations of investments were 289.0 million, again well The Board is recommending a special dividend for 2017 ahead of our guidance for 2017 of approximately 200 million: of 4.88p per share, before adjustment for the rights issue.
This reflects 6.2% of 2017 realisations of 289.0 million.
Our total external Assets under Management grew to 1,648.5 million, an increase of 12.0%: and The total final dividend therefore amounts to 8.70p per share, We are proposing a final dividend for 2017, before adjustment which, together with the interim dividend of 1.91p per share paid in October 2017, makes a total dividend for 2017 of 10.61p for the rights issue, of 8.70p per share made up of a base dividend of 3.82p per share and a special dividend of 4.88p per share, an increase of 30.2% over 2016, reflecting the significant level of realisations achieved in 2017.

We have an experienced Board which has been CHAIRMAN strengthened by the addition of Will Samuel.
