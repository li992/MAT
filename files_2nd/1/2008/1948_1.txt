Chairmans Statement Results Crystal Park, Airdrie, Lanarkshire The current state of the housing and mortgage markets has been well documented and the speed of the deterioration is unprecedented.
Nevertheless, the Group completed the sale of 6,556 homes, a fall of 14.2% from last years record level of 7,638.
The average price achieved for these sales was 169,729, down 2.1% from 173,300 in 2007, resulting in housing turnover reducing by 15.9% from 1,323.7 million to 1,112.7 million.
Other turnover increased from 30.3 million to 36.8 million, resulting in total turnover for the Group of 1,149.5 million, compared to 1,354.0 million in 2007.
Operating margins have come under increasing pressure as the market rapidly contracted and, in response to this, more incentives were used.
As a consequence, the operating margin, as mentioned in the Trading Update on 14 August, has fallen from 18.7% in 2007 to 16.1%, before any exceptional charge.
This has resulted in operating profit falling from 253.1 million to 185.0 million.
The net interest charge for the period is 19.1 million, up from 17.9 million, mainly reflecting changes in interest rates.
Gearing, as at 31 July 2008, was 23.7%, with 42.5% of the Groups 512 million bank facilities having been utilised.
In light of ongoing adverse market conditions, the Group considered it prudent to review its stocks by applying current expectations of revenues, dependent upon location and product.
The Group has also written down costs incurred on sites, not yet purchased, where the likelihood is that we will not conclude a purchase under current contractual terms.
In addition, our stock of unsold part exchange properties has been written down by 10%.
The total exceptional charge created by these actions is 130.9 million, equating to 8.0% of stocks at 31 July 2008.
The net profit before tax, and after exceptional items, was 34.8 million giving earnings per ordinary share of 23.6p, compared to 146.1p in 2007.
Net assets per ordinary share at 31 July 2008 were 871p compared to 903p at 31 July 2007. Dividend The Board recognises the importance of cash dividends to shareholders and, consequently, despite the current instability in the financial markets and the resultant effects on the general economy, has decided to propose a final dividend of 6p per ordinary share.
This results in a total dividend for the year of 24.1p, representing 56% of last years payment of 43.125p.
The Board believes this level of dividend for the year is an appropriate reduction, given current trading conditions.
Future dividend payments will be quantified with reference to cash generation.
The dividend will be paid on Wednesday 21 January 2009 to all ordinary shareholders on the Register of Members on Friday 12 December 2008.
The ex-dividend date is Wednesday 10 December 2008.
