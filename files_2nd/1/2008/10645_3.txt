Chairmans Statement In 2007 08 we have further strengthened our position in the consulting and business services sector.
Mouchel is increasingly seen as one of the UKs leading providers of professional services to the public sector and to industries regulated by government.
Over the last few years weve enjoyed strong performance and steady financial growth in our core markets.
In the last 12 months this has continued.
But we have also taken steps during this period to diversify our activities, acquiring businesses that move us into related markets of business process outsourcing BPO and service transformation.
The expanded Mouchel business is still positioned in public service markets that are relatively inelastic in the face of a general economic slowdown: working for clients who, we believe, will increasingly look to the private sector to help strengthen service efficiency and improve value for money for their end-users.
We expect to maintain the growth rates we have achieved in the recent past and we believe our business model remains robust.
Performance Richard Benton Revenue in 2007 08 reached a record level of 656.7 million Chairman and underlying operating profit increased by 27% to 41.7 million.
Adjusted earnings per share was up by 22% to 25.7p.
Operating margins fell, as expected, to 6.4% following the acquisition of HBS: but we are confident that, following the successful integration of that business into the Group, margins will resume their upward trend towards our 8% medium-term target.
At the end of July 2008, our forward order book and bidding pipeline stood at 2.1 billion and 2.2 billion respectively.
At more than three times our 2007 08 revenue, this level of orders highlights the visibility of our future earnings, which provides great comfort to staff and shareholders alike, particularly in the current general economic climate.
Strategy Our investment in building a wider range of service offers, directed predominantly at the UK public sector and public service industries, has proved to be effective.
Organisations in these sectors, faced by tighter budgetary constraints and under pressure to improve service efficiency, are turning to companies like Mouchel in still greater numbers.
Our investment in highway technology skills places us at the heart of the debate on managing movement.
