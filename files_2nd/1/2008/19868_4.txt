Outlook Forecasting when the current problems afflicting both the property and wider investment markets will come to an end is almost impossible, as the Government struggles to maintain order in the banking system and to instill some degree of confidence and stability in the wider economy.
The depth of the current recession will be determined by the ability of the banks to restart the credit markets through lending at competitive and not restrictive rates, by improved investor confidence in both domestic and international investment markets and by consumer confidence recovering to a level that halts the current flow of negative news emanating from the retail sector.
In the current downturn protecting current revenue streams, maintaining and creating value through active asset management and remaining alive to any opportunities that may arise in the current markets are your Companys priorities.
