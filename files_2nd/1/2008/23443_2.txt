Chairmans Statement Overview The year to 30 September 2008 was a particularly difficult one for financial markets with highly volatile stock markets, a worsening of the credit crisis and, towards the end of the year, a widespread loss of confidence driven by the prospects of recession not only in the UK but also globally.
Against this background Electra has again had a solid year including the successful realisation of a number of existing investments.
Investment activity was less than the previous year and Electra ended the year with slightly increased net liquid resources of 159 million after share buy-backs of 26 million and the... Electra has again had a 9 million cost of the special dividend paid in March 2008.
Together with borrowing solid year including the facilities, Electra had 409 million of resources available for existing commitments successful realisation of a and new investment at 30 September 2008, a position which the Board and Electra number of existing Partners consider to be advantageous in view of the buying opportunities which are investments.
expected to occur as the downturn progresses.
Results At 30 September 2008 the net asset value per share was 1,801p compared to 2,001p at the beginning of the financial year, a decline of 10%.
Together with the special dividend of 25p per share paid in March 2008, this represents a negative return of 8.3% for the year.
Over the same period the share price decreased by 26.5% while the FTSE All-Share Index decreased by 25.1%.
Over the five years to 30 September 2008 Electras net asset value per share, inclusive of dividends totalling 62p per share, increased by 145.2% and Electra achieved a return on equity of 18.5% on an annualised basis.
Over the same five-year period the share price increased by 105.5% and the FTSE All-Share Index increased by 22.5%.
Investment Activity For most of the year the mid-market buy-out sector was reasonably buoyant and our Manager, Electra Partners, bid on 19 investment opportunities out of 186 considered in the year.
However, its cautious pricing stance meant that it was frequently outbid by competitors and, as a result, new investment amounted to 114 million in aggregate for the year compared to 322 million in the previous year.
24 million was invested in Labco, a French business involved in the consolidation of medical laboratories in Europe and 20 million was invested in London & Stamford Property, an AIM listed company established to take advantage of the corrections expected in the industrial and commercial property market.
Part of our investment policy over the two years since shareholders approved the revised investment strategy has involved investment in funds thereby building relationships through our Manager with other private equity groups as a co-investor and as a fund investor.
This has yielded substantial deal flow and we believe this is an important way of providing increased diversification and accessing overseas and niche markets as a key part of the strategy going forward.
Such activity is complementary to Electras direct investment activity and an important part in providing a greater diversity of deal flow.
