Chair Chairman mans statement s statement I am very pleased to announce that 2008 was another year of excellent progress for Croda.
The Groups ability to produce record sales and profits demonstrates the robustness of the underlying business and the continuing strength in our core market sectors.
Furthermore, these results were achieved despite a difficult economic environment with steeply rising raw material costs in the first half and weak industrial markets, particularly in the second half.
Overall, the Group saw double digit sales and profit growth in every quarter, with our Consumer Care business trading particularly well.
Results Outlook Turnover increased by 18.8% to 956.4m We have started 2009 in line with expectations.
Average selling prices were up broad trading trends of resilient Consumer Care 18.5%, more than compensating for the 11.2% demand, weaker industrial markets and favourable volume shortfall caused by our deliberate strategy of currency translation are continuing.
We are confident reducing the ex-Uniqema commodity business and of making further progress in the year ahead.
weak industrial markets in the second half.
Currency translation added a further 11.5% to the growth.
Turnover in our core Consumer Care division was up 28.0% and up 11.9% in Industrial Specialities.
Continuing pre-tax profit before exceptional items Martin Flower increased by 61.8% to 98.4m 2007: 60.8m.
Non-executive Chairman Earnings per share before exceptional items increased by 39.4% to 51.7p 2007: 37.1p, despite the dilution from the business disposals discussed below.
Disposals We disposed of our associate, Baxenden Chemicals, in February 2008 to Chemtura Corporation for 13.0m and our Chicago Oleochemical business was sold to H. I. G. Capital LLC in May 2008 for 46.8m.
These disposals further reduced Crodas exposure to commodity and industrial markets.
Dividend In 2007, we changed our dividend policy from one of modest dividend growth, whilst building dividend cover, to payouts growing more in line with earnings.
As a consequence of the strong trading performance, the Board has increased the final dividend by 25.5% to 13.55p, making a total of 19.75p for the year.
This represents an increase of 25.4% versus the 15.75p paid out for 2007.
