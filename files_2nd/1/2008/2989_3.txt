We then adapt the model accordingly to take advantage of new growth opportunities and defend ourselves from new challenges.
The present is no different.
We are on the cusp of a new wave of growth in the mobile industry, as mobile data services become truly mass market and customers begin to use their handsets and other connected devices for services beyond voice and text messaging.
The growth we are experiencing in the sale of mobile email platforms, smart phones and mobile broadband is just the start of this process: during the coming year, we will be rolling out a range of laptops into all our UK stores, for connection to fixed or mobile broadband US networks: as we enter 2009, we will be trialling the first big box Best Buy Mobile format stores with our new partner Best Buy: who knows what additional devices and services will be available in the near future?

We see scope for continued roll-out of our small format Carphone Warehouse and Phone House stores, as we seek to grow our market share across Europe and evolve our retail model.
The new venture with Best Buy has the potential to re-invent consumer electronics retailing in a number of European territories and create significant value for shareholders.
Finally, the value of providing broadband to peoples homes is, we think, only just beginning to be realised.
In the future, the broadband connection will be the hub of an extraordinary array of devices and services in the home.
We aim to invest in the quality and capacity of our network, in the development of innovative new services, and in further customer acquisition, to maximise the value of the asset we have created.
