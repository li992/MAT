Results Our businesses in the Middle East and North Africa MENA region continued to thrive and the successful integration of two important acquisitions signicantly strengthened our position as the leading regional pharmaceutical manufacturer.
In line with our commitment to become a leading global speciality pharmaceutical company, we also made excellent progress in our Injectables business, where revenues grew by 23.2%.
We are making good progress in implementing our oncology strategy.
