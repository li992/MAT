CHAIRMANS STATEMENT INTRODUCTION Since I reported to shareholders at the beginning of August on the Companys results for the first six months of 2008, property markets have shown a marked deterioration.
The unprecedented conditions in financial markets worldwide and restricted availability of capital led to a sharp decline in real estate investment activity and values during 2008, particularly in the last few months of the year.
Over the last eighteen months, the Board of Hammerson has taken measures to manage the Company's gearing, including selling assets and reducing development expenditure.
It has also cut overheads.
Since 30 June 2007, the Company has sold assets and used the net proceeds of 783 million to repay debt.
The Company continues to pursue asset sales as a means of reducing gearing.
However, given the lack of debt finance available to potential purchasers to fund acquisitions, negotiations regarding sales are proving protracted and the outcomes uncertain.
Against this background, the Directors have concluded that it is in shareholders best interests for Hammersons capital base to be increased substantially through the fully underwritten rights issue to raise net proceeds of 584.2 million announced today.
The net proceeds of the rights issue will be used to reduce drawn borrowings under the Company's existing credit facilities.
The rights issue is subject to approval by shareholders at a General Meeting to be held on 25 February 2009.
RESULTS AND DIVIDEND Reflecting the very difficult market conditions, there was a reduction in the value of Hammersons portfolio which resulted in a negative capital return of 20.9% and led to a decline in the Companys adjusted NAV to 10.36 at the year end.
By contrast, the Groups net rental income showed resilience with a like-for-like increase of 3.7%.
Adjusted pre-tax profits and adjusted earnings per share declined by 3.1% and 5.5% respectively, principally reflecting financing costs associated with the development programme and funding the REIT conversion charge.
The Board is recommending an unchanged final dividend of 15.3 pence per share for 2008, giving a total dividend for the year of 27.9 pence per share compared with 27.3 pence for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The final dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the AGM to be held on 30 April 2009 and will be paid to shareholders on the register as at 20 February 2009.
The total dividend for 2008 represents a dividend cover of 1.36 times.
Applying the same dividend cover to pro forma 2008 adjusted earnings, restated for the effects of the rights issue, would result in a pro forma dividend for 2008 of 15.0 pence per share.
This takes into account the new number of shares following the rights issue and the interest saving on the debt which will be repaid from the proceeds of the rights issue.
The Board intends to maintain its policy of progressive dividend growth in the future from this base of 15.0 pence per share in respect of 2008.
PROPERTY MARKET BACKGROUND Since the onset of the major problems in the international financial markets some 18 months ago, there has been a substantial reduction in capital available for property investment leading to widespread falls in values in the Groups principal markets.
The collapse of Lehman Brothers in the Autumn of 2008, closely followed by the need for emergency action by governments to provide equity capital and other support to several banks, increased the uncertainties.
The consequence was a very significant downturn in investment activity in property markets in the last quarter of 2008 and further falls in values, with the effect more pronounced in the UK than in France.
This is now accompanied by a slowdown in economic activity in the UK and France leading to a reduction in confidence both in the business sector and amongst consumers.
As a consequence, rental levels for new leases for offices have reduced.
Rental levels for retail space are also under pressure, except at the best locations or where rents are relatively low.
It seems likely that market activity will remain subdued until there is evidence of a return to liquidity in the capital markets and an improvement in business and consumer confidence.
Nevertheless, in the context of the current very low interest rate environment, the yield on prime property now appears attractive against the returns on some other investment classes.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 5 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CONTINUED PORTFOLIO AND OPERATIONS Hammersons investment portfolio continues to generate a robust income stream from a broad spread of tenants, both in the UK and France, from leases with an average unexpired term of approximately ten years.
2 During the year leases in respect of some 59,000m of accommodation in the investment portfolio were signed or renewed.
Expiring leases with rents of 9.1 million per annum were re-let at rents 1.6 million higher than previously.
The transfer to the investment portfolio of the four developments completed during 2008 resulted in a decrease in the occupancy rate to 95.4% at 31 December 2008 from 98.2% at the end of 2007.
The Groups rent collection rates remain excellent.
In the UK, 95.2% of rents were collected within 14 days of the last quarter day on 25 December 2008.
This compares with 97.3% for the previous quarter and 97.8% for the equivalent period in 2007.
In France, 94.7% of rents were collected within 14 days of the due date, compared with 93.9% in the previous quarter.
Currently, 56 retail units are let to tenants in administration in the UK and 16 in France, of which 47 are still trading with rents being paid.
The total rent receivable from tenants in administration amounts to 6.7 million, representing just 1.8% of the Groups total rent roll, of which 4.4 million relates to units which are still trading.
During 2008, Hammerson invested a total of 514 million, of which 377 million was in respect of developments.
Some 245 million was raised from property sales, principally the Groups interests in two office buildings in the City of London - One London Wall for 67 million in March and Moorhouse for 152 million in September.
Reflecting the more difficult conditions in real estate investment markets, Hammersons portfolio showed a negative capital return of 20.9% for the year as a whole.
However, there were contrasting performances between the UK and France.
In the UK, the negative return was 25.8%, whilst in France the portfolio showed a negative return of 11.0%.
During 2008, a staff reorganisation and cost reduction programme was carried out, which will result in savings in the Groups administration expenses of approximately 3 million in 2009.
The one-off costs of implementing the programme were just over 1 million, which are reflected in the Groups accounts for the year ended 31 December 2008.
DEVELOPMENTS Excellent progress was made on the development programme.
Four of the six major developments underway at the beginning of 2008 were completed during the year.
At 31 December 2008, developments represented just 7% of the portfolio with 195 million of expenditure remaining to be incurred.
The Groups exposure to developments has reduced further since the year end with the completion in January 2009 of a fifth scheme, 60 Threadneedle Street, in the City of London, leaving just one major development underway, Union Square in Aberdeen, and some smaller retail parks schemes.
Hammerson estimates that, when these schemes are fully let and following rent-free periods, they will generate rents of 75 million of which 49 million is contracted.
Of the latter figure, 12 million was reflected in net rental income in 2008.
In August 2008, Hammerson and its partner, the City of London Corporation, were advised by JPMorgan Chase that the latter was terminating discussions regarding the development of a new headquarters building for the bank.
Accordingly costs of 15.9 million have been written off in the 2008 accounts.
Over a period of several years, Hammerson has secured a substantial pipeline of potential future development opportunities.
These include land ownerships, site purchase options, development agreements with local authorities and agreements with anchor stores.
The book value of these interests is 239 million and they currently generate income of 6 million per annum.
In the current economic climate, Hammerson does not intend to start construction of any major development projects, although it is continuing to progress the planning and design stages so that the schemes could be advanced in the future.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 6 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CONTINUED BALANCE SHEET AND FINANCING At 31 December 2008, Hammersons property portfolio was valued at 6.5 billion.
The Groups borrowings were 3,453 million and cash balances were 120 million to give net debt of 3,333 million.
Cash and undrawn committed facilities amounted to 487 million at 31 December 2008.
The undrawn committed facilities totalled 367 million, of which 200 million expires at the end of 2009, 17 million in June 2010 and 100 million at the end of 2010.
The weighted average term to expiry of drawn committed facilities was 7.3 years at 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2008, approximately 1,611 million or 47% of the Groups gross borrowings were denominated in euros.
As a result of the appreciation of the euro relative to sterling in 2008, the sterling value of the Groups euro-denominated net liabilities increased by 496 million.
This accounted for ten percentage points of the rise in the Groups gearing from 57% at the start of the year to 118% at the year end.
RIGHTS ISSUE The proposed rights issue will substantially strengthen the Companys overall financial position.
Specifically it should enable the Company to remain within the most restrictive financial covenants contained in its existing borrowing agreements - minimum interest cover of 1.25 times and maximum gearing of 150%, thus allowing the Company to continue to benefit from the low cost of the existing facilities.
Following the rights issue, on a pro forma basis, interest cover would increase to 2.02 times and gearing would show a reduction to 81%, based on Hammerson's financial statements at 31 December 2008.
I believe that, following the rights issue, the Companys long term strategy should enable it to generate attractive returns in the future for three principal reasons.
First, its investment portfolio is of high quality with assets of a type that should prove attractive to occupiers and generate rental growth over time.
The appeal of such assets to property investors should increase as markets recover and funding becomes more readily available.
Second, the current difficulties being experienced by certain property investors are expected to give rise to attractive acquisition opportunities for Hammerson.
Third, Hammerson has a substantial pipeline of development opportunities which can be progressed in the longer term.
CONCLUSION The fundamentals of Hammersons business remain sound and, following the rights issue announced today, the Companys financial condition will be substantially strengthened.
Our high quality portfolio is focused on prime retail and office assets in the UK and France and generates a robust and growing income stream.
