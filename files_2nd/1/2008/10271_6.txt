chaIrManS StateMent our actions have added stability and enhanced the Groups strength to withstand the current economic crisis In June and July 2008, we detected a slowdown in the rate of growth in Asia and since then the Group has remained vigilant in controlling costs including a recruitment freeze and a halt on virtually all new capital expenditure apart from essential health and safety expenditure.
We immediately took steps to implement cash conservation and profit protection plans for the Group.
Through the successful implementation of these continued initiatives, I am pleased to report that, despite a softening of demand across all regions in which the Group operates, in the quarter ended 31 December 2008, the Group has managed to partially mitigate the adverse market and financial conditions on the Groups hotel revenue and RevPAR.
Financial Performance In reported currency, the Groups hotel revenues increased 7.1% and RevPAR increased 7.6% for the 12 months ended 31 December 2008 while headline profit before tax increased by 6.4% to 125.9 million 2007: 118.3m and headline operating profit increased by 2.4% to 143.5 million 2007: 140.2m.
In June the Group entered into a contract to dispose of CDL Hotels Korea Limited.
However the purchaser was unable to complete the transaction and M&C recorded a 31.4 million gain arising from the forfeiture of the non-refundable cash deposit paid by the buyer, which boosted the Groups cash position by 27.3 million.
The years immediately preceding the global economic turmoil and financial tsunami in 2008 represented a period of high liquidity and relatively easy access to credit markets.
This fueled an insatiable demand for real estate properties including hotels thereby contributing to an escalation in asset prices in many countries around the world.
We adopted a conservative approach and have been selective in making our investments, with a particular emphasis on growing the Groups presence in key gateway cities in Asia.
While we have been less aggressive than many other investors, we have not been immune to the deterioration in the global markets.
Arising from a critical review of the Groups investments in joint ventures in Asia, the Groups carrying value in the 30% joint venture in Beijing and 50% joint venture in Bangkok have been fully written down by an aggregate of 19.6 million in the fourth quarter.
This is due to the difficult economic conditions and the over supplied hotel situation in Beijing post the Olympics and the 14 14 Millennium & Millennium & c copthor opthorne ne h hotels plc otels plc a annual nnual r report & eport & a accounts 2008 ccounts 2008 Millennium & copthorne hotels plc annual report & accounts 2008 15 chaIrManS StateMent unstable political conditions affecting business in Thailand.
At the end of the year the Group took impairment charges of 15.5m on Sunnyvale, hotels in the UK and US, and land in India.
The Group also recorded a loss of 20.4m which represents its share of the revaluation deficit 2007: 32.3m revaluation uplift of investment properties of CDLHT, the Groups 39.0% associate in a Singapore-listed REIT.
All these non-cash items have been separately identified in the income statement.
The Groups investment of 39.5m in China through First Sponsor, largely funded by surplus Australian dollars, benefited from exchange rate translation generating a currency gain of 14.3m which was credited to reserves.
Strong Balance Sheet and Capital Resources The Group continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and low gearing at 16.4% 31 December 2007: 18.3%.
As at 31 December 2008, the Group had total undrawn committed bank facilities available of 188.6m.
Although the Group had repaid 40.0m of bank debt during the year, net debt increased by 23.0m from 2007 due to the effect of foreign currency translation.
Key Operational Highlights During the year the Group opened seven new hotels: one in Beijing, two further hotels in China operating under franchise agreements and four in the Middle East region operating under management contracts.
In China the Millennium Harbourview Hotel Xiamen, a 352-room property, was contracted under a franchise agreement in January 2008.
The hotel was formerly the Crowne Plaza Harbourview Hotel Xiamen.
In April 2008 the Group opened its fourth Grand Millennium property, the 521-room Grand Millennium Beijing in China, and in May 2008 the Copthorne Hotel Qingdao, a 453-room property, was contracted under a franchise agreement.
The hotel was formerly Hotel Equatorial Qingdao.
In total, the Group has five properties in China.
In the Middle East the Group opened four new properties under management contracts under three brands which are all new to the Middle East.
The first property is the 352-room Grand Millennium Dubai which was the third property in the Group to be launched under the Grand Millennium brand.
The second is the Copthorne Hotel Dubai which has 163 rooms offering views over Dubai Creek and surrounding parks from private balconies.
The third is the Al Jahrah Copthorne Hotel & Resort, the Groups first property in Kuwait.
The Group opened its fourth property, the 108-room Kingsgate Abu Dhabi Hotel marking the first property trading under the Kingsgate brand outside of New Zealand.
The Group also announced the signing of a further eight management contracts, with seven in the United Arab Emirates and one in Kuwait.
These properties are due to open between 2009 and 2011 and account for almost 2,300 additional rooms.
This brings the number of rooms in the Groups worldwide pipeline to 5,168 rooms 17 hotels.
The Group has largely completed a combined US$50.0m renovation project at the Millennium Bostonian in Boston and the Millennium Knickerbocker in Chicago to completely transform both properties to bring a stylish, high quality upscale look to both hotels.

Dividend In this difficult trading climate, consistent with our focus on conserving cash, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.17p per share taking the full year dividend to 6.25p per share.
CEO Appointment We announced the appointment of Richard Hartman as Chief Executive Officer on 7 April 2008.
Richard joined the Board of Millennium & Copthorne on 7 May 2008.
Wong Hong Ren reverted to his previous role as an Executive Director with responsibilities that include overseeing the Groups finance function.
Richard, aged 63 has over 30 years experience in the hotel and restaurant industry and has held senior positions at InterContinental Hotels Group where he was main Board Director from 2003 to 2007.
He was also President of ITT Sheraton North America between 1992 and 1998.
Looking Forward Moving forward, global financial and credit markets are expected to remain volatile with the continued loss of confidence among investors, lenders and industry players alike.
In this current uncertain climate, it is difficult to predict with accuracy how long these conditions will continue to exist and when a correction and improvement in market sentiment can be expected.
We are cognisant of the fact that airline load factors are currently in decline despite the reduction in energy and fuel oil prices.
Leisure and corporate travel are also facing great constraints.
Group RevPAR for the first 5 weeks of 2009 declined by 21.2% New York -41%, Regional US -23%, Asia -20%, London -4%.
Against this background, the Group is anticipating that the next few quarters will present challenging trading conditions which are expected to be partially mitigated by the fact that global rooms supply from new build hotels is limited due to the lack of debt financing.
We have made some tough decisions in recent years, including changes in senior management, and have maintained our prudent approach to acquisitions, divestments and the way in which the Group is financed.
Our actions have added stability and enhanced the Groups strength to withstand the current economic crisis.
I believe that with a continued policy of tough, prudent and analytical management we can steer our ship through the roughest of waters.
When calm returns to the world economic scene as eventually it must we will have secured an enviable competitive position from which we may exploit the best commercial opportunities that become available.
Finally I would like to thank all our staff for their sterling efforts in 2008 and to express my sincere gratitude, as always, to our shareholders, for demonstrating their confidence in the Group, for remaining committed to our future, and for their belief in our ability to deliver further good results for 2009 and beyond.
