212016 RIT R&A pp01-pp19 29 5 08 19:16 Page 4 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT 4 In last years Annual Report, I commented on the paradox of investors appetite for risk increasing at a time when the level of risk was clearly rising.
The credit crunch, the housing debacle, the slow-down in economic growth and rising inflation were already threatening the world economy and, as the year has gone by, the outlook has worsened.
As the recent World Economic Outlook from the IMF commented, the world economy has entered new and precarious territory.
During the year under review we therefore significantly reduced our investment in listed equities from 84.0% of net assets to 56.7%, ending the year with exposure to Lord Rothschild listed equities after adjusting for index futures and unquoted investments of 66.8% Chairman compared with 103.5% at the outset.
Over the year your Companys net asset value per share increased by 4.2% from 1,047.3p to 1,091.6p, and its net worth by some 54.4 million to 1,690.0 million.
Over the same period, the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index in Sterling, the FTSE All-Share Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Index decreased by 6.3%, 10.8% and 3.1% respectively.
Currencies have been an important contributor to our results.
During the earlier part of the year we hedged a large proportion of our exposure to the US Dollar, but reduced this hedge as the currency weakened.
In the last quarter of the year we hedged the entirety of our Sterling exposure, concerned by the economic slow-down in the UK and by evidence of increasing inflation.
We have diversified our currency exposure amongst a number of currencies worldwide, with particular emphasis on Asia and Scandinavia.
In terms of geographical exposure, we have reduced our exposure to Europe and to China and increased our holdings in Middle Eastern securities.
Our UK exposure has increased as a result of our holdings in UK government bonds.
We set out below our asset allocation within the investment portfolio at the year end: ASSET ALLOCATION % of Portfolio % of Portfolio at 31 March at 31 March 2008 2007 Quoted investments 34.4 57.6 Government securities and money market funds 23.4 2.1 Hedge funds 4.2 4.6 Long equity funds 11.5 11.8 Unquoted investments 15.8 14.9 Private equity partnerships 9.0 7.1 Property 1.7 1.9 100.0 100.0 A more detailed analysis of your Companys portfolio and currency exposure can be found on page 3 and in the Investment Review on pages 6 to 17.
Although, at the time of writing this Statement, our asset allocation remains broadly similar, our exposure to listed equities is somewhat higher than at the year end.
However, we continue to position ourselves defensively as, in our view, the downward adjustment in equity markets remains quite modest in the context of the problems that lie ahead.
Even if the worst of the immediate liquidity issues afflicting financial institutions are behind us, the availability and pricing of credit are likely to remain constrained for some time as banks rebuild their balance sheets.
The capacity of financial institutions has been impaired and so therefore has their ability to provide credit on the scale necessary to facilitate economic expansion.
Furthermore the authorities determined response to the fear of a systemic collapse of the financial system may give rise to further difficulties and dislocation in the years ahead.
Global inflationary pressures are of particular concern, especially when taken together with weakening economic conditions in the West.
212016 RIT R&A pp01-pp19 29 5 08 19:16 Page 5 5 Capital preservation and delivering long-term capital growth remain our highest priorities.
We are likely to err on the side of caution in the months ahead, conscious that such positioning can lead to periods of underperformance during brief but often powerful market rallies.
Indeed, in the period between our year end on 31 March 2008 and 22 May, the net asset value per share has increased to 1,113.5p a 2.0% rise, compared with an increase in the MSCI World Index in Sterling of 7.1% over the same period.
In spite of our caution, we believe that attractive opportunities will become available as a result of difficult market conditions.
Given our relatively modest level of exposure, taken together with our borrowing facilities, we are particularly well placed to take advantage of these opportunities.
LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE Looking back twenty years since the inception of your Company in its current form in 1988, I am pleased to note that the net asset value per share has increased by over ten times, as shown in the table on page 88.
Over the last five years it has increased by more than 150%, representing an increase of over 20% per annum, as can be seen from the chart on page 7. DIVIDEND We are proposing to pay a dividend of 4.0p per share on 23 July 2008 to shareholders on the register at 13 June 2008.
The focus of your Company remains one of achieving capital growth rather than increases in dividend income.
BOARD We announced in December the appointment of John Cornish as an independent non-executive director, and I am delighted to welcome him to the Board.
John headed the investment trust team at Deloitte for many years and is a director of four other investment trusts.
NILS TAUBE We were saddened by the death of Nils Taube at the age of 79 in March.
Nils played an important role in managing RITCPs portfolio for the ten years to 1998 and was acknowledged to be one of the great investors of his generation.
Both on behalf of shareholders and our Board, I would like to place on record our appreciation for his contribution to your Company throughout this period.
