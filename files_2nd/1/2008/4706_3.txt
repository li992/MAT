As the Chief executives review explains, the business has delivered another strong performance.
4 It has done so in increasingly testing circumstances.
Last years Annual Report drew attention to the growing challenges faced by truly global BUSINESS AREAS businesses.
Appropriately, companies which do business in the worlds marketplaces now have to do so with the highest possible standards of governance.
In practice that means much greater scrutiny by regulators and commentators of our financial dealings and closer examination of our relationships with suppliers, customers and business 180 partners.
We welcome the application of those standards as should our shareholders for the degree of assurance it offers.
But we should also recognise that scrutiny brings with it significant new responsibilities for OPERATING MARKETS our management and additional costs to the business itself.
For a company in the beverage alcohol business there is an extra dimension.
In several markets the role of alcohol in society is at the heart of important public debates.
From the outset we have chosen to be 17 active participants in those debates, as we believe that alcohol should play a responsible role in society, and it is right for beverage alcohol FTSE100 RANKING to be appropriately regulated and taxed.
We also respect the rights of those who choose not to enjoy alcohol.
AT 27 AUGUST 2008 This is the first opportunity I have had as chairman to contribute to Diageos Annual Report.
I do so reviewing a year throughout which my distinguished predecessor, Lord Blyth, was chairman.
Lord Blyth chaired the board for eight years throughout Diageos transformation into the worlds leading premium drinks business.
That period included the sale 4 1 of Pillsbury and Burger King, the acquisition of a substantial part of the Seagram spirits and wine business, Bushmills, Chalone Wine Group and most recently our stake in the 50:50 company for Ketel One vodka.
He created a most effective partnership with our chief executive, Paul Walsh.
He also oversaw the transformation of the board into one of truly 3 international character, and was a highly regarded representative of the 2 business to governments, business partners and shareholders.
On behalf of everyone associated with Diageo, I thank Lord Blyth for his remarkable work and wish him very well in all he does in the future.
