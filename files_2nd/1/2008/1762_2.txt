DIRECTORS REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW Chairmans letter Good performance against objectives BAE Systems Further progress in delivery of strategy has delivered Greater focus on the Corporate Responsibility agenda a further Transition to a new Chief Executive year of good performance Dick Olver Chairman BAE Systems has delivered a further year of good performance against its objectives, delivering on our strategy, financial performance and other non-financial metrics that are becoming an increasingly important component of a successful business operating in global markets.
The more difficult economic climate may restrict many governments spending, but we believe defence and security will continue to be amongst the priorities for a number of our main government customers.
The long-term nature of much of our business, underpinned by a record order book, provides a good level of forward visibility.
BAE Systems has been successful in addressing growth opportunities in a strong US defence market, whilst continuing to improve operating performance in the more difficult UK market environment, and winning new business and expanding our presence in other markets around the world.
The Groups continued focus on delivering performance and value for money will be increasingly important in its drive to deliver our aspirations for sustainable growth in shareholder value.
