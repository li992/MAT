Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Chairmans Statement I have pleasure in presenting the Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2008, a year which has seen a reversal of fortunes for the property industry in both the UK and USA.
At a time when many property companies are announcing revaluation deficits, it is pleasing to be able to report that the independent professional revaluations of our portfolios in both the UK and USA have produced an overall uplift in value, albeit of only modest proportions.
The table below shows a summary of the revalued portfolio by property type: Valuation Percentage March 2008 Change Commercial Property UK 659.6m 0.9% USA 38.0m 16.2% Residential Property UK 419.8m 3.5% USA 141.4m -0.6% Total 1,258.8m 2% Above: Architectural detail at Park West, Marble Arch, London W2 Right: 30 Kensington Church Street London W8 Page 2 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 The UK property market has experienced a distinct downturn and this has been sharpest in commercial property: this years surplus of 0.9% contrasts with the double-digit rises experienced in recent years 2007 15.8%.
Although our US commercial portfolio is relatively small, it has benefited from a number of specific factors such as improved occupancy and opportunities for rental increases resulting in an uplift of 16.2% 2007 4.4% reduction.
At 31st March 2008, 45% of the total portfolio by value was represented by residential property.
It is clear that the negative sentiment which has affected the commercial sector in the UK has been slower to impact on residential property and so far its effect has been less marked: this is reflected in the uplift of 3.5% 2007 15.9%.
In the USA the value of our residential properties has remained constant in dollar terms, notwithstanding downward pressure on values in many areas.
However, it is important to add a cautionary note as negative sentiment is gathering momentum both in the UK and the USA: our residential property portfolios are unlikely to remain immune in the coming months.
Above: Barons Court, Middlesex Left and far left: St Paul Court, Baltimore, USA Page 3 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Chairmans Statement continued More detailed analyses of our portfolio by property type and by location are set out below: Analysis by Property Type Property UK Property USA Commercial 659.6m Residentital 419.8m Commercial 38.0m Residential 141.4m Commercial Property UK Commercial Property USA Offices 231.7m Retail 320.6m Offices 36.0m Retail 2.0m Leisure 26.5m Land & Development 36.8m Industrial 44.0m Analysis by Location UK Valuations USA Valuations London & the South 756.6m New York 79.3m Florida 35.0m Midlands & East Anglia 169.7m Boston 27.5m New Jersey 21.9m Wales & West 69.5m Baltimore 13.7m Pennsylvania 2.0m North & Scotland 83.6m It was clear that the adoption from 2006 onwards of International Financial Reporting Standards requiring year on year changes in property valuation to be included in the Consolidated Income Statement would inject volatility into our reported results.
So it has proved, with a Profit before Taxation for the year ended 31st March 2008 of 47million in contrast to 198 million reported for 2007.
By far the greatest part of this reduction is represented by lower net property revaluation gains which at 20.7 million were 133.2 million less than in 2007 2007 153.9 million.

Rental income has remained at a level similar to last year.
We have completed over 1000 relettings or renewals of tenancy during the year, mostly at improved rentals.
However these increases have been offset in value terms by a slight increase in commercial voids.
The completion last year of a number of major repair projects on UK residential properties has resulted this year in reduced expenditure of 14.8 million 2007 19.4 million.

This Right: the new year has also benefited from the impact on the entrance deferred tax provision of the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28%.
The combination of these adjustments has produced Below right: the a net tax credit to the Consolidated Income new reception area Above: a selection of the materials used Page 6 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Statement of 7.0 million 2007 56.5 million charge.
It has long been our policy to pursue growth in the rental and capital values of our property portfolio in a spirit of enterprise which is tempered by caution.
This prudent approach has served us well and enabled us to sustain the strong financial position which is reflected in the Balance Sheet.
At 31st March 2008 shareholders funds amounted to 902.8 million.
When recommending the annual dividend the Board has particular regard to available financial resources and to the performance of the Groups core rental activities which generate the cash which we use to run the business.
Our continuing strength in these areas enables the Board to recommend an increase of 3p in the total dividend for the year from 70p to 73p: equivalent to 4.3% 2007 7.7%.
In previous years it has been our practice to hold significant undrawn facilities in order to be able to respond rapidly to buying opportunities.
In todays financial climate the cost of such Left top: Africa House, London WC2 Far left: Meadway Court, London NW11 Left: the Boongate Retail Park, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire Page 7 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 Chairmans Statement continued facilities has risen to an unacceptable level and therefore at 31 March 2008 we have allowed short term facilities of 85 million to lapse.
We retain medium term facilities of 65 million in addition to cash deposits of 30 million.
Our gearing remains low at 8.7% 2007 8.8% and we are confident that our long term banking relationships and balance sheet strength will enable us to obtain appropriate funding as and when the right opportunities arise.
During the year we have pursued a number of long term development projects aimed at enhancing the rental and capital value of properties within our existing portfolio.
Our principal projects in the year included: 164, Shaftesbury Avenue, WC2 : this major refurbishment to create 29,000 square feet of prime office space was completed in March 2008.
Letting activity is now underway with a number of floors under offer.
25-29, Worship Street, EC2: this development, which is close to Broadgate in the City of London will create 22,000 square feet of modern office space and is due for completion in October 2008.
Africa House, WC2: Planning consent has been granted for a major scheme of refurbishment and extension to this listed building.
The scheme will create an additional 20,000 square feet of lettable space producing a total of 127,000 square feet in a landmark office building.
Preparatory design and procurement work is being undertaken and the final decision to proceed will be taken at the end of 2008.
49-50, Great Marlborough Street, W1: this refurbishment and extension of an existing office building will create approximately 17,000 square feet of prime office space.
The project is due to complete in Spring 2009.

USA Page 8 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2008 The Company proposes to adopt new articles of association in order to incorporate the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 which come into effect in 2007 and 2008.
It is anticipated that further changes will also be required next year to reflect those provisions of the new Companies Act which will not be fully in force until October 2009.
The main changes proposed to be adopted this year relate to electronic communication with shareholders, shareholder meetings and resolutions, directors indemnities and directors conflicts of interest.
The immediate outlook for the UK and the global economy is troubled, with rising inflation rates and slowing economic activity combining with a banking system weakened by the sub-prime mortgage crisis.
However, the prudent approach which we have adopted over the years means that we are well placed to weather any storm.
It is inevitable that a significant down turn in the economy will raise the risk of a loss of rental income through reduced occupancy levels and the risk of increased bad debts caused by financial pressures on our tenants.
Our future results will overwhelmingly be determined by market movements in property values.
All published data point to the fact that UK property values are generally falling: how long and how great the fall will be is impossible to predict.
This trend raises the real possibility that the valuation at 31 March 2009 may produce an overall reduction in property values.
Nevertheless, I remain confident that our tried and tested business approach will serve us well in the challenging times that lie ahead.
In conclusion I would like to take this opportunity of expressing on your behalf our sincere thanks to the loyal and hard working members of our staff for their energy and commitment to the Group during the year.
