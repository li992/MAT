04 Chairmans statement King sher Annual Report and Accounts 2007 08 The last financial year has been a challenging one for King sher and for its shareholders who have seen a signi cant reduction in the companys share price.
Much of this has been a result of stock market volatility, which was caused by uncertainty in the global financial markets.
During the year, investor sentiment moved against UK-based retailers, particularly those selling bigger ticket items such as home improvement, as concerns about consumer credit availability grew.
Whilst stock market sentiment will always ebb and ow, our job inside the company is to keep focused on moving the business forward aggressively but responsibly in order to optimise shareholders interests in the medium and long-term, as well as the short-term.
Our model, which gives us exposure to opportunities in a range of markets, many in fast growing economies, should enable us to grow at rates which are notably higher than companies who are solely based in a single developed market.
However, for the model to work most effectively, each of the units needs to perform and a close eye needs to be kept on the balance sheet.
Against this background it was good to see a range of excellent performances by a number of our companies during this last year.
Examples include Castorama in Poland, which had a very successful year, as did its namesake in France.
Kotas, our Turkish joint venture, delivered very strong results and our new business in Russia made an extremely encouraging start.
There are, however, areas where we need to see improvement, including our business in China, where the performance is being addressed.
Overall, total Group sales rose 8% to 9.4 billion in the year, with adjusted pre-tax pro t down 2.8% to 386 million, largely due to a dif cult UK market.
In the UK, B&Q made major changes to its business, not only refreshing much of its ranges with new products, but revamping around 5.5 million square feet of its store space.
This has been a demanding task which has been carried out well at a dif cult stage in the business cycle.
These changes are delivering good results, it was the right thing to do, and I am sure it will ensure B&Q is ready to take full advantage when the market improves.
