The second half of the year witnessed unprecedented and extraordinary events in the world economy which translated into the most challenging conditions for a wealth management group that any of us have seen before.
Against this backdrop our business is proving resilient.
Total new business was down just 2%, while we wrote 3.1 billion of single premium investments during the year.
Although funds under management fell 10% to 16.3 billion in 2008, this was in the context of 30-40% declines in world markets over the same period.
