The Group has established its integrated services capability by developing an unrivalled range of services for social landlords, largely self-delivered TM and underpinned by its in-house technology, Conntrol.
As a consequence, Connaught has emerged as the partner of choice for social landlords seeking to deliver efficiencies in their property maintenance through longer-term partnerships.
Since 2006 when the Group secured its first integrated services contract with Paradigm Housing, the trend towards such longer-term multi-service partnerships has accelerated.
This is demonstrated by the contract wins in 2008 83% of the 855 million order intake was integrated services IS contracts of which four are ten or more years in length: Raglan Housing Association 15-year IS contract worth 150m Matrix Housing Partnership 10-year IS contract worth 180m Bromford Group 10-year IS contract worth 60m Midland Heart 10-year IS contract worth 40m Since the year end the Group has secured an additional 150 million order intake including a 12-year integrated services partnership worth 117 million with A2Dominion, a leading housing association.
The Groups investment in Scotland and Wales continues to bear fruit with a 50 million integrated services contract with Dumfries & Galloway Housing Partnership and a 30 million Welsh Housing Quality Standard partnership with RCT Homes.
The acquisitions made in 2007, Baldwins and AE Williams, have performed well and during the year we successfully rebid two of their key contracts, Harrogate District Council and the London Borough of Merton, worth a combined 35 million per annum.
