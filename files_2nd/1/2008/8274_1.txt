BOARD AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE Stevan Porter 19542008 We were all deeply saddened by the loss of Steve Porter, a Board member and President of the Americas, who passed away in August 2008 after a short illness.
Under Steves inspired leadership the Americas region has been established as a dominant force.
We must thank Richard Solomons, Finance Director, for taking on the additional role of leading the Americas region when Steve became seriously ill in July.
Richard did an outstanding job, ensuring a smooth transition to Jim Abrahamson, who was appointed as our new President of the Americas in January this year.
Jim joined IHG from Global Hyatt Corporation, where he was Head of Development, The Americas.
Two of our Non-Executive Directors, Sir David Prosser and Robert Larson, retired from the Board in May and December 2008, respectively.
I thank them for their excellent service and contribution.
George Turner became Company Secretary in January 2009, taking over from Richard Winter who retires in April 2009.
I thank Richard for his service over the past 15 years and wish him well for the future.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND SHAREHOLDER RETURNS We continue with our prudent approach to managing our balance sheet.
We successfully refinanced our debt facilities in May 2008, and have lowered our overall net debt position by $400 million to $1.3 billion.
During the year, we continued with our existing share buyback programme, taking the total funds returned since March 2004 to more than 3.5 billion.
We have deferred the remaining 30 million of the buyback programme in order to preserve cash and maintain the strength of our balance sheet.
OUTLOOK Our solid performance in 2008 can be attributed to the exceptional efforts of all our people.
Trading will undoubtedly be tough in 2009, but our strong balance sheet, resilient business model, great brands and excellent management team, led by Andy Cosslett, give me continued confidence in the future for the Group.
David Webster Before exceptional items.
