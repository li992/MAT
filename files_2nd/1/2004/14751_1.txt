Chairmans Message Financial performance Ian Martin Results for the year are complicated by our soon to be completed disposal programme.
In the key area of consumer brand sales, however, there were a number of noteworthy achievements.
Durex sales As a focused consumer growth continued with 7.4 per cent recorded for the full year, in line with the trend seen at the half year healthcare company, and ahead of last year.
Scholl footcare grew 7.4 per cent in the second half generating a full year performance growth in the value of of 3.7 per cent.
A similar trend was evident in OTC where second half sales growth of 1.5 per cent our brand portfolio is of reduced the decline of 5.4 per cent in the first half to a1.9 per cent decline on a full year basis.
The footwear paramount importance business is now being prepared for growth with two specialist senior appointments and innovative to shareholders.
Our overall operating margin expectations were realised with an operating profit before exceptionals of 74.5 million generating a 12.4 per cent margin.
This is lower than last year reflecting the dilutive effect of the Marigold industrial gloves disposal.
The subsequent medical disposals will also reduce margins.
Our on-going consumer business achieved an operating profit before exceptionals of 26.1 million at a margin of 6.4 per cent.
This margin is expected to improve in the future as the effect of anticipated sales growth and continual cost control feed through.
Our cash position continues to improve: free cash flow of 85.2 million was generated in the year, of which 61.1 million resulted from disposals.
Working capital management improved further to 19.6 per cent of sales compared with 21.3 per cent last year.
Notwithstanding the encouraging operating performance, we have recorded a loss per share of 4.2 pence in the period, compared with a profit last year of 13.1 pence.
This results from losses on disposal of the Marigold industrial glove and wound management businesses, including recycling of goodwill previously written off against reserves, and the writedown of certain assets in anticipation of the forthcoming Regent Infection Control disposal.

SSL International plc Annual Report 2004 03 Chairmans Message Ian Martin Chief Executives Review At the time of writing this, Ive been an employee Garry Watts of SSL for a little over three years and Chief Executive for some two months.
The three years have seen a catharsis and change within the Company and based upon eight weeks as Chief Executive, I want to see SSLs four priorities: that change continue.
Complete medical All new Chief Executives are faced with a range of choices, opportunities and problems: they are mindful disposal programme of the need to set an agenda and aware of the risk of too quickly choosing an ill considered course.
Grow consumer brand With that in mind, I set four priorities for SSL in contribution early April: Our people Complete the medical divestitures Grow brand contribution Challenge the cost base Re-energise and invigorate our employees Challenge the cost base Let me explain each in turn: Disposals Our disposal programme is nearing completion.
Once done we will have sold four businesses for gross proceeds of approximately 260 million, generated net cash of approximately 175 million and reduced our core borrowings to 100 million, which compares with c450 million three years ago.
In this process our employee count has fallen from 7,000 to 4,000.
Our manufacturing facilities have fallen from 20 to 12.
In the UK, we are also currently in the process of condensing our four office locations in the Northwest of England into one.
The disposals bring with them a number of transitional service obligations which will run for the majority of this fiscal year: we will continue to service these whilst completing the transition of SSL into a focused consumer healthcare company.
Brand contribution After the completion of the disposals our focus will be on growing the value of our retained portfolio of brands by increasing the variable contribution generated by sales of our consumer brands, which in 2003 04 amounted to 162.5 million.
Sales growth, driven by effective advertising, will be sought through a concentration on higher margin products and the development through innovation of the Groups current portfolio of leading brands such as Durex and Scholl.
We intend to maintain the Companys advertising and promotional expenditure at broadly its existing level of 15 to 16 per cent of sales, and investment in the development of new products will continue in order to improve the overall product offering.
We believe that investment in these areas, even for established brand names such as Durex and Scholl is critical in driving organic sales growth in a competitive market environment and in the creation of brand value.
