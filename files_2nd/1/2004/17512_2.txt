Our management teams 1 achieved significant operational improvements and initiated major growth projects across the Group, to further optimise 2 a portfolio already strengthened by the acquisitions during the two preceding years.
Today, Xstrata has a market capitalisation 3 of some $12 billion compared to around $600 million at the time of the IPO in 2002 and benefits from a balanced portfolio 4 of commodities, diversified by product and geography, and with robust market positions.
5 6 Our progress over the last three years affirms the strategic direction set out at the time of the London listing in 2002: to create 7 value for shareholders through growing Xstrata into a global, diversified mining group.
Notwithstanding our success to date, 8 further opportunities exist.
9 10 In 2004, the Group reported record attributable profit of $1.09 billion, pre-exceptionals, up over 560% from last year, as 11 the diversification and breadth of our portfolio achieved through the acquisition of the coal assets in 2002 and MIM in 2003 12 showed its potential in strong commodity markets.
Even more encouragingly, Xstrata was alone among the London-listed 13 diversified mining companies in reducing operating costs in real terms in 2004, despite the inevitable cost pressures associated 14 with the high commodity price environment.
15 16 The Groups achievements since the acquisition of MIM, including the seamless integration and subsequent improvements in 17 the operational and safety performance of these operations, confirm our confidence in the strength of Xstratas management 18 structure, which devolves responsibility and authority, empowering the Groups businesses to operate effectively and efficiently.
19 20 This devolved management structure relies on strong governance and good communication across the Group and in 2004, 21 Xstrata implemented a number of Group-wide policies and assurance programmes to reinforce existing frameworks.
