Emap Annual Report and Accounts 2004 1 Chairmans statement Adam Broadb Adam Broadbent ent This year Emap has continued to make strategic progress This year Emap has continued to make strategic progress.
Although trading conditions across the Group have been mixed, good revenue growth has been achieved, market share gained and margins improved in most parts of the business.
Our new magazines, exhibitions and radio stations have made a healthy contribution to our organic growth: our recently acquired businesses Agor and Excelsior have been integrated successfully: and the acquisition of a 28% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings Plc SRH brings us the prospect of further opportunities in radio.
I am glad therefore to be able to present a strong set of results for the Group.
Turnover has increased by 9%, normalised operating profit by 11%, normalised profit before tax by 12% and normalised earnings per share by 14%.
Total earnings per share is 36.3 pence, an increase of 8% on last year.
This is an achievement for Tom Moloney in his first year as Chief Executive of Emap, as well as for Gary Hughes, Group Finance Director, for the senior management team and for the many talented people who work on Emaps brands across the Group.
This year the Board has again reviewed its corporate governance arrangements.
Shareholders interests are well represented by a Chairman and four independent Non-Executive Directors, who form a clear majority on the Board.
David Rough has been appointed Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, and we are pleased to welcome Pierre Danon, who joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 22 April 2004.
The forthcoming year will bring opportunities and the prospect of more favourable trading conditions in the UK: it will also, no doubt, bring new challenges in our highly competitive markets.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank everyone at Emap for their achievements this year and for their commitment to the Companys future success.
