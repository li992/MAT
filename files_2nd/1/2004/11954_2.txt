CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Bridgegate Derby BMW MINI Acquired 2004 Dear Shareholder Following on from the successful acquisition of CD Bramall at the end of February our focus in 2004 has been to integrate the new business, reduce debt and, at the same time, continue to drive forward the performance of the group.
In doing so we have achieved strong results for the year, which reinforces our position as the UKs leading motorcar and truck dealership group.
Group sales, for the year ended 31 December 2004, have risen to 3.2 billion compared to 1.8 billion in 2003.
Underlying profit before tax is up by 58.4 per cent to 60.5 million from 38.2 million in 2003.
Earnings per share on this basis increased 64.6 per cent to 33.9 pence.
On a statutory basis, including exceptionals and goodwill amortisation, pre tax profit was 65.0 million and earnings per share were 35.9 pence.
Your board has proposed a final dividend of 6.0 pence, which together with the interim dividend of 4.2 pence, gives a full year dividend of 10.2 pence, an increase of 34.2 per cent.
The uplift in the dividend reflects both the confidence your board has in the future and the step up in the earnings capacity of the group after the major acquisition made in the year.
We increased our borrowings by 293 million in February 2004 to acquire CD Bramall.
We have managed our cash flow well during the year and generated 167 million from operations.
We are confident of meeting our objective of bringing gearing back to more normal levels by the end of 2005.
The group has almost doubled in size in 2004 and, whilst the core business is motorcar retailing and servicing, we have added new complementary businesses in parts wholesale and truck retailing and servicing.
Our strategy is to have scale with the manufacturers we represent.
We have an integrated business model, industry leading management information across each of our franchise focused groups and innovative activities in our customer services centre, all of which are delivering benefits to the business.
We now have almost twelve thousand Pendragon team members and the contribution of each individual within the team has again enabled these excellent results to be achieved.
My colleagues on the board and I extend our thanks to them for their hard work and commitment.
Sir Nigel Rudd Chairman 17 February 2005
