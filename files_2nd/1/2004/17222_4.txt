Wm MORRISON SUPERMARKETS PLC Chairmans statement Review of the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2004 The directors are pleased to announce the results for the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2004.
Once again they show a year of good, steady progress, with record sales and profits the 37th successive improvement since the company went public in 1967.
A solid team performance delivered the goods once again, in spite of the diversion of attention to the bid for Safeway plc.
A good illustration of the strength in depth of our management team and a tribute to their all-round knowledge, skill and application when under extra pressure.
Sales Total takings through our stores were 53bn rising by 153% from the 46bn reported in 2003.
This growth came from a combination of new stores, increases in the average number of customers in each of our stores, and a rise in the average spend by each customer.
During the year sales were helped by the opening of new stores at Port Talbot, Ebbw Vale, Barrow, Liverpool, Bristol and Barnsley and large new replacements, which began trading at Anlaby, Failsworth and Rotherham.
The results of the store opening programme have been exceptionally good and some new takings records have been established.
During this time the Wetherby store was closed for rebuilding works.
We nished the year trading from 125 stores with an average sales area of 36,200 sq.
ft. and added petrol lling stations to our stores at Banbury, Failsworth, Keighley, Retford and Yeadon.
Like-for-like sales were up by 93% and total supermarket takings by 153% to 53bn.
Shoppers continue to enjoy our offer of low prices and great value in quality surroundings.
Our success in the fresh food areas of our business was again demonstrated through the strong performance of the Market Street.
Multisaves were again well supported and our customers benefited to the tune of 366m.
The average number of customers using each of our stores every week rose by 34% and their average spend went up from 2357 to 2448 an increase of 39%.
Excluding petrol sales, each of our stores took an average of 715,700 per week, an increase of 74% over the 666,400 shown in the previous year.
When we exclude new stores, the increase in like-for-like stores sales was 85% and this rises to 93% when petrol is taken into account.
After VAT and other adjustments, net sales from our stores improved by 152% against last year.
In order to recognise the importance of other forms of income, most of the items previously shown as sundry income have been reclassied as turnover and once we include rents receivable, lottery commission, etc.
the total turnover of the group has risen from 4,290m in 2003 to 4,944m this year.
profit Although the gross margin was slightly down, staff costs, overheads and depreciation rose less than the increase in turnover, and the operating margin remained virtually unchanged.
Operating profit was 3051m after taking into account 109m of advisors costs in respect of the Safeway acquisition last year 35m compared to 2664m twelve months earlier.
As usual we treat any profit on the disposal of land and buildings as exceptional with income from this source falling from 12m to 08m.
After taking interest into account, profit before tax rose by 132% from 2825m to 3199m.
We have fully adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets for the first time and this has lead to a restatement of the prior years gures.
Balance Sheet At the year end our balance sheet remained strong with no borrowings other than normal overdraft facilities and 2066m in net cash.
The year has seen capital expenditure of 252m during which time shareholders funds have increased from a restated 1,233m to 1,317m an increase of 68% Dividend The directors are proposing a final ordinary dividend of 270p per ordinary share.
This will be paid on all shares in issue on 23 April 2004, including those issued in respect of the acquisition of Safeway plc on 8 March 2004.
The total dividend for the period will be 325p per ordinary share compared with 270p in 2003, which shows an increase of 204%.
Excluding the amount payable on newly issued shares, the dividend is covered 39 times by the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and 117m will be retained in the business for further investment.
Staff Over an extended period of 14 months when a number of members of senior management were heavily engaged in the ultimately successful bid for Safeway plc, it was good to see how well the company performed.
All members of management and staff are to be commended for their good work, and I would like to thank them for their support at a particularly busy time.
I am pleased to note that in the 26th year of our profit sharing scheme the sum available for distribution is increased by 125% to 16m and will be distributed amongst all eligible employees.
I would like to personally thank them for their continuing energy and enthusiasm which contributes so much to the success of the company.
6 Wm MORRISON SUPERMARKETS PLC Chairmans statement continued Current Developments On 2 February, the first day of the new financial year, our first Scottish store opened in Kilmarnock and this was followed 4 weeks later by the new store at Hartlepool.
The replacement store at Wetherby opened in March and this will be followed by Falkirk in June, Knottingley and Swansea in October, and Manchester in November.
Just as last year when we completed major works at Dereham, Beverley and Keighley to refresh our stores, the programme will continue with improvements at Harrogate, Boroughbridge and the Wetherby shopping centre.
Safeway stores at Rubery and Bridport have store extensions at completion and the Hereford store will enjoy increased warehouse space.
ft. with a petrol lling station at Bangor Northern Ireland will open in April.
Future Developments We expect to be very busy in the next few months with new developments including major store projects at Auchinlea and Livingston in Scotland, and Swadlincote in Derbyshire.
Consent has been obtained to rebuild our existing store in Rothwell, and a further six store sites will move from the design stage shortly.
Further investment is being made in central facilities and an additional 440,000 sq.
ft. warehouse has been purchased at Northampton to enable us to begin the conversion programme of the first 50 large Safeway stores.
Work commences in June and these stores should carry the Morrison brand by the end of the year.
Our initial planning application for the new Regional Distribution Centre at Kettering was inexplicably turned down, despite being recommended for approval.
Whilst this was a set-back, the purchase of the Northampton unit will relieve any immediate pressure whilst talks continue with the local authority to try and satisfy their concerns.
A 100 acre site has been acquired in Corby to enable us to build facilities to increase our packing capacity for fresh fruit and vegetables and improve our ability to distribute both fresh and frozen goods.
Packing and distribution facilities for produce at the Hook of Holland are being augmented in order to meet our increased demands.
The projected head ofce building for Bradford has been re-designed to cater for the needs of the enlarged company.
We will continue to seek and exploit opportunities to develop new large stores in good locations.
Safeway After a 14 month period of investigation, which commenced in January 2003, initially by the Ofce of Fair Trading and then by the Competition Commission, we received consent to bid for Safeway.
The transaction was completed on 8 March 2004, and the process of integration started.
We are required to dispose of 52 stores under the consent and have commenced the marketing of these units.
There has been great interest in them and offers received to date have been very encouraging, although, of course, the loss of turnover is disappointing.
It is our intention to promptly transfer our trading in four towns to existing Safeway units in Ripon, Southport, Chester and Bramley, Leeds.
Our plan to integrate the Safeway business into Morrisons will obviously take some time and there is a pressing need for the implementation of our culture throughout the larger company in order to improve operating standards and build volume sales.
With this in mind we have selected the first 50 stores which will be converted to the Morrisons brand.
The work of benchmarking all the own label products of both companies is approaching completion and the results will enable us to simplify the supply chain and maximise production efficiencies.
Operating as a sales driven company, with the customer always of prime concern, will result in increased volume sales and help to ensure job opportunities in sales and distribution.
The difficulty of obtaining rm information before 8 March 2004 has been a handicap but we are rapidly catching up with important details of the Safeway business.
We have sought to update all our new colleagues on our plans for the future and all areas of the business were kept informed through presentations from the Hayes head ofce.
Firm plans are in place for the run down of the Hayes ofce and its ultimate disposal.
I would like to welcome all our new colleagues from Safeway and hope that I can count on their support through a period of hard but exciting work.
Prospects The Morrison business is presently in very good shape with store takings in the first 8 weeks of the current year increasing by 149%, with like-for-like stores 94% ahead, or 92% higher excluding petrol.
It is our intention to convert the larger Safeway stores to the Morrison format in a rolling programme throughout the next months, which, coupled with the current development programme, will ensure further growth.
Our current trading strength illustrates how we understand our market and, most importantly, how we recognise the needs of our customers.
We have in place a competent team which will extend our success in serving up good, honest value for money to all customers, new or old.
I see another good year of progress in prospect.
Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting will be held at 1100 am on Thursday 20 May at the Hanover International Hotel, Mayo Avenue, Bradford, West Yorkshire.
I will update you at the meeting with further details of the companys progress.
If you are unable to attend, may I please ask you to vote on the resolutions by either using the enclosed form of proxy or electronically as detailed in the notice of meeting page 5 note 2.
The record date for the final dividend is 23 April and the dividend will be paid on 24 May.
