Allowing for acquisitions and capital expenditure during the year, this represents a reduction of 3.8% in the book value over the year.
The IPD UK Monthly Index: Capital Values for all classes of commercial property fell by 25.3% over the same period.
Our portfolio showed a total return for the year of 0.5% compared with the IPD UK Monthly Index: Total Returns for all classes of commercial property, which showed a negative return of 19.2%.
Our values recovered in the second half of the year, producing a revaluation surplus equivalent to 7.1% of book value at the half year, adjusted for acquisitions and expenditure in the second half.
This has off-set much of the 10.0% fall in the six months to 31 March 2009.
There has been a noticeable increase in the final quarter of the year in investment demand and transactions, particularly for well located investments such as ours, where there is also tangible evidence of healthy tenant demand and growing rents.
Over the year as a whole, the revaluation deficit attributable to our wholly owned portfolio amounted to 2.8% of its adjusted book value.
Carnabys deficit amounted to 3.4% of its adjusted book value.
Here there is substantial, but as yet un-contracted, reversionary income from shops and restaurants and 33% of the income in this village still comes from offices where rents have fallen and average lease lengths are only four years.
Covent Garden, our most mixed-use village, showed a revaluation deficit of 2.3%.
Chinatowns deficit amounted to 1.6%, the least of all of our locations, as was the case last year.
In this village, restaurants and leisure uses continue to provide 59% of rental income with leases which have an average unexpired term of 15 years.
Only 7% of Chinatowns income now comes from offices.
The revaluation deficit attributable to our Berwick Street properties was 10.8% of adjusted book value.
At present many of the properties are in poor condition and offices currently comprise almost half of the income, so this outcome is unsurprising.
We are confident that our initiatives in this area will produce good capital growth over the medium term as we advance our strategy.
The properties owned in the Longmartin Joint Venture showed a revaluation deficit of 18.4% of adjusted book value.
Once again this year, the fall is much as we would expect, and reflects valuers cautious view of the risks inherent in a speculative scheme such as St Martins Courtyard, where works are in progress and most of the commercial and residential accommodation was unlet at the year end.
We are confident that when this project is complete and substantially let, its value should improve materially.
