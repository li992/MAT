This has been achieved through our strong growth in markets such as Government, cash solutions and New Markets.
In what has been a challenging economic environment, there has been continued strong focus on cost control and debtor and cash management.
At the same time the management team has been implementing its strategy both organically and via capability-adding acquisitions in key sectors to drive accelerated growth and development in the business.

G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview 03 Business review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Dear shareholder, It is very pleasing to be able to report another strong performance in what has been a difficult year for so many businesses.
Such results do not happen by chance and I would therefore like to pay tribute to everyone in the group who has worked so hard to continue to drive our business in the right direction.
This has involved implementing cost-saving measures where necessary, but also in pushing ahead with plans for future growth and development.
Elsewhere in this report, our chief executive talks about the way the groups strategy is being delivered.
I have no doubt that our policy of developing solutions for our customers over longer term relationships will allow us to continue to build on the strong foundations which have been laid throughout the group over the last few years.
Our recent acquisitions, including All Star International, Adesta, Hill & Associates and NSSC, have been targeted particularly at capability-building in security-related solutions niches, but the integration of earlier acquisitions such as GSL and ArmorGroup over the last year has helped us to develop a broad spectrum of solutions which we are able to offer to more of our customers in more of our markets.
The financial outcome of all this effort has been particularly creditable in 2009, with both revenue and margin increased.
Profit before interest, taxation and amortisation increased by 10.0% to 500.3m whilst turnover was up 7.4% to 7,008.6m.
Organic growth was 3.7% and the group profit margin increased to 7.1%.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 22% to 20.2p.
The directors are therefore recommending a final dividend of 4.16p or DKK 0.3408 per share, payable on 4 June 2010, which, with the interim dividend of 3.02p or DKK 0.2599 per share paid on 30 October 2009, makes a total dividend of 7.18p or DKK 0.6007 per share for the year ended 31 December 2009.
This represents an increase of 11.7% over the total dividend for 2008.
The board intends to maintain a progressive dividend policy in line with the groups underlying performance.
The developments during the year have not all been purely financial however.
In 2009 we published our first ever Corporate Social Responsibility report.
We said that this was just a first step in a continuing journey and I am pleased to be able to say that the equivalent report this year shows how we are progressing on the issues of corporate citizenship.
These are issues which no responsible company should ignore and our board is increasing its focus on this area, with one of our non-executive directors, Mark Elliott, chairing a newly formed CSR Committee whose job it will be to ensure implementation of appropriate policies.
As the worlds second largest private employer, it is also vital that we have strong and open relationships with our employees and those they choose to represent them, so it is pleasing to report that the implementation of our ethical employment partnership with UNI is being rolled out in yet more of the countries in which we operate.
The performance of the board is also a matter about which we have given careful thought.
We have conducted detailed reviews of the manner in which the board and its main committees have functioned and, whilst the outcome of those reviews has been generally satisfactory, we know we must avoid complacency.
We have therefore increased the interaction between non-executive directors and the groups businesses and made some changes to the composition of the boards committees.
We have also decided that we should refresh the composition of the board itself over the next year or so.
Whilst commenting on the board, I must also mention with great sadness the death in January 2010 of our former chairman, Jrgen Philip-Srensen.
He was of course much more than simply a former board member.
His family helped create the very notion of a private security industry and Philip himself did an enormous amount to develop the business which has become G4S.
He was also chairman of this company from its foundation in 2004 until I took over that role when he retired in 2006: but even in retirement he took a close interest in the group and remained as our President Emeritus.
Looking ahead, there can be no doubt that in many parts of the world in which we operate, the economic climate will remain difficult for some time to come.
Nevertheless, as our strategy continues to be implemented, we will be able to form more, stronger, longer and more valuable relationships with our customers and I remain optimistic therefore that the company will continue to perform well in the year ahead.
Alf Duch-Pedersen Chairman To show a fair comparison, constant exchange rates are assumed.
