Directors Report: Business Review Chairmans statement The effects of the economic downturn during the past twelve months have demanded exceptional effort to stay on track.
We have achieved that and have On track delivered a good set of results as a consequence.
Our long standing strategy is to deliver high quality passenger transport services in dense, urban markets, primarily through bus and rail.
