THE GROUP COMPANY Chairmans Statement Peter Salsbury BSc Chairman 4 June 2009 Introduction This time last year I opened my introduction by saying that it was a brute of a year for property shares.
This year it seems appropriate to start with ditto.
Indeed it has been the most nerve-wracking period in financial markets that most of us can ever recall.
Given the horrendous background, I am pleased to report that both share classes have survived the ordeal with their portfolios in decent shape.
Both NAVs have outperformed the benchmark by considerable margins and both have record levels of earnings per share.
This is enabling the Board to recommend a dividend increase for both share classes at a time when many shareholders will be suffering income declines from cash holdings.
Our managers expect a decline in net revenue per share for both share classes in the current year.
However the Trust has built up substantial revenue reserves over previous years, and the Board has agreed that, subject to unforeseen circumstances, it will use some of these reserves to recommend to shareholders that the dividend in the year to end March 2010 will not be less than the dividend now recommended for the year to end March 2009.
I would draw shareholders attention to the new management fee arrangements set out later in my statement.
I believe these are innovative and will be of long term benefit to shareholders.
Sigma shareholders should also note that the Board approved a change of benchmark for that share class as from the start of the current financial year.

However, the net revenue was greater than chiefly to the substantial cash holdings built up during 2008 from the sale of shares in more heavily leveraged your managers had anticipated, even after allowing for the element of VAT recovery and reflects not only absolute companies.
The Ordinary share class share price performed in line with the NAV, but the Sigma share price growth in earnings but also the slower exit from large cap stocks together with the accretive impact of share discount widened significantly during the year.
I will comment on this further under the discount heading.
Revenue Outlook 2009 10 Revenue Results The revenue outcome in both share classes was higher Ordinary Shares than earlier guidance.
This was largely due to the Our managers are advising the Board that, subject to exceptional receipt, in March 2009, of a large and unforeseen circumstances, they expect that revenue per welcome refund of VAT that had been incorrectly charged share for the Ordinary share class will be in the order of in previous years.
