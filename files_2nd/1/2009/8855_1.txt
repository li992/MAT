CHAIRMANS STATEMENT Sir John Banham Chairman I am pleased to report that Johnson Matthey performed well in the financial year 2008 09 despite the extremely difficult economic conditions that prevailed throughout the second half of the year.
Following a very strong first half we felt the full force of the economic downturn that followed on from the severe problems in the global banking system, the resulting credit crunch and collapse in consumer confidence.
The effect of the crisis on the automotive industry, particularly in the North American and European markets, was especially severe and resulted in quite unprecedented declines in vehicle production during our second half.
The results achieved by Johnson Matthey in this environment are a great tribute to the strength of your company and the ability of its management team, which was able to take rapid action to reduce costs and adapt to quickly changing market conditions.
The drivers of our business, particularly those concerned with protecting the environment and improving energy security, remain firmly in place.
Our commitment to investing in R&D remains as strong as ever as it provides the products and technologies that are vital if we are to maintain our world leading market positions and continue to grow our global businesses.
Looking forward, your board will continue to support investment in new products to ensure the continued growth of the Johnson Matthey group and progress towards achieving the boards main objective, that of delivering superior value to its shareholders.
