3174 Impax R&A 2009 Text:3174 Impax R&A 2009 Text 22 3 10 15:23 Page 3 CHAIRMANS STATEMENT I am pleased to report that Impax Environmental Markets plc IEM, or the Company has completed another strong year, posting a rise in diluted net asset value excluding income of 28.0%, its highest annual return since launch in 2002.
Twelve months ago, the global economy and financial markets were in almost unprecedented levels of turmoil, and the outlook for investors was very uncertain.
However, it appears that government policies to avert a slump have been successful, and prospects for markets have recovered dramatically.
Against this background, environmental markets have staged a significant recovery and have benefited from increased public sector expenditure and new environmental policy initiatives.
Although Decembers climate change conference in Copenhagen attracted the most media attention, most of it negative, there were important positive developments in other areas as many countries announced challenging long-term targets for environmental markets, particularly in renewable energy, energy efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gases.
Performance and Current Status During the year, the Companys net asset value NAV per Ordinary Share excluding current year net revenue and taking into account the dilution effect of the warrants in issue increased from 98.8p to 126.5p, a rise of 28.0%.
The share price rose 40.1% from 85.0p to 119.1p reflecting a narrowing of the share price discount to diluted NAV over the period from 14.7% to 6.4%.
Over the same period, the MSCI World and the MSCI World Small Cap Indices priced in Pounds Sterling rose by 14.6% and 27.9% respectively.
The Companys five year performance track record remains impressive: during the five years to 31 December 2009, the diluted NAV excluding income of IEM rose 64.9% compared to 18.6% for the MSCI World Index and 26.3% for the MSCI World Small Cap Index.
The Companys investments in seven unquoted companies accounted for 4.1% of NAV at the end of the year.
During the year ended 31 December 2008 several of the holdings were revalued downwards.
After a challenging start to 2009, which resulted in further reduced valuations, this portion of the portfolio has made some good progress in the last quarter of the year with directors increasing their valuation of two unquoted holdings.
The current year has had a mixed start with generally positive results and outlook statements from portfolio companies being counterbalanced by concerns about high levels of sovereign debt particularly in European markets.
As at 19 March 2010, the diluted NAV excluding income had risen 3.4% since the start of the year, while the share price had risen by 0.1%.
The MSCI World Index in Pounds Sterling had risen 9.5% over the same period.
The discount of the Companys share price to diluted NAV had increased to 9.4%.
Discount After several years of generally trading at a premium, the Companys share price traded at an average discount to diluted NAV of 6.9% during the year in spite of the strong NAV performance.
The Board responded to this situation by buying 907,005 shares during the year at an average discount of 11.1%.
Warrants The final subscription date for the warrants will be 15 June 2010.
At the date of this report there are 18,666,085 warrants outstanding.
The warrants, issued to all shareholders on 22 December 2005 pursuant to the terms of the Companys first C share issue, entitle holders to subscribe for 3 IMPAX ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS PLC Job No.

A separate circular on this subject will be sent to warrant holders in due course.
Continuation vote In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, an ordinary resolution that the Company continue as an investment trust for a further three year period will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Notwithstanding challenging market conditions, the Board considers the Companys performance over the last five years to have been excellent.
We continue to believe that IEM offers an attractive opportunity for investors to obtain exposure to environmental markets and recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolution.
Dividend The Companys net revenue return for the year was 2.4 million reflecting strong cash flow generation by a number of IEMs holdings.
The directors recommend a dividend of 0.75p per Ordinary Share 0.85p per share in 2008, which, if approved at the Companys Annual General Meeting, will be paid to shareholders on the register as at the close of business on 16 April 2010.
The primary objective of the Company is capital growth, therefore it should not be assumed that this level of dividend will be paid in future years.
Outlook While risks undoubtedly remain, the environmental sector has recovered well, further assisted by global stimulus funding and longer term environmental policies.
As explained further in the Managers Report, given the positive newsflow from both governments and companies involved in the environmental sectors, together with the attractive valuations of the companies in the portfolio, the Manager and directors believe that the Companys shares offer a compelling opportunity for investors seeking to benefit from the long term growth potential of these dynamic markets.
