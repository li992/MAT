Chairman 22 April 2009 Current trading and future prospects We have made a very encouraging start to the financial year particularly given that the strong comparative period in 2008 when Group l sales were 18 per cent was driven by the launch of a number of popular software titles such as Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games and Mario Kart Wii.
In the first 11 weeks to 18 April 2009 the Groups total sales were up by 1.0 per cent and l sales were down by 6.3 per cent.
The l sales reduction is less than we had anticipated and the demand remains strong.
In the UK and Ireland, total sales and l sales were down by 2.4 per cent and 6.6 per cent respectively.
In our International business, total sales were up by 9.9 per cent and l sales on a constant currency basis were down by 5.7 per cent.
On a reported currency basis, Group l sales were down by 3.7 per cent.
