qxd 24 7 09 1:52 pm Page 2 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Chairmans Statement I have pleasure in presenting the Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2009.
This year, which represents the 50th anniversary of Daejans flotation as a publicly quoted property company, has been a period of unprecedented economic upheaval.
As foreseen in my last annual statement, the negative sentiment which was then gathering momentum in property markets in both the UK and the USA has had a major impact on the Group.
Investment Properties The table below shows a summary of our annual property revaluation by property type: Valuation Percentage March 2009 Change Commercial Property UK 507.3m 23.1% USA 46.6m 22.6% Residential Property UK 384.3m 8.5% USA 188.5m 33.3% Total 1,126.7m 10.5% Above: Architectural detail of Queens Mansions Muswell Hill London N10 Right: New entrances at Cadogan Square Glasgow Page 2 118245 Daejan Pt1.
qxd 24 7 09 1:52 pm Page 3 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 The independent professional revaluations of our portfolios in both the UK and the USA have produced a material overall reduction in value, although this has been offset as regards the USA figures shown above by the impact of the 28% decline in the sterling dollar exchange rate between 31 March 2008 and 2009.
The table below provides an analysis of the movement in the value of the investment property portfolio and shows both the revaluation loss and the foreign exchange gain which have arisen over the year: Movement in Valuation of Investment Properties m Valuation as at 31 March 2008 1,258.8 New acquisitions 44.5 Additions to existing properties 15.5 Disposals & reclassifications 0.7 1,318.1 Revaluation loss 261.6 Above & below: Foreign exchange gain 70.2 Glenloch Court Valuation as at 31 March 2009 1,126.7 London NW3 Page 3 118245 Daejan Pt1.
qxd 24 7 09 1:52 pm Page 4 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Chairmans Statement continued A loss of 232.5 million arose on UK properties which represents a reduction of 21% on a like for like basis: this is in line with the fall in market indices in the period.
In the USA our properties experienced a reduction in valuation of $42.8 million which is equivalent to 11%.
A depressed market can provide opportunities to enhance our portfolio and during the year arrangements were successfully concluded with Southern Cross Healthcare Group Plc for the freehold purchase and leaseback of nine care homes in the UK.
The total cost of acquisition was 33.1 million and the leases will produce rental income of 2.5 million pa subject to review.
Following on from our successful acquisition in 2004 of a multi-apartment complex in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this year our main purchase in the USA was a similar complex in Tampa, Florida at a cost of $14.8 million.
More detailed analyses of our portfolio by property type and location are set out below: Analysis by Property Type Property UK Property USA Commercial 507.3m Residential 384.3m Commercial 46.6m Residential 188.5m Commercial Property UK Commercial Property USA Offices 184.9m Retail 207.9m Offices 44.0m Retail 2.6m Leisure 22.9m Land & Development 27.5m Industrial 34.1m Residential Homes 30.0m Analysis by Location UK Valuations USA Valuations London & the South 647.7m New York 105.2m Florida 47.8m Midlands & East Anglia 112.8m Boston 35.0m New Jersey 28.8m Wales & West 52.7m Baltimore 15.7m Pennsylvania 2.6m North & Scotland 78.4m Page 4 118245 Daejan Pt1.

The work at 49 50 Great Marlborough Street, W1 is close to completion and a marketing launch is scheduled for early autumn.
The refurbishment of 164, Shaftesbury Avenue, WC2 was completed in March 2008 and the property has been substantially let.
As I reported last year, planning consent has The pictures on been obtained for a major scheme of these pages are some refurbishment and extension at Africa House, of the Southern WC2.
The scheme will create an additional Cross Healthcare 20,000 square feet of lettable space giving a total care homes we have of 127,000 square feet in a landmark listed recently added to building at a total cost of some 40 million.

qxd 24 7 09 1:52 pm Page 8 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Chairmans Statement continued The table below shows the performance of our core rental business before and after valuation losses: 2009 2008 m m Total rental and related income from Investment Properties 96.0 87.0 Property operating expenses 53.5 46.5 Net rental and related income from investment properties 42.5 40.5 Profit on disposals of investment properties 6.7 6.5 Administrative expenses 12.0 8.6 Net operating profit before net valuation Losses Gains 37.2 38.4 Net valuation Losses Gains on investment properties 261.6 20.7 Net financing costs 23.6 12.0 Loss Profit before tax 248.0 47.1 The increase in gross rental income in the year is largely attributable to the US dollar exchange movement and the impact of our new acquisitions: our like for like rental income has remained broadly constant.
Re-lettings in the UK have continued at our normal annual rate representing approximately 1,000 individual rental negotiations.
Whilst some downward pressure on rental levels has been experienced, taking the portfolio as a whole, this has been offset by rental increases.

qxd 24 7 09 1:52 pm Page 9 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 As might be expected in the current economic conditions, our level of voids has edged upwards.
Exchange rate movements also largely account for the increase in property operating expenses: administrative expenses in the year have been increased by non-recurring costs related to the settlement of a long running tenant dispute and the corporate restructuring referred to below.
Unlike some property companies, we have no need to sell properties into a falling market and the profit on disposals in the year of 6.7 million 2008 6.5 million is largely the result of the sale of residential lease extensions.
Dividend In setting the dividend each year your Board focuses in particular on the sustainable profit and cash generated by the Groups rental operations.
Notwithstanding the significant revaluation loss reflected in this years Consolidated Income Statement, the strength of the underlying core business gives us the confidence to recommend an unchanged total dividend for the year of 73p.
Balance Sheet Our balance sheet continues to exhibit the strength which has been a feature of the Group for many years.
At 31 March 2009 shareholders funds amounted to 759.3 million 2008 902.8 million.
This is equivalent to 46.60 per share 2008 55.40.
Gearing remains low at 15.6% 2008 8.7% and in addition to our cash deposits of 24.7 million 2008 30 million we retain undrawn medium term facilities of 34 million 2008 65 million.
Corporate Social Responsibility Companies are now required to set out their approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and I comment below on our approach in the areas of Employees, Environment and Community.
Employees Daejan operates an equal opportunities policy to ensure that all job applicants are treated fairly.
The Group encourages and supports employees in the pursuit of programmes of appropriate professional training.
The Group is committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for all staff: first aid training is provided to employees at all Group offices.
The Group benefits from very low staff turnover with average employee service as set out below: Average Service Years Senior Executives 16 Managers 23 Surveyors, clerical & other staff 10 Environment As a property investment company with only limited development activity Daejan has a relatively low overall climate change impact.
Nevertheless we recognise our responsibility to reduce any impacts that may arise from our business activities and we try wherever possible to improve the environment.
In practical terms, our continuing programme of repair work provides opportunities for us to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings and the plant therein.
When undertaking development or major schemes of refurbishment on our properties we seek to achieve the highest BREEAM rating consistent with the nature of the building and the scheme being undertaken BREEAM is a widely used environmental assessment method for buildings.
qxd 24 7 09 1:52 pm Page 10 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 Chairmans Statement continued Community It has long been our philosophy that business should play its part in supporting community activities and for many years the company has made an annual charitable donation of 120,000.
However, with so many possible good causes in need of support, I believe that the choice should principally be made by individual donors rather than by the Company on behalf of all shareholders.
With that in mind, some years ago, the Freshwater family donated shares in Daejan equivalent to 6.3% of the issued capital to charitable companies.
These companies in turn use the income which they derive from Daejan dividend payments for charitable activity and to benefit the communities in which we operate.
Corporate Restructuring During the course of the year we took the opportunity to rationalise our internal corporate structure and all subsidiaries have now been grouped together under appropriate intermediate holding companies covering Investment, Trading and the USA.
The restructuring has generated a substantial book profit in the accounts of the holding company see page 51 but has no impact on the consolidated accounts of the Group.
Articles of Association At last years AGM the Company adopted new articles of association in order to incorporate the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 which came into effect in 2007 and 2008.
This year further amendments are required to reflect changes which come into effect on 1 October 2009: details are set out in the circular enclosed with these accounts.
Outlook and Risks It seems likely that the decline in residential property values may have bottomed out: at least for the time being.
The position is less clear in regard to commercial property.
The reduction in values to date has largely reflected financial pressures on investors and individuals arising from the credit crunch and the dearth of available funding.
In the immediate future the weakness of the economy may continue to exert downward pressure on rental values: a further, but less dramatic, decline in commercial property values seems likely.
Expert opinion is divided as to the possible depth and duration of the present recession with even the most optimistic economists forecasting that contraction in 2009 will be followed in 2010 by a year of only insipid growth.
Ultimately we rely on that growth to stimulate the fundamental demand for commercial property.
Our future results will overwhelmingly be determined by market movements in property values.
In times of recession we are exposed to the risk of bad debts through the loss of tenants and delays in reletting.
As has been evidenced this year, given that we hold a significant portfolio of property in the USA we are exposed to movements in the sterling dollar rate of exchange.
This year the movements have been positive: they may not always be so.
Top and far right: Our ability to take advantage of new purchase opportunities and to undertake new development Talgarth Mansions, projects may be constrained if banks and other financial institutions do not show a greater London W4 willingness to make available term lending at a reasonable cost.
qxd 24 7 09 1:52 pm Page 11 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2009 50th Anniversary In past annual statements I have often emphasized the importance of taking the long view and pursuing a prudent course.
Such an approach is more relevant than ever in this the 50th anniversary of Daejans flotation in 1959 as a listed property company.
At the time of flotation, Daejan owned properties valued at 4 million with equity shareholders funds per share of 29p.
Even in a year of depressed property values in both the UK and USA the equivalent figure at 31 March 2009 stood at 46.60 per share, a 160 fold increase over the 50 year period.
We are proud of our history from which we derive our business philosophy and our balance sheet strength but our focus is firmly on the future.
We will strive to build long term net asset value so that the steady growth which has characterised our first 50 years continues as the hallmark of our next half century.
As ever, our thanks must go to the loyal and hardworking members of staff for their help in meeting the challenges of the last year.
