Chairmans Statement As expected, BBA Aviation delivered a strong relative performance in 2009 despite the continued cyclical downturn in our major markets.
We have made good underlying progress and have managed our cost base eff ectively to improve our underlying operational effi ciency and to limit the impact of volume declines on fi financial performance.
We have clearly demonstrated the fl exibility and strongly cash generative nature of BBA Aviation and materially reduced our net debt.
The Group is well positioned to benefi t from a cyclical upturn and we remain confi dent about the outlook and attractive secular growth prospects for our markets.
Results I am pleased to report that, as we expected, BBA Aviation has delivered a strong relative performance in 2009 despite the continued cyclical downturn in our major markets.
We have made good underlying progress with market share gains, contract wins and new authorisations.
We have managed our cost base eff ectively to improve our underlying operational effi ciency and to limit the impact of volume declines on fi financial performance.
Revenue for 2009 fell by 7%, with our businesses impacted by the diffi cult economic climate.
However, we continued to outperform the market with an organic revenue decline excluding the impact of exchange rates, fuel prices and acquisitions and disposals of 10%, which contrasts with market reductions of 19% in US business and general aviation activity and 14% in US commercial activity.
Underlying operating profi t of 100.5 million was 8% lower 2008: 109.7 million with the impact of the fall in revenue largely off set by cost reduction initiatives and movements in exchange rates.
Adjusted earnings per share were 14.6p 2008: 16.1p.
The key area of focus in 2009 was cash generation and the reduction of net debt.
We have clearly demonstrated the strongly cash generative nature of BBA Aviation with free cash fl ow up 78% to 137.5 million 2008: 77.2 million due principally to a working capital infl ow of 57.9 million 2008: 3.8 million and reduced capital expenditure of 18.7 million 2008: 30.9 million.
Net debt was reduced to 391.6 million 2008: 554.4 million, including a foreign exchange gain of 55.6 million.
The attention to cost control and debt reduction has ensured that despite the market downturn and lower activity levels, the Groups leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA improved in the year to 2.8 times 2008: 2.9 times.
