Chairman s Statement Objectives At the beginning of this financial year we stated that, given the anticipated difficult market conditions, cash conservation and generation was to be our key objective for the year.
Accordingly, our focus during the year to 30 September 2009 has been on:- - maximisation of sales revenue - reduction in property purchases - overhead reduction - enhancing the Group s financial stability.
Key progress during the year - Sales of property across the Group amounted to 220m, an increase of 21.5% over 2008 s figure of 181m.
- Only 12m of UK property assets were acquired compared to 123m in 2008 and 403m in 2007.
- We have reduced the number of full time equivalent employees at 30 September by 13% as compared to 30 September 2008.
- We finalised the refinancing of our core UK debt facility and reset various maturities These steps, in conjunction with the successful conclusion of the proposed Rights Issue announced today, will strengthen Grainger s financial position and ensure our business is able to take advantage of compelling future acquisition opportunities as the market recovers.
Gross Property Assets m 09: 2,083 08: 2,260 07: 2,322 06: 1,901 Results Grainger s results for the year have been significantly affected by valuation movements and nonrecurring items.
Accordingly, within note 3 to the accounts, we have analysed our income statement into trading activities and valuation and other mark to market adjustments and non-recurring items.
This analysis enables us to present more meaningful comparisons of our core operations year on year.
Loss before tax has increased to 170m from 112m, the majority of which is derived from valuation deficits write downs, mark to market adjustments, change in fair value of derivatives and non-recurring items.
Adjusting for these, the Group s result for the year would be a loss of 3m compared to a profit of 12m last year.
In addition, the business has remained strongly cash generative:- m Loss before taxation 170 Add back: : Property valuation movements note 3 49 : Financial mark to market and non-recurring items note 3 118 : Other cost of sales and other movements 173 Cash generated from operations statement of consolidated cash 170 flows 5 Chairmans Statement continued The trading profit included within operating profit before net valuation deficits on investment property has declined from 106m to 79m.
This is primarily due to a fall in profits on disposal of trading property, with an increase in volume being offset by decreased margins.
Our net asset values have been adversely affected by falls in property values: 2009 2008 per share per share Net asset value per share NAV 411p 535p Triple net asset value NNNAV 251p 385p Grainger net asset value GNAV 360p 520p Details of the calculation of these NAV measures are provided in the financial review.
Gross NAV per share pence 09: 411 08: 535 07: 828 06: 677 Rights Issue This morning we have announced our intention to raise approximately 250 m approximately 238 m net of expenses by way of a 2 for 1 Rights Issue of up to 277,628,724 m new shares.
The Rights Issue price of 90p represents a 40.2% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price based on the closing middlemarket price of 271.4 pence per ordinary share on 4 November 2009 and a 39.7% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price based on that closing price adjusted for the proposed final dividend of 3.91 pence per ordinary share which will be paid to Shareholders on the register of members at close of business on 20 November 2009.
We have determined to raise additional equity finance to improve our balance sheet leverage ratios, reduce the overall cost and size of our debt and to better enable us to move from our current position of cash conservation to recommence active trading as opportunities arise.
Full details of the issue are contained in the Prospectus which is expected to be issued this morning.
Dividends At the half year the Board felt that it was prudent to wait until the year end before deciding on dividends.
Given the stabilisation in the housing market over recent months and our success in generating sales income the board are recommending a final dividend equivalent to that paid as a final dividend in 2008.
This will therefore amount to 3.91p per share and if approved will be paid on 12 February 2010 to shareholders on the register of members at close of business on 20 November 2009.
Assuming the stabilisation in the economy and the housing market continues, the Board anticipates being in a position to revert to its progressive dividend policy in the year ended 30 September 2010, from a base total cash payment of between 5.5m and 8m, the total dividend payments made in respect of 2009 and 2008 respectively.
6 Dividends per share pence 09: 3.91 08: 6.18 07: 6.18 06: 5.62 Board Changes Subsequent to the year end and as previously announced our Chief Executive, Rupert Dickinson, stepped down from the Board on 20 October 2009, for reasons of ill health.
On behalf of the Board I thank Rupert for his significant contribution over the 17 years he was a director and in particular, for the leading role he played in the acquisition of BPT plc.
His place has been taken by Andrew Cunningham who was previously Deputy Chief Executive and Finance Director and who has sat on the board since 1996.
The Company has also commenced the search for a new Property Director and Finance Director to strengthen the executive team.
Outlook Although the residential trading market has shown some sign of recovery over the late summer, we remain cautious in our near term outlook and will not remove our focus from prudent financial management.
Nevertheless, assuming the successful conclusion of the Rights Issue announced today, we would anticipate being in a position to recommence property acquisitions as the market recovers provided pricing levels are appropriate and we see the ability to generate or enhance shareholder value.
Indeed, we already are beginning to see potential opportunities to build on our existing portfolio.
Whilst economic conditions may remain challenging for some time to come, we believe we are well positioned to capitalise on future up turns and are excited by the prospect.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at Grainger for the committed, professional way they have performed in extremely difficult conditions.
