com People On behalf of the Board and all our Shareholders I welcome all new employees to the Group.
I would also like to thank all employees for their hard work, dedication and innovation in contributing to our successful year.
Prospects Despite the current uncertain economic outlook, the majority of the markets in which we trade continue to show growth although at a slower rate than historically.
Within the UK, current market growth has been as a result of price inflation rather than volume growth, with livestock products outperforming the companion animal sector.
The Groups current performance, however, is in line with the Boards expectations.
The Group will be enhanced by new product launches and by growth from our existing portfolio.
Additionally, we are realising good month on month growth from Vetoryl within the USA and our European specialist pet diets business is exceeding our expectations.
We therefore remain confident in our future.
Dividend In line with our progressive dividend policy and our confidence in the business, the Directors are recommending an increase in the final dividend to 6.10p per share 2008: 5.50p per share.
This, together with the interim dividend of 3.00p per share 2008: 2.75p per share, makes a total Michael Redmond dividend for the year of 9.10p per share 2008: 8.25p per Chairman share, a 10.3% increase.
1 September 2009 The total dividend is covered 2.8 times by profit after taxation but after adding back amortisation of acquired intangibles.
The final dividend, which is subject to Shareholder approval at our Annual General Meeting to be held on Friday 6 November 2009, will be paid on 11 December 2009 to Shareholders on the Register at 13 November 2009.
