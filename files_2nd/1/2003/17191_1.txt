The resulting profit before tax and goodwill amortisation of 2.1m, was 225.4m: the first time we have passed the 200m mark.
This is our eighth successive year of record profits.
Our compound pre-tax profit growth over the past eight years exceeds 28% per annum and is an excellent demonstration of the growth in shareholder value delivered by successful implementation of our strategies for the business.
I am particularly pleased to be able to refer to that record in that it covers a period when the Company and the housebuilding industry in general has been confronted with significant changes in its operating environment in areas such as demographics, land supply, and planning, and has demonstrated flexibility and resourcefulness in dealing with them so successfully.
I am also delighted to report the progress we have had with our two major corporate acquisitions in 2003.
Henry Boot Homes has been successfully integrated into our Northern and Midlands operations and has contributed significantly to our results.
Ward Homes has now been reorganised and will continue trading under the Ward name in Kent and will, we anticipate, add to our 2004 performance.
