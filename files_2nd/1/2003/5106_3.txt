Chairmans statement This was an eventful year for easyJet, during which a number of factors presented major challenges.
War in Iraq, economic uncertainty and the SARS epidemic all adversely affected sentiment about travel, both business and personal.
The Company also substantially completed the assimilation of the airline Go Fly, decided to order 120 Airbus A319 aircraft and withdrew from the option to acquire Deutsche BA from British Airways.
Throughout, the airline has continued to grow, itself another challenge.
Yet the resilience and determination of the easyJet team, so ably led by Ray Webster, has enabled a highly creditable set of results to be produced.
For next year, the emphasis will be on improving margins, as the assimilation of Go Fly is substantially completed and we start to benefit from the introduction of the Airbus aircraft into service.
A combination of a talented management team and a supportive Board, which is exceptionally well balanced in terms of experience and expertise, gives me confidence that we will continue easyJets admirable record of profitable growth.
This has been my first year as Chairman and the single most impressive aspect of the Company for me has been the spirit and commitment of easyJets people.
On behalf of the Board, I offer them many thanks and much appreciation for a job very well done.
