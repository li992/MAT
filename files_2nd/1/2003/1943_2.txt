Current Trading Uncertainties surrounding economic conditions and concerns over military action in the Middle East dampened demand for new homes in late Spring.
However, I am pleased to say that since the start of summer we have enjoyed good market conditions throughout all our areas of operation.
We have remained committed to delivering quality homes to the middle market and this has resulted in the value of our forward sales increasing from 325 million in July 2002 to 380 million at the end of July 2003.
Since that date, the market has remained buoyant resulting in a further 250 million of reservations.
