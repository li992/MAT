Well Support Group revenue decreased by 6% to $4.9bn but was unchanged in Gas Turbine Services constant currency terms.
The revenue movement reflects strong growth in our Production Facilities activities, offset by a reduction in Engineering revenue, lower Well Support revenue principally in the US natural gas market, and lower revenue in Gas Turbine Services.
Group EBITA decreased by 19%, or 14% in constant currency terms, and Group EBITA margin reduced from 8.4% to 7.3%.
The Engineering Revenue by region & Production Facilities E&PF margin decreased due to a reduction in North America the underlying Engineering margin and the change in mix towards lower Europe margin Production Facilities activity, which represented 57% of E&PF revenue in 2009 2008: 52%.
In Well Support, the margin reduction Middle East & Africa reflected significantly lower volumes and pricing in our US natural gas Asia Pacific related activities.
The relatively small margin reduction reflects a good performance from ESP and early and effective action taken to reduce Central & South America our cost base.
In Gas Turbine Services, we continued the trend of margin improvement and achieved an 8.0% margin.

Within our development related activities, the improving US 2 handling and storage, which should provide a small but increasing rig count should help Well Support, although pricing is likely to be slow contribution over the coming years.
Within Engineering, we expect lower volumes with activity beginning to recover in the second half of the year.
