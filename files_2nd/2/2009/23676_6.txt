The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 7 Business Review Chief Executives Report continued 2009 Strategic Developments Our strategy for some time has been to achieve sustainable earnings growth by diversifying our business base and building recurring revenue streams.
The Group has a long track record of acquiring financial assets and businesses at reasonable prices to create shareholder value.
The Group was well placed going into the downturn in financial markets: The Group had already begun to diversify its revenue mix towards recurring fee income through the acquisition of Williams fide Bro Limited: and The Group took early and decisive action to adjust its cost base and preserve balance sheet strength and liquidity.
As a result of the Group being well positioned going into and through the downturn relative to many peers, we were able to complete three significant business initiatives in the space of nine months: The acquisition of the investment management team of Singer & Friedlander Investment Management Limited SFIM has brought over 1billion of new assets under management: The development of our fixed income agency business within Evolution Securities Limited which has significantly expanded the range of products the Group covers and the number of institutional clients the Group services: and The build out of a large-cap Pan-European equity research and sales business resulted in net hires of 56 people within the business during the year.
The Groups focus in 2009 has been on these three key initiatives, while continuing to develop the Groups other businesses in accordance with the strategic aims and core principles, namely: Financial Strength Underpinned by a disciplined approach to investment: Focus on an agency model: and High Balance Sheet liquidity.
Partnership Culture Proper alignment and reward sharing between employees and shareholders: and Long-term view focused on relationships not transactions.
The Group has stayed true to these values throughout the downturn of 2008 and 2009, both in growing our existing businesses and in developing new ones.
The Group aims to maintain a high cash generation and low fixed cost agency model to deliver high margin and low risk returns.
The heart of the Groups business is building long term client relationships and developing a true partnership culture.
