Mindful of this we continue to review carefully all our markets and manage closely our cost base.
We continue to execute our strategy, with further careful investment in higher growth potential markets and sectors, and in the technology and services that meet the demands of our customers.
Accordingly, we are confident in the longer term prospects for the business.
