Chairman and Chief Executives Statement Dear Shareholder 2009 proved to be a challenging year for the Company, Revenue million but nonetheless, a year with some significant achievements.
2009 397.3 2008 Most notable amongst these successes were the acquisition of 2007 Bow Valley and the associated debt re-financing, which boosted 2006 2005 Danas production base and secured funding and cashflow for the Company for the next three years.
This re-financing was completed within an environment where access to liquidity was extremely Profit before tax million difficult.
2009 56.4 In exploration, a record 17 wells were drilled with some notable successes in the UK, Norway 2008 and Morocco.
Attractive new acreage was also won in both the UK and Norwegian licencing 2007 2006 rounds, and commercially the Company also signed a binding Sale and Purchase Agreement to 2005 acquire an interest in offshore Guinea, an exciting new exploration area in West Africa.
In developments, significant milestones were achieved on the Babbage development project, with the float-out and installation of the jacket and topsides in September 2009 and the tie-in Earnings per share pence work on West Sole has also been concluded.
The horizontal wells have also been drilled and completed and now are only required to be fracced prior to first production which is expected 2009 25.19 mid 2010.
Good progress has also been made on both the Barbara-Phyllis and Western Isles 2008 Development WID projects where sanction is expected towards the end of 2010.
2007 2006 Production outturn for the year at just under 38,700 boepd was broadly flat with the previous 2005 year.
This was somewhat below expectation due to some production underperformance from certain assets within the portfolio and the depressed UK gas price during the summer of 2009, which resulted in the Johnston gas field being shut-in for more than five months.
Together with the lower commodity price environment for much of 2009 and a number of unsuccessful exploration wells, this served to reduce the Companys financial performance relative to previous years.
Overall, however, and from a value creation perspective, proven and probable reserves increased to a new record high of 223 mmboe at the end of 2009, representing a reserves replacement of approximately 304%, being reserves additions of 42 mmboe relative to production in the year of 14 mmboe.
HS&E is a critical business factor across all of Danas activities and through the implementation of the Companys HS&E management system, Dana strives to achieve a set of ideals in terms of no harm to people, property or the environment in its operations.
Annual goals and objectives are set to achieve these ideals and excellent results were delivered in 2009 in respect of these targets.
Learnings have been captured and recycled in the setting of challenging goals for 2010 with the aim of achieving continual improvement in HS&E.
Comprehensive details of the 2009 business environment, the Groups activities and the progress and results achieved during the year are contained in the Business Review on pages 6 to 35.
Results With a lower average realised price per boe of $44.11 during 2009 2008: $66.58 per boe and average daily oil and gas production broadly flat on the previous year at 38,653 boepd 2008: 39,365 boepd, revenue for the year declined by 23% to 397.3 million 2008: 518.0 million.
Profit before tax also reduced to 56.4 million 2008: 191.4 million.
This trading performance was impacted by a number of adjustments, principally 48.3 million of net exploration write-offs, 7.9 million of impairment charges: together partially offset by an exchange gain of 8.0 million due to the movement in the GBP USD exchange rate during the year.

In view of the continuing tight financial market conditions and in light of the Groups ongoing 2009 exemplify the commitment to an extensive exploration and development programme, the Directors do not recommend payment of a dividend.
This will be reviewed once the results of the forward expertise and skills programme are known and financial market conditions improve.
Overall, 42 mmboe of proven and probable reserves were added during 2009 due to the net embedded within effect of discoveries, disposals and field revisions.
This represents a reserve replacement of approximately 304% over the calendar year.
Year end proven and probable oil and gas reserves Danas small team reached a new high of 223 mmboe 2008: 194 mmboe of which 80% are held in Europe.
Danas end 2009 contingent resources technically, recoverable hydrocarbons not yet determined to be commercial were a further 134 mmboe.
Therefore the total recoverable hydrocarbon resources available to the Group at the end of 2009 were 357 mmboe 2008: 341 mmboe of which 62% are currently classed as proven and probable reserves.
Business development Business development during 2009 continued the success of previous years through a combination of a production adding deal, a material exploration new country entry, as well as a number of portfolio optimisation transactions.
In April 2009, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Bow Valley, a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, through a plan of arrangement.
Aggregate consideration was approximately USD 212 million equivalent, which included the assumption of USD 177 million of bank debt.
The transaction delivered production from four oil fields producing in the UK, namely Blane, Chestnut, Enoch and Kyle, with a fifth, Ettrick, which came onstream during August 2009.
The acquisition added approximately 12 mmboe of reserves at the date of completion and a substantial UK tax loss position which has delivered further benefit to Dana post acquisition, particularly given the oil price recovery in the second half of 2009.
Through this deal, the Company has again demonstrated its ability to undertake complicated transactions in a difficult financial and economic climate, in a timely manner.
In December 2009, Dana signed a binding Sale and Purchase Agreement with Hyperdynamics The Bow Valley Inc to acquire 23% equity in an exploration stage Production Sharing Contract PSC covering offshore Guinea, West Africa for a total consideration of USD 20 million.
This acreage is considered to be prospective given the recent discoveries in the West Africa Transform Margin including those in Ghana and Sierra Leone.
The partnership aims to acquire 3D seismic over the highest ranked prospects in 2010, with the objective of drilling the first exploration well by late 2011.
These diverse commercial transactions and the refinancing undertaken during 2009 with the Bank of Scotland, which delivered a new three year USD 400 million revolving credit facility, are prime examples of the expertise and range of skills embedded within Danas small team of committed and talented group of industry professionals.
The Board is highly appreciative of all staff members dedication and enthusiasm and wish to formally thank them for their contribution to the Companys activities during such a challenging year.
4 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2009 2010 Planned Capital Investment Outlook From a macro environment perspective, 2010 has begun with the oil price finding some stability in the USD 70-80 per bbl range and early signs of recovery in the global economy and financial markets, but with volatility likely to remain an ongoing theme for the near term.
115m exploration Group production for 2010 is expected to be in the range of 37,000 to 41,000 boepd with the funding 235m actual out-turn again being dependent on the UK gas price which impacted on nominations and hence production during the summer of 2009, and the timing of first gas from the Babbage field.
Further substantial progress is planned on the Western Isles Development and BarbaraPhyllis projects during the year to deliver sanction decisions on both projects around the end of 2010.
2010 also has a continued high level of exploration activity, with a total of 17 exploration wells scheduled.
The programme has started positively with the announcement in February 2010 of a discovery at the Papyrus well, Danas second gas discovery offshore Nile Delta, Egypt.
Currently, the Bamboo well in the Nile Delta, the Platypus well in the UK Southern North Sea and the K3-4 well in the Netherlands are all drilling.
Of the wells remaining in the schedule, most notable are the Anne Marie prospect in the Faroe Islands, West of Shetland, expected to spud in April 2010: and the Cormoran prospect in Block 7 in Mauritania expected to be drilled during the third quarter of the year.
Also in 2010 two further wells are scheduled for the UK SNS, two onshore and two offshore wells in the Gulf of Suez GoS area, Egypt, one well in Norway and four wells in the East Beni Suef concession in the Western Desert, Egypt.
In total Dana expects to invest around 235 million in its 2010 capital investment programme, though this figure will be subject to volatility in the GBP USD exchange rate given the significant dollar component of the drilling programme.
Currently, 115 million of this will be targeted at exploration, aiming to deliver approximately 300 mmboe, net to Dana, of unrisked P50 reserves.
This capital expenditure programme can be funded comfortably from existing cash resources, cashflow from operations and the available debt facilities.
17 wells In addition to Danas extensive ongoing exploration and development programmes highlighted scheduled for 2010 above, the Company will continue to appraise new opportunities and commercial transactions where Danas technical expertise and financial strength can be utilised to add further value for shareholders.
In conclusion, we would like to thank Danas shareholders for the support delivered during the past year and their continuing interest in the Company as we look forward together to the opportunities and challenges ahead.
