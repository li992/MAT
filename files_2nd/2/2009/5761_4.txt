Business review Chief Executives review Experian performed well in 2009.
Our organic revenue growth was 3%, we expanded our margins by 50 basis points to 23.3% and we delivered strong free cash flow of US$736m, up 11%.
Benchmark EPS grew 8% to 62.3 US cents per ordinary share and we have raised our full-year dividend by 8% to 20.0 US cents per ordinary share.
This performance has been delivered in a challenging and uncertain environment, caused by unprecedented disruption within the global financial system.
Our performance is attributable to the breadth of our business and our ability to adapt to new market conditions.
We were quick to refocus our organisation towards changing client needs and to reduce our cost base.
The benefits from our cost efficiency programme are exceeding our plan.
We delivered US$80m of cost savings in 2009, and today we raise our expectation for total annualised savings from fiscal year 2010 onwards by US$20m to US$150m.
Global growth strategy For now, challenges remain for some of our clients and in some of the regions in which we operate.
In the US and UK, lenders remain focused on account management and collections and on addressing costs.
More broadly across these two economies, rising unemployment is slowing consumer demand.
However, as the external environment begins to stabilise, our strategic focus increasingly is on nurturing, building and harvesting growth opportunities for our business.
During 2009, we invested significantly in new growth opportunities, and our plan is to invest at a similar level in the year ending 31 March 2010.
