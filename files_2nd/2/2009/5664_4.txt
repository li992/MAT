ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 06 Group Overview Chief Executive Officers Statement We are pleased with the Groups financial and operational Mr Felix Vulis performance in 2009, which exceeded our initial expectations held Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year.
The Groups resilience reflected its strategic location, its low cost advantages and the benefits of our integrated business capabilities.
Our performance also reflected the success of measures implemented by management in response to the general downturn.
In addition, the Group benefited from the strength of the Chinese economy and its robust metals demand.
Commodity prices were generally stronger than we originally anticipated.
Going into 2010, conditions for recovery in our main markets now seem to be firmly established, although we recognise that there remain some points of vulnerability in the global economy.
In late 2008 and into 2009 management responded rapidly and decisively to the crisis, cutting ferroalloys and iron ore production to match customer demand, reducing inventories and receivables, re-evaluating capital expenditure and focusing on the control of costs.
Progressively during 2009, management was able to advance production levels across those businesses, and particularly in Kazakhstan where the labour force had been retained through the downturn.
By the end of 2009, production had been restored to effectively full available capacity across most of our principal product lines.
In 2009, the Groups resilient operating performance In 2009 the Groups advantages, and balance sheet strength opened up opportunities to diversify the business.
particularly its proximity to China, low cost base and business diversification, The results achieved are a particular credit to the operational management in Kazakhstan.
We are also grateful for the underpinned a robust performance in commitment of the workforce through the challenging times and to the face of a marked industry downturn.

The Group offers to all its employees its sincere thanks for their loyalty, commitment and Swift measures taken by the continued efforts.

The prospects for ENRC in these markets are second-half of 2009.
During the year we enhanced by structural capacity shortages, notably in China, and were pleased to be able to use our supply constraints that are expected to emerge with an economic recovery.
ENRC in Kazakhstan is well positioned to exploit strong balance sheet to grow our opportunities in China and Russia.
For the Group this is commodity base by acquisition.

We are increasingly confident that strong growth in emerging markets and a recovery coming in the rest of the world will sustain growth in the demand for our products in 2010.
ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 07 2009 Production performance The impact of the decline in revenue was partially offset by The Groups production performance in 2009 was broadly similar to reductions in the Cost of sales, 7%, and total costs, 17%.

Industry overview We continue to maintain our tight financial discipline in The key driver of ferrochrome demand remains stainless steel evaluating opportunities.
production which in 2009 was believed to be 26.2 million tonnes ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 09 worldwide, below its 2007 peak of 28.5 million tonnes and around Outlook 1% lower than the 26.4 million tonnes in 2008.
Around 65% of Our confidence for 2010, in the sustainability of Chinese domestic ferrochrome is consumed by the stainless steel industry.
Like many demand growth and in the growth of other emerging markets, has other metals markets the largest growth in recent years, in terms of improved, and is likely to offer a sustained increase in commodities both consumption and production of stainless steel, has been demand.
In addition, although signals remain mixed and short-term China, with the country emerging as the world leader in stainless prospects are subdued, there are signs of stabilisation and even steel.
With Chinas economic growth forecast to continue in 2010 some growth emerging in the United States and Europe, whilst the and beyond this situation is set to remain.
In 2007, the record year outlook for Russia is better for 2010. for stainless steel production, China accounted for some 7.5 million tonnes: in 2010 China is forecast to produce almost 11 million We anticipate that product prices for the full year 2010 will be ahead tonnes.
Even with only a limited recovery in the traditional markets of the averages that prevailed in 2009.
We expect that production in 2010 could emerge as a strong year for stainless steel production.
2010 for our principal products will be at, or near capacity.
Although fiscal stimulus packages are likely to be reduced during 2010, and as initiatives such as car scrappage schemes are ended, Into 2010, with near full capacity production restored across our some recovery in developed world consumption is forecast to Kazakhstani businesses, maintaining our 2009 cost level will be continue.
We had said in the past that a sustainable recovery in difficult.
We would anticipate some increase in costs: labour costs prices will only be possible when demand results in a significant are set to rise broadly in line with local inflation: raw material and increase in capacity utilisation in the ferrochrome industry.
The other input costs are increasing more significantly as the industry recent price increases and more confidence in the economic and global economy recover: whilst there is also the potential recovery again turned attention to supply side constraints, such as negative impact of a tenge appreciation.
We do, however, expect to electricity and logistics in South Africa.
Overall, with uncertainties retain our advantaged relative low cost position.
remaining for both demand and supply, some volatility can be expected to continue, but the overall outlook is positive.
Save as set out in this report, there have been no material events, transactions or changes to the financial position of the Group since For iron ore, our major competitive advantage is our low cost access 31 December 2009. to Northwest China, which facilitated a doubling of our shipments in 2009 versus 2008.
The ongoing industrialisation of our traditional markets in Northwest China, along with the improved access offered by the new China Gateway rail link in due course, will provide us with further opportunities to develop iron ore sales in China.
In addition, the current improvement in the Russian steel industry is providing us Mr Felix Vulis with a recovery in iron ore sales volumes to The Magnitogorsk Iron Chief Executive Officer and Steel Works Open Joint Stock Company MMK.
Also, due to our low cost logistics position, as well as steady demand, shipments of alumina to Rusal in Russia were not materially affected by market conditions in 2009.
However, in 2010, proportionately more of our alumina production will be absorbed by our aluminium smelter with the launch of Phase 2.
In energy, our low cost position and market insight in electricity allowed us both to sell greater volumes into the regions recovering market and utilise our own secure power in value-added metals production.
Our current position in copper and cobalt is limited.
However, we believe that the longer term demand fundamentals of copper are sound.
This is underpinned by a weakening longer term supply outlook in the face of increasing demand from emerging markets.
