Some 6 million of exceptional costs which we previously envisaged being incurred Within this economic environment, the impact on in 2009 have been carried over into 2010.

As a result of these We have reinstated certain amounts of capacity in measures, manned capacity has been brought into response to an improved outlook, but at present this line with the levels of demand which the business is limited to specific geographies and products.
Generally, we believe that ESABs manned capacity is in line with current levels of demand, and ESAB has 08 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses  Financialstatements Otherinformation We expect both ESAB and Howden to make further progress in 2010 and to perform well against the principal markets in which they operate.

Taking these Chief Executive into account and, as noted above, the charge of 23 March 2010 6 million carried over from 2009, we expect the total exceptional charge in 2010 to be around 15 million.
Howden After a very robust business performance in 2009, Howdens order book at 1 January 2010 stood at 441 million, of which 340 million is for delivery in 2010 and the remaining 101 million thereafter.
Allowing for some element of book and bill, we anticipate new equipment sales being slightly below the record levels seen in 2008 and 2009, and we have taken steps to reduce manned capacity in Howden accordingly.
