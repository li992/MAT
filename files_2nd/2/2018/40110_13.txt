Underlying basic earnings per share Underlying basic EPS is a measure of total shareholder return and ultimately an indicator to our shareholders of the success of our elevation strategy.
Free cash flow Free cash flow is considered to be an important indicator for the business of the cash available for investment in the elevation strategy.
Net debt Net debt is an indicator of both the Groups investment in the elevation strategy and its covenant headroom which is a key component of the Groups going concern considerations.

Workforce turnover The Board considers that this measurement is a key indicator of the contentment of our people.
Packaging recycling The Board considers that this measurement is a key indicator of our impact and commitment to the best environmental practices.
Like-for-like sales The Board does not consider like-for-like sales to be a KPI while the Elevation Strategy is being undertaken, but it is considered a used metric for business use.
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW Group revenue increased by 3.5% to 3,359.5m in the year.
UK Sports Retail decreased by 2.0% to 2,181.5m, which includes USC fascia sales.
European Sports Retail decreased by 0.1% to 637.2m including Heatons Republic of Ireland.
Premium Lifestyle revenue increased by 42.7%, with revenue in the Wholesale & Licensing division down 22.7%.
Rest of World Retail revenue was 192.4m.
Group gross margin in the year decreased by 130 basis points from 41.0% to 39.7%.
This was largely due to acquisition accounting as a result of the purchase of the trade and assets of Bobs Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports and increased inventory provisions as all divisions invested in more significant product offerings.
UK Sports Retail margin was down slightly at 40.8% 2017: 41.1% while European Sports Retail decreased 250 basis points from 43.3% to 40.8%.
Premium Lifestyles gross margin decreased by 190 basis points from 35.2% to 33.3%.
Rest of World Retail margin was 30.0%, which includes acquisition adjustments.
Group operating costs decreased by 3.6% to 1,020.3m FY17: 1,058.7m, largely as a result of non-recurrence of such significant provisioning as in FY17, as well as increased efficiencies through a degree of automation in the warehouse and rationalisation in continental Europe.
See Financial Review for reconciliation of Group operating costs to selling, distribution & administrative expenses.
As a result, Group underlying EBITDA pre-Share Scheme costs for the year was up 12.2% to 306.1m FY17: 272.7m.
UK Sports Retail underlying EBITDA was up 6.5% to 277.9m while European Sports Retail underlying EBITDA was a profit of 14.0m from a prior year loss of 22.0m.

The depreciation and amortisation charges have decreased by 5.7% to 139.4m FY17: 147.9m as the prior year included revisions to accounting estimates of useful economic lives of assets.
Group underlying Profit before tax increased 34.5% to 152.9m 2017: 113.7m, due to the higher EBITDA, favourable realised FX and lower depreciation and amortisation charges.
Underlying basic EPS for the year increased by 74.6% to 19.9p FY17: 11.4p.
The Group generated free cash flow during the year of 326.2m, up from 257.4m in the prior year, and net debt increased by 215.0m to 397.1m at year end, mainly as a result of the acquisition of freehold properties, strategic investments and the continuation of the share buyback programme.
Net debt currently stands at 1.1 times reported EBITDA 30 April 2017: 0.6 times.

Total gross margin increased by 250 basis points to 38.9% FY17: 36.4%.
Wholesale gross margins increased 230 basis points to 26.2% FY17: 23.9% mainly due to the impact of accruals made in the prior year relating to historic import costs.
Licensing revenues in the year were down 19.4% to 32.0m FY17: 39.7m.
During the year we signed 28 new licence agreements and renewed several existing licenses, covering multiple brands, product categories and geographies, with minimum contracted values of $30.0m over the life of the agreements.
The decrease is due to the Dunlop disposal, which included the transfer of 96 licenses.
On a like-for-like basis licensing has maintained its underlying level.

Underlying EBITDA increased by 14.4% to 30.2m FY17: 26.4m, mainly as a result of the non-recurring accruals made in relation to historic import costs in the prior year.
PROPERTY REVIEW The impact of our elevation strategy continues to see the rollout of a new generation of stores.
During FY18, we opened a total of 15 of these new generation stores, of which 5 were regional flagship-style stores, consisting of multiple fascias on a single site.
Post year end we have opened Thurrock, bringing the total number of flagships to 19.
The concept for our flagship stores is constantly evolving based on feedback from customers and our third party brand partners.
The latest example of this is at Thurrock, where there is a strong emphasis on creating a compelling experience for shoppers, offering a diverse product range from football boots all the way to luxury fashion.
com sports store, a USC fashion store, a Flannels luxury apparel store, and a state-of-the-art Everlast gym.
The store includes innovative use of technology.
This includes high-pixel video merchandising displays and interactive elements for customers, such as a facility to record a 360-degree gif when trying on a new outfit.
Experiential enhancements include recharge areas for men and women, an urban-inspired kids zone with selfie mirror, plus plans for an eSports arena.
The estate strategy remains unchanged from the previous financial period, transitioning from smaller stores into larger new generation stores.
Over the past three years a significant pipeline of new large format stores has been built, allowing a phased delivery over the coming years.
The high street has come under the spotlight over the course of the year due to the headwinds facing the sector.
Due to the changing landscape we have made fewer store acquisitions than in previous financial years as repricing comes further into effect.
This restructuring of the retail property sector has opened greater opportunities to enhance our store portfolio across the Group fascias.
We will continue to make prudent investment into freehold property to advance the repositioning of the Groups transition into large format stores.
We have received good support from local councils and communities for our commitment to physical retail.
A significant milestone for the Group was the opening of the London Office headquarters situated on Oxford Street at the beginning of FY19 having acquired the freehold in FY17.
Store Portfolio Sports Stores UK incl.
Northern Ireland The Group is currently operating 374 stores in England, 36 in Scotland, 29 in Wales and 16 in Northern Ireland, along with 38 other fascias including USC.
This represents a net reduction of 19 stores over the period as a result of 13 openings and 32 closures.
Despite the net reduction in stores the total sales area has increased to approx.
ft. Of the 32 closures, 8 were linked to relocations to new generation stores.
Of the new store openings, strategic locations to highlight include new generation stores at Sheffield Meadowhall, Hull, Middlesbrough, Darlington and Isle of Man.
With the exception of Sheffield Meadowhall all of these are held on a Freehold or Long Leasehold basis.
Each of these stores includes a lifestyle offering having incorporated a USC section.
The new Isle of Man store is a new market for Sports Direct with all trade being entirely incremental.
In Northern Ireland during FY18 the 10 Heatons Sports Direct dual-fascia stores acquired at the time of the Heatons acquisition have been converted to the Sports Direct new generation store format.
The remaining 6 standalone Sports Direct stores are part of a pipeline for future development and investment.
SPORTS DIRECT - ANNUAL REPORT 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT 67 CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW Continued Sports Direct Forecast Openings UK FY19 The Group forecasts that there will be in the region of 10-20 new generation Sports stores over the coming financial year in the UK and ROI, the majority of which will include the new USC concept.
For our luxury fascia, Flannels, we anticipate 6-12 new stores over the coming financial year.
Store Portfolio Europe - Republic of Ireland The ongoing investment programme by the Group in Ireland has also seen the development of 2 new generation Sports Direct stores during FY18, one being the flagship store in Dublin.
The Group has also invested extensively in the Heatons ROI existing store network through the conversion of 16 out of the 29 dual-fascia Heatons Sports Direct stores.
The Group operates in 32 locations across ROI, 5 of which are standalone Sports Direct stores.
An additional 12 stores are stand alone Heatons fascia.
Our investment in stores continues to be well-received by our colleagues, local customers and third party brands.

The Group now operates 21 Flannels stores, 10 Cruise stores and 3 van mildert stores a total of 34 stores within the Premium Lifestyle division.
Freehold Long Leasehold Property Purchases The property investment programme remained an important focus of the Group over FY18.
A total of 10 acquisitions were completed in the UK amounting to a combined purchase price of 123.7m.
This is a reduction from the previous financial year due to the strong pipeline of stores already created and changing market conditions shifting pricing.
A further two properties were acquired in the EU, amounting to 16.3m.
Disposals of property assets that were considered non-core to the Group were also completed.
Further property disposals will be made over the next financial year where appropriate.
68 The property acquisition programme will continue throughout the next financial year with an outlook to spend approx.
300m dependent on appropriate market conditions.
CONTRACTS ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS OF THE GROUP The Group has long-established relationships with Nike and adidas, the major suppliers of third party branded sporting goods, and considers that continued supplies from these companies are critical to the business of the Group.
