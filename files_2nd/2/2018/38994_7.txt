Our key exploration objectives in 2018 Key 2018 achievements While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals, we At Kyzyl, full-year gold production came in at 96 Koz of Brownfield exploration projects in close proximity to the In 2018, Polymetal succeeded in extending the life-of-mine continue to sell concentrates from Dukat gold silver, Varvara gold, making a significant contribution to the Groups strong Companys producing assets in the Magadan, Sverdlovsk at producing assets and continued to invest in the next leg of gold copper, Mayskoye refractory gold and Kyzyl double results.
The outperformance is mainly attributable to the softer and Khabarovsk regions, notably: Albazino with focus growth.

Offtake allows us to maximise our nature of the rock, as well as the presence of small highon preparing open-pittable reserves at the Farida and properties with 350 km of drilling completed in the course margins and achieve an optimal combination of transportation grade ore pods.
