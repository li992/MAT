Strategic report Chief Executives review Driving growth through active management and portfolio repositioning OVERVIEW Fredrik Widlund, During the year we made significant Chief Executive Officer progress in working the property portfolio through active, hands-on asset management, reducing the vacancy rate from 5.8% to 3.8%.
We also continued to reposition the portfolio with selective disposals and value-add acquisitions.
As a result, we have reported an 8.5% increase in EPRA net asset value, a total accounting return of 10.8%, pretax profits from continuing operations of 144.9 million and an 8.7% increase in our dividend.
The Company has a well-diversified office portfolio of over 120 properties in the largest cities in the UK, Germany and France and we take a long-term view on the prospects of our markets.
REPOSITIONING THE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO We have continued to reposition the portfolio and have enhanced both our investment team and the local German team to reflect our ambitions and accommodate our growing portfolio in the country.
In 2018, we saw good value in selective opportunities in Germany, but the competition in the investment market strengthened during the year, and despite coming close on a couple of significant potential acquisitions we did not buy any new properties.
However, in the UK we were able to recycle capital with a focus on properties where we could add value, with the acquisitions of Harman House, Uxbridge for 51.4 million and 12 | CLS Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report | Corporate governance | Financial statements | Additional information 401 King Street, Hammersmith for rules, First Camp has been classified as a Two other asset management initiatives 16.1 million.
