As a result, the Pipeline increased to broadly net out.
For all new leases they will fully net out over stand at 5.3bn at 31 December 2018, which consists of the life of each lease, though the interest cost will be higher around 30 bids that have an ACV averaging approximately in the early years of a lease and lower in the later years: this 30m and a contract length averaging around six years.
