Chief Executive Officers review Low costs for the long term The Group is firmly established as a first quartile producer on the copper cash cost curve and we expect to continue to benefit from the structural factors which underpin this.
KAZ Minerals achieved high growth in production, earnings and The number of fatalities continues to be on a long term downward free cash flow from its portfolio of low cost copper mines in 2018. trend.
Our open pit mines at Bozymchak, Bozshakol and Aktogay Copper production increased by 14% to 295 kt 2017: 259 kt and have all operated with zero fatalities since the commencement of the Group maintained its position in the first quartile of the cost mining operations.
A strong safety culture and a high degree of curve with a net cash cost of 85 USc lb, amongst the lowest of any compliance with safety procedures has been established and pure play copper producer globally.
With the new Bozshakol and maintained at these mines and we strive to raise standards at our Aktogay mines fully ramped up, the Group is now focused on underground mines to the same level.
In 2018, we conducted operating consistently at design capacity and identifying detailed health and safety audits at all our mines and held Group opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce costs in existing wide workshops, bringing together managers from different operations, while planning ahead for the future growth to be operations to share best practice.
We have also invested in delivered from the Aktogay expansion and Baimskaya copper improving our emergency response and medical support project in Russia.
To address longer term occupational health issues, we have established new industrial hygiene guidance, medical support Health and safety standards and rehabilitation and return to work procedures.
The Group prioritises its health and safety performance and I am disappointed to report that four fatalities occurred as a result of Our employees three incidents in our underground mining operations in the East The Group employs approximately 14,000 staff and 8,000 Region during 2018.
No fatality is ever acceptable and we are contractors.
We are committed to providing fair remuneration, a focused on our goal of operating with zero fatalities.

We recognise the crucial role of our employees in delivering the Groups success and I would like to thank our staff, whose contribution has enabled the Group to perform well in 2018.
6 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Review of operations Production outlook Copper production in 2018 was 295 kt, compared with guidance of Ore processing volumes at Bozshakol and Aktogay are expected to 270-300 kt 2017: 259 kt.
Achieving the upper end of the copper be higher in 2019 compared with 2018 as both facilities operate at production range was largely due to output from Aktogay where a or close to design capacity for the full year, though at Aktogay this well-executed ramp up, consistent periods of operation at design will be partially offset by a reduction in the average copper grade capacity in both the sulphide and oxide plants and a strong copper processed.
Copper production guidance for Bozshakol is set at grade delivered output of 131 kt 2017: 90 kt, which was above the 105-115 kt for 2019 and 130-140 kt for Aktogay, including c. 25 kt of top of the guided range of 110-130 kt.
Bozshakol increased its ore oxide copper production.
Combined with East Region and processed to 28.5 Mt in 2018, including over 15 Mt processed in the Bozymchak output of around 55 kt, Group copper guidance for second half of the year, approaching its design capacity of 30.0 Mtpa.
2019 is for production in the region of 300 kt.
Gold production is Bozshakol achieved the upper half of the guided range for copper expected to be 170-185 koz in 2019, as lower gold grades are offset production of 95-105 kt, with full year output of 102 kt 2017: 101 by higher ore throughput at Bozshakol.
Group silver output in 2019 kt.
The East Region and Bozymchak produced 62 kt of copper is guided to be approximately 3,000 koz.
2017: 67 kt, slightly below guidance of c. 65 kt.
Group gold production of 183 koz was 3% higher than 2017 as increased processing volumes at Bozshakol more than offset the decline in average gold grades across the Group to 0.31 g t 2017: 0.33 g t. Silver output of 3,511 koz was in line with the prior year 2017: 3,506 koz as lower output from the East Region and Bozymchak mines was replaced by increased silver production from the ramp up of Aktogay.
Zinc in concentrate production declined by 14% to 50 kt 2017: 58 kt, as mining moved through transitional areas at Artemyevsky with lower than anticipated zinc grades.

The operations was offset by the settlement of $281 million of deferred average LME copper price in 2018 of $6,526 t was 6% higher than capital expenditure relating to the original Aktogay project and 2017, although prices were volatile, reaching a four year high of investment in the Aktogay expansion project amounting to $7,263 t in June before declining to a low of $5,823 t in September.
Gross borrowings reduced to $3,453 million at the year end 2017: $3,877 million as the Group continued to pay The Group recorded EBITDA of $1,310 million, representing an down its debt facilities according to agreed schedules.
Gearing, increase of 6% compared with Gross EBITDA of $1,235 million in measured as a multiple of net debt to EBITDA, reduced to 1.5x 2017, as higher production volumes and copper prices were offset from 1.7x at the end of 2017.
Additional financing is required for the by the increase in unit costs, mainly due to the ramp up of Aktogay.
Aktogay expansion project, which the Board expects to obtain in Operating profit increased by 19% to $851 million 2017: the first half of 2019.
Free Cash Flow increased by 29% to $585 million 2017: $452 million and cash flow from operations reduced to Financial guidance $673 million 2017: $752 million due to the receipt of $232 million Gross cash costs at Bozshakol are expected to benefit from of net non-current VAT refunds in 2017. improved throughput and stable copper grades in 2019 compared with 2018, with some upwards pressure from general mining cost Unit costs inflation and increased maintenance costs.
Gross cash cost guidance Supported by increased production volumes and a weaker tenge in for Bozshakol is therefore held at the same level as guided in 2018, the second half of the year, the Group continued to operate with at 130-150 USc lb.
one of the lowest net cash costs of any pure play copper producer globally, with all divisions in the first quartile of the industry cost The Aktogay sulphide concentrator operated at an average of 83% curve in 2018.
Group gross cash costs were 4% higher in 2018 at of design ore throughput capacity as it ramped up across 2018 and 144 USc lb 2017: 138 USc lb, mainly due to higher unit costs in the unit costs are expected to benefit from higher throughput in 2019, East Region.
The Groups net cash cost position increased to 85 as the plant operates at or close to design capacity.
This cost benefit USc lb from 66 USc lb in 2017 as expected, due to the greater will be offset by an expected reduction in the average copper grade share of production from the Aktogay mine, where by-product processed from the elevated levels in 2018 and general mining output is minimal.
Aktogay ramped up sulphide ore processing inflation.
Gross cash cost guidance for Aktogay is set at 105-125 volumes to 20.8 Mt from 12.9 Mt in 2017 and produced 45% of the USc lb in line with the 10 year guidance range of 100-120 USc lb Groups copper output in 2018, at a gross cash cost of 106 USc lb for the project over its first ten years of operation, in 2016 US and a net cash cost of 103 USc lb, compared with 2018 gross cash dollar terms.
Bozshakol delivered a gross cash Gross cash costs in the East Region and Bozymchak are expected to cost of 129 USc lb against 2018 guidance of 130-150 USc lb and a be impacted by lower copper output, wage inflation and higher raw full year net cash cost of 58 USc lb 2017: 54 USc lb, supported by materials prices and 2019 guidance is set at 260-280 USc lb, but will strong gold output of 128 koz 2017: 119 koz.
At 58 USc lb in 2018, still benefit from significant by-product credits.
Bozshakol continues to operate below the ten year net cash cost guidance set in 2016 US dollar terms of 70-90 USc lb over the first ten years of the life of the mine.
In the East Region and Bozymchak, gross cash costs increased by 17% to 244 USc lb 2017: 208 USc lb, compared with guidance of 230-250 USc lb, as cost and wage inflation combined with a reduced copper output resulted in higher unit costs.
The East Region and Bozymchak continued to operate within the first quartile of the cost curve with a net cash cost of 94 USc lb 2017: 42 USc lb, as by-product credits of 150 USc lb were generated 2017: 166 USc lb from slightly lower gold, silver and zinc volumes compared with the prior year.
8 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sustaining capital expenditure in 2019 is expected to be in the Outlook region of $50 million in the East Region and Bozymchak.
At With all of the Groups current mining operations now fully ramped Bozshakol and Aktogay, total sustaining capital expenditure in 2018 up, we are focused on running our processing plants at their design was $44 million compared with guidance of $65 million and capacity.
The Group is firmly established as a first quartile producer approximately $20 million of spending has been carried forward on the copper cash cost curve and we expect to continue to into 2019.
Sustaining capital expenditure guidance is therefore benefit from the structural factors which underpin this, including expected to be $50 million at Bozshakol and $50 million at Aktogay low strip ratios, energy efficiency, favourable water and transport in 2019. costs, automation and the use of modern, large scale mining and processing equipment.
Excluding the Baimskaya copper project, expansionary capital expenditure in 2019 will comprise $400 million on the Aktogay The Group is entering an important phase in the construction of expansion project, $70 million on the Artemyevsky II mine the Aktogay expansion project with the main structural works set extension and approximately $20 million on continued technical to commence in 2019.
This project will add 80 ktpa of copper studies at Koksay, funded by the $70 million investment into the production over the period 2022-27, at a low capital intensity of Koksay entity by NFC which is expected to be completed in the $15,000 per tonne of annual copper production.
The additional first half of 2019.
Final contractor retention payments of cash flow generation from this low risk brownfield project will help approximately $40 million at Bozshakol will be settled in early 2019 to support our investment in the Peschanka deposit at Baimskaya, and approximately $70 million of expansionary capital expenditure our longer term growth project, which is expected to start will be incurred at Aktogay in 2019, largely to complete the second production in 2026. stage of heap leach cells.
In January 2019, the Group paid $386 million of cash consideration Andrew Southam in respect of the acquisition of the Baimskaya licence area with a Chief Executive Officer further $50 million payment expected to be made during 2019 following the release of a guarantee made by the acquired entity which is the legal owner of the Baimskaya licence.
Expansionary capital expenditure on this project will mostly relate to the completion of a bankable feasibility study, with an estimated total spend of $70 million in 2019.
Initial spend on site infrastructure may be considered later in the year.
A capital expenditure profile for Baimskaya will be provided together with other project metrics following completion of the bankable feasibility study in the first half of 2020. www.
