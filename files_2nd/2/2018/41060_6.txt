STRATEGIC REPORT CEOs review of the year THE INVESTMENT MARKETS IN 2018 Equity markets were volatile during the year and, after a notably weak fourth quarter, they ended the year with moderate losses, with global equities down in sterling terms.
The standout performer in 2018 was the US market, witha small positive return of 1.4%, in areversal of 2017 when it was the weakest region.
The UK and Europe were down 9.5% and 9.1% respectively.
The Pacific Basin was down 8.1% and Emerging Markets fell 7.6%.
2018 was a year when macro-economic and political worries such as Brexit, rising US rates and the US-China trade dispute dominated the headlines.
This proved a less auspicious climate for stock pickers than 2017 and our external managers asawhole were barely ahead of their benchmarks, providing little offset to our operating costs.
Gearing was also a handicap during a year when markets ended in negative territory.
As a result, ournet asset value total return lagged ourbenchmark by 1.9% in 2018.

The trade disputes initiated by the A testing year US with its trading partners, particularly China, were a further negative factor.
Oilprice rises earlier in the year had alsoincreased inflation rates, while theuninspiring progress of the Brexit for optimists negotiations continued to dampen thedomestic mood in the UK.
Corporate earnings and dividends grewwhile share prices as a whole fell, particularly in the final months of the year, so equity valuations finished the year lower.
A mood took hold that 2018 might prove to be the peak in the economic cycle, leading investors to discount todays sunshine for fear of rain tomorrow.
