STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW The 2018 financial year was another year of investment and driving efficiencies in Wizz Airs operations as we continue to our mission to become Europes undisputed airline cost leader.
This relentless focus on cost means we continue to stimulate the market through the lowest fares, resulting in record passenger numbers of almost 30 million up 25% year on year.
A backdrop of high economic growth rates across the CEE and the opportunities created by Wizz Airs ultra-low fares underpins our business which has seen revenues increase by 24% and net profit of a record 275m an increase of 22% year on year.
Our cost focus, market leading position in CEE, pipeline of truly game changing Airbus A320neo family technology and balance sheet strength, as reflected in our recently awarded investment grade credit ratings, are the strongest of foundations for Wizz Air to continue to drive profitable growth and achieve one of the best profit margins of all European airlines, ensuring Wizz Air remains one of the most exciting airline businesses in the world.
Central to Wizz Airs ultra-low cost base is our commitment to operating the youngest, most fuel efficient aircraft.
Evidence of that commitment in action can be seen in the average age of our fleet, which is just 4.6 years.
However, we need to ensure that we continue have access to the latest technology and to have a constant replacement of older aircraft with new and so, in late 2017, we announced a firm order for an additional 72 Airbus A320neo and 74 Airbus A321neo aircraft.
These aircraft, adding to our previous order for 110 Airbus A321neo aircraft, will allow us to sustain our cost advantage through cabin innovations, the latest engine technology and other efficiency improvements, while enhancing our customer offering and experience.
Our performance over FY2018 demonstrated the benefits of our fleet, diversified network and continued improvements to our industry-leading ultra-low-cost base coming together to drive fares lower and stimulate ever higher load factors and passenger numbers.
In FY 2018, we delivered: } A revenue increase of 24.0% to 1,948.0 million: } Growth in ancillary revenue of 24.4% to 815.8 million: } An underlying net profit increase of 22.1% to 275.1 million: } A total airline ex-fuel unit cost increase of 0.4% to 2.26 cents per Available Seat Kilometre ASK : } A 23.6% increase in capacity offered to the market as measured by ASKs, as we extended and deepened our network of routes to and from Central and Eastern Europe: } An increase in our average load factor by 1.3 percentage points to 91.3% in the financial year in addition to the significant capacity expansion: and } TSR growth of 98.3% since the end of FY 2017.
Strategic progress We believe that our strategy of building on our diverse network, highly efficient business and operating model, compelling customer proposition, solid finances and sound approach to risk management will result in sustainable growth and continue to drive increasing value for shareholders.
The culture of rigorous cost control is set from the top by management.
It affects every aspect of our business and, as a result, Wizz Air has a cost advantage that protects its market share, provides customers with extremely low fares and stimulates demand.
Wizz Airs infrastructure, including personnel, processes, systems and relationships with suppliers of outsourced services, is scalable and sufficiently flexible to support Wizz Airs growth plans.
We continue to leverage the know-how, market understanding and cultural awareness of senior management and employees to build fruitful relationships with airport operators, suppliers, governments and regulators in new markets, with the Company being able to present itself as a reliable partner establishing and maintaining long lasting, mutually beneficial partnerships.
The strength of our balance sheet recently recognised by the investment grade ratings from both Fitch and Moodys is a historic milestone in the development of Wizz Air.
These ratings will enable Wizz Air not only to access new sources of aircraft financing but also financing at even lower cost than at present.
Reducing our aircraft ownership costs will be crucial to delivery our mission of becoming the undisputed cost leader amongst European airlines.
CEEs Leader Wizz Air continues to be the clear market leader in CEE.
In FY2018, we had a market share of over 42% of low-cost airline traffic in the region and more than 16% of the total CEE market.
We launched 95 new routes during the 2018 financial year, taking our operating route network to 525 routes from 27 bases, connecting 135 destinations in 44 countries at the end of March 2018, allowing us to reach more new customers throughout Europe than ever before.
Today we operate in 21 of the 22 CEE countries, serving the market by offering a network of 27 bases and 141 destinations in 44 countries.
We are confident in the significant growth opportunity that remains in the region and we are convinced that our ultra-low cost business model is best placed to serve and stimulate this market.

Our first Western European base opened at London Luton in June 2017 and, shortly afterwards, our entrepreneurial spirit and agility as a business allowed us to secure additional slots and parking stands at London Luton airport and grow that base quickly.
By the end of FY2018, our network from London Luton airport consisted of 46 routes, flying to 20 countries and offering 6.9 million seats to customers.
In response to the uncertainty created by Brexit, we put in place one of the pillars of our contingency plan with the establishment of Wizz Air UK Limited, a UK-licensed airline which, by the end of June 2018, will be operating 8 aircraft.
Later in the financial year, we were also able to take advantage of a market opportunity in Vienna, and announced the establishment of our second Western European base which will start operations in June 2018.
As at today, Wizz Air offers services from 21 CEE countries including the 14 CEE countries where we have based aircraft and crews.
During the year the Company started operations to from 12 new airports, as follows: New CEE stations New stations outside CEE City Country City Country Tirana Albania Frankfurt Germany Sarajevo Bosnia and Athens Greece Herzegovina Osijek Croatia Astana Kazakhstan Prishtina Kosovo Agadir Morocco St Petersburg Russian Federation Tromso Norway Lviv Ukraine Faro Portugal Fleet development During the 2018 financial year, we continued to invest significantly in our fleet by adding ten A321ceo and four A320ceo aircraft, taking our fleet to 93 aircraft at the end of March 2018.
Deliveries of the A321ceo aircraft commenced in November 2015 and in just 30 months we are already operating 26 of the type representing 33 per cent.
of the Companys total seat capacity.
We are excited about the cost savings we are seeing from the A321ceo aircraft, and the continued roll-out of these aircraft across our network is expected to further improve our cost base and competitive edge.
The composition of our fleet at the end of the 2018 financial year and currently anticipated at the end of the next two financial years is as follows: March 2018 March 2019 March 2020 Actual Planned Planned A320ceo without winglets 180 seats 35 35 32 A320ceo with winglets 180 seats 28 28 28 A320ceo with winglets 186 seats 4 9 9 A321ceo with winglets 230 seats 26 38 41 A321neo with winglets 239 seats - 3 20 Fleet size 93 113 130 Proportion of seat on A321 33% 42% 53% Average number of seats per aircraft 194.2 198.9 205.3 Aircraft Orders In FY 2016 the Company concluded a purchase agreement with Airbus for 110 firm-order A321neo aircraft and purchase rights for a further 90 of the type.
During the 2017 financial year the Company selected and contracted Pratt & Whitneys new technology geared turbofan engines to power these aircraft.
The purchase agreement includes uncommitted purchase rights for 75 additional A321neo aircraft as well as ample flexibility with conversion and deferral rights.
Complementing the above transaction, during FY 2018 the Company signed two additional purchase agreements with Airbus.
The first was for 10 A321ceo aircraft with deliveries in 2018 and 2019 calendar years responding to the ever-increasing demand for Wizz Airs low fares.
The second and historic order at the end of 2017 was the Companys largest ever order of 146 A320neo family aircraft 72 A320neo and 74 A321neo, and as part of an airline group initiative, marked also Airbus largest ever A320 family aircraft order of 430 units.
This exceptional deal secures a continued stable flow of new aircraft starting from 2021 until 2026 at extremely competitive prices.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2018 11 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Fleet development continued Aircraft Orders continued We are convinced that the Airbus A320neo and A321neo are game-changer aircraft for Wizz Air, as we continue to grow at an industry-leading rate and expand our market reach across and beyond Europe.
Wizz Air now has 256 Airbus A320 family neo aircraft on order and these ultra-efficient, next-step technology aircraft will underpin our growth plans for the next decade as we continue with our mission to be the undisputed cost leader among European airlines.
Based on the estimates of both Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, the A320neo Family will deliver significantly better fuel burn efficiency and even lower unit costs compared to the ceo version, making it the perfect aircraft to underpin the Companys ambitious growth plans and replace older aircraft as they are returned to lessors.
The first A321neo is scheduled to be delivered in 2019 and deliveries will continue until the end of 2026.
Based on the current order book with Airbus, and lessor return schedule, the fleet will more than double in size from the end of FY 2017 to the end of FY 2024.
Offering our customers more We know that our customers welcome the opportunity to fly at Wizz Airs lowest fares yet experience a high quality on-board service provided by our dedicated crew.
We continue to challenge ourselves to make things easier for our customers, provide the widest choice of travel options fpr our customers and deliver a strong operational performance.
Proving our commitment to finding innovative ways of enhancing the customer experience we introduced several new services in the 2018 financial year: } WIZZ Priority, an option which includes priority boarding, an additional small cabin bag and guarantee that hand luggage will be placed in the cabin: } Fare Lock, a new product helping customers lock-in Wizz Airs low fares for 48 hours and complete their purchase later: } Flexible Travel Partner, a service allowing customers to create a new reservation without including all passengers names at the time of booking: and } Trip Planner, a new website search tool which allows passengers to discover new and exciting destinations by offering a choice of flexible filter.
Wizz Air continuously listens to customer feedback, which is why Wizz Air decided to change its cabin baggage policy and allow passengers to bring a large item of hand baggage on all Wizz Air flights for free.
We believe that the new hand luggage policy enhances the WIZZ travel experience even further and underlines Wizz Airs commitment to continuously provide excellent consumer experience every step of the customer journey.
Many of our customers are loyal Wizz Air fans who fly with us on multiple occasions each year.
Our Wizz Discount Club enables our most loyal customers and their friends and families to benefit from even lower fares than normal, throughout the year.
The popularity of the Wizz Discount Club continued with members reaching 1.1 million members by the end of the 2018 financial year further demonstrating how well Wizz Air treats its customers.
The trust customers place in Wizz Air has also been evident from the success of bookings with our partners through wizzair.
com: and, the continued growth in ancillary revenues, which represented 41.9% of overall revenue during the year.
While knowing that there is always more to do, we are delighted with customer satisfaction scores of 82% for FY 2018.
Developing our people Without the best people, we would be unable to deliver a high quality service for our customers.
That is why we take steps not only to recruit the best but also place a relentless focus on developing our employees.
We have developed a number of training and career development initiatives for our employees to help them with their career progression not only through promotions but also helping them move between functions, operations and bases.
Our employee feedback survey, which we conduct bi-annually, showed that our employees are highly engaged in their work.

Balanced hedging approach Wizz Air operates under a clear set of treasury policies approved by the Board and supervised by the Audit Committee.
The aim of our hedging policy is to reduce short-term volatility in earnings and liquidity.
Wizz Air hedges a minimum of 50 per cent.

Pre-hedging, a $10 per metric ton movement in the price of jet fuel impacts the 2019 financial year fuel costs by $10.0 million.
In the Companys view, the profit impact of such changes is likely to be less given the empirical evidence of major industry-wide movements in input costs being passed through to air fares with a lag of twelve to eighteen months.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2018 13 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Management changes In July 2017, Wizz Air announced the appointment of Stephen Jones as our Executive Vice President and Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Iain Wetherall as Chief Financial Offer and Heiko Holm as Chief Technical Officer.
Stephen has responsibility for Wizz Airs commercial, marketing and information technology organizations with the Companys Chief Commercial Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Information Technology as direct reports.
The promotion of Iain Wetherall to Chief Financial Officer and Heiko Holm to the newly-created Chief Technical Officer position were further examples of Wizz Air's planning for its future significant growth by bringing additional capacity into its senior management team while also leveraging its great talent pool to promote from within.
In November 2017, the Companys leadership capacity was further strengthened by the promotion of Bela Szegedi to take the role of Chief Flight Operations Officer.
We are delighted to bring further extensive expertise to the executive management team, which remains an important part of overall succession planning.
Outlook As FY 2019 financial year begins we remain very optimistic for the coming twelve months.
Higher fuel prices are supporting a stronger fare environment and we expect these macro conditions to provide Wizz Air with market share opportunities as weaker carriers withdraw unprofitable capacity.
Our ability to drive cost advantage further and offer lower fares across our ever expanding network will lead to an expected 20% increase in passenger numbers to 36 million in FY 2019.
The Company recorded a solid start to FY 2019 with RASK forecast at broadly flat in Q1 year on year, a good performance given the absence of Easter traffic which fell into the last financial year, and although still at an early stage of the financial year, the Group net profit is expected to be in a range of between 310 million and 340 million in FY 2019.
As usual, this guidance is dependent on the revenue performance for the all-important summer period as well as the second half of FY 2019, a period for which the Company, like most airlines, currently has limited visibility.
