CEO statement Dear Reader, This annual report covers the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018, and was completed and signed off by the Board and our auditors on 25 July 2018.
At this time, both Twenty First Century Fox 21CF and Comcast had made firm offers for the company and the offer process was ongoing.
Following an auction process led by the Takeover Panel, on 22 September 2018 the Independent Directors recommended Comcasts superior offer of 17.28 per Sky share to shareholders.
This valued Sky at 29.7 billion and demonstrated the strength of our business and its position across Europe.
Subsequently, on 9 October 2018 Comcast announced they had acquired over 75% of the voting rights of Sky and their offer had therefore become wholly unconditional, meaning our business had become part of a global and world-class entertainment organisation.
We expect Sky shares to cease trading on the London Stock Exchange on 7 November 2018.
It was nearly 30 years ago that Rupert Murdoch took a risk to launch our company and revolutionise the way people watch TV.
The support of 21CF over that time, including James Chairmanship of our business, has enabled Sky to grow in to one of Europes leading direct-toconsumer media and entertainment companies.
I would personally like to thank Rupert, James and 21CF for their consistent support as shareholders, board members and friends.
Id additionally like to thank those Board members - Chase Carey, Tracy Clarke, Martin Gilbert, Adine Grate, John Nallen, Matthieu Pigasse, Andy Sukawaty and Katrin Wehr-Seiter who have or will shortly join James in stepping down from the Board.
They have all made a significant contribution to the success of Sky and have continually looked after the interests of all shareholders.
This is the beginning of the next exciting chapter for Sky and I look forward to bringing our business together with Comcast for the benefit of customers, colleagues and the communities in which we operate.
As part of a broader organisation our momentum will only increase and our aim is to make the next 30 years equally as successful as the last.
Im very proud by what weve achieved at Sky and Im equally excited about the opportunities that still lie ahead.
Yours faithfully Jeremy Darroch 31 October 2018 Sky plc, Grant Way, Isleworth, Middlesex TW7 5QD Call 0333 100 0333 Fax 0333 100 0444 Visit sky.
