Strategic Report Chief Executives Review Introduction In many ways 2017 was the most challenging year we have faced for twenty-five years.
A difficult clothing market coincided with selfinflicted product ranging errors and omissions.
At the same time, the business has had to manage the costs, systems requirements and opportunities of an accelerating structural shift in spending from retail stores to online.
In the end our profits were in line with the forecast we issued in January 2017 and the Company goes into the coming year in good financial health.
Whilst it has been an uncomfortable year it has also prompted us to take a fresh look at almost everything we do: from the structure of our store portfolio, the in-store experience and the generation of alternative retail revenue streams, the management of our cost base, our sourcing and buying methods, stock management and, most importantly, our online systems, marketing and fulfilment platform.
As a result of these endeavours, many challenges and opportunities have emerged.
Structure of this review We have structured this review to give readers: 1 a clear and detailed picture of the financial performance of the Company, 2 an analysis of the cyclical and structural changes affecting the business and our plans to respond to these challenges and 3 our guidance for the year ahead.
An overview of each of these sections is set out in the table below.
Section Description Part 1 Review of Financial Performance page 5 This section gives a detailed description of the Groups financial performance by business division Retail, Online and other activities.
It also gives the structure of the Groups Balance Sheet, financing and cash flows.
Part 2 Strategic Response to a Changing Market page 20 This section describes the structural and cyclical changes affecting our industry and our thoughts as to how these trends will develop in the year ahead.
This section also gives a flavour of some of our plans to address the challenges and harness the opportunities of the current environment.
Part 3 Sales and Profit Guidance for the page 37 This section gives our guidance for full price sales, profits Year Ahead and Earnings Per Share for the year ahead.
4 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Part 1 Review of Financial Performance Financial performance key numbers NEXT Brand full price sales for the year were up 0.7% and total sales including markdown were down -0.6% on last year.
In line with the guidance we gave in our Christmas trading statement, Group profit before tax was down -8.1% and Earnings Per Share EPS were down -5.6%.
During the year we have changed the cost allocation between our Retail and Online businesses.
The aim is to reflect more accurately the costs of fulfilling Online orders through our shops.
Prior year operating profit for Retail and Online has been restated throughout this report for comparison: there is no change to total Group operating profit, refer to page 6.
We are proposing an ordinary dividend of 105p per share, making 158p in total for the year, which is in line with last year and covered 2.6 times by EPS.

Our analysis of cost recharges between the two businesses identified that there was a significant shortfall in the amount that Retail was recharging for the cost of fulfilling Online orders in store.
Prior year operating profit for Retail and Online has been restated throughout this report for comparison: there is no change to total Group operating profit.
The table below sets out the change made between the two businesses and the corresponding effect on their 2016 17 net operating margins.

Reduced clearance -0.3% rates lowered margin by -0.3%.
Stock loss The Sterling value of branch stock loss was in line with last year, but as a result of -0.1% falling sales, was a larger percentage of turnover.
Store payroll Productivity initiatives more than offset increases in rates of pay.
0.2% Store occupancy Falling sales increased fixed costs as a percentage of sales.
Underlying rental -1.7% inflation was negligible at 0.4%.
Warehouse & distribution Falling sales increased fixed costs as a percentage of sales: this has been partially -0.2% offset by cost saving initiatives in our distribution network.
Central overheads Central overheads increased as a percentage of sales.
-0.6% Net operating margin on total sales this year 12.7% Based on our central guidance for the year ahead we expect Retail margins in 2018 19 to reduce from 12.7% to around 10%, mainly 5 as a result of lower like-for-like sales.
2016 17 net operating profit and margin has been restated, refer to page 6.
Change in sales from stores which have been open for at least one year.
7 Strategic Report Retail space expansion Net trading space increased by 51,000 square feet this year, taking our portfolio to 8.0m square feet.
In September 2017 we forecast our trading space to increase by 85,000 square feet.
However, this estimate included two large stores that were planned to open in 2017 which are now expected to open in 2018.

The forecast performance of the portfolio of stores opened during the year is set out in the table below.
Performance of new store portfolio Sales versus target -1.5% Profitability of new store portfolio 21% Payback on net capital invested 24.8 months The new store portfolio marginally missed its sales target, largely because many of the targets were set some time ago at the point we negotiated terms for these properties: a time when prospects for retail stores were more benign.
Payback is forecast to be slightly higher than our 24 month goal.
Of the 17 store closures, three were as a result of consolidating two stores into one location.
As set out in the table below, the remaining 14 stores made an average 12% profit before central overheads.
Excluding the one store which was subject to a compulsory purchase, the average profitability of the stores was 9%.
We would not necessarily actively seek to close stores making a 9% margin however we would rarely agree to a new lease at these levels of profit.

Store profit refers to net branch contribution.
Net branch contribution is defined as profit before central overheads and is expressed as a percentage of VAT inclusive sales.

The table below sets out the growth in the respective parts of our customer base.
Active customers are defined as those who have placed an Online order or received a standard account statement in the last 20 weeks.
9 Strategic Report Increasing stability of our credit customer base The chart below shows that, two years ago, our credit customer base was in decline.
We closed the year ending January 2016 with credit customers down -5.6%.
Since then, we have re-launched our credit account as nextpay and actively promoted it to our cash customers.
As at January 2018, credit customers were up 0.6% on the prior year.
We are pleased with progress made to date and feel more confident about maintaining stability in our credit customer base going forward.

As can be seen, the increase in credit sales has been entirely driven by an increase in sales per customer.
We believe this has been driven by a combination of the re-launch of nextpay, the introduction of NEXT Unlimited and investment in the functionality of our website.

Net operating margin on total sales last year restated 24.8% Bought-in gross margin Improved underlying NEXT bought-in gross margin added 0.2%.
Overseas -0.6% margin has benefited from favourable exchange rates, adding 0.2% to margin.
This has been offset by an increase in third-party branded sales, which reduced profitability by -1.0%.
Markdown Stock for Sale was up 5.2% with markdown sales down -0.7%.
Reduced -0.2% clearance rates lowered margin by -0.2%.
Interest income Credit sales have not grown as fast as total sales, reducing margin by -0.2%.
In -0.3% addition, interest free promotions have further reduced margin by -0.1%.
Warehouse & distribution Under normal circumstances we would expect to gain some leverage over 0.0% warehouse fixed costs.
However growth in Overseas sales increased our distribution costs and capacity pressures in the run up to Christmas increased operational costs.
Catalogues and mailshots Production of fewer catalogues and printed mailshots has increased margin by 1.0% 0.8%.
Photography savings have increased margin by 0.2%.
Online marketing Investment in digital marketing means costs have grown faster than sales.
-0.3% Systems Investment in online systems software and development has reduced margin.
-0.2% Central overheads Central overheads have not grown as fast as sales, increasing margin by 0.2%.
0.2% Net operating margin on total sales this year 24.4% Based on our central guidance for the year ahead, we expect Online margins in 2018 19 to increase from 24.4% to around 25%, mainly as a result of our fixed cost base not growing in line with sales.
11 Strategic Report Online Overseas Online Overseas continues to trade well.
Full price sales for the year were up 26% and up 10% on a constant currency basis.
Margin also improved to 22%, mainly as a result of efficiencies achieved through our overseas distribution hubs.
Our German hub now services 14 countries in Continental Europe.
Overseas sales are achieved through our own website nextdirect.
com and via third-party websites.
Growth by each channel is set out in the table below.

We intend to roll out many of the successful changes that have been deployed in the UK.
These improvements include: better mobile functionality, retaining and promoting abandoned baskets, improved registration checkout and intelligent recommendations.
In the year ahead, we expect full price sales on a constant currency basis to be up 8%, and in Pounds Sterling up 10%.
Sales and profit The table below sets out the last four years sales, profits and net margins in Pounds Sterling for Online Overseas, along with an estimate for the year ahead.
Operating profit for 2017 18 and 2018 19 now includes an allocation of central overheads and markdown costs.
This cost allocation reduces overseas profitability by 3%.
12 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information LABEL LABEL has had a strong year with full price sales up 43% and total sales including markdown sales up 40%.
Growth has been driven predominantly through existing partner brands where we have successfully increased our breadth of offer and improved stock availability.
LABEL sales are achieved on both a wholesale and commission basis: sales by these channels are set out in the table below.
Jan Jan Total sales m 2018 2017 Wholesale 151 125 21% Commission 139 81 72% Total LABEL sales 290 206 40% Nearly half of our third-party branded business is now sold on a commission basis for the purposes of this section we include Lipsy sales as a third-party branded business.
Although we make lower net margins on the commission model, we encourage brand partners to adopt it because we believe that, in the long run, it will generate higher sales growth, a belief reinforced by our sales performance.
During the year and looking ahead, we have been working closely with our brand partners to simplify the process of working with LABEL.
We are developing our stock systems to enable brand partners to directly manage their stock into our warehouse and onto our website.
Our aim is for LABEL to be the most profitable route to market for our commission brand partners and for the relationship between our businesses to be based on mutual trust and transparency.
Sales and profit 10 The table below sets out the last four years sales, profits and net margins for LABEL, along with our estimate for the year ahead.

This forecast is flattered by the fact that it includes c. 10m of Lipsy & Co. full price sales, previously taken via the lipsy.
Following the closure of the lipsy.
co. uk website in February 2018, these orders and sales will be routed through next.
co. uk and reported within LABEL.
Sales and profit referred to in this section exclude interest income on LABEL items purchased on a nextpay account.
13 Strategic Report Other business activity NEXT Sourcing NEXT Sourcing NS is our internal sourcing agent, which procures around 40% of NEXT branded product.
In common with the wider manufacturing sector, NS experienced pressure on its margins during the year.
NS sales were down -10% in US Dollars, mainly as a result of the reductions in the Dollar cost prices NEXT has negotiated across its supply base.
Falling sales and increased investment in product design meant net margin fell by -1.4% to 6.0%.
The profit impact in Pounds Sterling was partially mitigated by the stronger Dollar.
The table below sets out the performance of the business in Sterling and in Dollars.
We expect NS to make around $40m profit, a decline of 11 -7% on the year to January 2018.
At our 2018 19 costing rate this would equate to a profit of around 31m in Pounds Sterling, down -2m on 2017 18.
Lipsy Lipsy is a wholly owned subsidiary managed from its headquarters in London by an independent management team.
Lipsy sells product through a number of different channels, including the NEXT website and NEXT Retail stores.
Sales through NEXT are sold on a 50:50 profit share basis and reported through Online and Retail respectively.
The working relationship between NEXT Online and Lipsy is very similar to the way LABEL works with commission brands.
The table below sets out Lipsys total sales performance by distribution channel.

This has been more than offset by increased sales through NEXT Online.
Operating profit excluding acquisition costs was 12.3m which was up 39% on last year.
Net operating profit including acquisition costs was 6.0m, up 9% on last year.
In the year ahead, we are forecasting net operating profit of around 11m: an increase of 5m.
This estimated increase is due to a combination of sales growth 24% and cost savings associated with the closure of the lipsy.
Details of costing rates can be found on page 21.
14 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information International Retail and franchise stores Our franchise partners currently operate 194 stores in 32 countries.
During the year our partners opened eight new stores and sales have increased by 7.8%.
Revenue and profit are set out below.
Jan Jan m 2018 2017 12 Franchise income 55.7 51.6 Own store sales 11.5 12.1 Total revenue 67.2 63.7 5% Operating profit 7.7 9.3 -17% Profit has reduced due to franchise partners lowering their local selling prices which reduced the royalty we received and the impairment of assets in six of our overseas stores.
Non-trading activities The table below summarises central costs and the profit on other non-trading activities.
Jan Jan m 2018 2017 Central costs and employee share schemes 20.2 22.5 Property management 3.6 6.8 Unrealised foreign exchange 1.1 0.1 Associate 1.0 1.0 Total 16.7 14.6 The reduction in central costs reflects the release of a provision against a legal claim in the current year.
The reduction in profit in property management is driven by an increase in our onerous lease provisions of 4m, mainly driven by two London stores.
Pension scheme On the IFRS accounting basis, our defined benefit schemes have moved from 63m surplus at January 2017 to 106m surplus at January 2018.
This is primarily due to the impact of returns on investments within the schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension scheme was undertaken as at 30 September 2016.
The technical funding position was a surplus of 37m when rolled forward to 31 December 2017.
Franchise income is a combination of royalties or commission added to the cost of goods sold to franchise partners.
15 Strategic Report Cost inflation and cost control In the year to January 2018, cost increases of 44m have been largely offset with cost savings of 38m.
The tables below outline the main contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.
Cost control remains at the heart of the business and we remain determined that cost savings must come through innovation and efficiency, rather than any compromise to our product quality or services.
The net increase in our costs was 8m higher than we anticipated at the half year.
This is mainly due to the additional costs we incurred in our warehouses in the run up to Christmas as we began to run into capacity constraints.
Operationally we were able to serve our customers, however the cost of providing our normal service was high.

The entire value of the Companys net debt is more than matched by the value of our nextpay debtor book, a financial asset worth 1,117m.
In the year ahead we are forecasting continued sales growth from customers using our credit facility, nextpay.
As a result we are forecasting nextpay debtors to increase by 110m.
We will finance this increase through net debt which we expect to increase to around 1.1bn by January 2019.
Net debt, which is forecast to peak in the year ahead at around 1.2bn, is securely financed through a combination of bonds and committed bank facilities.
At January 2018 our financing consists of 875m of bonds and 525m of committed bank facilities as set out in the chart below.

The Groups current and estimated peak net debt is within the limit of investment grade status which we estimate to be around 1.5bn.
17 Strategic Report Cash flow Cash generated in the year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation was 882m.
Cash flow after non-discretionary outflows of taxation, interest and working capital was 663m.
After investing in capital expenditure and paying ordinary dividends, the Group generated surplus cash of 335m.
13 In total, we returned 361m to shareholders through a combination of special dividends 256m and share buybacks 105m.
Of the 105m of share buybacks, 79m related to surplus cash generated in 2017 18.
A further 26m of buybacks were brought forward from surplus cash generation expected in 2018 19.
During the year we purchased 2.2m shares at an average price of 48.81 and reduced our shares in issue at the start of the year by 1.5%.
The table below summarises our main cash flows in the year ended January 2018 and our forecast for the year ahead, based upon our central profit guidance.
We expect to generate 300m of surplus cash after interest, tax, capital expenditure and ordinary dividends.
As outlined in our January 2018 trading statement, we intend to return 275m of remaining surplus cash 300m surplus less 26m purchased in 2017 18 to shareholders through share buybacks, subject to market conditions.

Based on our central guidance, this would leave a balance remaining of 206m to return to shareholders during 2018 19.
Interest and taxation Interest paid in the year was 32m.
However, as a result of timing differences the interest charged in the year ending January 2018 was 34m, a reduction of 3.7m on the prior year.
This was primarily due to the prior year cost of double running bonds ahead of maturity.
We are budgeting for the interest charge next year to increase to 39m, due to higher net debt and interest rates.
Our full year tax rate of 18.5% is slightly lower than the headline UK corporation tax rate of 19.2% for the corresponding time period due mainly to closing previous years open tax filings with HMRC and overseas tax differentials.
The tax payment of 106m in the year included a tax refund from HMRC of 31m relating to overpaid corporation tax attributable to prior years.
We expect our effective tax rate for the year ending January 2019 to be around 18.5%.
106m of share buybacks were completed in the year: however 1m purchased had not been paid for at the year end.
18 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Capital expenditure As set out in the table below, capital expenditure this year was 104m, which is 57m lower than the prior year.
This reduction was due to lower spend on retail space, including four large store projects c. 12m that were delayed until 2018.
In addition, there was less spent on warehousing because last year we made a large investment in a new automated furniture warehouse.

Cosmetic capex of 22m is much higher than normal because it includes 12m for the refit of our store in the Arndale Centre, Manchester which includes a number of important concession trials.
The 5m increase in systems capital expenditure mainly relates to the investment in new RFID scanners for our stores.
Expenditure on Head Office infrastructure reduced to 6m as we completed the three year programme to upgrade our central facilities.
In the year ahead we expect capital expenditure to be around 130m, an increase of 26m on the current year.
Next years capex includes additional investment in our Online warehouses in order to increase capacity to manage future Online sales growth.
Ordinary dividends The Board has proposed a final ordinary dividend of 105p, to be paid on 1 August 2018 and taking the total ordinary dividends for the year to 158p, flat on last year.
This is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2018.
Shares will trade ex-dividend from 5 July 2018 and the record date will be 6 July 2018.
19 Strategic Report Part 2 Strategic Response to a Changing Market The challenges of 2017 & outlook for 2018 Overview 2017 was challenging in several different ways.
A weak clothing market coincided with self-inflicted product ranging errors and omissions, at the same time, the business has had to manage the costs, systems requirements and opportunities of an accelerating structural shift in spending from retail stores to online.
The next three sections deal with each of the above issues in turn: 1 the clothing market, 2 product ranging issues and 3 the structural shift online.
Under each heading we set out what we feel the issues have been in 2017, how they have affected our business and a prognosis for the year ahead.
The clothing market During 2017 the clothing and homeware markets were adversely affected by the following economic factors: Unusually high cost price inflation meant we had to increase selling prices to maintain margins.
A squeeze on real incomes as general inflation rose faster than average earnings put pressure on discretionary spending.
A sectorial shift away from our core markets of clothing and homeware into leisure, entertainment and other experiential spending acted as a further drain on our revenues.
We believe that all of these factors are essentially cyclical and are likely, at some point, to reverse.
The following three sections expand on each of the above.
Cost price inflation 2017 experience The following chart shows the trade weighted value of the Pound over the last two years.
Since the sharp post-referendum correction in June 2016 the Pound has found a new level and appears to have stabilised around 11% lower than its level in January 2016.

NEXTs price increase of 4% was close to the inflation experienced in the UK clothing and homeware market as a whole see graph below and we have no evidence that our overall pricing has become less competitive as a result of last years increases.

The devaluation of the Pound has now worked its way through the system and we now have comparable year-on-year costing rates.
The table below sets out the exchange rates we secured in Dollars our most important trading currency by buying season, the change versus the prior year and the corresponding price increases on like-for-like product.

Our provisional costing rate for Spring 2019 is 10% better than the current year, so we may see a return to modest price deflation as we move into 2019.
If we do experience any improvement in cost prices it is our intention to pass on any benefit to our customers by way of lower prices.
21 Strategic Report Declining real incomes Real incomes in 2017 Real incomes in the UK declined as inflation in the wider economy overtook real earnings.
Inevitably this placed pressure on our customers discretionary spending as the price of essential goods rose faster than our customers income.
The graph below shows the growth in average earnings and CPI inflation: the blue line shows the difference between the two numbers and is a measure of real income.
Real incomes were in decline for almost all of 2017, albeit the decline moderated as we approached the end of the year.
Average Earnings, CPI and Real Earnings Growth 3.0% 2.5% 2.0% Average earnings 1.5% CPI 1.0% Real earnings 0.5% 0.0% -0.5% -1.0% Jan 16 Jul 16 Jan 17 Jul 17 Jan 18 Source: ONS, CPI Actual 20 March 2018 Average Weekly Earnings 21 March 2018 Outlook for real income in the year ahead It appears that the easing of inflation in our own sector is being reflected in the wider economy, as other sectors benefit from stabilising currency rates.
If that is the case and average nominal income growth remains at current levels, then we should expect to see little or no decline in real incomes during 2018.
22 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Sectorial shift Since October 2016 we have seen a shift away from consumer spending on clothing and homeware into other more experiential spending sectors.
The illustration below contrasts the spending on entertainment, pubs and restaurants with womens and mens clothing.
We believe that this shift has been driven partly by innovation, investment and change in experiential sectors.
This is evidenced by the surge in choice and quality of streaming services, TV shows, restaurants, pubs, bars and other leisure destinations.
At some point this cyclical effect will change, but consumer cycles are very hard to predict and can take a long time to reverse, so we are not anticipating any easing of this headwind in the year ahead.

In short, we had allowed our ranges to become too focused on more fashionable lines and omitted some of our easier-to-wear heartland product.
At that time we set out timescales for range improvement using the simplified graphic shown below.
We believe that the improvements to our ranges were delivered in line with our forecast.
Our quarterly full price sales performance clearly reflects the progressive improvements to our ranges.
Full Price Sales by Quarter 2017 2018 2% To Christmas Eve 1.5% 1% 1.3% 0.7% 0% -1% -2% -3.0% -3% Brand full price sales performance as per NEXT plc quarterly trading statements Comparative numbers and effect on sales in the year ahead We are much happier with our ranges as we go into 2018 and expect sales performance in the first half to be flattered by the comparison with the mistakes of last year.
This will be important to remember as we issue our trading statements throughout the year.
Comparative numbers will harden as the year progresses so shareholders should not expect the performance of later quarters to be in line with the first quarter.
24 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Structural change the move online We believe that the continuing transfer of sales from stores to online represents a permanent and profound change in the structure of our industry.
Last year we saw an acceleration in the rate at which sales have transferred to Online.
This change is partly as a result of the improvements we have made in our Online systems and marketing but it is mainly down to changing consumer preferences.
Full Price Sales Growth 2016 17 2017 18 vs previous year vs previous year 12% Retail 11% Online 8% 4% 4% 0% -5% -4% -7% -8% In the long run this shift offers the NEXT Group a valuable opportunity to leverage its distribution, marketing and credit infrastructure in the UK and its brand overseas.
However, the immediate effect of this change has been that although Group sales have been maintained, profit has not.
25 Strategic Report The changing shape of NEXT The table below clarifies the current total sales, profit and the contribution made by each business division.
The Online business is, in effect, two businesses: a trading business and a finance business.
For completeness, an approximate division between the trading and finance business is shown below.
Sales Profit Sales Profit Business m m participation participation NEXT Online 1,665 307 40% 43% NEXT Finance 223 119 5% 16% 14 Total Online inc. Finance 1,888 426 45% 59% NEXT Retail 2,123 269 52% 37% NEXT Group 107 31 3% 4% Total 4,118 726 100% 100% The impact of structural shift on profits in 2017 Looking at last years numbers it appears that every Pound of full price sales lost in Retail cost us 60p whilst every Pound gained Online delivered only 19p of profit.
Full Price Sales and Profit 2017 18 m 200 Retail Online 150 Sales 167m 100 profit 50 32m 0 profit -50 -85m Sales -100 -141m -150 -200 This margin erosion is partly a result of the shift in sales from Retail to Online.
Retail carries large fixed costs such as rent, rates and energy which, in the short term, are unable to contract with reducing sales.
On the other hand, the Online business has significant variable costs which increase with sales delivery, warehouse picking, returns processing, call centre activity etc..
In addition to this transfer cost, last year, there were also other factors which eroded profitability in both businesses.
It is important to separate these more temporary profitability issues from the margin erosion caused by sales transferring from one business to the other, as the latter is likely to remain an issue for some time whilst the others can be managed out of our profit and loss account.
Group interest of 35m has been charged to the Finance profit and loss account.
26 Change m Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information The table below is a simplified model which walks forward the decline in Retail sales and growth in Online sales.
Profit walk forward 2017 18 m Retail Online Total A Change in full price sales -141 167 26 B Gain loss on gross margin on NEXT branded stock -92 109 17 C Less increase decrease in variable costs and new space 6 -29 -23 D Change in margin from sales growth -86 80 -6 E Margin erosion from lower margin third-party brands -30 -30 F Total gain loss in margin -86 50 -36 G Loss from lower clearance rates -15 -7 -22 H Cost increases -12 -12 -24 I Cost savings 28 1 29 Total gain loss in margin -85 32 -53 J Change in Group costs -11 Total gain loss in margin after Group costs -64 The walk forward uses approximate margins and requires a bit of explanation which is given for the relevant lines referencing the letters in the left column.
Line B shows the lost gross margin on sales assuming that all items are sold at the gross margin of NEXT branded stock.
In reality, much of the sales growth was delivered by third-party brands that are sold at lower margins.
Line C accounts for the normal variable costs that would be incurred or saved as business levels change.
Line D shows the net effect of the change in sales and variable costs: in effect this is the cost of the structural shift in sales from Retail to Online.
It is mitigated by the fact that sales grew faster Online than they did in store.
If Online sales growth had exactly matched the Retail sales decline the loss would have been 18m, 13p for every Pound transferred.
Line E shows the margin erosion from growth in lower margin third-party branded business.
Line G shows the margin erosion caused by poorer clearance rates.
Lines H and I show the impact of cost increases and savings in our fixed cost base.
Line J shows the change in Group costs.
The analysis shows that although some of the margin erosion was caused by the switch from Retail to Online, the lions share of the erosion came from other factors.
The most important were: the cost of poorer clearance rates -22m, the margin erosion from third-party brands -30m and the step change in Online systems and marketing costs -11m meant that cost increases outweighed cost savings.
Profit attrition in the year ahead Our central guidance for the year ahead is for Brand full price sales to be up 1.0%, a very similar increase to the year just ended.
However, we are not expecting anything like the same level of profit attrition in the year ahead.
The walk forward in the following table mirrors the format of the table explained in the previous section.
We estimate that lower margin erosion will be delivered by a combination of slightly higher sales growth, lower rental increases from new space, less erosion from third-party brands and most significantly less erosion from Sale clearance rates.

Cyclical Internal external Outlook Comments Rising cost prices External Improvement 2018.
Short term issue with price inflation likely to be eliminated by second half.
Consumer squeeze External Possible improvement Some possible relief towards the end of the year as general end 2018. inflation likely to fall back to below wage growth.
Sectorial shift External No foreseeable Difficult to predict when this will correct and no sign of improvement yet.
Ultimately cyclical so likely to reverse at some point in the next three years.
Exceptional level of errors and omissions corrected as we head into 2018.
Structural Internal external Outlook Comments Shift of sales online External No change to Permanent change to retail environment with further to underlying trend.
Continuing implications for cost management and investment across the business.
Online systems Internal Improvements Much improved and delivering material benefits, much ongoing.
Action plan for the year ahead In many ways the challenges of the current environment along with the consequent economic changes to our business sets the agenda for the year ahead.
We are very clear about our priorities: Continue to improve and develop our product ranges.
Defend Retail sales and profitability.
Attack costs across the Group through innovation and negotiation and never at the expense of service or quality.
Maximise the potential for profitable growth Online.
Improving product ranges The quality and design of our product ranges remain all important and improving them is at the heart of what we do.
The improvements we have made to our buying and design processes are the sum of many small changes, which we will not detail here.
The improvement we saw in our quarterly performance last year see page 24 gives us the confidence that we are moving in the right direction.
We believe that we have further to go.
In general terms we are looking to achieve the following: Ensure that our ranges have well-designed, great quality heartland product at every level of our price architecture.
Do more to harness and react to the design expertise within the business and its supply base.
Extend choice online where relatively low stock investment allows us to experiment and extend the breadth of our offer.
Develop new sources of supply.
Defend Retail sales and profitability We are reconciled to the fact that Retail sales are likely to decline in the medium term and have set our budgets accordingly see Store portfolio stress test on page 31.
However, that does not mean that we can do nothing to mitigate the effects of declining like-for-like sales.
We can introduce restaurants, cafs and other concessions which generate additional revenue and increase footfall to our shops.
We can manage both our operational and occupancy costs down to a level that suits the current retail environment.
Most importantly, we can develop the positive role our stores already play as an integral part of our Online platform bearing in mind around 50% of our orders are delivered through stores.
The average value of store orders is lower than home deliveries but they still account for 43% of all Online sales.
There is much more that can be done to make our stores and their stock holding an active part of our Online business.
28 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information These ideas are developed in the following sections.
Maximise online value of retail stores One of the great advantages any online business has over retail stores is that all its stock is held in one central location.
This means choice is not limited by physical display space or stock investment.
In addition, stores have the disadvantage that once they have received their allocation, some sell more than planned whilst others sell less.
So some stores end up in surplus whilst others are out of stock.
Over the past year we have given much thought as to how we can exploit the one big advantage shops have over Online warehouses the fact that the stock is already close to our customers.
We also looked at how we can mitigate some of the disadvantages caused by the fragmentation of Retails distributed stock holding.
Find-in-store and same day click-and-collect Ten per cent of the stock our customers attempt to order online is sold out.
A further 20% is not available for immediate delivery either because we are waiting for returns or a supplier shipment.
Of the items that are sold out online, 10% are likely to be available in a store within 10 miles from our customers homes.
40% of the delayed items are also available in local stores.
To address this issue we launched a find-in-store function just before Christmas which enables customers to locate stock that is out of stock online.
In September we aim to launch a full click-and-collect service that will allow customers to purchase these scarce items online and collect them in a store within one hour.
Store-to-store ordering and transfers In June we will also enable store-to-store transfers to fulfil customer orders and introduce an element of stock rebalancing between stores transferring surplus stock in one store to fill a deficit in another.
The find-in-store, click-and-collect and stock rebalancing projects are part of a wider project to make better use of our store network in its role as a distributed stock holding.
Our long term aim is to further integrate our shops ever more closely into our Online trading platform.
These projects are greatly assisted by the fact that we currently deliver to most of our stores every day to fulfil Online orders to store.
The leveraging of this internal delivery network means that we are able to transfer stock between our stores, depots and warehouses at relatively low cost.
Improving the retail experience Manchester Arndale experiment Last year we set out our plans for the refit of our Manchester Arndale store.
Arndale has a florist, prosecco bar, restaurant, childrens activity centre, caf, card & stationery shop, barber and shortly a car showroom.
We are also in negotiation to add a spa operator and bridalwear concession.
We estimate that the concessions in Manchester will deliver c. 800k of income to the store, accounting for around 40% of our rent, and 22% of total occupancy cost rent, rates and service charge.
The restaurant is a 50 50 joint venture with Gino DAcampo and Individual Restaurants Group and we take 50% of the profit rather than a rent.
We have one other Ginos restaurant open in Hull.
We have very much appreciated the professionalism, acumen and energy of our restaurant partners.
The combined appraisal for the two stores is set out below.
The economics of the restaurants are healthy but not as compelling as the appraisal hurdles we set for our investment in retail space.
So the key for us will be the positive effect they have on the sales of the stores in which they operate.
We plan to invest in four more Gino restaurants in the year ahead.
Combined appraisal for Hull & Arndale Gino restaurants Turnover 4m Profit 490k Profit % 12% Capex 2.7m IRR 28% Concession expansion and projected income in the year ahead In addition to the concessions opened in Arndale we are also in discussions with a travel operator, branded footwear concession and cosmetics concession.
In the year ahead we currently plan to open 98 concessions across our store portfolio and expect to generate annualised income of around 5m from these concessions.
29 Strategic Report Retail credit It is often assumed that all of our 1.6bn credit sales are made Online.
In fact, many of our Online customers use their nextpay home shopping account instore and c. 240m of Retail sales are charged to Online accounts using their account card.
We are adapting nextpay to allow us to market it directly to Retail customers.
Initially we will offer this through online marketing and emails to known Retail customers.
Going forward we will trial offering it in stores, though this needs to be done with extreme care to ensure that customers are correctly informed of everything they need to know before opening a credit account and we comply with all credit regulations.
Retail credit is likely to be higher risk than home shopping credit and we will have much to learn about this product.
However the introduction of a retail credit offer puts stores on an equal footing with Online by enabling customers to spread the cost of their purchases.
All the evidence we have from the nextpay account cards is that customers who are able to spread the cost of their retail purchases are likely to increase their retail spend.
Managing occupancy costs One of the reasons Retail profitability is so highly geared is that our occupancy costs are a high and fixed cost as a percentage of sales.
Managing these costs in the short term is very difficult but in the longer term there is scope for some of our occupancy costs to reduce.
The vast majority of our leases are on upward only rent reviews so rents do not come down during the lifetime of a lease.
However our store portfolio has an average lease term of just under seven years and 240 of our leases, representing 32% of our rental liabilities, will be up for renewal within the next three years.
Options at lease end When a lease comes up for renewal we have three options: Remain: renegotiate rent, lease term, and a capital contribution to the refit of the shop.
Hold over: remain in occupation paying the historic rent on a very short term lease with a mutual break.
Lease renewals 2017 Our experience over the last year is that when we renew leases we get significantly better terms.
Where we are unable to secure better terms we generally are not renewing the lease.
During the year ending January 2018 we renewed the leases on 19 stores.
The table below sets out the rent before and after the renewal and gives the capital contribution paid to us.
These capital contributions were used to refit the renewed stores and get them to a standard that will see them through to the end of the new lease.
In many cases we have taken the opportunity of the renewal to add new concessions.
The concession income is also shown in the table.
As can be seen from the table the net rent fell by -28%.
The capital contribution of 5m would pay for a significant part though not all of the cost of refitting these stores.
The average lease term was seven years and the portfolio profitability before central overheads is now 21%.
This level of profitability is such that the store should remain profitable for the life of the lease, even in adverse like-for-like trading conditions.
Before we approve any new store we now test the year ten profitability assuming -10% annual compound like-forlike sales decline.
Before After 19 stores renewals 2017 18 renewal renewal Gross rent before concession income 6,500k 4,900k -25% Concession income 80k 250k Net rent 6,420k 4,650k -28% Net rent sales VAT inc. 10.3% 7.5% Capital contribution 5,000k Average lease term 7 years Average net branch contribution 21% 30 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Prospective lease renewals 2018 Looking forward to the year ahead we believe we are likely to renegotiate 29 leases: the remaining stores that are due for renewal will either be held over at the passing rent, pending future negotiation, or will be closed.
We currently plan to close 10 small stores next year of which most are at the end of their lease.
The table below shows what we expect to achieve in the 29 stores we plan to renew in the year ahead.
It is a similar pattern to last year, though importantly the average lease term is expected to come down to five years.

In our last report we projected what would happen to the economics of our store portfolio in the event of ten years of -6% negative like-for-like sales.
With last years like-for-like sales of -9.1%, we have tested what would happen to our stores at -10% over a longer period of time.
It is important to emphasise that the scenario we set out below is only a scenario.
It is not what we actually think will happen.
I have little doubt that shareholders may read that this worst case scenario is what NEXT is planning and that the projected store closures required in these circumstances are what the Company will actively seek to achieve.
That is not the case, although it does make for a better news story!
The purpose of this scenario is not to plan the future: rather it is to test whether our store portfolio is an asset or a liability in extreme circumstances.
Our verdict is that it remains an asset, albeit one that is declining in value, and not a liability.
A very profitable portfolio Before discussing the stress test, it is important to point out that our current store portfolio is extremely profitable.
Currently the vast majority of our stores make a healthy profit, with 94% of turnover delivering a net branch profit of more than 10%.
The left hand table below sets out the percentage of our turnover within stores of different levels of profitability as at January 2018.
The second table shows the same information projected forward one year, based on the assumption that like-for-like sales are down -8.5%, which is in line with our central guidance.
January 2018 January 2019 e Store profitability % of turnover Store profitability % of turnover 20% 59% 20% 46% 15% 85% 15% 74% 10% 94% 10% 90% 5% 97% 5% 95% 0% 98.7% 0% 96.8% 31 Strategic Report Stress test assumptions The following stress test is based on the following assumptions: We shut unprofitable stores at their lease expiry.
When profitable stores reach the end of their lease we are able to continue trading, paying the same rent on a short term lease holding over.
We take on no new space, are unable to reduce any rents and take on no concession income.
Fixed costs that are shared between the Retail and Online businesses are absorbed as the Online business grows.
For the purpose of this model, it is assumed that Online sales growth matches the Retail sales decline.
Base scenario: like-for-like sales at -10% for fifteen years In this scenario the cumulative cash generated by our stores over fifteen years is 86m and in year 15 there is a 19m cash loss from the remaining portfolio.
800m Years 700m 15 600m LFL 500m -10% Cumulative net cash 400m Net cash per annum Net cash 300m 86m 200m 100m 0m -19m -100m Mainline stores excluding Clearance stores -200m 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 Scenario accounting for rent reductions, interest income and sales transfer The scenario above does not account for three factors that would improve the portfolio profitability.
These factors are set out in the table below: Cum cash Year 15 Factor Description effect cash effect Retail interest Retail stores generate a profit from the use of our Online credit account in income stores.
This profit is a genuine Retail profit but is not accounted for in the Retail profit and loss account.
167m 1m Rent reductions In the scenario of -10% like-for-like sales it is very likely that retail rents would fall at lease renewal.
Our experience last year was that rents fell by -25% on average at lease renewal.
This scenario assumes that rent reductions are -15% at renewal.
23m 0m Sales transfer When we open new shops that are close to existing stores we would normally experience some cannibalisation, whereby some of the sales gained in the new store come at the expense of a nearby shop.
When we close stores we would expect to see this effect in reverse.
Currently we generally experience cannibalisation of 15% to 25%.
In this scenario we have assumed a 15% transfer of sales from closing stores to nearby shops.
155m 10m 32 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information 800m Years 700m 15 600m LFL 500m -10% Cumulative net cash 400m Net cash Net cash per annum 300m TRANSFER SALES 15% 431m RENT REDUCTION 15% 200m INTEREST INCOME 100m 0m -8m -100m Mainline stores excluding Clearance stores -200m 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 In this, more complete scenario, the store portfolio generates 431m of cash and only loses -8m in year 15.
Whilst the outlook for Retail in a -10% like-for-like scenario severely undermines the value of our Retail business, it does not create a liability.
Nor does it in any way detract from the value of our Online business which is very likely to grow in the event Retail sales move back at this rate.
Maximise growth online We continue to develop our product offer online: expanding the breadth of our own product offers alongside those of our partner brands through LABEL and Lipsy & Co. whose progress is described on pages 13 and 14.
This section focuses on our systems and logistics infrastructure.
Online investment paying dividends In March 2016 we acknowledged that we had fallen behind best in class in terms of our website functionality, online marketing and data management.
During the last twenty-four months we have significantly increased our investment in the systems and the people required to improve our performance.
We spent an additional 11m in the year on software and IT and marketing professionals.
This investment included a new Data Management Platform, Content Management System, Customer Segmentation System, and Optimisation and Testing Platform.
None of this software has been capitalised and is fully expensed in the year of purchase.
These systems all served to improve our online capability and resulted in a large number of small improvements to the online shopping experience.
Initiatives include intelligent recommendations, a new mobile site, new flowers site, faster checkout and registration, the introduction of NEXT Unlimited unlimited deliveries to home for 20 a year and a whole host of other small improvements.
The graph below shows that both the Retail and Online businesses improved as our ranges recovered.
However, the acceleration online was much more pronounced, and we believe that this was largely as a result of the improvements we made to our website, marketing and online services.
33 Strategic Report Interestingly, no single development made a significant difference on its own.
Each improvement made shopping with NEXT just a little bit easier and delivered a small increase in sales.
It appears that sales have benefitted more than might have been expected from the sum of the parts, as the cumulative effect of developments collectively made for a much better shopping experience.

The graphic below shows the timetable for some of our more important projects in the upcoming year.
This is by no means a definitive list and we have many other smaller projects that we will deliver during the year.
The table beneath the graphic summarises the nature and benefits of each project.
Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Targeted marketing New search engine 3 step credit Personalised promotions Home page personalisation Product personalisation Phase 2 34 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Project Description Targeted marketing roll out To date we have only really experimented with our Data Management Platform.
In the coming year we will deploy it in anger.
This technology enables us to more accurately target our spend on third-party websites, tailoring the products we offer and the amount we pay for an advert to the expected productivity and preferences of each potential customer.
Trials indicate that we can deliver an improvement of at least 12% return on advertising spend i. e. 12% more sales for the same investment in advertising.
However this application is not just about improving returns on marketing spend, it also allows us to target customer groups we could not identify in the past.
New search engine We aim to launch a new Artificial Intelligence based search engine in the second quarter of the year.
The main advantage it will have over our current search engine is that it will be able to learn from customer behaviour.
So it is much less reliant on the attributes we manually allocate to our products.
3 Step credit offer This is a new credit product for NEXT, aimed at customers who do not have or do not want a nextpay account.
It will enable customers to split the cost of any purchase into three equal monthly amounts without incurring interest, as long as each monthly 3 Step payment is made in full and on time.
Customers will have the flexibility to pay less than the monthly 3 Step payment provided they pay at least the monthly minimum, but if they do, they will incur interest on the balance they have not yet paid.
We anticipate that this product will generate some interest income from those who choose not to pay the full 3 Step payments: but the main aim of the product is to drive sales growth by allowing customers to spread the cost of their purchases.
Personalised promotions We will deliver a personalised promotions engine that will allow us to target specific promotions on specific products to specific customers.
We believe that there may be particular merit in selectively promoting new product categories to existing customers e. g. womens jeans to female customers who currently only buy our childrens clothing.
True personalised home Currently our level of home page personalisation is crude.
This application will allow us to pages serve 12,000 home page variations driven by the product and service preferences of individual customers.
Product personalisation This will allow us to embellish and personalise our own NEXT product, for example embroidering names on NEXT babygrows or jeans.
Developing our delivery network We have already discussed the ways in which we can further integrate our store network into our online trading platform see section entitled Maximise online value of Retail stores on page 29.
We are also planning to integrate some of our newest suppliers into our online platform.
Last year we started to sell personalised products on our website.
Orders are passed to a network of independent suppliers who personalise their products and send them directly to our customers.
The new business started well and looks as though it will take at least 7m this year.
This service has two operational problems.
Firstly, we are unable to deliver these products through our stores.
Secondly, delivery tracking and problem resolution is convoluted if items do not arrive as expected.
In addition, we lose the opportunity to consolidate items into a single delivery which would be more cost effective.
In October we intend to integrate key personalised gift suppliers into our delivery network.
We will use our next-day to store delivery fleet to collect items from suppliers and inject them into our network when our vans return from their rounds.
Most of these suppliers are not more than a few miles from one of our existing delivery routes so the cost of collection will be low.
We believe that by bringing these deliveries into our network we have the opportunity to increase the quality of the delivery service, reduce costs and potentially increase speed of delivery.
35 Strategic Report Attack costs Saving money in the right way In light of the costs inherent in the structural shift online the need to make cost savings is greater than ever.
However, we need to be careful.
It would be easy to cut costs by reducing the quality of goods and services or underinvest at a time investment is central to online growth.
We are acutely aware of these risks and are clear that cost savings must not come at the expense of our customers or the business.
Cost savings need to come through working smarter, using new technology, right sizing our Retail fixed costs and ensuring that we are cutting the marketing expenditure which is losing relevance in the online world.
Three case studies illustrate these points.
RFID stock counting technology driving efficiency Every week our stores scan all stock on their shop floors to ensure that we accurately replenish from stock rooms to the shop floor.
Using a traditional Hand Held Terminal HHT staff can scan 1,275 items per hour.
We have recently introduced new Radio Frequency Identification RFID tags in our stores allowing us to scan using new RFID enabled HHTs.
This is forecast to increase hourly scanning rates to 5,100, saving 2m per annum in wage costs.
New delivery schedule right sizing our delivery fleet Over the last three years our Retail sales have fallen by 10% but the number of deliveries we make has remained broadly in line with 2014.
We are in the process of changing our delivery schedule to bring it in line with the volume of units moving through the business.
We anticipate that this will eliminate 4m of unnecessary cost at a time our Retail business desperately needs to save money.
The graph below shows our sales and deliveries indexed to 2014.
of deliveries 100% 95% Retail sales 90% Reduction in the costs of catalogue production Our catalogues and other brochures remain an important part of our business.
We distribute our major publications nine times in the year, to coincide with the launches of nine seasonal ranges.
These brochures remain popular with large numbers of customers and are proven to drive sales if sent to the right people.
However as digital technology advances catalogues have become less relevant to an increasing number of new customers.
We are constantly analysing the effect of catalogues on different customer segments and are careful to prevent distribution of free brochures when they no longer generate a return.
This exercise, along with efficiency savings in photography and reduced page numbers, is expected to save 7m in the coming year.
Costs and savings in the year ahead In our central forecast we are budgeting for cost increases of around 35m, as set out in the table below.
Cost increase forecast for 2018 19 m e General wage inflation 17 Interest payable on bonds and bank debt 5 Investment in online systems 4 National Living Wage 3 Occupancy rates, energy taxes 3 Lower clearance rates of Sale stock 3 Total cost increases 35 To date, we have identified around 30m of cost savings which mitigate some of the cost increases detailed above.
This includes a non-cash 12m saving in depreciation.
36 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Part 3 Sales and Profit Guidance Outlook for sales The table below sets out the central guidance for full price sales growth in Retail and Online for the year ahead.
For comparison we give the actual figure for last year in the second column.
The divisional guidance comes with a health warning: it is very early in the year to be giving sales guidance by division but we have more confidence in guidance for the Group as a whole than we do for the individual parts.
Central guidance Performance % Variance on previous year for 2018 19 in 2017 18 Retail full price like-for-like sales -8.5% -9.1% Total Retail full price sales inc. contribution from new space -7.4% -7.0% Online full price sales 10.3% 11.2% Total full price sales 1.0% 0.7% We are budgeting for a slightly better full price sales performance in the year ahead than last year.
This is because in the first half last year we were adversely affected by ranging errors, which we believe we have now corrected.
As a result we expect growth in the first half to be stronger than the second when comparative sales improve for quarterly sales history and guidance see page 24.
Outlook for profits We are maintaining the guidance range we issued for the full year in our January 2018 trading statement.
At our central guidance of full price sales growth of 1.0%, we estimate that Group profit would be around 705m.
This profit is marginally down on the current year as we expect operational costs to continue to grow faster than sales.
We expect EPS to be enhanced by 4.3% as a result of the continuing distribution of surplus cash generation in the form of share buybacks.
So, at our central guidance EPS would grow by 1.4%.
Our central guidance for sales, profits and EPS is set out in the table below.
Central Full year estimate to January 2019 guidance Total full price sales versus 2017 18 1.0% Group profit before tax 705m Group profit before tax versus 2017 18 -2.9% 15 Earnings Per Share growth versus 2017 18 1.4% First quarter trading update Our first quarter trading statement will cover the fourteen weeks to 5 May 2018 and is scheduled for Thursday 10 May 2018.
This is one week later than originally planned in order to give a more meaningful comparison with last year due to the timing of the May Day Bank Holiday.
Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise Chief Executive 23 March 2018 15.
EPS growth is based on our latest forecast of the timing of share buybacks.
