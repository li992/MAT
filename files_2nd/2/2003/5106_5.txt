To maintain the rate of growth, particularly whilst dealing with a difficult operating environment, the undertaking of a major merger and a number of other significant challenges, and still keep the downward pressure on our unit costs, is testament to all of our staff and the corporate culture that they live and espouse.
It has not been an easy year for many of easyJets people and I am grateful to them for their continued professionalism and dedication to our values.
Our continued success is rooted in them and their ability to adapt, innovate and act, and we look forward to many more years of continued growth.
