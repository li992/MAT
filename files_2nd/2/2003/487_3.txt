4 FOODSERVICE GROUP ANNU AL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW Creating a strong international business centred on Aga and key foodservice product lines was the objective we set ourselves three years ago.
Our broadened product ranges and new routes to market show how much progress has been made.
Aga is our centre stage business.
Aga enjoyed another record year, importantly achieving our stated target of 10,000 sales in 2003, set in 2001 when sales were under 8,000.
The impetus has come from new products like the 3-oven model: the Six-Four conventional cooker and from increased sales outside the UK.
We have now set a new objective Project 15 of 15,000 sales worldwide by 2006.
An important driver of growth will be our new range of electric Aga products which ensure that wherever the customer lives we have a product to suit.
Rangemaster had an excellent year, highlighting the benefits of the radical business transformation undertaken in 2002 to focus on higher margin products.
Further, the current product range will support growth not just in the UK but also overseas.
In the US and in Europe we have already launched versions of the Rangemaster Elan.
In all our key consumer markets we are now looking to refrigeration to be an important product range.
The free-standing Aga and Falcon fridges built in the UK by Williams are establishing themselves.
Now the under-counter range of fridges from Marvel are to be available in the UK.
We are looking to make wine fridges and ice makers mainstream European products as they are in North America.
Taking AgaRayburn, Rangemaster and Northland-Marvels collective ranges highlights that the Group is becoming a major upscale appliance company with a powerful product offering, both in cookers and in refrigeration.

6 FOODSERVICE GROUP ANNU AL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 A factor, which sets us apart from many manufacturers, is our close links to the end consumer which our home fashion operations provide.
Fired Earth, Domain and Grange all feature Group products in showrooms creating room sets capturing the imagination of customers.
We now have some exceptional retail outlets the new Aga Fired Earth store at Darts Farm in Exeter: the Aga Grange store in the centre of Paris and the 15,000 square foot, Aga Domain store in Natick, Boston highlighting the exciting products the Group now has.
In 2003 our consumer businesses enjoyed a strong Two-oven year, led by record performances at Aga-Rayburn and electric Aga Rangemaster.
Turnover reached 204.6 million and The electric Aga provides an Aga for all operating profits before goodwill amortisation were available internationally.
Requires only a 18.1 million compared to 173.6 million and 17.2 13 amp plug to operate, no flue and no million respectively in 2002: increases of 17.8% and annual servicing.
In the year, UK growth was partially offset by a The beauty in simplicity and ease of use weak US performance.

Launched at losses of 0.5 million after marketing investments the start of 2004 it will quickly become a core product.
during the year and Domain saw profits fall by over 2 million from over 2.5 million.
This was caused by sales in like-for-like stores being down 7%, in line with the fall in the US furniture industry market.
In addition, we invested in 5 new Aga Domain stores which have now added nearly 30% of selling space to Domain but which during pre-opening and initial trading inherently do not contribute to profits.
Our optimism in the US for 2004 reflects the expected turnaround from Domain already written sales are well ahead of last year and the higher level of Aga sales through Domain and the total dealer structure.

It is the focus of Aga Foodservices international marketing programme.

8 FOODSERVICE GROUP ANNU AL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 The Falcon Infinity Fryer improves the cooking environment.
Fat content is significantly reduced as shown below.
In foodservice in Europe we have faced some difficult market conditions.
When key accounts are at low points in capital spending cycles, volumes and margins are obviously difficult to sustain.
The answer is to have a geographical and product spread that reduces exposure Competitor Infinity to any one customer or sector.
In addition, we are 15% seeing increased demand for new innovative product ranges which meet todays needs to reduce waste, 11% energy emissions and raise food quality.
These are products which respond to customer needs to 9% implement corporate social responsibility requirements and create pleasant, hygienic working environments 5.75% for staff.
2003 was a year in which a concerted effort was put into preparing such products to bring to the 1.15% 0.6% market and we will see the benefits of this effort in 2004 and the years ahead.
OIL POLLUTANTS Falcon, our prime cooking manufacturer, based in Total polar compounds Scotland, is now launching a new range of fryers that Polymers and oxidation products use Rayburn pre-mix burner technology.
We believe it Free fatty acids will revolutionise the fryer market.
In refrigeration our Glycol range, which uses an inert fluid to cool products more efficiently, uses less energy and has shorter pull down times.
Glycol is used in major industrial sites and we have taken it into mainstream commercial settings.
Williams Glycol Refrigeration Newly launched with a single compressor unit, Williams brings an industrial system to the commercial market the energy savings, greener refrigerant system, flexibility in installation and lower pull down times now at no additional capital cost, can make it a core international product.

10 FOODSERVICE GROUP ANNU AL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 In bakery we have a flexible bake-off concept, devised in Wales by Mono and now seen in Marks & Spencer, which will underpin our effort to expand, in particular, into the US neighbourhood bakery market.
Our plan to have all key products available in all markets has been a major objective and is now becoming a reality.
We have an e. catalogue providing data access and have worked to obtain necessary product approvals and to adapt products for individual markets.
2003 was a testing year because of the lack of demand in many areas notably in Europe.
We have worked hard during this time to improve underlying market positions by offering products supported by service.
During 2003 we won some important new business becoming sole equipment and service support supplier to Sainsburys and winning new work with Whitbread and Mitchell & Butlers.
On the Continent, bakery markets were patchy.
We responded by focusing the business: withdrawing from oil oven markets in Holland, rationalising the central management structure and raising manufacturing efficiencies.
While turnover actually fell, operating profits were ahead before reorganisation and discontinued costs.
The benefit of the actions taken at Bongard should be seen in an improved performance in 2004.
In North America we had a good year.
A major achievement in 2003 was to produce a new complete package of products sourced from five Group companies for one of our long held US customers.
In addition, we confirmed our status as the world leader in doughnut equipment, successfully introducing Thermoglaze which produces quality doughnuts from frozen.
In refrigeration we had a good year and with nearly $2 million now invested in new equipment, we are looking to raise output at lower unit costs.
Taken overall in foodservice, turnover of 185.7 million was up from 149.7 million and operating profits before goodwill amortisation were 14.3 million compared to 13.0 million: increases of 24.0% and 10.0% respectively.
Victory: Energy Star Victory has more refrigeration products that meet Energy Star standards than any other company.
The energy savings are substantial as Victory is highlighting in its current advertising.
