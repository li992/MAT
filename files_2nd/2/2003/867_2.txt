Chairman & Chief Executives review The strong results in 2003 reflect unwavering focus on our business fundamentals.
We continued to expand sales of our patented Medical Diagnostics products at an excellent rate, delivered stronger second half growth in Protein Separations following the slowdown seen in the first half of the year, moved Discovery Systems into profit, ahead of schedule, for the second half of 2003 and we delivered improved underlying margins for Amersham.
Since 1990, Amersham has produced an average annual earnings per share growth on a business performance basis at actual exchange rates of 17 per cent.
Our strategic focus on enabling personalised medicine has given our people a strong sense of purpose, and they have applied their skills successfully to provide our customers with a range of innovative products and technologies.
The creation of GE Healthcare will enable us to combine expertise in diagnostics, biology, engineering and informatics.
By focusing the scale, brand and competencies of the combined businesses on improved diagnosis, we will have an excellent opportunity to transform global healthcare ensuring a better quality of life for the individual and a more cost effective delivery for payers and providers.
With the deal now approaching its final phase, we would like to take this opportunity to personally thank our board of directors, executive team and, especially, all our employees at Amersham for their efforts and commitment, not only in producing this outstanding set of results, but also for their dedication to our long term goals.
Business Performance Sales were 1,652 million, up six per cent at constant exchange rates and excluding the impact of disposed businesses, with Amersham Health sales up seven per cent, Protein Separations sales up five per cent and Discovery Systems sales up two per cent.
All regions experienced positive sales momentum led by North America up by eight per cent.
Total R&D expenditure of 182 million 11 per cent of sales was as expected down four per cent, reflecting reduced expenditure in Discovery Systems as a result of the restructuring programme whilst maintaining growth in Amersham Health and Protein Separations.
Operating profit was 299 million, up 12 per cent and after reduced net interest expense of 5 million, profit before tax increased by 14 per cent to 294 million.
With the tax rate of 31.0 per cent for 2003 slightly lower than the 31.4 per cent reported in 2002 and a modest increase in the number of shares in issue, earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation increased by 13 per cent to 29.0p.
The board is recommending a dividend of 5.92p per share, giving a full-year dividend of 8.77p per share, up 12 per cent.
The results, as reported in sterling, are affected by movements in foreign exchange.
During 2003, the results were most notably impacted by the weakening of the US dollar with an overall adverse currency impact on profit before tax of 39 million.
Net cash flow from operating activities before exceptional items of 322 million was down from 346 million in 2002 affected by adverse foreign exchange movements.
Free cash flow was 100 million 2002 - 139 million after an increase in capital expenditure of 22 million primarily in expanding manufacturing capacity.
Net debt at the year end was 147 million, including a benefit of 20 million from movements in foreign exchange, compared to 182 million at 31 December 2002.

In 2003, sales increased by seven per cent to 973 million with Medical Diagnostics accounting for 924 million, up nine per cent.
Medical Diagnostics sales were driven by patented diagnostic products, which grew by 22 per cent to 412 million.
Sales of unpatented diagnostic products grew by 2 per cent to 357 million.
Sales of Visipaque and Omniscan each exceeded 100 million in 2003 bringing the number of products with more than 100 million in annual sales to four: the radiopharmaceutical heart diagnostic product Myoview 149 million, up 20 per cent, the second generation X-ray product Omnipaque 218 million, up two per cent, the magnetic resonance imaging MRI product Omniscan 106 million, up 12 per cent and the third generation X-ray product Visipaque 122 million, up 38 per cent.
Visipaque sales growth accelerated from the 18 per cent growth achieved in 2002.
Medical Diagnostics delivered improved underlying operating margins during the year partially compensating for lower margins in Therapy.
There has been significant progress in 2003 in advancing the development of the R&D portfolio, particularly in Japan where the submission of Fluordeoxyglucose FDG was achieved on schedule in December.
Patient recruitment to support all clinical trial programmes reached an all time high in the last quarter of 2003 and reflects both the late stage of the development portfolio and the drive within the business for greater efficiency in programme management.

Protein Separations Protein Separations is the market leader in chromatographic systems for the purification of proteins from laboratory to manufacturing scale.
In 2003 sales were 295 million, up five per cent, and operating profit was up nine per cent to 106 million.
Following the 3% sales growth reported at the half year, sales accelerated in the second half driven by 14 per cent growth in laboratory separations and operating margins improved driven by changes in the product mix.
Overall sales growth was impacted by the slowdown in antisense product development with sales of speciality products declining 18 per cent after a strong performance in 2002.
R&D expenditure increased by 18 per cent accelerating the development of a number of new products targeting the research customer base, which are expected to reach the market in 2004 and 2005 including AKTAxpress for automated multi-step high-throughput protein purification and AKTAxflow, a system designed to harness the dual capabilities of chromatographic and membrane separations.
In bioprocessing, following the successful launch of MabSelect, Amersham is preparing to launch a second generation affinity resin for purification of monoclonal antibodies.
The technology behind this new product allows customers to reduce costs associated with their manufacturing processes.
Discovery Systems Discovery Systems is a leading global provider of products and services used in disease research, drug discovery and drug development.
Sales in 2003 grew two per cent to 384 million, with an operating loss of 9 million compared with 32 million in 2002.
5 The business achieved profitability in the second half following a successful realignment of the cost base by reducing R&D and manufacturing costs and refocusing the business portfolio on areas where there is strong long term growth potential and where Amersham has existing market leadership.
Restructuring cost savings in 2003 amounted to more than 20 million with revised expectations of annual savings running at the rate of more than 40 million by the end of 2004.
Sales continued to grow during the restructuring.
The areas of strategic focus, including cellular assays, protein analysis and microarrays Codelink showed good growth with sales up 14 per cent.
In these areas a number of new products were launched during the year, including the IN Cell Analyzer 1000, a high-throughput sub-cellular imaging system and new DIGE dyes, sample preparation products and software for protein analysis.
Management Peter Loescher was appointed Chief Operating Officer, effective 1 January 2004.
