02: Chairmans and Chief Executives Statement As shareholders will be aware, the weakness in the share price of Canary Wharf Group plc a few months ago prompted approaches from parties interested in acquiring the company.
At that stage an Independent Committee of the Board was formed to evaluate these potential offers.
I agreed to be Chairman of the committee, which includes all my non-executive colleagues on the board.
During the summer the potential offerors have undertaken extensive due diligence.
We are now actively involved in the process of reviewing indicative proposals which we have received in order to determine if any of these can be developed into an offer suitable for recommendation to shareholders.
The companys management have supported the committee through the provision of information as and when required by us, and I am grateful to them for this.
Meanwhile, in spite of the considerable distractions whilst the company has been in an offer period, the management have continued to focus their efforts on maximising the value of the ongoing business.
More detail of the progress achieved is contained in the Chairmans and Chief Executives Statement.
SIR MARTIN JACOMB Chairman Independent Committee of the Board Introduction During the last year the UK property sector has operated in a difficult market environment.
However, we are now beginning to see signs of recovery in demand for office space.
It is not clear whether we have reached the bottom of the market, but from the level of enquiries we are experiencing we would not expect the current market downturn to be sustained for much longer.
There is, nevertheless, still a significant amount of space available in the London office market where oversupply, both of new and existing space, has widened tenant choice and driven rental values downwards.
This has had a clear impact on rental levels and increased tenant inducements.
Our recent experience, however, also shows that several tenants in the market for larger amounts of space are all looking at the same newly developed buildings.
As these new buildings are committed in the City and Canary Wharf, we would anticipate next year the beginning of a tightening in the market for the new, highly specified, large floorplate office space we offer.
We do not, however, foresee an immediate return to new development at Canary Wharf except on a fully pre-let or bespoke basis.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :03 Over the last 12 months we have made excellent progress on the completion of our current construction programme.
As the initial phases of development near completion it is an appropriate point at which to consider the disposal of selected buildings or interests in selected buildings.
Although our internal cash resources are sufficient for ongoing operations, such disposals would enable us to reduce leverage and to consider continuing our return of capital programme whilst also maintaining the integrity of the estate.
Financial Review Turnover increased from 206.8 million in 2002 to 250.3 million in 2003 a 21% increase.
Excluding exceptional items, the group recorded a loss before tax for the year ended 30 June 2003 of 13.3 million, compared to a profit of 22.6 million for 2002.
Interest costs increased from 107.6 million to 178.5 million as a result of the two securitisations completed in February and October 2002 and the refinancing of 20 Canada Square in March 2003.
These planned issues increased total debt from 3,950 million to 4,710 million and were used in part to fund the share buy-back programme 108.1 million in the year and special dividend 372.8 million paid in November 2002 which together with past buy-backs have resulted to date in a total return of capital of 887 million.
Net assets during the year fell by 340.9 million from 1,860.3 million at 30 June 2002 to 1,519.4 million at 30 June 2003.
The reduction from the share buy-backs and special dividend of 64.27p per share in total 480.9 million was offset by a revaluation of five group investment properties completed in the year to 30 June 2003 an increase of 415.4 million less a reduction of 263.6 million in the valuation of investment properties held during the year.
This latter figure represents a decline of 8%.
The adjusted net asset value basis revalues properties under construction and those held for development to their Market Value and adds back the adjustments in respect of lease incentives required by UITF 28 and deferred tax required by FRS 19.
Based on Market Value, the adjusted net asset value per share reduced from 5.10 per share at 30 June 2002 to 3.44 per share at 30 June 2003 before dilution, a reduction of 1.66 per share.
This reduction in part reflects the share buy-back and the special dividend of 64.27p per share and in part the reduction in the market value of the total portfolio totalling 553.8 million in the year, or 8.7% disregarding additions, equivalent to 0.95 per share based on the closing number of shares.
At 31 December 2002 net assets per share on the Market Value basis were 3.70 per share and the reduction of 0.26 per share to 30 June 2003 was primarily attributable to a reduction in the Market Value of the portfolio of 126.2 million or 0.22 per share.
In July 2003, 10 Upper Bank Street HQ5 reached practical completion and Clifford Chance gave notice to vacate its offices in Aldersgate Street on 29 September 2003.
In accordance with UK GAAP the group has recognised a provision of 123.5 million in respect of the estimated liability in respect of the Aldersgate leases which were taken over in connection with Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 04: Chairmans and Chief Executives Statement the letting of HQ5.
In addition, a provision of 27.3 million has also been recognised in respect of certain incentives payable to Lehman Brothers in respect of their lease of 25-30 Bank Street following the achievement of base building practical completion which removed any conditionality to these payments.
Further detail on the basis of these provisions is set out in Note 18 of the financial statements.
Capital Structure In October 2002 the group completed a 510 million tap issue taking the total securitised debt issued by Canary Wharf Finance II plc to 3,117 million.
Part of the proceeds of this tap issue were used to fund payment of the special dividend of 372.8 million.
In December 2002 the group entered into a loan facility secured on 1 Churchill Place BP1 which enables the group to draw up to 605 million once the property has reached practical completion, scheduled for July 2004, and the related construction financing has been repaid.
Subsequently, in March 2003, the group entered into a 225 million facility secured on 20 Canada Square which was used to refinance the 82 million of construction financing on this building with the balance being retained for general corporate purposes.
As a result of the completion of these facilities, permanent financing in excess of that required to complete all buildings presently under construction has been put in place.
Construction Our construction programme has continued to progress on schedule and during the year five buildings totalling 2.4 million sq ft were completed.
In September 2002 we opened a new retail building, the 203,000 sq ft extension to the Canada Place Mall.
In October 2002, we completed the 515,000 sq ft building at 5 Canada Square.
This building is let in its entirety to CSFB but 250,000 sq ft was subsequently sub-let by CSFB to Bank of America whose fit-out is now nearing completion.
In January 2003 we reached practical completion of 20 Canada Square in which The McGraw Hill Companies have leased 266,200 sq ft and British Petroleum have agreed Heads of Terms for a letting of 128,000 sq ft for its Integrated Supply and Trading division.
In March 2003 we reached practical completion of 40 Bank Street, a 607,000 sq ft building of which 78,300 sq ft has been leased to Allen & Overy and 133,000 sq ft to Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom Skadden.
In May 2003, 20 Bank Street was completed, a 546,500 sq ft building let to Morgan Stanley.
Subsequent to the year end completion was achieved of 10 Upper Bank Street, a 1 million sq ft building which has been let to Clifford Chance who have already taken up occupation.
Base building works practical completion was also achieved on 25-30 Bank Street, the 1.02 million sq ft building let to Lehman Brothers.
Fit-out of the building is expected to be substantially completed in October 2003.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :05 The final building currently under construction is Barclays 1 million sq ft headquarters building at 1 Churchill Place which will complete in mid 2004 along with 24,000 sq ft of retail space at Cartier Circle.
When completed the Barclays building will bring the completed Canary Wharf estate to a total of 14.1 million sq ft of which the group will own 11.6 million sq ft.
In the past, as we completed individual buildings we have been shifting key development and construction personnel to new projects.
Whilst we shall retain our core group of key personnel to enable us to respond to development opportunities as they arise, the process of scaling down these teams and their administrative support to reflect the reducing development and construction programme has begun.
Leasing It is hard to judge the turning point of the cycle but a number of indicators now point to an improving prospect for financial and business services employment.
Although there are many competitive schemes aggregating more than 5 million sq ft due for delivery in the next 12 months we can anticipate a rapid fall off in supply of new space thereafter given the very low level of building starts in the past 12 months.
Throughout the downturn there has been continuing demand for major office buildings in Central London but from fewer companies.
Canary Wharf has been on the shortlist for most of these enquiries, a number of which are now reaching a successful conclusion.
One example is our recent announcement that we have agreed Heads of Terms with British Petroleums Integrated Supply and Trading division.
Another is the announcement on 23 September 2003 that from Spring 2005 Reuters will lease the entire 281,000 sq ft building at 30 The South Colonnade following the departure of London Underground Limited LUL in 2004.
We are also able to announce agreed Heads of Terms with Goldenberg, Hehmeyer & Co Limited Goldenberg Hehmeyer for the leasing of 18,000 sq ft on a single floor at 50 Bank Street, and with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency EMEA for a further 13,500 sq ft at 7 Westferry Circus taking their total occupation in the building to just over 116,000 sq ft.
These transactions confirm that we have the space to meet a variety of client needs and also indicate our ability to structure deals to meet the specific requirements of clients.
The group currently has completed investment properties of approximately 1.0 million sq ft available to let which equates to a vacancy rate of 10.4%.
This could rise to 1.9 million sq ft by the end of 2004 following the exercise of LULs lease break and assuming all remaining options to sublet space back to the group are exercised.
This total will be reduced by the recent letting announcements which will serve to reduce the space potentially available by 440,000 sq ft, together with any additional space which may be let during the period to the end of 2004.
Taking into account the recent announcements, the maximum vacancy rate in respect of space in the groups ownership would be 12.5% in 2004.
In addition, certain tenants at present are openly marketing some 640,000 sq ft of available space.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 06: Chairmans and Chief Executives Statement In addition to office lettings our highly successful retail offering continues to expand.
In September 2002 we opened a new retail building, the 203,300 sq ft extension to the Canada Place mall anchored by Waitrose.
Weekend trading on the estate increased markedly as a result.
This was followed on 18 September 2003 by the opening of the new 89,900 sq ft Jubilee Place Mall.
Marks & Spencer anchors the 38 unit mall and we have added a wide variety of new fashion shops including Molton Brown, L K Bennett, Karen Millen, Reiss, Choice and Whistles.
New restaurants to Canary Wharf include Wagamama, Fratelli deli caf, Tootsies, Pashmina, Port of Call and Caff Nero.
Jubilee Place Mall expands the total retail complex to 550,000 sq ft. Transport In June 2003 the company and LUL announced that they had reached agreement on future improvements to, and upgrading of, the Jubilee Line.
Under the terms of this agreement, LUL and Canary Wharf have agreed that, in satisfaction of rebates totalling 94.6m due to Canary Wharf in respect of its funding contribution to the Jubilee Line extension LUL will provide a programme of capacity enhancements.
These include the introduction of a 2-hour single direction peak period timetable west to east in the morning and east to west in the evening of 24 trains per hour in October 2003 several months ahead of schedule, seven car trains providing an increase in train capacity of 17% by July 2006 and new signalling and train control systems which will enable a peak hour service of up to 30 trains per hour by December 2009.
These improvements will provide an overall increase of up to 45% over the existing service capacity at Canary Wharf station.
LUL will open the eastern entrances to Canary Wharf station in June 2004.
Direct access to Jubilee Place retail will be linked to the Jubilee Line station by February 2004.
We continue to work with Cross London Rail Ltd CLRL and other stakeholders in promoting the case for Crossrail which is critical to maintaining Londons competitiveness by adding transport capacity between its main commercial districts Canary Wharf, the City and the West End to both Heathrow, in the west, and housing capacity in the Thames Gateway in the east.
In July 2003 the Secretary of State for Transport issued a House of Commons written statement which confirmed the Governments support for Crossrail.
The statement confirmed that a station at Canary Wharf was an integral part of Crossrail.
CLRLs objective is for a Hybrid Bill to be lodged in November 2004 with a target date of opening the link in 2012.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :07 Planning In March 2003 the group lodged planning applications for two separate developments at Canary Riverside and North Quay.
Both applications are being considered by London Borough of Tower Hamlets.
Canary Riverside consists of three linked commercial buildings totalling 1.8 million sq ft of which 60,000 sq ft comprises supporting retail premises.
North Quay again consists of three linked commercial buildings totalling 2.4 million sq ft of which a further 55,000 sq ft is supporting retail.
These applications reflect the groups confidence in the medium to long term future of this area which is recognised both by National and Local Government as a key component for Londons future growth aspirations.
This work will allow the group to respond to future market demand.
Staff We and the board appreciate that the last 12 months have been a particularly difficult and pressured period for all our employees.
The board would like to thank the entire staff for their hard work and their continuing contribution to the success of Canary Wharf.
