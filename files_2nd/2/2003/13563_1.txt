Chief Executives review Sir John Rose I am pleased to be able to report, for the third year in succession, financial results that are in line with our guidance, demonstrating the strength of our business model and our ability to respond effectively to challenges.
The period since the tragic events of September 11, 2001 has been one of great challenge for our Group, and particularly for the civil aerospace sector.
The initial impact of those events was subsequently exacerbated by the Iraq war and the outbreak of the SARS virus during the first half of 2003.
However, two key components have enabled us to achieve this years successful outcome: first, a strong business model based on a consistent strategy of providing power systems and support for four global markets with a common technology focused mainly on the gas turbine and, second, committed people throughout the Group who understand our objectives, are focused on our customers and are prepared to support the changes necessary to enable us to be competitive.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees for their dedication and commitment.
We have built a well-balanced business, with revenues evenly divided between original equipment sales and high value-added aftermarket services.
This balance has reduced our exposure to a downturn in any particular sector.
As a result we have been able to mitigate the impact of the continuing recession in civil aerospace, which saw a further 13 per cent fall in civil engine deliveries in 2003.
Civil engine deliveries have nearly halved from a peak of 1,362 in 2001, and now account for approximately 20 per cent of our total sales.
The successful implementation of our services strategy has resulted in ten per cent compound annual growth in aftermarket revenue over the past five years.
In 2003 this revenue amounted to 2.8 billion, or 50 per cent of our sales.
It represents a reasonably predictable and growing source of revenue based on an increasing number of long-term, contractual relationships with our customers.
Further visibility is provided by our order book which, despite the difficult market conditions, grew to a record year-end level of 17.4 billion, with a further 1.3 billion of business announced but not yet under contract.
The pension fund deficit has been an area of considerable uncertainty.
We were able to contain the cost of additional funding in line with the guidance we provided in 2002 with a combination of changes to the benefit structure and a 35 million annual increase in contributions from the Group.
This ensures that we can continue to offer an affordable and attractive dened benefit pension scheme.
Over recent months the US dollar has weakened signicantly relative to sterling.
The nature of our activities means that the Group has always had an exposure to the dollar exchange rate.
We have therefore pursued a consistent strategy of hedging dollar revenues and this has operated successfully for more than 15 years, including periods where the exchange rate has been above two dollars to the pound.
During this period we have maintained an achieved rate within a range of ten cents, while the spot rate has moved in a range of 63 cents.
We currently have approximately US$10 billion of forward cover at rates which will enable us to achieve a stable rate over the next four years.
We have completed the major rationalisation programme announced in October 2001.
At the year-end we employed 35,200 people, a net reduction of 2,100 during the year and a reduction of 8,300, or 19 per cent, since the programme was announced.
In addition there has been a reduction of 1,000 contract jobs.

2000 14.5 We will continue to focus on operational excellence, including rationalisation 1999 13.2 of our facilities, improvement of manufacturing processes, supply chain restructuring and lead-time reduction in order to increase productivity and reduce product and operating costs.
Costs associated with these activities will be included within underlying earnings.
We have become a truly international business with customers in more than Group turnover m 150 countries.
We have facilities in 48 countries: 40 per cent of employees are 2003 5,645 based outside the UK, representing 40 nationalities.

Following a decade of high investment in new product development, the market requirement for new products is now slowing down.
Technology acquisition, as well as supporting new product development, will increasingly focus on the development of derivative products, unit cost reduction, improvement of in-service operation Total aftermarket sales inc. joint ventures m and extending the scope and value of our service capabilities.
2003 3,406 Operational excellence 2002 3,046 We continue to manage our operational and unit costs effectively.
Over the 2001 2,918 past two years, despite a 45 per cent reduction in civil engine deliveries, we 2000 2,553 have maintained a healthy balance sheet and produced a creditable operating 1999 2,093 performance.
In 2003 we accelerated the implementation of our improvement initiatives and continued to focus on reducing both operating and product unit costs.
We will benefit from the lower cost base as workload recovers.
Rolls-Royce makes a positive contribution to sustainability.
This is achieved through our products, employment and wealth creation, training and Free cash ow m development of our employees, technological development, work with 2003 378 communities and through our large and complex global supply chain.

2001 161 Development of aftermarket services 2000 125 The Groups installed base of 54,000 engines in service has created a substantial 1999 90 aftermarket opportunity.
The development of innovative, long-term service agreements, such as TotalCare in the civil sector and Mission Ready Management Solutions in the military sector increases this opportunity.
It expands the scope of services from traditional support such as spare partssupply and repair and overhaul, to enhanced services such as engine health monitoring and Underlying profit before tax m predictive maintenance.
Our unique knowledge of our products and 2003 285 proprietary technology creates a competitive advantage in the provision of these services and enables us to add significant value for our customers.

Ever since Henry Royce and the Hon C S Rolls met in 1904, engineering excellence and innovation have 1999 368 been central to the company.
As it has throughout our history, our success depends upon maintaining our technology base and recruiting the best people.
Today, we have structured technology programmes in place covering the next five, ten and 20 years of our development and need to ensure that we continue to have access to the people who will drive these programmes.
In order to celebrate our centenary, we are launching a major new initiative called the Rolls-Royce Science Prize.
Its aim is to recognise and reward excellence in science teaching practice in our schools and to encourage an interest in science that will, we hope, ensure that we have access to the future scientists that will 6Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual Report 2003 Chief Executives review continued Sir John Rose enable our success.
The initiative will be UK based initially, but the intention in the Underlying pre-tax return on years ahead is to implement it in other countries where we operate.
