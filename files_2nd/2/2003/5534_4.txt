Chief Executives Review Results The year to 30 September 2003 has seen Enterprise Inns plc Enterprise consolidate its position as the leading operator of leased and tenanted pubs in the UK.
Total operating profit before exceptional items has increased by 44% to 293.2 million, driven by like-for-like growth of 8% in the core estate and further enhanced by the effective integration of the Laurel acquisition made in 2002.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 23% to 72.3 pence.

Although it is impossible to calculate how much has been invested in our outlets by licensees themselves, we estimate that, in the past year, this figure has been in excess of 40 million.
This combined expenditure is proving to be highly effective and has both helped maintain and improve the condition of our pubs, at the same time increasing average operating profit per pub to 49,300.

Some pubs were, however, just too good to miss and we purchased 34 top quality outlets for 16 million.
These pubs are already achieving an average income return on investment in excess of 13%.
Our commitment to improving the overall quality of the estate has, however, seen aggressive pruning of underperforming and high value alternative use outlets, with a total of 213 pubs and surplus land sold for net proceeds of 41 million.
This disposal programme included the 60 pubs sold in order to comply with the undertakings we gave to the Office of Fair Trading following our acquisition of the Laurel estate in 2002.
Reflecting our commitment, alongside licensees, to invest in and improve the quality of our pubs, it is no surprise that the independent valuation carried out by Humberts Leisure shows once again a substantial increase in the underlying value of our estate.
At 30 September 2003, the estate comprised 5,087 pubs throughout the UK valued at 2.5 billion, including a current year revaluation surplus of 283 million.
The average value per outlet increased by 16% during the year to 490,000.
The valuation excludes any lotting premium which, we are advised by our independent valuers, would be in the region of 10%.
Leases and tenancies Before the Beer Orders in 1989, 30,700 leased and tenanted pubs were in the hands of the national, regional and family brewers.
Tenancies in those days were characterised by strong ties to the brewery owner, with the inevitable restriction of consumer choice.
The decline of brewery ownership and the development of pub companies over the past decade has resulted in many benefits for licensees and consumers alike.
Enterprise Inns Annual Report 2003 5 000 Chief Executives Review A low cost business opportunity A lease or tenancy represents a low-cost opportunity for entrepreneurial licensees to run their own businesses.
Not only is the initial cost of entry substantially lower than buying a free house, but the ongoing costs of ownership are very fair.
The average Enterprise rent, net of discounts given, of 22,750 represents a rental cost of just 4.6% against the average value of the pubs in our estate.
It is of course the case that a true free house operator not necessarily one tied by loans to a particular brewer could purchase beer and cider in the open market at prices less than those charged by Enterprise.
However, even allowing for an estimate of the market discount forgone, the total deemed rental cost to the licensee is still just 36,000, or 7.3% of freehold value.
Recognising the vital importance of attracting good quality licensees, Enterprise has led the way in developing a range of user-friendly agreements, abandoning the unrealistic requirements of privity of contract and upwards-only rent reviews.
Our Retailers in Partnership philosophy in our dealings with licensees recognises and promotes co-operation, respect and the pursuit of mutual profitability.
We are pleased to report that we currently have more than 800 fully funded and screened applicants on our database, looking to take a pub with Enterprise.
This record figure is more than three times the number of pubs we have available for let and reflects the attractive business opportunity that taking a pub lease represents, especially with Enterprise.
Consumer choice As major wholesalers and distributors of beer and other wet products, we are able to secure for our licensees a wide range of products, including some 380 beers and 35 ciders.
Cask ale now represents 14% of our total beer sales, against a declining national average of around 8%.
Working closely with our supplying brewers, we now offer our licensees an unrivalled choice of more than 110 cask ale brands available on a permanent basis from 47 brewers, and a further 120 guest cask ales which are made available at different times throughout the year, supplied predominantly from small and regional breweries.
It is worthy of note that in the 837 former Scottish & Newcastle and Whitbread managed houses which we purchased in May 2001, we have facilitated the introduction of cask ales supplied by small and regional breweries.
These cask ales have now grown to represent 13% of total ale sales in these estates.
Whilst this commitment to a wide range of products reduces the average level of wholesale margin that we can achieve across our estate, we consider that this is a worthwhile investment in the long-term quality and potential of our pubs.
Licensee profitability Following some high profile failures in the branded managed house sector, most notably in high street locations, questions are sometimes raised about the profitability of pubs in general and tenants and lessees in particular.
Whilst Enterprise does not have direct access to the detailed financial statements of individual licensees, we have been able to analyse the theoretical fair maintainable trade profit and loss accounts which are produced for each pub, providing the basis for business development reviews and rental negotiations.
These have been independently verified by professional valuers.
The results are encouraging, showing that the average individual Enterprise licensee is likely to be earning a profit before tax of around 37,000, including an allowance of 8,000 for free living accommodation and essential amenities.
Just 167 pubs in our estate have earnings potential of less than 15,000 and the majority of these outlets are on our list of planned disposals.
However, 165 licensees are likely to be earning in excess of 75,000 per year and, most encouragingly, 63% of our outlets have potential earnings of more than 30,000 per annum.

There will of course be some licensees who are falling short of their own expectations and there are without doubt some pubs which are massively overperforming thanks to the excellence of their licensees.
Statistically, we can take comfort from certain key performance indicators: Almost 93% of our pubs are let on substantive leases and tenancies.
Bad debt costs for the year were just 0.3% of sales turnover, down from 0.4% last year.
Rent concessions given at 30 September 2003 amounted to just 650,000, only 0.5% of the rent-roll and down from 775,000 at the same time last year.
Over the past year we have completed 718 rent reviews, with just two going through any form of independent arbitration process before being agreed.
Dilapidations claims issued to departing licensees amounted to below 1.0 million during the year, with 80% of the remedial work being completed by the licensees themselves, confirming that our licensees are able to comply with their repairing obligations and keep the pubs in good order.
Hence we believe that our existing lease and tenancy terms are fair and provide significant opportunities for good quality licensees to develop and grow profitable businesses.
Unique Pub Company In March 2002, working alongside a consortium of venture capitalists, we created a special purpose vehicle to acquire the Unique and Voyager estates of some 4,200 pubs.
In September 2002, the Unique and Voyager estates were combined into The Unique Pub Company and the level of securitised debt in the combined business was increased to 1.80 billion, with a further issue of up to 170 million approved in principle by the bondholders.
During the year to 30 September 2003, Unique continued to perform in line with expectations, achieving an operating profit before exceptional items approaching 230 million.
The entire Voyager estate has now been converted from managed houses to some form of lease or tenancy agreement and at 30 September 2003 over 95% of the combined estate of 4,056 outlets has been let on long-term substantive agreements.
Enterprise Inns Annual Report 2003 7 No.
of pubs Chief Executives Review Despite spending some 28 million on capital improvements to the pub estate, Unique was able during the year to increase cash reserves by 26.7 million and repay 61.8 million of securitised bonds, where repayments are currently 52.6 million ahead of schedule.
The balance of securitised debt at 30 September 2003 stands at 1.74 billion and the company believes that it is on track to meet the criteria that will allow the further issue of up to 170 million of bonds during 2004.
Enterprise has a fixed price call option to acquire, from the venture capital consortium, the balance of 83.2% of the equity that Enterprise does not already own.
This option may be exercised at any time between January and November 2004 at a price which is fixed at 608 million up to 31 March 2004 and which increases slightly over time thereafter.
Following a year of strong cash generation both within Enterprise and Unique, further helped by successful bond issues, our discussions with several major banks have indicated that, should we decide to exercise the option during 2004 and subject to market conditions remaining favourable, it may well be possible to raise the funds required without recourse to the equity market.
Legislative background The licensed trade is faced with some uncertainty as the new Licensing Act 2003 becomes a reality during 2004 5.
On balance, this change in legislation offers a tremendous opportunity for well-run pubs in the hands of responsible licensees to improve the profitability and potential of their businesses.
With law and order high on the Governments agenda and binge drinking in the headlines, there should be no place in the industry for irresponsible low pricing and promotions.
This is the time when the pub industry must demonstrate that a well-run pub represents a controlled environment able to promote responsible, sociable drinking, more often than not accompanied by great food and entertainment.
Equally, the pub industry must take the lead with the issue of smoking.
Self-regulated, with proper provision for smokers and non-smokers alike, plus effective protection for members of staff, there should be no need for a total ban on smoking in public places which would be as unwelcome as it would be unnecessary.
I am pleased that in all of these key areas the industry, acting through its trade associations, is proactively working with Government to try and ensure that sensible conclusions are reached.
Conclusion This has been another successful year for Enterprise, consolidating the high quality acquisitions that we have made in previous years and demonstrating our ability, alongside our licensees, to grow earnings in a highly competitive and regulated market.
The key to future success lies in the quality of our pub estate and the profitability of our licensees.
In this regard, we have demonstrated during the year not only that the quality and value of our pub estate has continued to grow but also that the vast majority of our licensees are able to make good returns for their efforts and investment.
The head office and field-based teams at Enterprise continue to perform above expectations, enthusiastically taking on leading edge technology across the whole business, enabling us to achieve our goal of providing top quality support to our pub estate in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.
We have again demonstrated our ability to deliver increasing returns to shareholders through appropriate operating disciplines and steady growth in the core business, enhanced by the effective use of the strong cash flows that the business generates.
The new financial year has started well and the team looks forward with confidence to another exciting year of continued success and long-term growth in returns for shareholders.
