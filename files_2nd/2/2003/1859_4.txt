IN THE CHALLENGING WORLD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE LAST THREE YEARS, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO KEEP OUR BUSINESSES STRONG BY CONCENTRATING ON THREE AREAS: 1 KEEPING OUR RETURNS HIGH BY WORKING ON PRODUCTIVITY AND CONTROL OF CAPITAL: 2 GROWING OUR TOP LINE THROUGH BUSINESS WINS AND MARKET SHARE GAINS AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS: 3 MAXIMISING CASH FLOWS.
04 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2003 By applying these principles in 2002 we were able to report good progress for that year double-digit earnings growth, strengthened margins and free cash flow of 79 million.
As we entered 2003, with the build up to conflict in the Middle East, a deferral of business and sharp increases in raw material and oil prices, we knew it was going to be a difficult first half.
And so it was, albeit we still showed underlying pre-tax profits of 61 million and free cash flows of 28 million.
We also indicated that, in the absence of any further major external factors, we expected to see a good recovery in the second half of the year.
And so I am pleased to report that this was the case.
In the second half we generated underlying pre-tax profits of 69 million and free cash flows of 59 million.
Our ability to generate strong cash flows is very important to us.
In the last two years we have delivered 166 million of free cash flow.
We can use this cash to grow our Group and to increase our earnings.
For example, in 2003 we spent 51 million on bolt-on acquisitions which, in a full year, should contribute another 75 million of revenues with operating margins of around 12 per cent.
We also initiated an earnings-enhancing share buyback programme in the first half of 2003 where we bought back 21.5 million shares 5 per cent of total issued share capital at an average price of 2.07 per share for a total cost of 45 million.
During the year we also moved forward on a number of important initiatives to win new business and gain market share which I will cover in more detail later in this report.
After the restructuring seen in the last two years, our management and board structure have been stable during 2003 and we have put together a team of people who understand our common goals and business strategy.
