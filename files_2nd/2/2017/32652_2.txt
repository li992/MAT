Strategic Report Chief Executives Review Overview 3 NEXT Brand total sales were level with last year, full price sales were down -1.3%.
Directory has performed better than Retail as customers continue to shop more online.
In addition, Directory benefited from improved stock availability, enhanced website functionality and the continued growth of LABEL and Directory overseas.
Profit before tax was down -3.8%.
Underlying Earnings Per Share EPS were down only -0.3% as a result of share buybacks during the year.
We are proposing a final ordinary dividend of 105p per share, making 158p in total for the year, which is in line with last year.
In order to give a clear picture of the underlying performance of the business, the figures above and throughout this report are shown on a 52 week versus 52 week basis unless stated otherwise.
Full price sales are VAT exclusive sales, excluding items sold in our mid-season or end-of-season Sale events and our Clearance operations.
They include interest income relating to those sales.
co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Objectives for the year ahead The year ahead looks set to be another tough year for NEXT.
We remain clear on our priorities going forward.
We will continue to focus on improving the Companys product, marketing, services, stores and cost control.
The Companys main operational objectives are set out in the table below.
They remain broadly unchanged from those set out last year.
Develop the NEXT brand Continue to develop our buying and design capabilities: delivering better design, improved quality and quicker response to new trends whilst also re-building some of our heartland business see page 6.
Upgrade Directory Continue to build on the improvements we have made to the Directory in the previous year.
Development will focus on improving our website functionality, website look and feel, personalisation, our credit offer and the way we promote it, our online marketing capabilities and our delivery services see page 16.
Invest in online growth businesses Continue to develop NEXT overseas through investment in our website, in particular the roll out of our overseas mobile site.
Continue to develop LABEL through the addition of new key brands, particularly through Lipsy & Co.
Invest in profitable new space Open profitable new retail space, maintaining the Companys payback and profitability hurdles of 15% net store profit before central overheads and payback on net capital invested in 24 months see pages 8 to 10.
Control costs Control costs through constantly innovating and developing more efficient ways of operating.
This must be done without detracting from the quality of our products and services.
co. uk 5 slugline Strategic Report Focus on product Our ranges continue to be at the heart of everything we do.
In our half-year report in September 2016, we explained how we were adapting our buying processes to increase the speed with which we react to new trends.
We have made a great deal of progress in this area.
Our buying teams are now developing new products and making buying decisions faster, taking products from concept to shop floor in much shorter timescales.
In many cases we have reduced the product development times by three months.
These gains can be even greater where our buyers have pre-ordered fabric and have it available to use at the time they order an item.
Where we have used these new buying techniques they have proved successful.
The items shown below were some of our best-selling lines in the run up to Christmas and were all developed rapidly using new buying and merchandise practices.
However, in focussing so much energy on changing our buying culture, processes and adopting exciting new trends, we have omitted some of our best-selling, heartland product from our ranges.
These are the easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes and great prices across several colours.
We identified this issue in January.
Corrective action is relatively straightforward and began in late January.
We believe that some of these changes will begin to be reflected in our Summer ranges from May onwards, but we will not have our ranges where we want them until the Autumn season September onwards.
Going forward we will continue to build on what we have learnt about the rapid development of new products and the delivery of new trends, with the proviso that those trends must be delivered in a way that all our customers can easily buy into.
In re-balancing our ranges, we must be careful not to become overly conservative and throw away the excellent progress we have made in moving our buying processes forward.
co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information NEXT Retail Retail sales and profit analysis Total NEXT Retail sales reduced by -2.9% and full price sales were down -4.6%.
Profit reduced by -15.8%, as shown in the table below.

The table below sets out significant Retail margin movements by major heads of costs.
Net operating margin on total sales last year 16.9% Bought-in gross margin Over-achievement against target margin, mainly as a result of lower freight 0.1% costs.
Markdown Stock for Sale was up 17% on last year whilst markdown sales were up 13%.
-1.0% 4 The increase in stock for sale eroded margin by -0.7% and lower cash recovery reduced margin by -0.3%.
Store payroll Increased rates of pay would have reduced margin by -0.5%.
However, this 0.0% adverse effect was offset by productivity initiatives in store.
5 Store occupancy Negative like-for-like sales increased fixed costs as a percentage of sales.
Warehouse & distribution Margins were eroded for three reasons.
1 we incurred start-up costs for -0.3% our new automated furniture warehouse, 2 negative total sales meant that fixed costs increased as a percentage of sales and 3 wage inflation reduced productivity.
Central overheads Central overheads reduced, mainly due to lower management incentives.
0.1% Net operating margin on total sales this year 14.7% Based on our central guidance for the year ahead we expect Retail margins in 2017 18 to reduce to around 12%, mainly as a result of lower like-for-like sales.
Cash recovery is the cash generated from markdown sales expressed as a percentage of the full price value of the stock going into the Sale.
Growth in sales from stores which have been open for at least one year.
co. uk 7 slugline Strategic Report Retail space expansion Net trading space increased by 330,000 square feet this year, taking our portfolio to 8.0m square feet.
Store numbers remained broadly the same, with the increase in new space being offset by the closure of smaller, less profitable stores.
The table below sets out the change in store numbers and space for the full year.
ft. numbers 000 January 2016 540 7,648 New stores, including 17 re-sites 27 608 Closures, including 20 re-sites -29 -327 Extensions 9 49 January 2017 538 7,978 4.3% The profitability of the portfolio of stores opened or extended in the last 12 months is forecast to be 23% of VAT inclusive sales and payback on the net capital invested is expected to be 24 months.
Both measures meet our Company investment hurdles of 15% profitability and 24 months payback.
Looking at the new projects in the year ahead, we estimate we will add 150,000 net square feet and a further 250,000 square feet in the following year.
This estimate is only a rough guide at this stage and much will depend on the lease terms we are able to achieve and required planning permissions.
It is worth reiterating that, as we outlined in our Analysts presentation in September 2016, the new stores are significantly cheaper than the current portfolio, both in terms of rent per square foot and rent to sales ratio.
The table below sets out the rent ratios of our existing stores and the equivalent figures for the new space opening in the year.

co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Retail store profitability As a result of the active management of our store portfolio, the vast majority of our stores make a healthy profit, with 97% 6 of our space delivering a net branch profit of more than 10%.
The left hand table below sets out the percentage of our turnover within stores of different levels of profitability at January 2017.
The right hand table shows the same information projected forward into next year based on the assumption that like-for-like retail sales are down -7%, which is in line with our central guidance.
As can be seen from the tables, our portfolio is extremely profitable and is likely to remain so despite current trading conditions.

Net branch profit is defined as profit before central overheads and is expressed as a percentage of VAT inclusive sales.
co. uk 9 slugline Strategic Report Long term retail portfolio stress test With increasing amounts of business being transferred online, it is legitimate to question the long term viability of retail stores and whether the possession of a retail portfolio is an asset or a liability.
We believe that our stores represent a valuable asset and will continue to do so.
However, in the unlikely event that like-for-like retail sales continue to decline at high rates for the next ten years, we believe that our lease structure is such that the portfolio could be managed down profitably.
In such a scenario it is extremely likely that rents would fall to reflect the new reality and that is our experience so far, but what if they do not?
To answer this question we projected the profitability of our current store portfolio in three different like-forlike sales scenarios over the next ten years: -2% which is the average of the last five years, -4% and -6%.
For the purpose of this model we have made the following conservative assumptions: We shut unprofitable stores at their lease expiry.
When profitable stores reach the end of their lease we are able to continue trading, paying the same rent on a short term lease.
As can be seen from the graph below, even in our worst case scenario, the portfolio would still make around 10% net branch profit before central overheads.
In such extreme circumstances it is likely that we would be able to renegotiate rents downwards and open some profitable new stores, both of which would increase profitability.
In conclusion, our existing and new stores will remain a profitable asset even in very difficult circumstances.
And this is why we continue to take on new space where we have the opportunity to increase sales and profit, as long as we continue to adhere to our strict profitability and payback hurdles and only take relatively short term leases e. g. ten years.

The table below sets out the growth in our customer base.
Active customers are defined as those who have placed a Directory order or received a standard account statement in the last 20 weeks.
Prior year active customers have been reduced by 0.04m to exclude inactive accounts that were included in error last year.
co. uk 11 slugline Strategic Report Directory credit business As anticipated, our credit customer base has continued to decline, albeit at a slower rate, and our average active customers throughout the year were down -3%.
In January 2016, we began to actively market our credit account to existing and new customers.
As a result, we have seen a steady improvement in the rate of attrition in our credit customer base.
The graph below shows the percentage decline in our customer base throughout the year.
We started the year with -6% fewer credit customers than the year before.
As it stands at January 2017 our credit customers are down just -0.8% on last year.
We are encouraged by the increasing stability of our credit customer base.
However, we do not expect the trend shown in the chart below to necessarily continue into the current year.
We have now passed the point at which we began to promote credit accounts last year, so the opportunity for further improvement is limited and we expect the customer base to continue to decline at a modest rate in the year ahead.

Net operating margin on total sales last year 24.4% Bought-in gross margin Bought-in gross margin was 0.1% and in line with Retail.
However, this -0.3% improvement has been offset by an increase in sales of third-party branded products, which have lower margins.
Markdown Stock for Sale was up 5% on last year, broadly in line with markdown sales.
-0.1% Interest income Higher interest income, as a result of reduced minimum payments, increased 1.0% margin.
This has been partially offset by a reduction in the annual percentage rate of interest we charge our customers.
Warehouse & distribution Margin improved as a result of greater efficiency in our warehousing and 0.6% distribution operations.
Marketing, photography Reduction in print costs have been partially offset by increased UK online 0.1% & catalogue production marketing costs.
Net operating margin on total sales this year 25.7% Based on our central guidance for the year ahead we expect Directory margins to reduce by -0.3%, mainly as a result of the growth of sales in our third-party branded products, which have lower margins than our NEXT branded stock.
Directory overseas Directory overseas continues to trade well and full price sales for the full year were up 18% on last year on a constant currency basis sales were up 19%.
Sales and profit history The table below sets out the last four years sales, profits and net margins in Pounds Sterling for Directory overseas, along with an estimate for the year ahead.
In the year to January 2017, margin in our overseas business improved, mainly as a result of efficiencies within our parcel networks and distribution hubs.
As a result of the weakening of the Pound our overseas business will benefit in two ways.
Firstly, our overseas customers will not experience any inflation in selling prices, so selling prices relative to the UK will reduce by around 5%.
Secondly, the revenue stream will be more valuable in Sterling.
As a result of this we expect sales in Pounds Sterling to increase by 24%.
Profit for the year ahead now includes an allocation of central overheads and markdown costs.
This cost allocation reduces overseas profitability by 4%.
co. uk 13 slugline Strategic Report Distribution hubs Our overseas hubs China, Russia and Germany are working well, and allow us to get our stock to customers more efficiently compared to servicing orders from the UK network.
We now service our Polish business from the German hub, a service we will be extending to fourteen surrounding countries during the year.
The China hub is operationally very efficient but the administration associated with importing stock into the country continues to be a challenge.
LABEL 10 Our branded business, LABEL, continues to perform well, with total sales up 14% and full price sales up 17%.
Net margin has improved to 16% largely as a result of less surplus stock.
In the year ahead we expect full price and total sales to grow by 17% and to maintain our margin of 16%.
The table below sets out the last three years sales, profits and net margins for our LABEL business, along with our estimate for the year ahead.

This enterprise offers other third-party young fashion brands, mainly sold on commission, alongside Lipsy product.
These brands now account for 34% of Lipsys total sales.
The aim is to create a younger offer within the NEXT Directory and on Lipsys own website.
Sales through the NEXT Directory of Lipsy & Co product are included in the LABEL figures above.
Sales and profit referred to in this section exclude interest income on LABEL items purchased on a Directory account.
co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Focus on the Changing Face of NEXT Directory At the beginning of last year, we started the process of modernising the Next Directory.
The two sections below detail some of the improvements we delivered in the previous year and some of the planned developments for the year ahead.
Developments during the year Systems During the year we implemented the following: Converged our UK and overseas websites allowing faster roll-out of new functionality and content across all our websites.
Launched mobile websites in the UK and Northern Ireland across all hand held devices.
Launched improved Apps for iPhone and iPad.
Improved promotion of the NEXT Directory account see page 12 and Directory card.
Launched a new stock ordering system for Directory, improving stock availability from 65% to 70%.
This saving partially offset the increases in online marketing spend see below.
Developed online marketing capabilities increasing our online recruitment spend by 6m.
Delivered the capability and began the process of personalising our website.
Rolled out parcel shop collection from 4,000 parcel shops spread throughout the UK.
This route now accounts for around 2% of our delivery volumes.
Development of the new flowers website.
Introduced sofa selection and ordering, adapted for our mobile site.
Online marketing During the year we increased online marketing expenditure by 6m.
It has proven difficult to precisely measure the returns on this expenditure, however our analysis indicates that the internal rate of return IRR on investment in online advertising is around 30% in the UK, but unproductive in most overseas territories.
In the year ahead we will be able to target our advertising much more effectively.
Firstly, we will be able to prevent recruitment advertising being shown to existing Directory customers where they are recognised through a cookie.
Secondly, we will be able to personalise adverts to our existing customers based on their purchasing history, recent browsing and abandoned baskets.
We will also be able to more accurately promote relevant credit offers to existing customers through third-party websites.
co. uk 15 slugline Strategic Report Directory developments planned for the year ahead We will continue to develop our online services and capabilities in the year ahead and plan to increase investment in Directory systems and content by 11m.
The most important projects are: The roll out of Next Unlimited which allows customers to pay 20 for a years unlimited next-day delivery anywhere in the UK and Northern Ireland.
The re-branding and promotion of our Directory account as nextpay along with the development of new, more targeted, credit offers.
Save for later facility and saved bags across devices.
Implementation of a Content Management System and Data Management System allowing a deeper level of home page personalisation, sort order personalisation, credit marketing, third-party advertising and emails.
Precise delivery service offering a one hour delivery slot, selected at check-out, for a 2 premium.
Look and feel website redesign, including faster and simpler registration and check-out.
Launch of overseas mobile website.
Currently mobile users overseas can only access a desktop website on their mobile devices.
70% of our overseas customers by sales value will have access to our mobile site by August.
Improved search engine functionality longer term.

co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Other Business Activity NEXT Sourcing NEXT Sourcing NS is our internal sourcing agent, which procures around 40% of NEXT branded product.
NS sales are down -20% in local currency, mainly as a result of competition from other third-party suppliers.
The profit impact of these lost sales was partially mitigated by the strengthening of the Dollar.
The table below sets out the performance of the business in Sterling and in Dollars.

At our 2017 18 costing rates we expect this profit to be 39m in Pounds Sterling.
Lipsy Lipsy has continued to reduce its UK wholesale business which is less profitable than and competes with its other sales channels.
This has been more than offset by increased sales in NEXT Retail and Directory.
Lipsys sales are broken down by distribution channel in the table below: sales through NEXT stores and Directory are reported in those divisions.

Net operating profit was 5.5m, up 4% on last year.
We are anticipating that the business will make net operating profit of around 7m next year.
co. uk 17 slugline Strategic Report International Retail and franchise stores Our franchise partners currently operate 186 stores in 33 countries.
Franchise sales in the year have reduced by -15%, mainly due to retail like-for-like sales decline in some important territories.
Our 13 wholly owned stores in Europe have made a small return in the full year.
Revenue and profit are set out below.
Jan Jan m 2017 2016 11 Franchise income 51.6 63.0 Own store sales 12.1 11.7 Total revenue 63.7 74.7 -15% Operating profit 9.3 10.2 -9% Non-trading activities The table below summarises central costs and other non-trading activities.

There were minimal gains from unrealised foreign exchange, as budgeted.
Pension scheme On the IFRS accounting basis, our defined benefit scheme has moved from a 46m surplus at January 2016 to a 63m surplus at January 2017.
This is primarily due to the impact of actuarial assumptions and additional contributions of 20m made into the scheme during the year.
A full actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension scheme was undertaken as at 30 September 2016, which showed a technical funding deficit of 70.2m at that date.
A recovery plan has been agreed with the Trustees whereby the Group will contribute five annual payments of up to 14m.
The first payment of 14m under this agreement was made in January 2017 and future contributions will only be required to be paid to the extent that there is a funding deficit at that time.
The technical funding position moved to a surplus of 5m when rolled forward to 31 January 2017.
Franchise income is a combination of royalties or commission added to cost of goods sold to franchise partners.
co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Cost Inflation and Cost Control In the year to January 2017 we have offset cost increases of 41m with cost savings of 42m.
The tables below outline the main contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.
Cost control remains at the heart of the business and we remain determined that cost savings must come through innovation and efficiency rather than any compromise to our product quality or services.

Cost increase forecast for 2017 18 m e National Living Wage 4 General wage inflation 8 Taxes rates, Apprenticeship Levy, energy taxes 9 Investment in online systems 11 Other increases 4 Total cost increases 36 We have identified around 26m of cost savings which mitigate some of the cost increases detailed above.
This includes a non-cash 10m saving in depreciation.
co. uk 19 slugline Strategic Report Cash Flow Cash generated in the year before interest, tax and depreciation was 946m.
Cash flow after non-discretionary outflows of taxation, interest and working capital was 717m.
After investing in capital expenditure and paying ordinary dividends the Company generated surplus cash of 330m.
This was used to finance 65m of additional Directory debt and the balancing 276m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks and a special dividend.
The table below summarises our main cash flows in the year ending January 2017 and our forecast for the year ahead, based upon our central profit guidance.
We expect the Company to continue to generate significantly more cash than is required to invest in capital expenditure and pay ordinary dividends.
As we outlined in our January 2017 trading statement, we intend to return surplus cash to shareholders through four special dividends see page 21.

However, as a result of timing differences, the interest charged in the year was 38m, 7m higher than in the prior year.
Average net debt during the year was up c. 300m on the previous year.
This additional debt funded the step change in Directory debtors following the lowering of minimum payments in February 2015.
Average interest rates in the year were lower partly due to the bond we issued in May 2016.
We are budgeting for the interest charge next year to reduce to 36m.
Our full year tax rate of 19.6% is broadly in line with the headline UK corporation tax rate of 20%.
We expect our effective tax rate to be around 19% next year as the headline UK corporation tax rate reduces to 19%.
co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Capital expenditure This year our capital expenditure was 161m, which was 10m ahead of last year.
The increase on last year is as a result of further investment in profitable new space and warehousing, which has been partly offset by a reduction in Head Office and systems capital expenditure.
Our capital expenditure for the last two years is set out in the table below.
Jan Jan m 2017 2016 Retail space expansion 108 86 Retail cosmetic refits 11 15 Total capex on stores 119 101 Warehouse 28 22 Head Office infrastructure 10 15 Systems 4 13 Total capital expenditure 161 151 New retail space remained our biggest investment at 108m in the year to January 2017.
Warehouse capex was 28m, which included 15m of expenditure to complete our new automated furniture warehouse.
The new warehouse cost 30m in total and will be operational from April 2017.
Systems capex of 4m was 9m lower than the prior years exceptionally high number, which was inflated by the purchase of hardware for a new till system.
Expenditure on Head Office infrastructure reduced by 5m as we are near the end of upgrading our central facilities.
In the year ahead we expect capital expenditure to be around 130m, a reduction of 31m on the current year.
This is driven by an anticipated decrease in spending on retail space 102m versus 119m and lower warehouse expenditure 16m versus 28m.
Directory debt Directory debt increased by 70m, 65m of which was due to the change in minimum payments.
We believe this has now fully matured and we do not expect to see a further increase in the year ahead.
Ordinary dividends The Board has proposed a final ordinary dividend of 105p, to be paid on 1 August 2017 and taking the total ordinary dividends for the year to 158p, flat on last year.
This is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held 18 May 2017.
Shares will trade ex-dividend from 6 July 2017 and the record date will be 7 July 2017.
Surplus Cash and Shareholder Distribution in the Year Ahead At the mid-point of our sales and profit guidance we expect to generate surplus cash of 300m after capital expenditure and paying ordinary dividends.
In our January 2017 trading statement, we advised that we intended to distribute surplus cash to shareholders by way of four quarterly special dividends of 45p each.
This broadly represents the cash we would generate at the lower end of our guidance.
The Board has decided to declare the first of these interim special dividends of 45p per share which will be paid on 2 May 2017.
Shares will trade ex-dividend from 6 April 2017 and the record date will be 7 April 2017.
Payment of the other three special dividends remain subject to our internal forecasts remaining in line with our guidance ranges and no significant changes in market conditions.
co. uk 21 slugline Strategic Report Why special dividends not buybacks?
With the share price trading at a relatively low multiple of future earnings, some have reasonably questioned whether the Company would be better to use surplus cash to buy back shares.
The last time the Company was in a similar situation was in 2008.
At that time we were suffering from a combination of tough economic conditions, weakening currency rates and some internal product range issues.
Profits were forecast to decline in the year ahead and there was much uncertainty in the wider economy as the credit crunch took hold.
We took the decision at that time to halt our buyback programme.
In hindsight, we were wrong to not buy back shares in 2008 and we hope that hindsight will prove us wrong, on this particular decision, once again!
But at this time of significant uncertainty, we feel that the decision to buy back shares is best left to shareholders themselves.
And of course, shareholders can always use their special dividends to buy shares for themselves.
Perhaps we have been overly cautious but companies rarely fail for being prudent with their shareholders money and in uncertain times such prudence is all the more important.
In the long term share buybacks remain our preferred route for returning capital to shareholders and we intend to return to them when market and trading conditions make it appropriate.
Net Debt and Financing Our year end net debt was 861m, which was 11m higher than last year.
The entire value of the Companys net debt is more than matched by the value of our Directory debtor book, a financial asset worth 1bn.
Net debt which peaks at c. 1.0bn is securely financed through a combination of bonds and committed bank facilities.
In May 2016 we issued a new 300m 12-year bond in anticipation of redeeming our 213m bond in October 2016.
At January 2017 our financing consists of 875m of bonds and 525m of committed bank facilities.
In the year ahead, based on our central guidance, we are forecasting for our net debt to remain at 861m, as set out in the chart below.
Financing m 1,600 1.4bn 1,400 2020 1,200 Bank facility Peak 525 1.0bn 2021 1,000 800 Jan 2018 e 1bn 2021 861 600 Bonds 2026 875 400 200 2028 m Funding Net debt Directory debtors The Group maintains its objective of retaining investment grade status.
At 861m, the Groups net debt is comfortably within the limit of investment grade status which we estimate to be around 1.5bn.
co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Outlook for the Year Ahead 2017 External headwinds We remain extremely cautious about the outlook for the year ahead.
The clothing sector faces three potential threats: a sectorial shift away from spending on clothing, price inflation as a result of Sterlings devaluation and potentially weaker growth in real incomes in the wider economy.
These headwinds are likely to be felt most acutely in our Retail business, as sales continue to migrate away from the High Street to online shopping.
Sectorial shift The figures issued below by Barclaycard give an indication as to how spending preferences have changed.
The chart below shows the growth in spending on pubs, restaurants and entertainment compared to High Street clothing in the fourth quarter of 2016.
We believe that these numbers demonstrate the continuing trend towards spending on experiences away from things.
Shifts in consumer spending patterns are not unusual and we expect that the trend will stabilise and reverse at some point, though it is impossible to say exactly when this will happen.

co. uk 23 slugline Strategic Report Real wage growth As can be seen from the graph below, inflation is slowly rising to the level of general wage growth and looks set to continue to do so for the remainder of the year.
We therefore expect a continuing squeeze on real incomes in the year ahead.

Prices As expected, prices on like-for-like product in the first half of the year are up less than five percent with average selling prices of sold garments up 4%.
The table below sets out our costing rates for the Dollar which accounts for around 60% of our total buy for the year to January 2017 compared to January 2018.
Costing Selling rate price 2016 17 2017 18 variance variance Spring & Summer $1.54 $1.39 -10% 4% Autumn & Winter $1.47 $1.26 -14% Less than 5% As can be seen from the table above, costing rates are more challenging in the second half.
This is because some of our currency for the first half of 2017 had been hedged before the devaluation of Sterling in June 2016.
Although costing rates are relatively lower in Autumn Winter, we do not expect price rises to be any worse in the second half and they may be a little better.
A combination of alternative sources of supply, better negotiation and surplus capacity mean that we have been able to mitigate much of the weakness in Sterling.
Longer term outlook for pricing and inflation The inflation in our cost prices and the wider economy looks like it has been driven mainly by the devaluation of the Pound.
In the event that devaluation is a one off adjustment and Sterling does not devalue again in 2018, pricing pressure should ease as we go into the second half of 2018.
By the same logic, the pressure on real wages from rising inflation may also work its way through the system by the middle of 2018.
2017 Internal factors As detailed in the Product section see page 6 we have substantially improved the Companys ability to respond to new trends.
Where we have done so, we have been rewarded with good sales.
However, in the process of making our ranges more responsive, we have omitted some best-selling, heartland product.
co. uk slugline Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Over the last three months we have taken corrective action in all the relevant areas.
This work will begin to be reflected in our ranges as the Summer season progresses.
However, our ranges will not be exactly where we want them to be until we get into the third quarter.
So we expect sales in the first quarter to be around the lower end of the 2017 18 guidance range we issued with our January 2017 trading statement.
All other things being equal, we expect some improvement in the second quarter and a more marked improvement in the second half of the year.
This, of course, is subject to there being no further deterioration in the external environment as the year progresses.
Outlook for Sales and Profit We are maintaining the guidance range we issued for the full year in our January trading statement.
We expect total full price sales growth for 2017 18 to be between -3.5% and 2.5%, with Earnings Per Share growth of between -12.4% and 0.5%.

Summary The year ahead looks like it will be tough with a combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us.
Our reaction to these challenges will be, as it has been in the past, to acknowledge where we can improve and focus on our core business.
We are very clear about our priorities for the year ahead and how we can continue to make NEXT a better business for our customers.
Our objectives are as follows: Continue our efforts to improve our buying processes, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve in terms of design and quality whilst maximising the potential of our best-selling, heartland products.
Continue the process of modernising the UK Directory business: improving our systems capabilities, developing new ways of recruiting customers, stimulating sales from existing customers, improving the presentation of our website, personalising our product offer and developing our credit offer.
Continue to grow LABEL and Next Directory overseas.
Develop and profitably expand our UK retail store network.
We are in a good position to deliver these objectives.
NEXT is financially strong with high net margins, healthy cash generation, good cost control and a robust, well financed balance sheet.
We have a highly profitable, well maintained and relatively flexible store portfolio and excellent home shopping operations in the UK and overseas.
For NEXT these have proven to be the foundations of long term success.
We aim to build on them in the year ahead.
