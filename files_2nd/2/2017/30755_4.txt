By far the most significant disposal was Vauxhall Square in London, which had been valued at 100 million at 31 December 2016, and for which we received net proceeds of 144.1 million.
This time last year, we explained that the schemes bias towards residential towers did not suit our skill set or risk appetite, and the sale clarified our future strategy whilst adding 7p pence to NAV.
We also sold a further six properties in Germany, France and the United Kingdom which met our disposal criteria.
Since the year end we have sold a further two properties, one each in Germany and the UK, for an aggregate of 12.4 million, and I expect further similar disposals over the next 24 months.
We successfully redeployed the proceeds into Germany 187.7 million and the UK 49.9 million.
The largest acquisition was the Metropolis portfolio of 12 properties across major cities in Germany for 140.1 million, yielding 6.3%, and, attractively for us, with around 11% of the portfolio vacant.
