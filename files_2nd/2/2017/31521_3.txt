ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE RAMP-UP OF YOUR THIRD CFC IN ANDOVER IN 2017?
Our CFC3 at Andover is a revolutionary facility containing the very latest technology developed by Ocado.
I am pleased to report that we have successfully ramped up capacity at Andover over the course of 2017.
Today, we deliver thousands of customer orders each week from the facility and we Tim Steiner expect to make further significant progress in 2018.
Throughout the year, as well as driving increasing CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER numbers of orders through the CFC, we have focused on improving the reliability and resiliency of the facility as we look to get the most from our proprietary new technology.
HOW MANY SOLUTIONS PARTNERSHIPS SHOULD WE EXPECT IN 2018?
With five retailers now using or signed up to our platform, we are confident that we will be able to do further deals with the momentum of new signings building over time.
We are in an increasing number of ongoing conversations with retailers across the world and significant mergers and acquisitions across the grocery industry this year have helped progress many of these conversations, most notably Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods.
HOW MANY SOLUTIONS PARTNERSHIPS CAN YOU COMMIT TO GIVEN THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE?
We are committed to giving our partners an excellent service and we have invested in the resources to do multiple deals.
We dont have unlimited capacity, of course, so, depending on the number, complexity and type of deals we do, we may need to prioritise some future deals.
