CHIEF EXECUTIVES STATEMENT HUNTING HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAS PROVIDED GAMECHANGING TECHNOLOGY TO THE INDUSTRY DURING THE MARKET DOWNTURN.
A PERFECT EXAMPLE BEING THE H-1 PERFORATING SYSTEM.
Introduction Hunting has industry-leading technology, strong intellectual property, quality-assured products and an established global manufacturing capability, supported by a highly trained and committed workforce.
The can-do mentality of our global business managers gives me confidence that from this environment of fragile-but-stable market conditions, we can build growth and capture new initiatives as the next phase of industry growth gets underway.
The oil and gas sector, in many respects, is a changed industry since 2014 when the heady days of $100 oil were driving both activity and production levels.
An aspect of this time, which is only apparent now, is that the reliance on the same approved products and services purchasing regimes, created a degree of resistance across the industry to adopt new technology that could do the same job more efficiently or safely.
The oil price lows during the downturn forced operators and participants in JIM JOHNSON CHIEF EXECUTIVE the supply chain to revise this stance and embrace new technology, which cut operating costs and allowed profitable production to be achieved, even in a lower oil price environment.
Hunting has been one of those companies that has provided game-changing technology to the industry during the market downturn.
A perfect example being the H-1 Perforating System, the Groups proprietary, hydraulic fracturing, perforating gun.
The H-1 System was a result of technology cross-over from a number of Huntings business lines, to create a single multi-functional proprietary product.
For the operator, it provided a higher level of safety for field operations and takes personnel off the wellpad, providing a real cost saving to well completion operations.
The H-1s success is reflected in that some operators and end users are now mandating the use of the system by its wireline operators, given the reliability demonstrated since its commercial launch in late 2015.
