com Annual report 2017 Beazley 27 Outlook After a sustained period of low catastrophe activity, the insurance industry experienced one of the most costly years for natural disaster losses on record in 2017.
Beazleys 2017 result benefited from our balanced business model and our active risk appetite management, leaving us well placed to benefit from any improvement in market conditions in 2018.
We have already seen rate increases in the latter part of 2017 and early 2018 across our property and treaty books as the market recalibrates its pricing of catastrophe exposed risks.
We also see continued opportunities for profitable growth in specialty lines in 2018, with further development of our US platform and the first full year of operation for our international business.
While market conditions may improve across some of our product lines in 2018, Beazleys core underwriting philosophy remains stable.
Our underwriting approach of exercising discipline across a diverse portfolio of specialist insurance products, particularly in lines of business where competitive pressures are strongest, will remain a key component of our underwriting strategy.
This strategy has delivered an underwriting profit in difficult market conditions during 2017 and we are confident that we are well placed as we move into 2018.
