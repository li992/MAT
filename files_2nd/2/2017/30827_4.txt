The causes of are provided with a safe working environment and continue their these incidents have already been identified as key fatality risks and professional development.
The Group takes a long-term view of are the subject of ongoing programmes aimed at improving safety building capability amongst its staff, recognising their critical role in standards in our underground operations.
No fatality is acceptable our successes to date and in meeting future challenges.
I would like to us and we continue to work towards our goal of zero fatalities.
to thank all my colleagues for their contributions in 2017 and for their ongoing commitment to our future success.
The number and frequency rate of fatalities in 2017 have reduced compared to the prior year and this is a continuation of a long term Review of operations trend of improvement in our overall health and safety performance.
The ramp up of our new mines proceeded in line with management We have operated our open pit facilities at Bozshakol, Aktogay and expectations in 2017, with the 25 million tonne per annum Bozshakol Bozymchak without any fatal incidents since each of these mines sulphide concentrator achieving 100% of design capacity in August.

16 KAZ Minerals Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For more information, see pages 22 Strategy 27 Operating review The Aktogay sulphide concentrator started production in February 2017 and ramped up ahead of schedule.
Combined sulphide and oxide copper production was 90 kt against initial guidance of 65-85 kt, five times higher than the 18 kt produced in 2016 from the oxide plant.
The sulphide concentrator achieved commercial levels of production at the end of September in line with guidance and remains on track to achieve 100% of design capacity during 2018.
At the East Region and Bozymchak, copper production of 67 kt exceeded the target for the year of around 65 kt and gold production of 59 koz was at the upper end of guidance.
Works to extend the life of the Artemyevsky mine continued according to the project plan.
The Group produced 259 kt of copper in 2017, at the upper end of the original guidance range of 225-260 kt given at the start of the year and in line with the revised guidance range of 250-270 kt set in the second half, following good progress with the ramp up at Aktogay.
Gold production of 179 koz was at the upper end of expectations, supported by high gold grades at Bozshakol and strong output from Bozymchak.
Silver production was in line with guidance at 3,506 koz, with lower silver grades in the East Region in the fourth quarter offset by the contribution from both Bozshakol and Aktogay.
Zinc in concentrate production of 58 kt was below guidance of 60-65 kt, as access to high zinc grade areas in the East Region mines was deferred.
Production outlook With Bozshakol entering 2018 at close to full capacity and Aktogay scheduled to ramp up to 100% of mill throughput during the year, guidance for copper production in 2018 is set at 270-300kt.
Bozshakol will benefit from a full year of production at or near design levels in both the main sulphide concentrator and the clay plant, although this will be offset by a decline in copper grade from the 0.53% processed in 2017.
Copper production at Bozshakol is guided at 95-105 kt for 2018.
At Aktogay, copper guidance is set at 110-130 kt, consisting of 20-25 kt of copper cathode from oxide ore and 90-105 kt from sulphide ore. Copper production in the East Region and Bozymchak is expected to remain stable at around 65 kt.
Zinc in concentrate production is guided to be in the region of 60 kt in 2018.
Gold production in 2018 is expected to be slightly lower at 160-175 koz, as gold grades at Bozshakol and Bozymchak reduce from the elevated levels processed in 2017.
Silver output is anticipated to be approximately 3,000 koz.
