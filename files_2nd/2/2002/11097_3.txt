NEXT PLC CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW This year Group turnover was 1,872m, up 18% on last year.
Sales in NEXT Retail were up 21% with a like-for-like increase of 9%.
NEXT Directory also had an excellent year with sales up 20%.
In the year ended January 2002 NEXT achieved total profit before tax of 265.8m compared to 218.4m last year, an increase of 22%.
The increase in earnings per share of 24% was higher than the increase in profits largely due to share buybacks.
We bought for cancellation 2% of our shares in October 2001 and 10% in May 2000.
Turnover and profit figures are set out in the table below.

Either through offering the same product at a lower price or, more often, through providing a better product at the same price.
It is this constant process of improvement that has driven our like-for-like sales growth and we remain committed to delivering further improvements in value going forward.
Quicker response to fashion During the course of 2001 NEXT has made significant progress in reducing the lead times between the ordering and the delivery of product.
This has enabled our ranges to better reflect the latest colours and styles.
We recognise that we still have significant opportunities in this area.
In the coming year we intend to invest in the development of our international supply chain, with particular emphasis on Eastern Europe and Turkey.
three NEXT PLC CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW Expanding new product ranges We continue to explore new product areas where we believe that our design skills can genuinely add value.
This has been particularly successful in our ranges of products for the home.
We have expanded the range in bathroom, hard furniture, kitchenware, fresh flowers and ceramics whilst greatly increasing the size of our core offering in bedding, sofas, and home accessories.
The growth of Home products has been particularly strong in the Directory, where new ranges can be displayed through the printing of additional pages.
Currently we only have Home departments in 94 of our 331 retail locations.
We therefore believe that our move into larger stores provides us with a major opportunity to increase our share of this considerable market.
NEXT also continues to invest in developing other areas in which we have experienced strong growth, such as lingerie, bath & body care products and clothing for newborn babies.
NEXT RETAIL Rationale for space expansion Our most important objective in Retail is to profitably increase our selling space.
We believe that new space will continue to make a significant contribution to our sales and profit growth in the years ahead, because it enables us to offer our customers a greater choice of product in a more comfortable shopping environment.
This drive for larger stores is governed by strict financial criteria.
Every new project aims to pay back the capital invested in less than 24 months and to achieve at least 15% profit on sales in year one, before distribution and central costs.
During the year to January 2002 the portfolio of new stores has exceeded its sales target by 17% and payback on net capital invested will be considerably less than our 24 month limit.
Profile of new space Over the last year we have added 338,000 square feet, an increase in space of 20% of which 42,000 is from two additional clearance stores.
Much of this increase relates to the extension or relocation of stores in towns and cities where NEXT already had a trading presence.
New trading locations tend to be in out of town retail parks.

In the current year we are confident of achieving a net increase of at least 250,000 square feet of which 180,000 square feet is already under contract.
NEXT DIRECTORY The main objectives for Home Shopping are: To increase the number of customers using the Directory To extend the product offer available for the customer to order from home To improve the services offered to Directory customers New customers This year we have achieved an exceptional net increase in new customers of 17%.
January 2002 January 2001 Active Customers 1,201,000 1,030,000 We expect to make further progress in the recruitment of new customers during the current year.
Expansion of the product offer We continue to increase the number of pages given to each product category and thus increase the number of lines available for our customers to choose from.
A year-on-year comparison of page numbers in our publications is shown in the table below, broken down by product type.
Category Pages in Directories Increase and Brochures in Pages Year ended Year ended 2002 2001 % Womenswear 803 753 7% Menswear 432 344 26% Childrenswear 352 235 50% Home 328 251 31% TOTAL 1,915 1,583 21% We intend to continue increasing the number of pages in both the Directory and the Brochure to accommodate additional product.
In addition we have increased the page size by 18% in the 2002 Spring Summer Directory, which has allowed us to enhance the presentation of our products.
five NEXT PLC CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW New services NEXT Directory offers next day delivery as standard for goods ordered before 5.00 p. m. We recently introduced the option for customers to return goods through our retail stores, this has proved very popular.
As a result we have tested a service allowing customers to order from home and collect from store.
We intend to extend this to all our customers during the first half of this year.
The collect from store service is designed for those customers who enjoy catalogue shopping but do not always find it convenient to be at home for the delivery.
Sales through the Internet increased by 102% over last year and accounted for 11% of our Home Shopping sales.
Over the last year we have extended our Internet services, customers can now manage their account and make payments on-line.
So far this season the Internet has accounted for 14% of Home Shopping sales.
NEXT FRANCHISE Our overseas franchise operation had another successful year, with sales increasing by 18% and profit by 19%.
At the end of January 2002 we had 49 franchise stores compared with 37 the previous year.
VENTURA Profit for the year from Ventura increased to 13.0m compared with 11.3m the previous year.
The focus remains on provision of call centre services and customer account management to companies who recognise the opportunities from outsourcing these business activities.
The increase in profit is attributable to improvements in operating efficiencies and a better performance, but lower investment, in the activity of funded consumer credit.
During the year we reduced the outstanding consumer credit receivables by 22m to 23m and this process will continue.
Ventura has been successful in winning new business from new and existing blue chip clients, and has sufficient operational capacity to meet their requirements in the year ahead.
OTHER ACTIVITIES The profit of 12.5m last year 15.3m includes 13.1m from NEXT Asia, our product sourcing company in the Far East and 2.5m from NEXT Estates, our property management division.
Other Activities also includes Callscan, our telecoms software subsidiary, Choice, an associated company which operates a chain of twelve discount stores and Central Costs.
An actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension scheme was undertaken during the year which determined that scheme assets represented 107% of scheme liabilities, compared with 122% at the previous valuation.
This reduction in scheme surplus has reduced the credit recognised in Central Costs to 1.7m this year, from 4.7m the previous year.
We do not expect the introduction of accounting standard FRS17 Retirement Benefits, in itself, to have a material affect on the accounts of NEXT.
NEXT has for many years recognised the cost of its employee share option schemes in its Profit and Loss account.
Over the past five years the average annual cost has been 5.2m, this year the charge amounted to 8m compared with 0.9m last year.
The annual fluctuation is dependent on the timing of share purchases by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust and the exercising of options by employees.
BALANCE SHEET NEXT has a strong balance sheet and at the end of January 2002 our net cash balances had increased to 194m.
Stocks at 166m were level with last year and approximately 15m below the optimum level, a situation which has now been resolved.
six NEXT PLC CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW Capital expenditure amounted to 73m.
This included 54m on stores, 6m on warehousing, 5m on IT and 6m on developing our Head Office infrastructure.
Cash inflow for the year was 100m after taking into account the 54m cost of purchasing for cancellation 1.9% of our shares.
The 6.4m shares were acquired at an average cost of 839p.
DIVIDEND The Directors are pleased to recommend a final dividend of 18.5p against 16p last year, bringing the total for the year to 27.5p compared with 24p last year, an increase of 14.6%.
The dividend is covered 2.1 times by earnings per share of 58.1p.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES We will again seek to enhance shareholder value by using surplus capital to purchase our own shares when the price payable will result in an increase in earnings per share.
We currently have shareholder approval to do so and will be seeking to renew the authority at our AGM on 16 May.
CURRENT TRADING In the first seven weeks since the start of the new financial year NEXT Retail sales are 19% ahead of the previous year.
Like-for-like sales in the 266 stores which have been trading for at least one year are 7% ahead.
NEXT Directory sales for the first seven weeks are 31% ahead of the previous year.
Taken together, sales for the NEXT Brand are 22% ahead of last year.
We will make a further statement on current trading at our Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2002.
