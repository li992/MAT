Focusing our brand activity We reviewed our trading brands market by market and retained the strongest.
Now we are rolling out Aviva as a new international brand to reinforce the best and replace the rest.
The Aviva brand is already live in many of our operations in Europe and Asia.
It will be introduced in Australia, Canada, the US and other markets in 2003.
