Our management development training programmes will be reviewed together with the introduction of further sector and business-specific training.
Operational functions There will be a review of the opportunities that the sector structure brings to streamline management reporting and further integrate back office functions.
I believe that the actions will provide tighter, more effective management control, a more outward, customer-facing approach to sales and service delivery and a platform for future growth.
PROSPECTS FOR 2003 The above changes should continue to drive turnover from organic growth, whilst maintaining and, where possible, improving profit margins in a low inflation and increasingly price-competitive environment.
We will continue to search for suitable bolt-on acquisitions, primarily in security and hygiene.
On this basis, we aim for strong growth in turnover, profits before tax and earnings per share, which could be further enhanced by the continuation, as planned, of our share buy-back programme.
