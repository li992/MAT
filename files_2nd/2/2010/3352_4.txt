2011 outlook Looking forwards into 2011, further recovery in the macroeconomic environment is expected, although, as in 2010, this is unlikely to be smooth or uniform across regions and end-user industries.
For Europe, which remains Charters most important region in terms of profit generation, economic growth is expected to average no more than 1 per cent across the region, with Germany and Central Europe performing above average but Southern Europe stagnating or declining further.
The BRIC economies and emerging markets will generate stronger growth.
