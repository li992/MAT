In short, BP is moving swiftly to address its weaknesses and build on its strengths.
While doing this we will not hesitate to go beyond the conventional business model of an international oil company.

BP and Rosneft have also agreed to establish an Arctic technology centre in Russia, which will work with research institutes, design bureaus and universities to develop technologies and engineering practices for the safe extraction of hydrocarbon resources from the Arctic shelf.
In February 2011 we announced a second historic agreement.
This will, subject to completion, see BP and Reliance work together across the gas value chain in the fast-growing Indian market.

There will also be an increasing emphasis on value over volume, as we sharpen our strategy and reshape the company for growth.
Looking back over recent days and months, our thoughts return to the men who lost their lives, to those who were injured and to the communities hit hard by the spill.
