The success of Mires and other environmental initiatives has led to a more extensive programme of catchment management which is being implemented called Upstream Thinking.
Restoring wetlands will allow slower and steadier flows and cleaner water from the moors to rivers and reservoirs.
This in turn will help minimise long-term treatment costs.
Mires will be expanded across the region with moorland and farmland projects between 2010 and 2015 in partnership with Exmoor National Park Authority, Dartmoor National Park Authority, Natural England, the Environment Agency, English Heritage, local farmers and landowners.
Focussing on our Pure vision has assisted the company in delivering a strong set of results both financially and operationally.
This has also ensured there is a solid platform in place for further progress to be made.
