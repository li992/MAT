Moving forwards Group Chief Executives review Looking at National Express today, I see a business that is being transformed from the one that I joined at the beginning of 2010.
Twelve months ago, we set out a two year Business Recovery programme to restore business margins.
We said that we would achieve cost reductions, restore the business to a sound foundation and drive forward our performance to deliver value for our shareholders.
