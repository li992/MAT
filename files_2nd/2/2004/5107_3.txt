Chief Executives review In the year ended 30 September 2004, easyJet made a profit before tax of 62.2 million, an increase of 20.8% on the prior year.
The underlying profit before tax was 85.4 million 2003: 96.3 million.
Details of underlying items may be found in the footnote below.
Overview Earnings per share for the year were 10.34 pence 2003: 8.24 pence.
The year demonstrated the resilience of easyJets business model, particularly in a challenging environment for the airline industry.
Despite Profit before tax million difficult market conditions, easyJets point-to-point low-cost short haul 71.6 network, connecting major and convenient European airports, has 62.2 continued to attract business and leisure travellers alike, with our load 51.5 factor rising from 84.1% in 2003 to 84.5% in 2004.
40.1 During the year, there have been increasing numbers of entrants into the 22.1 low cost airline marketplace in Europe.
There are now at least 47 low cost airlines in Europe, compared to only seven three years ago.
This is clearly not sustainable in the longer term, and we expect consolidations and 00 01 02 03 04 liquidations indeed these have started to appear in recent months.
The key success criteria will be to have the lowest cost base between any two airports and to repeat this again and again.
Our strategy ensures that our cost base is amongst the lowest in the industry.
Increasing levels of overall competition have led to falls in yield from 43.28 Basic earnings per share pence in 2003 to 42.28 in 2004.
However, costs have been kept under control 14.6 through careful management and identification of strategic cost reduction opportunities.
Cost per Available Seat Kilometre ASK fell from 4.19 pence 10.3 in 2003 to 4.04 pence in 2004, or on an underlying basis, was level year- 8.2 on-year 3.97 pence in 2003 to 3.95 pence in 2004.
With the increasing load factor offset off by the decline in average fare, total revenues grew 17.1% to 1,091.0 million.
The number of passengers rose 19.7% to 24.3 million.
02 03 04 Over the year, ASKs were 25,448 million 2003: 21,024 million, with the average sector length up 1.7% to 884 km.
Revenue per ASK was down 3.2% to 4.29 pence.
Strategy and business model ASK millions During the year, the management reviewed with the Board the 25,448 implementation of easyJets strategy and made changes to ensure that 21,024 the business remains well-positioned in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
The business model however required no change.
It is tried and tested and has withstood the challenges of this difficult year.
10,769 7,003 5,801 Capacity growth is a lever that we can use to influence our profitability in the face of increased competition.
We have announced that our 2005 capacity growth rate, measured by the number of aircraft in the fleet at 00 01 02 03 04 Footnote The adjusting items are goodwill amortisation charge of 17.1 million 2003: 17.6 million, accelerated depreciation of certain owned aircraft of 6.1 million 2003: 10.2 million, the committed contribution to Deutsche BA of nil 2003: 1.3 million, the write off of investments of nil 2003: Deutsche BA totalling 7.8 million, and the costs of integrating the businesses of Go Fly and easyJet of nil 2003: 7.9 million.
8 Annual report and accounts 2004 12.50 hrs Budapest, Hungary Flight EZY 4585 arrives in Budapest, another new city added to the network during the year, showing our commitment to providing the entire EU with low fares to convenient destinations that save passengers both time and money.
14.55 hrs Berlin, Germany Back to Berlin.
easyJet has created over 300 jobs in the Berlin area as a result of its arrival and carried over 500,000 passengers in the five months since we started flying.
Chief Executives review continued year end, has been reduced to17% an increase of 16 aircraft.
It is likely Load factor % that the growth rates for 2006 and 2007 will also be lower, reflecting our ability to flex capacity according to market conditions.
84.8 84.1 84.5 83.0 80.8 Being mindful of the business environment, our strategy has three cornerstones:focus on our customers, own our markets and reduce our costs.
Focus on our customers We know what our customers value, and we design our core product and ancillary services accordingly.
Every year, we aim to create better 00 01 02 03 04 value for our customers, whilst decreasing our costs to maintain or improve competitiveness.
Own our markets We will develop and aggressively defend our chosen markets against Number of average daily departures competitors.
This means quickly establishing a strong base, offering numerous routes with multiple frequencies to existing and new points on the network, and establishing a strong brand in the market.
Reduce our costs Management is focussed on increasing the operating margin.
We will continue to challenge industry norms and further reduce our cost base through being highly productive, innovative and taking advantage of our scale and local knowledge in procuring goods and services.
For example, in the coming year we will see benefit from the increasing number of Airbus A319s in the fleet, and an increase in both fleet utilisation and London Luton 59 Edinburgh 24 crew productivity.
London Stansted 55 Amsterdam 22 London Gatwick 43 Geneva 20 We will withdraw capacity from any existing markets that are poorly Belfast 35 Paris Orly 19 performing or airports which are over-priced and do not meet our Liverpool 27 Berlin Schnefeld 18 strategy.
We have already taken action in this regard by removing Zurich Bristol 26 Barcelona 18 from our network and reducing capacity at Copenhagen and Amsterdam.
Nice 25 Other 201 I am confident that this strategy will bring clarity and focus to the efforts of our people and will provide easyJet with its unique strength to become best in class, with a leading position in the growing European air travel market.
Number of routes operated at year end Network 153 We have continued to develop the network during the year in a manner that absorbed the 18.4% growth in new capacity, measured by sectors 105 operated, without affecting operational performance.
At 30 September 83 2004, the easyJet network covered 153 routes and 44 airports, compared to 105 and 38 at the same time last year.
Three routes ceased operations 35 28 in the year due to excessive airport costs.
During the year, we have added six new cities to the easyJet network: Basel, 00 01 02 03 04 Berlin Schnefeld, Budapest, Dortmund, Cologne-Bonn and Ljubljana.
Berlin and Dortmund are new bases and demonstrate our commitment to the German market.
From Berlin we have started 13 routes during the year.
In addition, at Berlin, we have worked closely with airport management and now have a dedicated easyJet branded terminal, which will become a model for our future development across Europe.
We started eight routes from Dortmund and four from Budapest in the year, which we expect to generate more than 1.5 million extra passengers during the first year of operation.
Annual report and accounts 2004 11 Chief Executives review continued We are the fourth biggest Other locations where we grew during the year included Belfast with new routes to Paris, Alicante and Malaga.
intra-European Further growth is planned for the winter, and we have already announced airline, by 12 new cities: Almeria, Bratislava, Cork, Grenoble, Knock, Krakow, Murcia, Riga, Shannon, Tallinn, Valencia and Warsaw.
These reflect the expansion passengers of the European Union during the year.
We have now announced services to six of the new accession states.
Further growth is taking place from carried Geneva, Berlin, Budapest, Dortmund and London Luton.
Fleet At the end of the financial year the fleet comprised 71 Boeing 737s and Number of aircraft at year end 21 Airbus A319s, giving a total of 92 aircraft, up from the 73 Boeing 737s 92 and one Airbus A319 at the start of the year.
74 64 A further 99 Airbus A319 aircraft will be delivered through to December 2007.
This will give us a modern fleet of aircraft that will underpin our high levels of asset utilisation, increase our operational efficiency and reduce 26 our unit cost base.
The average fleet age, currently four and a half years, 19 is expected to fall to approximately three years by 30 September 2006.
00 01 02 03 04 Planned fleet changes additions retirements : The planned composition of the fleet over the period to 30 September 2007 is as follows: Airbus Boeing Boeing 319s 737-700s 737-300s Total Fleet plan number of aircraft At 30 September 2003 1 27 46 74 149 Year ending 30 September 2004 21 33 38 92 126 Year ending 30 September 2005 55 32 21 108 108 Year ending 30 September 2006 86 32 8 126 92 117 Year ending 30 September 2007 117 32 149 21 55 86 33 32 Whilst we are very confident of growing the business at this rate, we have 32 38 negotiated with Airbus flexibility that allows us to moderate, or accelerate, 32 21 8 our capacity growth should the external environment necessitate any 04 05 06 07 changes.
We have already used this flexibility by deferring three A319 Airbus A319 aircraft into the 2008 financial year at no cost.
Boeing 737-700 During the year, the first five Airbus aircraft were introduced into Geneva Boeing 737-300 which became our first dedicated Airbus base, enabling us to establish and test operations with the new type of aircraft before rolling out the subsequent deliveries to other bases.
This was done successfully, and new Airbus aircraft have now been introduced to our London Gatwick, Paris and Berlin crew bases.
Although Airbus is assisting with some of the costs Cost per ASK pence of introducing the new aircraft, easyJet will also incur some introductory 4.52 4.46 costs in the current year.
In the last financial year, additional costs of 4.16 4.19 4.04 6.4 million were incurred, primarily due to the need to hire extra crew during the training period.
Available Seat Kilometres are expected to increase by approximately 25% during fiscal 2005.
The full-year effect of aircraft added during 2004 means that growth is weighted towards the first half.
00 01 02 03 04 12 Annual report and accounts 2004 18.45 hrs Palma, Majorca Another destination this time, giving second-home owners and holidaymakers the opportunity for a low-cost conveniently timed flight to a great destination.
On board, our friendly cabin crew Annika Crimmann offers a range of snacks and drinks from the easyKiosk whilst Matt Bass takes passengers through the safety demonstrations.
On the ground, theres time to check that all is in order before the return flight.
22.20 hrs Berlin, Germany The end of a long day - 12 block hours and six flights, with 800 passengers carried.
Its time for Berlin to sleep, but not for easyJet.
The aircraft will undergo overnight maintenance inspections to make sure that everythings fine for another early start the next day.
Chief Executives review continued Aircraft financing Staff numbers at the year end Of the 26 new aircraft that were delivered to easyJet during the year, 3,925 21 were sold to lessors and leased back under operating leases, and five 3,372 were financed by debt.
3,124 At the year end, 12 aircraft were owned and 80 were under operating lease.
1,632 1,386 During the year, we have secured financing for the majority of the Airbus deliveries.
82 of the 120 Airbus aircraft ordered have now been financed.
The arrangements included almost all deliveries for 2004 and 2005, and a proportion of those in 2006 and 2007.
00 01 02 03 04 Operations Safety is our primary concern, and our internal procedures and processes ensured that there were no significant incidents during the year.
On time performance in 2004 The operation has run superbly during the year with on-time performance increasing from 74.3% to 80.5% of flights within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival time.
This improved performance was achieved alongside the addition of 51 new routes and the introduction of a new aircraft type.
81% of flights arriving Our people At 30 September 2004 there were 3,727 employees in easyJet, an increase within 15 minutes of 355 during the year, well below the overall growth rate in the business.
To maintain the rate of growth, particularly whilst dealing with a difficult operating environment and a number of other significant challenges, and still keep the downward pressure on our unit costs, is testament to the 7% focus of all of our staff.
better than It has been a challenging year for many of easyJets people and I am grateful to them for their professionalism and dedication to our values and customer in 2003 service.
Our success is rooted in them and their ability to adapt, innovate and act, and we look forward to many more years of continued growth.
Trading outlook In this first quarter, we expect to see the load factor and total revenue per passenger broadly the same as last year.
We continue to have limited visibility in regard to future fares, however we expect the remaining 94% months of winter to be challenging and that competition will be intense.
In addition, fuel prices and foreign exchange remain unknown factors.
of flights arriving Nevertheless, we have a resilient business, operating in a growth market, within one hour which we can readily tailor to a variety of market conditions.
As such we have considerable confidence in what can be achieved.
