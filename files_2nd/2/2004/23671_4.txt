Chief Executives Report The Group continued during 2004 to build upon the platform established within its operating businesses and overall this resulted in a significant increase in revenues and profitability.
Market conditions for UK equities continued to be challenging during much of the year and it is therefore a testament to the strength of the business models that we have built to produce results showing very clear progress from the previous period.
Our two key operating businesses, Evolution Securities and Christows, both performed extremely well at the revenue and profitability levels and in the achievement of key operating objectives.
This, together with further significant asset realisations in the period, resulted in the Group ending 2004 extremely well positioned to achieve further success in the coming period.
