We have benefited during the 26 weeks ended 25 January 2004 from the Operational review closure of three significant loss making stores in July 2003.
Approximately 4 million of annualised losses were being made by these stores.

The trading results of TJ Hughes TJH have been consolidated into the Group results for the period up to its disposal on 14 November 2003.
Operating profits before goodwill amortisation of TJH for the 42 weeks to that date amounted to 2.5 million compared to 6.6 million from the date of acquisition April 2002 to 31 January 2003.

52 weeks to 25 January 2004 We have opened 11 icon stores during the 52 weeks ended 25 January 2004 in small high street properties that were formerly occupied by JJB, where we have been unable to dispose of the lease.
The initial operating results from these stores is encouraging and is significantly better than the cost of having these stores vacant.
The icon stores sell a range of branded fashion products which are not currently available within JJB stores.
We have identified a further 6 sites which we intend to open under the icon format during 2004 and consideration is being given to further openings in this period.

We stated that we were experiencing a disappointing start to the current The Board believes that the changes made within the buying and merchandising accounting period with total turnover for the 10 weeks ended 4 April 2004 departments which have already seen the recovery of the gross margin, will help being 4.7 per cent lower than the same period last year which included a to meet the continuing competition within the retail clothing market and with the reduction in like-for-like turnover of 5.7 per cent.
The gross margin achieved strength of other product categories together with the continuing success of the during this period was in line with our expectations.
Slightly over half of the combined health club superstore opening programme, will achieve a successful shortfall in total turnover arose from two types of product: outcome to the results for the current accounting period.

Knight which was a period of very good weather: and Chief Executive 14 May 2004 Replica kit which has had difficult comparatives the England away kit which never sells as well as the home kit, was launched in March 2004 on the same day as the England home kit launch in 2003 also the Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool home shirts are now in the second and last year of their cycle and will be replaced with new shirts later during 2004.
The clothing category remains the most challenging part of our business and concerted efforts are being made to improve the ranges.
We believe that the strengthened buying and merchandising teams will address this issue but the relatively long product lead times delay the full benefits that can be achieved by these improvements.
However, our other product categories remain resilient and should contribute higher levels of profit.
Later in the current accounting period, we will benefit from increased turnover in the replica shirt category as a result of the Euro 2004 tournament and from the launch of new home shirts from Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.
We intend to build upon the significant success of our Leisure Division which continued during the 52 weeks ended 25 January 2004.
Since 25 January 2004, we have opened 2 combined health clubs superstores and a further 5 will be opened later in the period.
The demand for membership places at these new health clubs continues to be very promising and gives us further confidence in our openings strategy.
Every attempt will be made to step up the number of Leisure Division units being opened in future years and already 13 sites have been identified for openings during the accounting period commencing in February 2005.
In addition to the openings of the combined health club superstores, we will continue the migration to superstores from small high street stores with the opening of a further 12 superstores in the current accounting period.
It is believed that these openings together with a major refit programme which is referred to in the Property review on page 15 and is now underway, will have a beneficial impact upon the profits of the current accounting period.
