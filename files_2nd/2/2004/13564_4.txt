The Group continued to build up this aspect of the all enjoy strong demand trends stretching well into the future.
Revenue from services grew by 14 per cent to Rolls-Royce is well placed to benefit from this demand, 3.2 billion, which represented 55 per cent of total sales and having invested heavily in new products.

The Trent engine family has secured a and I cannot fail to be concerned over the contrast evident in the 50 per cent share of the engine market serving wide-bodied UK, where fewer students study the sciences each year.

06 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 The Group is exposed to exchange rate movements on foreign currencies, particularly the US dollar which continued to weaken relative to sterling throughout 2004.
We have, however, continued to pursue our strategy of hedging future net dollar revenues and at the end of 2004 had approximately US$9 billion of forward cover.
Our strong order book, the long-term services revenue stream and our focus on operational performance underpin the Groups expectations of continued growth in profits and reduction of average net debt in 2005.
We continue to target a ten per cent return on sales over the medium term, across all our businesses, as the business model develops and our operational efficiency continues to improve.
A memorable year We celebrated our centenary in 2004 with a huge variety of events, from Highland games in Derbyshire to open-air concerts and air shows, including an aerobatics display by the Red Arrows.

We also sponsored many special events notably a series of concerts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing by the London Symphony Orchestra, which, like us, was celebrating its 100th year.
So it was a year in which the unique character of Rolls-Royce was more than usually apparent to all of those who 5 work in the Group, a fact we were proud to acknowledge by presenting every employee with a copy of a beautifully produced book tracing the history of the companys first 100 years.
