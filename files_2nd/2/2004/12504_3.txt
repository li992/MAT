03 Premier Foods plc 01 02 David Kappler, Chairman Robert Schofield, Chief Executive Chief Executives review The business is on track and on strategy Group results continuing operations m 2004 2003 Sales 842.2 773.8 8.8% Operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items 107.4 85.6 25.5% Amortisation 10.1 9.2 Operating profit before exceptional items 97.3 76.4 27.4% Operating exceptional items 25.4 10.5 Operating profit 71.9 65.9 9.1% This is a strong set of results for 2004, in line with our expectations at the time of the IPO in July last year, despite the serious fire at our Bury St Edmunds factory in October and the challenging market conditions which led to slower sales over the Christmas period.
In summary, the business is on track and on strategy.
We have achieved this by continuing to implement a well-defined strategy based on the use of our scale to drive organic branded growth, to develop customer relationships and to deliver cost savings, whilst managing our retailer brands proactively and seeking further branded acquisitions.
The performance during the year has demonstrated the strength of the Companys strategy: Branded sales increased from 50% to 55% of grocery sales: Drive brands have shown strong growth: The Masterbrand strategy is progressing well with Hartleys and Crosse & Blackwell benefiting from significantly greater scale: Product innovation and brand extension are enhancing our brands with Loyd Grossman soups and Branston 02 sour pickles showing strong growth: The integration of Ambrosia during 2004 proceeded smoothly, with increased management focus on this brand delivering growth of 7% over 2003 based on pre and post acquisition sales in 2003, returning the brand and the category to growth after a number of years of decline: Our customer relationship strategy has enabled us to secure longer term contracts and pursue category development plans: 04 04 Pr Premier Foods plc emier Foods plc Chief Executives review Brand development, leveraging our scale and improved manufacturing efficiency have enabled us to increase our EBITA margin from 11.1% in 2003 to 12.8% in 2004: and The acquisition of the Birds and Angel Delight brands, which completed in February 2005, further strengthens our portfolio of great British food brands.
Continued focus on cost control and improving manufacturing efficiency drove margin improvement delivering an increase in operating profit before exceptional items from continuing operations of 27.4% to 97.3m.
These figures exclude Materne, a French spreads business, which was sold as part of the IPO.
Like-for-like grocery sales were level with 2003 and like-for-like grocery operating profit before exceptional items increased by 14.8%.
We have estimated that the fire at the Bury St Edmunds factory resulted in lost sales of 8.2m.
If we had achieved these sales, like-for-like grocery turnover would have increased by 1.3%.
3.0m has been recognised in operating profit in respect of the insurance claim for loss of profits associated with the fire.
We increased our marketing expenditure by 5% to 30.4m in 2004, reflecting our focus on drive brands, which showed sales of Loyd Grossman up 18%, Branston up 2% and Typhoo up 3%.
The gains made on Loyd Grossman and Branston are despite the fire and we estimate that these brands would otherwise have shown growth of 31% and 12% respectively.
Sales of Ambrosia were 7% higher than in 2003, rewarding the additional focus placed on the brand since its acquisition.
Hartleys also performed exceptionally well, with an organic sales increase of 19% over 2003.
Branded sales now represent 55% of our grocery product turnover, up from 50% in 2003.
We completed the closure of the Hadfield factory in the first quarter of the year and the transfer of tea production from Edinburgh to Moreton in December 2004.
The Edinburgh rationalisation programme cost 2.4m, and is expected to generate annual savings of 1.1m.
As previously stated, the 2003 comparatives benefited from the reversal of 3.3m of accruals made at the end of 2002, which subsequently proved to be over-provided.
EBITA margin represents operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items as a percentage of turnover.
Like-for-like excludes the results of Ambrosia which was acquired in December 2003.

We estimate that we would have shown growth of approximately 2.2%, but for the fire at our Bury St Edmunds factory.
The consolidation of our convenience foods products, particularly our foodservice offering under Crosse & Blackwell has created a 25m brand and this greater scale will help us to develop our foodservice business during 2005.
Branded sales in 2004 amounted to 38% of sales for the business, the same as 2003.
Operating profit before exceptional items for the division was 33.2m in 2004, an increase of 0.5m on 2003, though an increase of 2.7m after taking account of the accrual reversal referred to earlier.
This increase is primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiency, particularly savings from the closure of the Hadfield factory.
This business is seeing increases in raw material prices, principally tin plate, however we have achieved price rises on the affected products, which largely recovers the anticipated cost inflation.

The decline was principally due to the exit from certain low-margin retailer brand tea contracts.
Sales of Typhoo increased by 3% in 2004, with UK sales of London Fruit & Herb successfully transferred to the Typhoo brand.
Branded sales in 2004 amounted to 81% of sales for the business, up from 79% in 2003.
Operating profit before exceptional items for the Tea and Beverages segment increased by 5.0m to 31.9m.
This improvement comes from lower raw material costs, Ambrosia is savings starting to flow from the consolidation of tea production into the Moreton factory and the reallocation of marketing expenditure from Tea and Beverages to the number one other divisions.

Like-for-like sales increased by 2.3% with Hartleys, Roses, and Gales all performing strongly: like-for-like branded sales grew by 6%, offset by a decline in retailer brand sales of 1%.
The development of the Hartleys fruit masterbrand is progressing well with Chivers marmalades successfully transferred during the second half of 2004 and the transfer of Rowntrees jellies currently underway.
On completion of the brand consolidation, the Hartleys brand will have sales of 33.0m based on 2004 turnover, providing real economies of scale in advertising.
Our initiatives to improve the display of the spreads fixture has helped Hartleys to achieve organic growth over 2003 of 19% to become the UKs leading jam brand.
The integration of Ambrosia went smoothly, with the acquired business fully integrated by the end of the first quarter of 2004.
We launched a brandy-flavoured custard and new yoghurt-pot style four pack of custard and rice puddings in the fourth quarter of the year.
These product developments and the enhanced focus that we have been able to apply to the brand resulted in an increase in like-for-like sales for Ambrosia of 7% in 2004.
In February 2005, Ambrosia launched its first TV advertising campaign for six years.
Branded sales in 2004 amounted to 69% of sales for the business, up from 54% in 2003.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased from 11.2m in 2003 to 26.7m in 2004.
This was mainly due to the inclusion of Ambrosia, which contributed 10.4m at the operating profit level, compared to 0.7m in 2003.
Like-for-like operating profit before exceptional items increased by 5.8m to 16.3m, principally as a result of the improved branded sales and reduced manufacturing costs following the closure of the Hadfield factory.
Like-for-like includes pre and post acquisition sales for 2003.

A number of the Groups customers have indicated that they intend to claim for their costs associated with the product recall.
These claims may comprise claims for damage to their own products, the costs of recalling and destroying recovered products and claims for consequential loss among others.
Given the nature of the recall, the limited number of claims that have been received at this stage and intrinsic uncertainty involved in such situations, it has not been possible to quantify fully the claims.
However, the Company has made a preliminary assessment of the quantum and nature of the claims based on a set of assumptions reflecting managements current view of the situation and after having taken appropriate legal advice.
At this time, based on this assessment, its own insurance position and its potential claims against its suppliers and their own insurers, the Group does not believe that it has any material financial exposure.
09 09 Pr Premier Foods plc emier Foods plc Chief Executives review Outlook As a result of improving conditions through January, we remain confident that we will achieve sales growth for the full year in line with our strategic targets.
This will be underpinned by our strong pipeline of new product and category development which will help to drive branded sales growth.
We continue to focus on manufacturing efficiency through capital and other projects.
We do not anticipate any significant net raw material price movements beyond the rise in tin plate costs, referred to earlier.
Following completion of the Birds acquisition, we have commenced the integration process and our initial impressions are very encouraging.
This acquisition will lift sales by our Spreads and Desserts business to over 200.0m and increase its branded sales mix to approximately 72%.
