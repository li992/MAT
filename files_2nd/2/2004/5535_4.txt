Chief Executives Review Results 2004 has been another year of strong progress for Enterprise Inns.
Total operating profit before exceptional items increased by 37% to 402.7 million, driven by like-for-like operating profit growth of 8% in the core estate and the successful acquisition of Unique at the end of March 2004.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 32% to 47.5 pence.

Our recognition of the importance of quality has driven our strategic direction over the past few years.
We have only made acquisitions, individual or corporate, that have improved the overall quality and potential of our estate.
We have constantly reviewed our estate to identify and dispose of those outlets which we do not consider to have long-term potential and we have invested, alongside licensees, in unlocking additional profits where appropriate.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2004 5 Chief Executives Review Excluding the acquisition of Unique, we have this year purchased 22 pubs for a total consideration of 12.9 million.
We have of course looked at many more, including some corporate sales, but did not bid for these as they did not meet our strategic criteria.
In addition to the 239 pubs which we decided to sell to meet possible competition concerns and for which we received proceeds in line with book value of 61 million, we sold a further 197 pubs for a consideration of 49.5 million, giving an overall profit for the year of 1.3 million.
We continued to invest in our pubs alongside licensees, spending more than 50 million on the enlarged estate.
We estimate that our licensees spent a further 60 million on an annualised basis, indicating that together we are investing more than 5% of estimated pub turnover in maintaining and improving the quality of our pubs.
Whilst an unbranded estate such as ours does not require the same levels of maintenance capital expenditure as most branded outlets, we are confident that these levels of investment more than maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.
Our commitment to quality and our joint expenditure with licensees is proving to be highly effective and has helped to improve the quality, value and earnings potential of our pubs, with average operating profit per pub up to 55,800 for the enlarged estate.

The pubs are, however, no more than bricks and mortar unless we are able to attract and retain the best quality licensees.
It is therefore vital that our pubs provide a worthwhile living for our hard-working licensees and in this respect we are pleased that our estimated average licensee profit has increased by 8% during the year, driven equally by organic growth and the improving quality of the estate.
There are now just 152 pubs in the enlarged estate where earnings potential is less than 15,000, whilst more than two-thirds have potential earnings of more than 30,000, almost half of those more than 45,000.
In the enlarged estate of 8,727 pubs: More than 94% of pubs are let on substantive leases or tenancies.
Bad debt costs for the year reduced to just 0.2% of sales turnover, down from 0.3% last year.
Rent concessions at 30 September 2004 amounted to just 0.4% of the total rent-roll, down from 0.5% last year.
Over the past year, we have completed more than 1,200 rent reviews, with just 5 going through any form of arbitration before being agreed.
Of those which went to arbitration, all were found in our favour.
Our database has more than 700 fully funded, screened, quality applicants for pubs, three times the number available to let.
We remain convinced that the leased and tenanted format provides a low-cost opportunity for entrepreneurial licensees to run their own businesses, offering to the consumer a wide range of non-formulaic retail styles and huge choice of top quality products.
Unique Pub Company At the end of March 2004, we completed the acquisition of Unique, which had for the past two years been independently managed as an associate business.
At the half year our 16.8% share of Uniques operating profit before exceptional items was 19.0 million, accounted for as an associate company, whereas in the second half of the year the operating profit before exceptional costs of the Unique business was 123.0 million.
The business is performing comfortably in line with our expectations, generating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 239 million in the twelve months to 30 September 2004.
As anticipated, we are dealing with the integration in two stages, firstly transferring all administrative functions to our head office in Solihull.
Thanks to the efforts of the Enterprise team and the cooperation of Unique staff, this process has been highly successful and from 1 September 2004 all functions had been transferred and the closure of the Unique offices put into effect.
During this period we have also renegotiated substantially all of the supply arrangements common to each company.
We have always maintained close and cooperative relationships with our suppliers and I am pleased that these renegotiations were very positive and resulted in buying synergies in line with our expectations.
Both closure and redundancy costs of 15 million and resulting cost savings of around 25 million per annum have been in line with our expectations.
The two estates are now running in parallel, albeit with common telesales, distribution and administration.
It therefore remains for us to integrate the field-based operations of the estates, planned for April next year.
This will involve some disruption for the field team and for licensees alike but with careful planning and regular communication, we do not expect major issues to arise.
Legislative background We are pleased that the Licensing Act 2003 has reached the statute books and that it will become a reality during 2005.
If Local Authorities follow the spirit of the new legislation as set out in the Act, then we can look forward to greater flexibility in licensing for the benefit of licensees and consumers alike and, potentially, the development of a more civilised drinking culture across the UK.
We will be working hard with our licensees to ensure that they both understand the legislation and benefit from the opportunities it brings.
8 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2004 Chief Executives Review The legislation is, however, arriving at a time of increasing concern about binge drinking and, in particular, its impact on antisocial behaviour.
We are pleased that both the Prime Minister and the Home Office recognise that the problems are associated with a small minority of the population and that the solution is to target those outlets and individuals who encourage or engage in antisocial behaviour and to use existing police and local authority powers to deal with them.
There is no place in our industry for irresponsible low pricing and promotions.
A well-run pub is the home of responsible drinking, a controlled environment able to promote sensible, social drinking, more often than not accompanied by great food and entertainment.
High on the agenda are also the Governments proposals for the banning of smoking in public places, as outlined in the recent Public Health White Paper.
Enterprise has been at the forefront of an industry initiative to introduce a substantial reduction in smoking over the next four years, and we are pleased that the Government appears to have taken account of these proposals.
We share their view that a key element of any strategy should be the protection of staff and we are therefore proposing a ban on smoking behind or near the bar or serving areas within the next twelve months, in line with what is rapidly becoming common practice across the whole pub sector and ahead of the deadlines suggested in the White Paper.
The Government is also looking at a sensible period of consultation on the White Paper, with implementation not scheduled until the end of 2008, by which time the industry initiative would in any event have increased the no smoking areas in pubs to 80% of the floor area.
Government proposals currently envisage the division of the industry into non-smoking food pubs and wet led pubs and clubs where smoking is permitted.
We hope that through the consultation process the Government will permit segregated smoking and non-smoking areas within pubs, thus protecting those excellent rural and community outlets which not only provide such an important service to their communities, but also rely upon this broad range of trade to support a sustainable business.
In the end, working with Government, we are confident that the Governments objectives for the reduction of smoking can be achieved without putting many smaller pubs under pressure, with the resulting protection of jobs, tax revenues and amenity.
Conclusion This has been a busy and successful year for Enterprise.
Working alongside our licensees, we have seen mutual growth in earnings in a market which remains highly competitive and regulated.
Without doubt, our commitment to quality drives our success.
It may be a truism, but good pubs tend to do well and to get even better, gaining customers and reputation as they go.
There are so many quality reasons why people go to a particular pub and poor pubs, often offering little other than cheap beer in dull surroundings, are losing and will continue to lose market share.
The head office and field-based teams at Enterprise continue to perform ahead of expectations, tackling the challenge of an almost doubling in our size over the past year, enthusiastically working towards achieving our goal of providing the best service to our pub estate in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.
Once again we have delivered substantial growth in earnings and dividends to our shareholders, through our commitment to appropriate operating disciplines and steady growth in the core business, enhanced by the effective use of our strong and predictable cash flows.
The new financial year has started well and the team look forward to another exciting and challenging year of continued success and long-term growth in shareholder value.
