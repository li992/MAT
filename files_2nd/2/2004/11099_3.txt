Chief Executives Review INTRODUCTION Sales up In the year to January 2004 Group turnover was 2,516m, 14% ahead of the previous year.
Sales in NEXT Retail were up 14% 14% and in NEXT Directory were up 13%.
The year consisted of 52 weeks for NEXT Retail and Directory, compared with 53 weeks last year.
On a comparable 52 week basis NEXT Retail sales increased by 16% and Directory by 15%.
Operating Group profit before interest and tax increased by 23%.
The increase in operating profit was significantly ahead of growth in total profit up sales.
Full price sales which are the real driver of profit were up 16.8% whereas markdown sales were level with last year.
23% Tight control of costs also contributed to further growth in operating profit.
Share buybacks had two significant effects on the profit and loss account: An increased interest charge, which restricted the increase in profit after tax to 16%.
EarningsThe reduced number of shares in issue, which accelerated the growth in earnings per share to 34%.

We aim to achieve this by: long term growth Continuing to advance the underlying operating profit of the NEXT Group.
This will mainly be achieved through the development in EPS of product ranges, expansion of our selling space and the growth of our home shopping business.
Continuing to buy back our shares for cancellation as and when it is in the interests of our shareholders generally.
The increase in our share price and in interest rates makes buybacks less beneficial and this year we may not be as active in the market as in the last two years.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT PRODUCT Improving style, quality and value The style, quality and value of our ranges remain our highest priority.
We believe that it is the product that makes the brand successful, not vice versa.
Over the past year we have made significant improvements to our supply base and this, combined with a weaker dollar, has enabled us to pass on noticeable improvements in value to our customers without sacrificing gross margin.
This effort to improve value through better sourcing and selection will remain at the heart of our business in the year ahead.
Price deflation Beneficial As a result of improved value our average selling price has declined.
Some commentators see this as a concern, we do not.
As long as price price reductions are not at the expense of margin or quality then the drop in average selling price is an advantage.
This delivers better deflation value to our customers and so increases sales.
New product We continue to develop and expand our product ranges where we believe an understanding of our customers, combined with our design skills, can genuinely add value.
In the year ahead we will be focusing on improving our supplier base in some new product areas, in particular Home and Lingerie.
Whilst new product areas are exciting, we anticipate that the majority of our growth will still come from the development of our core clothing and home ranges.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT RETAIL Rationale for space expansion Our most important objective in NEXT Retail is to profitably expand our selling space.
We believe that new space will continue to make a contribution to the growth of sales and profits in the years ahead, because it enables us to offer our customers a greater choice of product in a more comfortable shopping environment.
The drive for new space is governed by strict financial criteria.
Every new store aims to pay back the net capital invested in less than 24 months and to achieve at least 15% store profit on sales before distribution and central costs.
When appraising new stores we account for downturn in neighbouring stores and do not factor in any future like-for-like growth.
The store must achieve its investment Sales from criteria on the basis of its expected first year sales.
new space exceeding Performance of new space target We have continued to develop our store portfolio both in and out of town.
This years portfolio of new space is exceeding its appraised by 12% sales target by 12% and is forecast to pay back the net capital invested in 12 months.
4 Chief Executives Review Profile of new space During the year we added a net 506,000 square feet to our trading space, increasing the total by 21% to 2,844,000 square feet.
The table below shows how our store portfolio has changed over the last three years.
Impact on like-for-like sales Underlying NEXT defines like-for-like stores as those that have traded for at least one full year and have not benefited from significant capital like-for-like expenditure.
Inevitably this includes all those stores that have been affected by new openings.
Over the past year we have shown sales both the headline like-for-like figures and separately shown the deflection to give underlying growth in stores that have not up 3.7% been affected by new openings.
Total like-for-like sales were up 1.8% whilst those stores unaffected by new openings were up 3.7%.
It is this last figure which we focus on when analysing the performance of our ranges.
Trial store in Denmark This year we will open a trial store in Copenhagen.
We believe that most of the major fashion markets in Europe are not yet similar enough to the UK to allow us to make adequate returns on investment in those countries.
However the success of our franchise in Iceland raised the possibility that the Scandinavian market may be more aligned with UK tastes.
Only time will tell, and it will be at least a year before we can draw any firm conclusions.
Even if a test store is successful in one overseas market it does not imply success will follow in other overseas markets.
Any further international expansion will be extremely cautious and the main opportunities for growth will remain in our core markets of the UK and Eire.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT DIRECTORY Directory profitability addressed At the half year we reported good growth in Directory sales but no growth in profit.
The corrective measures we outlined at the time, along with improved stock availability and reduced product returns rates, have been successful in restoring growth in profit.
Growing the customer base 13% growth The growth in new customers has been the most significant contributor to the growth of sales in our home shopping division.
in Directory We start the new year with 13% more customers than a year ago.
customers January 2004 January 2003 Growth Total active customers 1,660,000 1,467,000 13% During the last half of the year we experienced a noticeable decline in response rates to certain forms of customer recruitment.
As a result we have cut out some unprofitable advertising and direct mail.
We therefore currently expect more modest growth in customer numbers in the year ahead.
5 Chief Executives Review Expansion of pages and product offer We have continued to increase the number of pages in order to expand the choice of product available to the NEXT home shopper.
The table below shows how the pages printed for each product area have increased.
The fastest growth has come from the Home area.
PAGES 2004 2003 Growth Womens 890 829 7% Mens 490 465 5% Childrens 476 428 11% Home 652 454 44% TOTAL 2,508 2,176 15% Improving service Delivering We continue to improve and expand store based services for our Directory customers.
Last year over two million Directory items Directory were collected or returned via our stores.
In addition we have increased the number of customers who are able to use their Directory services in account to make purchases in NEXT stores from 424,000 in January 2003 to 588,000 in January 2004. store Inevitably this has meant there has been some transfer of business from Directory to Retail.
However, as both businesses are making similar net margins, our only concern is that the customer is able to purchase and return goods in the way that is most convenient to them.
In the coming year we will be looking at providing other call-centre and store based services, for example we will be trialling a Wedding List service.
PLANNED WAREHOUSE INVESTMENTS 50m of In order to support the growth of both Retail and Directory we will be making significant investments in warehousing over the warehouse next two years.
In August 2004 we will open a new warehouse specifically for Home product.
This will be 600,000 square feet capex over and incur fit out costs of 8 million.
In August 2005 we plan to open another warehouse for boxed stock, it will be 300,000 square next two feet, highly mechanised and cost in the region of 38 million to fit out.
In both cases the warehouses are being built to our years specification and will be leased.
NEXT FRANCHISE Our overseas franchise operation had another successful year, with sales increasing by 27% and achieving a profit of 5.3m.
At the end of January 2004 there were 70 franchise stores compared with 59 the previous year.
The Middle East continues to be our largest region with 30 stores.
Our partner in Japan now has 18 stores.
We expect further progress in the year ahead.
VENTURA Winning Ventura performed well ahead of our expectations, both in terms of sales achieved and costs controlled.
It commenced providing new clients services on behalf of several new clients, including the Pension Credit Service and British Gas.
Operating efficiencies have increased and we expect all existing call centre facilities will be fully occupied in the near future.
We are therefore pursuing opportunities to add capacity during the coming year in order to accommodate increasing demand from existing and new clients.
6 Chief Executives Review Venturas profit increased to 15.4m compared with 11.2m the previous year.
Whilst the majority of this profit came from customer service activities the residual consumer credit business remains profitable and contributed 2m for the year.
We continue to make good progress in broadening the client base through offering high quality services at very competitive prices.
We believe that Ventura can grow over the next five years, however, following the re-negotiation of Venturas largest contract at lower margins we expect profits to take a step backwards in the year ahead.
OTHER ACTIVITIES Profitable The profit in Other Activities of 18.6m includes 17.6m from NEXT Asia, our product sourcing company in the Far East, and the sourcing first full year contribution of 6.1m from NEXT Near East, which we purchased in July 2002 and sources product manufactured offices in Turkey, Sri Lanka and Romania.
Other Activities also includes our Property Management Division, Choice an associated company which operates a chain of thirteen discount stores, Cotton Traders an associated company selling its own brand products and Central Costs, the largest of which is a pension charge.
6m The total cost of the Groups pension schemes increased to 17.6m from 11.2m last year, including a charge of 6m in respect increase in of the past service deficit.
A year ago we estimated the deficit to be 62m whereas at January 2004 we estimated it to pension be 44m.
This would require reduced annual payments of 4m, in addition to the regular cost, to eliminate the deficit over the next charge thirteen years.
We have continued to recognise the cost of our Sharesave and Management share option schemes through the Profit and Loss account.
Over the past five years the average annual charge has been 5.3m, this year the charge amounted to 5.1m compared with 8.2m last year.
Almost 9,000 of our employees currently hold a total of 9 million share options in NEXT.
Our employee share ownership trust purchases shares in the market and issues them to employees when options are exercised, the 8 million shares which it owns are shown in the balance sheet as a fixed asset investment.
SHARE BUYBACKS Another During the year we purchased a further 21.7 million shares for cancellation at an average price of 961p, for a cash cost of 209m.
7.6% This was 7.6% of the shares in issue at the beginning of the year.
The average number of shares in issue during the year was purchased 275 million and at 31 January there were 265 million outstanding.
As a direct result of share buybacks over the past two years, this for years earnings per share were enhanced by 12%.
cancellation It is worth repeating the Boards policy on the use of debt to buy back shares.
The primary use of capital will continue to be investment in the development of the core businesses.
Share buybacks will not be made at the expense of capital investment in the business.
We aim to maintain the companys investment grade credit rating.
We intend to continue with our strategy of buying back shares as and when it is in the interests of shareholders generally.
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW 300m At January 2004 net borrowings were 306m compared with 189m the previous year.
The cash outflow of 117m was due to 10 year the 209m cost of shares purchased for cancellation, excluding this the cash inflow was 92m.
Borrowings are financed through a Bond 300m 5.25% 10 year bond, which was issued in June 2003, and medium term bank facilities.
The majority of our borrowings are now at fixed interest rates and therefore, at current levels of debt, any rate changes in the medium term will not have a significant impact on our cost of borrowing.
Capital expenditure amounted to 101m, of which 82m was spent on stores.
Stock levels at 264m were in line with our trading requirements.
Debtors of 378m includes the 272m account balances of our Directory customers.
These balances have increased faster than our home shopping sales as many customers use their Directory Storecard to make additional purchases whilst in our stores.
7 Chief Executives Review DIVIDEND Dividend The Directors are pleased to recommend a final dividend of 24p against 21p last year, bringing the total for the year to 35p compared increase with 31p last year, an increase of 13%.
The dividend is covered 2.6 times by earnings per share of 92.1p.
13% CURRENT TRADING The new season has started well, however, it is important to note that this years trading statement includes Mothers Day which was not the case last year.
We estimate this has increased sales by at least 1% in the seven week period.
In the first seven weeks since the start of the new financial year NEXT Retail sales are 17% ahead of the previous year.
Like-for-like sales in the 306 stores which have been trading for at least one year are 3.0% ahead.
Included in those stores are 26 that, as anticipated, have been directly affected by new store openings and extensions.
Underlying sales in the 280 stores which have not been affected by new space are 4.8% ahead of last year.
NEXT Directory sales for the first seven weeks are 13% ahead of the previous year.
Taken together, sales for the NEXT Brand are 16% ahead.
Our next trading statement will be made on 13 May 2004, which is the date of our Annual General Meeting.
