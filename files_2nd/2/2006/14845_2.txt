Stanley Leisure plc 2006 Annual Report and Accounts 10 Casino highlights London Casinos 4m refurbishment of Crockfords In common with other operators, our four London casinos were completed in July 2005 adversely affected by the security issues in July 2005.
We experienced Unprecedented growth in attendance a signi cant decline in attendance levels and turnover in August which levels at our Provincial casinos following continued in September and October.
This lower level of activity caused introduction of early freedoms results in the first half to be depressed.
However, attendance levels Acquisition of two casinos in Southend recovered in the second half with operating pro ts of 4.1m 2005: and one in Bristol 1.4m.
This strong second half performance mitigated the impact of Three new casino licences granted in the disappointing first half, resulting in an operating pro t for the year Nottingham, Shef eld and Liverpool of 12.2m 2005: 15.0m.
The refurbishment of Crockfords, our agship casino in Mayfair, was completed in July 2005 at a cost of 4m.
This investment will ensure that Crockfords reputation as one of the Our brands most high quality and exclusive casinos in the world is maintained.
At the Palm Beach casino, we have recently reached agreement with our neighbour, the refurbished Radisson Mayfair, for direct access between the hotel and the casino.
The agreement also allows guests to register automatically with the casino at the same time as they check into the hotel.
The Colony and The Mint casinos both performed satisfactorily.
The process of relocating The Mint to Earls Court continues.
Our recent application received Planning Of cers approval but was turned down by the local authoritys Planning Committee.
We have appealed against this decision.
Stanley Leisure plc 2006 Annual Report and Accounts 11 Chief Executives Review Admissions Provincial Casinos 2005 The Provincial casino estate enjoyed a year of record growth fuelled by the early freedoms of deregulation introduced in October 2005.
In the second half of the year attendance levels grew by an unprecedented 17% with our recently refurbished casinos reporting a 23% growth in attendance.
These strong growth statistics are re ected in the trading results for the Provincial casinos with operating pro t, before 2,787,000 exceptional items, of 21.9m 2005: 18.9m including a contribution 2006 of 0.6m from the acquisition of two casinos in Southend and one in Bristol.
The increase in attendance levels and the expected lower drop per head from new players has had an impact on win per admission for the year which fell by 7% to 39 2005: 42.
However, as a result of careful cost control and other ef ciencies, earnings before interest 3,157,000 and tax EBIT per admission has grown 2% to 8.03 2005: 7.84.
We are increasingly focusing on win per admission and EBIT per admission as key performance indicators.
Drop per head solely re ecting activity on table games is becoming a less appropriate measure as machine income grows.
Slot machine income Following the introduction of the early freedoms, including the removal of the 24 hour 2004 2005 2006 membership rule and increased machine numbers, we rapidly installed the permitted additional slot machines.
These new machines have proved very popular and even though the number of machines has more than doubled, the average EBIT per machine has quickly returned to over 300 per week.

Stanley Leisure plc 2006 Annual Report and Accounts 12 2005 Gambling Act Licences Current and future regulations Although the 2005 Gambling Act was enacted in April 2005, it was possible, until April 2006, to continue to apply for licences under the 1968 Act.
We have applied for eight such 17 new casino licences will be permitted new casino licences.
Of these, three Nottingham, Shef eld and Liverpool have been in three categories: eight Small 750 sq m : granted.
We have outstanding licence applications on a further five locations Cardiff, eight Large 1,500 sq m : and one Regional Hull, Reading, Glasgow and Leeds all of which are being progressed.

uk As no further licence applications under the 1968 Act are possible, if all applications being progressed were successful, the maximum number of 1968 Act casino licences would be Operating casinos in the UK 250.
However, we believe this maximum is likely to be materially overstated, as a number Number of Number of of applications will fail.
Trade objections to new licences remain high and the Licensing Provincial London At 31 March 2006 casinos casinos Total Authorities continue to apply the demand criterion.
So, although an increase in capacity Company: from outstanding applications is expected, we believe it will be tempered by the continued Stanley Leisure plc 40 4 44 enforcement of the demand criterion.

To date, with careful management, this has not had a material effect on our four casinos in Scotland.
With a similar ban very likely to be introduced in England in 2007 we are modifying our casinos to enable access to external areas, where possible, for players who wish to smoke.
550 520 International Betting Our International Betting Operation has reported good results for the financial year with turnover up 27% to 32.0m 2005: 25.2m and operating pro t up 90% at 5.5m 2005: 2.9m.

We remain con dent that the agency model can be successfully replicated in a number of other European countries.
Management and Employees 347 362 898 On behalf of the Board as a whole, I should like to thank all our colleagues who have helped contribute to these results.
I should also like to record the Boards appreciation to Lord Steinberg who has indicated his intention to retire as Chairman at the end of the year.
I know I am not alone in having International Betting Operation enjoyed working with him and have learnt an enormous amount from him.
I am delighted Turnover that, although retiring from the Board, he has agreed to accept the position of Life President of the Group.

The Provincial estate continues to bene t from the early freedoms introduced in October 2005 with attendance levels continuing to grow.
The London casinos have followed their normal seasonal pattern and enjoyed good attendance and drop.
However, there have been a number of material losses to major players, which although within normal limits, have caused our win margin for the first three months of the year to be lower than we had budgeted.
As stated previously, our results in London can change quickly depending on our luck and the luck of our players.
The International Betting Operation has experienced record levels of business for the first quarter, driven by the FIFA World Cup.
Unfortunately, with much of this business being generated through our Italian agents, the results of many of the games were not good from our point of view and have led to a negative contribution from this tournament.
