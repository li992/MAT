Our staff are shareholders in the business and are motivated to make a full contribution to the Groups performance.
I would like to thank every member of staff for their hard work and dedication in 2006.
Outlook I believe Mapeley is extremely well placed to continue its strategy and we are committed to maintaining a strong performance through both organic growth and further acquisitions.
Whilst the commercial property market remains competitive and the pressure on nancing costs increases, we continue to nd good opportunities to invest.
So far in 2007 we have acquired 95.1 million of assets and have a healthy pipeline currently under evaluation.
Our acquisitions database continues to grow as does our knowledge of the markets we operate in and intend to target.
Both of these factors continue to drive our competitive advantage in acquiring attractive regional assets.
2007 promises to be another exciting year for the UK real estate sector, particularly following the arrival of REITs.
At Mapeley, we do not currently intend to convert to REIT status as we already benefit from similar tax advantages to that which the REIT regime conveys.
Mapeley offers an attractive yield and a real growth opportunity to invest indirectly in the UK regional property market in a tax efficient manner.
Mapeley is well-placed to further ex its strengths of in-depth local market knowledge, strong relationships with tenants and its diverse regional operating platform to drive further shareholder value in 2007.
I look forward to the year ahead.
