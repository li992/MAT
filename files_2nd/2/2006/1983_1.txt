The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2006 10 Chairman and Chief Executives introduction In our 2005 Annual Report and Accounts we stated that the group was DELIVERING Focused for Growth.
We are pleased to report an increase in our revenue of 7% in 2006, which has been delivered by a combination of organic growth RESULTS... of 2% and targeted acquisitions.
The Permaclean acquisition, completed in January 2007, marks an important INVESTING first step in our ambition to achieve a national workwear business of real scale FOR GROWTH in Germany.
We expect that our acquisitions, which totalled 96 million in 2006 and 2007 to date, will deliver good returns once they are fully integrated into the business.
There is positive momentum in most of our markets in Continental Europe, where profits increased ahead of revenues and our operating margin was 16.3% 2005: 16.1%.
The UK continued to face the more significant challenge from increased costs and difficulties in obtaining matching price increases, but the expected benefit from acquisitions was delivered in the second half of 2006.
Overall the group traded in line with our expectations in 2006.

Our net finance expense was 9.6 million compared with 7.2 million last year, reecting both interest rate rises and the additional funding required for the investments we have made.
Our adjusted earnings per share rose 11% to 35.7 pence from 32.1 pence last year helped by a small decrease in the effective tax rate from 28.8% to 28.3%, and taking into account the 2005 share consolidation.
During the period we realised exceptional income totalling 2.8 million, which primarily related to the further receipt of cash from the sale of the HSS business.
Amortisation of acquired customer contracts and intellectual property rights amounted to 6.1 million compared with 1.8 million last year, due to the full year effect of the 2005 and 2006 acquisitions.
Operating profit after these items was 91.6 million 88.8 million.

The total dividend is covered two times by the adjusted earnings per share.
Strategy summary and achievements Our core strategy is to build leading market positions in textile maintenance from which to deliver revenue growth both organically and by making acquisitions.
These acquisitions are either bolt-on to our existing scale businesses or are investments in expanding markets within our core area of expertise.
We focus on managing our operations efficiently to ensure our growth in revenues delivers sustainable profit growth, stable cash ows and higher levels of return to shareholders.
Geographically we remain focused on Europe.
In 2006, we have continued to invest to broaden the reach of our existing business through bolt-on acquisitions but also to expand our platform for future growth.
In December 2006, we agreed to acquire the Permaclean Group in Germany, which completed in January 2007.
The Permaclean acquisition is an important step in establishing a workwear business in Germany on a national scale in line with our stated strategy.
In the UK we have invested in an improved production network and direct sales opportunities to complement our existing service areas.
We continue to review areas for further expansion.
Revenue m continuing operations Geographical expansion, particularly into Central Europe, remains an important 2002 489.6 area of development.
In 2006, we spent a significant amount of time looking 2003 651.6 at the opportunities for market entry through acquisition into the Czech 2004 645.4 Republic but we have not yet been able to nd companies of the right prole.
We are reviewing our strategy for entry into that market as well as continuing 2005 655.7 to look at other markets in Central Europe.
2006 704.6 We are investing in new plants where we see the opportunity for more significant Operating profit m continuing operations growth.
In 2006, we made further investment in plants in Poland and in Norway Before exceptional items and amortisation of customer contracts and also in our existing workwear business in Germany.
At the same time we have and intellectual property rights divested businesses where we see limited growth opportunities.
In 2006, we sold our 2002 64.7 small business in France, which was serving hotels and restaurants from a single plant 2003 84.1 in Paris, as well as our last remaining at linen plant in Lillehammer, which leaves our 2004 91.1 Norwegian business now focused on higher margin workwear, mats and washrooms.

Christer has worked for Berendsen since 2001 and has been Managing Director since January 2005.
He remains with us until June and the process to appoint his successor is under way.
The existing management team continue actively to follow the agreed growth strategy.
Steve Finch, the Managing Director in the UK, and his team have succeeded in delivering a good result in the very challenging UK market where they have seen competitors exiting and their operational excellence has contributed greatly to WE EXPECT the years performance.
We have experienced national management teams in each of the countries TO DELIVER A where we operate.
They and their staff fully support our growth strategy and their commitment and hard work during the year has been a major contribution SATISFACTORY to the group results in 2006.
We thank them all on behalf of the board and OUTCOME our shareholders.
Other financial matters FOR 2007 In May 2006 we concluded a private placement transaction to provide the group with additional sources of nancing, to extend the term of the committed funding and to increase the level of xed borrowings.
The private placement was with US institutions for $250 million at attractive rates, which we swapped principally into xed euro, Danish krone and Swedish krona borrowings.
We used these, to repay amounts drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility, which remains at 420 million.
In the same month we completed our B share programme by repurchasing the remaining shares for 6.5 million.
In May and June 2006 we purchased 825,000 Davis shares in the market for a total cost of 3.6 million and hold them as treasury shares.
In December 2006 we made a payment of 12.5 million into the groups main UK Pension Plan to fund the past service deficit which, when added to the 5 million funding made earlier in the year, totalled 17.5 million for 2006.
The deficit on this UK plan was 25.3 million at 31 December 2006 before we made a further payment into the plan of 12.5 million in January 2007.
Our balance sheet remains strong with gearing of 60% at 31 December 2006 57%.
Taking account of the January 2007 pension funding and our acquisitions in 2007 the pro forma gearing is 77%.
The nancing of the Permaclean acquisition was made from drawings under the revolving credit facility in January 2007.
We have increased the proportion of borrowings at xed rates by entering into two further five year swap agreements for a total of 155 million 37 million in January 2007 at a rate of 4.4% and our gross xed borrowings now amount to 252 million 65% of total borrowings at an average annual rate of 4.1%.
This is in line with the groups policy of maintaining at least 50% of gross borrowings at xed rates.
Our interest was covered 10 times by operating profits in 2006 13 times.
Our post tax return on invested capital was 8.4%, up from 8.2% last year.
Outlook On the Continent, we expect further progress through organic growth, the benefit of bolt-on acquisitions and the expansion of our workwear business in Germany through the Permaclean acquisition.
In the UK, while we see no significant overall easing in the difficult market conditions as yet, we will continue with tight operational management and expect increased contributions from acquisitions.
Overall we expect to deliver a satisfactory outcome for 2007.
