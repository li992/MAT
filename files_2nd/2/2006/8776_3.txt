Total revenue for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 is 3.6 per cent lower than for the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005 2.4 per cent lower on a 52 week comparison.
The decrease in like-for-like revenue of locations which have traded for over 52 weeks, on a 52 week comparison basis, is 4.3 per cent.
Included in these figures is the increase in total revenue from the Leisure Division of 42.2 per cent 44.3 per cent on a 52 week comparison, which reflects in part the increase in the number of operating units within this Division.
The strong competition which affected our retail store revenue in the first half of the accounting period to 29 January 2006 continued into the second half of the period.
However, the decline in revenue slowed as a result of the promotional stance that we took from October 2005.
The retail store revenue in the first half of the accounting period was also severely affected by the lower level of revenue from England replica products which had benefited in the first half of 2004 from the Euro 2004 tournament.
Revenue from all the retail stores in the first half of the accounting period to 29 January 2006 fell by 28.3 million or 8.1 per cent, whilst revenue in the second half year fell by 2.9 million or 0.8 per cent.
That comparative figure for the second half of the accounting period to 30 January 2005 has been adjusted for the fact that it was a 27 week period.
This lowering of the decrease in retail store revenue during the second half of the accounting period to 29 January 2006 was achieved as a result of the promotional stance that we took from October 2005.
However, this had a consequent effect upon the gross margin achieved in our retail stores whereby the combined gross margin achieved during the first half of the accounting period including the gross margin from our health clubs of 49.5 per cent, fell to 45.4 per cent in the second half year.
The total gross margin achieved by the Group including that from the health clubs for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006, was 47.3 per cent, which compares to 48.0 per cent achieved in the 53 week comparative period.
Net operating expenses increased by 8.7 million during the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006, compared to the 53 weeks of the previous accounting period, increased to 13.9 million or 4.6 per cent on a 52 week comparison.
The increase in net operating costs primarily resulted from the higher number of Leisure Division sites in operation during the accounting period just ended, when compared to last year.
Net operating expenses were also affected by: A charge of 1.9 million 2005: restated NIL in respect of a further increase in provisions made against possible liabilities in the action brought against JJB by the Office of Fair Trading and which is currently under appeal by the Company at the Court of Appeal.
A reduction in the charge for depreciation of 7.6 million, resulting from a review of the useful economic lives of certain categories of property, plant and equipment which had previously been depreciated over 10 years: and A net gain on the disposal of property, plant and equipment of 2.9 million 2005: restated a net loss of 0.8 million.
4 Chief Executives statement continued Serious About Brands Review of operating results continued Whilst undertaking the impairment review on the value of goodwill in the Balance sheet for the introduction of the International Financial Reporting Standards in February 2005, the Board also considered the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.
It found that many items of property, plant and equipment within the operating units, had useful economic lives that more closely matched the length of the short-term lease of the property in which they were constructed, rather than the 10-year previously estimated life which had formed the basis of the depreciation charge in previous accounting periods.
The useful economic lives of these items of property, plant and equipment have been revised going forward from 30 January 2005 and the consequent effect upon the Income statement for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 is to reduce the charge for depreciation by 7.6 million.
The operating profit fell by 44.7 per cent from a restated 62.1 million to 34.3 million.
Operational review JJB product and brand development The following table shows the percentage of JJB retail store revenue for each product category from both standalone retail stores and from the retail stores forming part of the combined units in the Leisure Division: 52 weeks to 53 weeks to 29 January 30 January 2006 2005 % % Textiles 35 35 Footwear 32 33 Equipment and accessories 15 14 Replica products 11 12 Golf and cycles 7 6 100 100 Revenue from textiles and footwear suffered from strong retail competition whilst replica products were affected by difficult comparisons from the Euro 2004 competition during the previous year.
Revenue from equipment, accessories, golf and cycle products showed an improvement over the comparative period.
The reduction in revenue from textiles and footwear products contrasts with the increase in the number of those items sold of between 4 and 6 per cent, confirming that demand for these products is still strong, but at lower price levels than those achieved in earlier accounting periods.
Our retail product strategy continues to be to provide a wide range of sports branded products including ranges from the premium brands of Nike and Adidas, supplemented with more competitively priced products from secondary brands and from brands which are marketed exclusively by ourselves within the UK.
Competition on the product ranges from the premium brands comes principally from other specialist sports retailers whilst competition on lower priced products comes from a wider range of clothing and footwear retailers as well as the major supermarket chains.
Our recent competitive stance is aimed at maintaining market share whilst we pursue a strategy which aims to differentiate our product ranges from those of our principal competitors.
A number of other initiatives are currently being developed: In March 2005, we acquired the Slazenger licence for the design, sourcing and sales of golf clubs and related clothing and footwear in the EU.
Initial results from the sale of these products are encouraging and have led to a higher gross margin being earned within the golf product category: Our transactional website came into operation in September 2005, the fulfilment of transactions being dealt with by Zendor.
Revenue from the website is currently equivalent to that of a JJB superstore: Our Sports Sponsorship Division has recently signed a 10 year licensing agreement with Rangers FC, for an initial consideration of 18 million, to design, source and retail Rangers merchandise throughout our JJB retail store chain.
The agreement will commence with the launch of a new home replica kit in June 2006.
Our existing agreement to source replica kit for Everton FC has recently been extended to enable us to also become responsible for the retailing of these products: and On 4 May 2006, we acquired the issued share capital of Golf TV who are the UK operators of The Golf Channel and the Golf TV Pro-Shop Channel.
We intend that the access this will give us to two TV channels will enable us to promote our range of golf products and to later extend the product range to many other products which we are currently selling in our retail stores and on-line.
6 Chief Executives statement continued Serious About Fitness Leisure Division During the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006, we opened 11 combined health club superstores which also included 2 indoor soccer centres.
At 29 January 2006, the Leisure Division traded from 32 combined units, which included 6 indoor soccer centres.
The growth of this division is reflected in the health club membership figures which totalled 136,800 members at 29 January 2006 from the 32 clubs in operation at that date, compared to 88,400 members from the 21 health clubs in operation at 30 January 2005.
The concept of locating a superstore on a mezzanine floor, which we have constructed, with a health club on the ground floor, is unique within the UK.
The savings from only paying rent on the footprint and receiving 2 revenue streams from 1 building enables the benefits in running costs to be passed on in low membership fees to members which results in health club memberships becoming a very strong value-for-money offering.
This value-for-money offering is further supported by the attractiveness to members of a well-equipped gym, swimming pool, health spa, steam room, aerobics studio and bar.
The Board continues to be very satisfied with the operating results of our Leisure Division, particularly taking into account the fact that the trading results of the stores located above the health clubs have, in common with standalone stores, been impacted adversely by the strong competitive forces in the retail market.
The principal features are: Revenue increased by 42.2 per cent to 89.2 million: Gross margin slightly lower at 68.6 per cent compared to 69.5 per cent: Operating profit before a share of head office and distribution centre costs increased by 56.4 per cent to 15.1 million although this benefited from the change in the basis of depreciation of which 3.6 million applies to the Leisure Division : and Operating profit, after a share of head office and distribution centre costs increased by 62.1 per cent to 11.1 million from 6.9 million which also benefited from the change in the basis of depreciation.
The maturity profile of health clubs and their pre-opening costs, which are expensed in the year of opening, results in newly-opened clubs not materially contributing to profits in their opening year.
The operating profit benefit of the 11 health clubs opened during the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 will therefore be more significant in the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 and in future accounting periods.
We have already identified 12 sites for the opening of combined health club superstores during the current accounting period and regard the continuing roll-out of these combined units as being an important part of our future strategy.
Current trading In common with many retailers, a significantly higher than average level of trading is enjoyed during the Easter holiday weeks which distorts comparisons if the comparative accounting periods differ in the number of holiday weeks which they contain.
At the time of the publication of our Preliminary Results on 20 April 2006 we referred to the current trading results for the 11 weeks to 16 April 2006: we reported an increase in total revenue of 5.8 per cent compared with the same period last year: the 2006 trading period however included only one of the Easter holiday weeks whilst 2005 contained two holiday weeks.
Included in the total revenue was a like-for-like increase from operating units which had been open for over 52 weeks of 2.6 per cent.
The strong competitive climate has continued into the current year and we have maintained our promotional stance during this period.
The gross margin achieved in the 11 weeks to 16 April 2006 was 46.1 per cent which compared to 49.0 per cent in the same period last year.
We will continue with the expansion of our Leisure Division with 12 combined sites planned to open during the current accounting period.
From 29 January 2006 to 16 April 2006, we opened a further 3 health clubs and the total membership at 16 April 2006 of the 35 clubs then in operation, was 147,000.
In addition to the combined sites, a further 3 high street superstores are to be opened during the current accounting period.
We do not anticipate any significant improvement in trading conditions during the current year.
We are however hopeful that we will benefit not only from improved revenue from replica products as a result of the FIFA World Cup but also from the recently signed Rangers contract, and from the launch of both home and away kits from several of the principal Premiership clubs.
The Board also expects a benefit from a full years contribution from the health clubs opened last year.
