The rise in volumes has been achieved by a broadening of product distribution supported by the establishment of a sales focused call centre, which has benefited both the car and retail finance businesses and has resulted in a significant number of new introducers being signed up during the year.
Additionally, the streamlining of both internal and external processes has improved operating efficiency and delivered an improved service to our introducers.

Pension scheme During the period the Group made a special contribution of 14.6 million to the staff pension scheme.
The amount was equal to the IAS 19 deficit at 30 September 2005.

The special contribution places the scheme on a more secure financial footing, as well as minimising the Group's ongoing payments to the Pension Protection Fund.
