Customers and employees We should like to thank our customers for their continued loyalty and support during a difficult year.

Equally, the commitment and dedication of our employees has helped us manage the difficult situation we faced in 2006, while still maintaining momentum towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives.
We should like to record our thanks for their continued support.
Outlook The overall outlook for our markets in 2007 is difficult, with the timing of recovery in trading conditions in some of our North American end-markets uncertain.
When compared to the early quarters of 2006, lower levels of demand from our customers, together with the translation effect of the weaker US dollar, are likely to impact on the reported performance of the Group.
Our management team is focused on managing the business through the current slowdown and delivering long-term value to shareholders.
Actions we are taking to tighten control over costs further will help to offset the profit impact of weaker markets and during this period, we will continue to focus on cash generation through a reduction in levels of capital expenditure and working capital.
On behalf of the Board, we should like to thank you for your support in 2006 and assure you of our continuing commitment to making Tomkins even stronger in 2007.
