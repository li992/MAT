Group Chief Executives review Our 2006 performance reflects both the impact of the markets in which we operate, and the benefits derived from the changes we have been making in the business over the last two years.
Our housing activities in the first half undoubtedly benefited from a slightly stronger market in the areas covered by our southern operations but the pace of improvement slackened in the autumn.
In the north, after a brief improvement in the early months of the year, conditions reverted to being comparable to those of the previous year.
On commercial developments, occupier demand for product maintained a healthy flow of business, and with investor demand and yields still strong, the overall market remained favourable.
Two key factors especially influenced our performance.
First, David Wilson Homes strategy of growing the overall land bank in recent years enabled us to deliver modest operating profit growth in 2006 despite a 1.5% reduction in operating margin, before goodwill impairment, reorganisation costs and costs relating to the potential sale of the Company, and to lay down a strong base for the future.
Secondly, we saw the benefits of our policy of developing a strong and more diverse portfolio of commercial sites and product within Wilson Bowden Developments in order to increase profitability on an ongoing basis.
David Wilson Homes The key financial results are: Completions 5,486 2005: 5,027 Average selling price 204,600 2005: 198,200 Average unit size 1,104 square feet 2005: 1,087 square feet Apartments 650 square feet 2005: 665 square feet Houses 1,328 square feet 2005: 1,305 square feet Revenue 1,145.8m 2005: 1,033.5m Operating profit 208.4m 2005: 203.3m Operating margin 18.2% 2005: 19.7% Return on average capital employed 19.5% 2005: 20.9% Before goodwill impairment of 3.5m 2005: 7.3m, reorganisation costs of 1.2m 2005: nil and costs relating to the potential sale of the Company of 1.5m 2005: nil.
The above measures are the Key Financial Performance Indicators by which management monitors the performance of the business.
The Non-Financial Key Performance Indicators are customer satisfaction, land bank status, planning performance, health and safety performance, and employee retention and turnover.
An 18.1% increase in completions in the second half year to 3,351 2005: 2,837 brought the full year total to 5,486 2005: 5,027, up 9.1%.
The completions were delivered from an average of 143 sites 2005: 135 on sale over the year, 5.9% more than in 2005.
Sales per site over the twelve months rose by 3.2% to 38.4 2005: 37.2 and in the second half were up 4.8%.
This increase came more from the southern areas of our business than the north.
Average selling price per unit rose 3.2% during 2006 from 198,200 to 204,600.
This was caused by the combined effects of a 1.6% increase in the average unit size to 1,104 square feet 2005: 1,087 square feet : an increase in underlying net sales price per square foot of 1.0%: and 0.6% from the effect of mix.
The increase in unit size derives, in part, from a 1.0% reduction in the proportion of sales attributable to apartments which, in 2006, represented 33.1% of completions 2005: 34.1%.
For the year as a whole, sales incentives, which are accounted for within the net selling price referred to above, were 4.7% 2005: 5.1%.
Other incentives, which are accounted for within build costs and overheads, amounted to the equivalent of a further 1.6% 2005: 1.7% of turnover.
In total, incentives for the year were 6.3% 2005: 6.8%.
The main movements were the 9.1% increase in sales volumes and the 3.2% increase in average unit price.
The total turnover also includes 23.3m of land sales down from 37.3m in 2005.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2006 5 Group Chief Executives review continued Operating margin, before goodwill impairment, reorganisation costs and costs relating to the potential sale of the Company, was 18.2% 2005: 19.7%.
After deducting the impact of serviced land sales, the plot margin was down 1.8% at 17.5% 2005: 19.3%.
This decrease in plot margin was due to the impact of a higher proportion of new sites in the mix.
These sites suffered from build cost inflation and the low rate of sales price inflation we have experienced over the last two years since their purchase, particularly in the north of England.
Excluding the impact of mix changes, underlying build costs per square foot rose by around 1.5% in the year.
This was an excellent result which stemmed from our previously reported efforts on cost control and specification.
This work is ongoing and will continue to deliver benefits throughout 2007.
Reservations in the year increased by 17.4%, partly as a result of the increase in site numbers, and an increased rate of reservations per site achieved, but also as a consequence of increasing our efforts on forward sales, both private and social.
This enabled us to enter 2007 holding a carry forward order book of 1,886 units with a sales value of 306.9m, compared to 1,133 units and 178.5m at 31st December 2005.
The forward order book includes reservations at our Wimbledon and Thurrock sites, 261 of which are for 2008 9 completion.
Wilson Bowden Developments At the start of 2006 our expectations for Wilson Bowden Developments were for a year of consolidation for a business that had increased operating profits by 64% from 2002 to 2005.
This was to enable the business to cope with the major efforts involved in absorbing the workload associated with the development of the new mixed-use, town and city centre regeneration projects won during the preceding 18 months.
The design and planning period for such schemes tends to be longer, more complex and more demanding than our traditional projects.
In the event the business enjoyed another successful year, with further modest profit growth on the back of continued success in securing tenants, occupiers, and investor sales.
The key performance data is as follows: Residential completions 142 2005: 180 Commercial revenue 157.2m 2005: 161.5m Total revenue 185.6m 2005: 197.3m Operating profit 41.5m 2005: 41.1m Operating margin 22.4% 2005: 20.8% Return on average capital employed 23.1% 2005: 22.9% Before costs relating to the potential sale of the Company of 0.3m 2005: nil.
The Non-Financial Key Performance Indicators are land bank status, planning performance, health and safety performance, and employee retention and turnover.
The division completed, or partly completed, 41 commercial projects 2005: 51 and 142 residential units 2005: 180 during the year.
These amounted to 1,041,000 square feet 2005: 979,000 square feet.
An analysis of the key components of this activity is shown below, together with the corresponding turnover: Square footage 2006 2005 Retail 152,000 16% 50,000 5% Office 98,000 10% 249,000 25% Industrial 785,000 75% 447,000 46% Total Commercial 848,000 87% 933,000 90% Residential 108,000 10% 131,000 13% Total Developments 1,041,000 100% 979,000 100% Turnover 2006 2005 Retail 39.7m 22% 60.8m 31% Office 66.0m 33% 43.5m 23% Industrial 74.0m 40% 34.7m 18% Total Commercial 161.5m 82% 157.2m 85% Residential 28.4m 15% 35.8m 18% Total Developments 185.6m 100% 197.3m 100% Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2006 6 Group Chief Executives review continued In the Industrial sector the most significant completions or partial completions were the 104,000 square foot unit for ATS Krupps at Nexus Point in Birmingham: 100,600 square feet for the Quinn Group at Oddicroft Lane near Mansfield: and the partial completion of an 80,000 square foot unit for BOC at Cambuslang, near Glasgow.
The key Office completions were 29,400 square feet for Trelleborg at Solihull Business Park: 22,700 square feet for the Fire Control facility at Willow Farm Business Park near Nottingham: and the sale of the 525 space car park at the Sheffield Riverside Business Park.
On Retail, the major development in the year was the 110,000 square foot mixed-use redevelopment at Bishops Stortford where a further partial completion was taken.
The 142 Residential units came from the sites at Manchester, Leamington Spa, Sheffield, Southampton, and Bishops Stortford.
The Manchester and Sheffield sites are now virtually complete with only two units remaining at Manchester.
Operating margin in the year, before costs relating to the potential sale of the Company, was 22.4% 2005: 20.8%, with the year on year improvement arising mainly from the increase in Industrial activity.
Land bank During 2006, we continued to grow the Groups residential land bank, making net land purchases of 378.6m during the year excluding the land within our purchase of Roland Bardsley Homes Limited, compared with 297.5m in 2005.
In addition, we carried forward into 2007 a further 24 sites with a total cost of 126.6m which we will complete on during 2007, mainly in the first half of the year.
The Groups residential land bank has increased, by a further 1,670 plots during 2006, as shown in the table below.
In addition, at 31st December 2006, there were a further 4,813 plots on sites which terms were agreed, but contracts had not yet been exchanged, the majority of which should add to the land bank during the first half of 2007.
Some 318 of these have already exchanged as at the date of this report.
Group residential land bank 31st December 2006 31st December 2005 Owned or controlled with planning 18,069 18,389 Deposit paid 3,173 2,947 Preferred developer status 7,808 6,308 Pathfinders 3,000 3,000 Potential planning gains 438 814 Total plots 32,808 31,138 Strategic land - acres 9,367 9,800 As a result of the efforts on land buying and planning, we anticipate having in excess of 10% more sites on sale, on average, during 2007 and have considerable confidence that, subject to market conditions, we can deliver the significant growth in sales volume which is planned.
We are also continuing our efforts on sourcing longer term sites and strategic options, to ensure the increasing supply of plots necessary to fuel our ambitious growth plans in the coming years.
As far as land for commercial development is concerned, Wilson Bowden Developments was successful in acquiring additional industrial sites at Oddicroft Lane Phase 2, Mansfield: Bentley Bridge, Wolverhampton: and at Peterborough.
In addition we were successful in winning preferred developer status on two further mixed-use regeneration projects at Barnstaple and Kidderminster.
These have been added to the already sizable long term pipeline of sites and projects which cover the entire range of Wilson Bowden Developments activities, and potentially total in excess of 3bn in terms of prospective turnover.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2006 7 Group Chief Executives review continued Outlook I believe that the various efforts and changes we have made in the business over recent years have placed us in a stronger position than for some time.
In David Wilson Homes: We have the strongest position on plot availability for several years because of our sustained efforts on the sourcing of land and the early obtaining of planning permission.
We anticipate operating from at least 10% more sites during 2007, with a further increase in 2008.
Our forward order book for 2007 is the strongest for many years.
We have placed ourselves in an excellent position for the spring selling season by building 5,990 housing units last year.
We continue to support the strong reputation of the David Wilson brand through our consistent efforts on design and quality.
We have made management changes which have brought a more focussed approach to the business and its key performance targets.
Wilson Bowden Developments too, has enhanced both its status and its trading position in recent years.
By continuing to add to its land bank of traditional industrial and office sites, while securing an excellent portfolio of mixed-use, city and town centre regeneration opportunities, the company has added considerably to its reputation, and put in place a sound foundation for the future growth of the business.
Taking those achievements, together with the trading performances outlined earlier in this report, I have every confidence that, in the absence of any unexpected deterioration in the market, 2007 can be a year of further growth for our businesses, and that there are excellent prospects for a continuation of that trend in 2008.
