Threshold performance results in 25% vesting 1 3rd and maximum performance 122% of threshold results in 100% vesting.
There were strong sales of new products in the two years ending 31 December 2015.
Based on aggregate sales of new products for the two years, and based on performance measure denitions, vesting is currently estimated to be around maximum.

In order to incentivise management to deliver the restructuring at or below those planned costs, any overspend or underspend versus the 3.3 billion will then translate into an adjustment in determining adjusted free cash ow performance relative to target.
The vesting schedule for this award is: 25% threshold of the award vests for achieving AFCF of 11.5 billion, 50% for achieving 11.9 billion, 75% for achieving 13.0 billion and 100% maximum for achieving 13.6 billion, with straight-line vesting between these points.
