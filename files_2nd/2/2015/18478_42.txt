90 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued Performance graph and table not audited The chart below shows Experians six-year annual TSR performance against the FTSE 100 Index.
The FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index against which TSR should be measured, as it is widely used and understood and is an index of which Experian is a constituent.

For 2015, a single figure for remuneration for Don Robert is provided for the period up to 16 July 2014, when he ceased to be CEO.
The figure shown for 2015 for Brian Cassin is his full year remuneration, although he became CEO on 16 July 2014 so part of this remuneration reflects his time as CFO of Experian.
The breakdown and explanation of the 2015 total single figures for both Don Robert and Brian Cassin is given earlier in this report and 54% of this for Brian Cassin was realised as a result of the annual bonus payout and vesting of long-term equity incentives.
The Companys TSR over the performance period of these awards was 33%.
The reduced level of remuneration for 2015 when compared to previous years is attributable to a number of factors including a lower level of bonus, lower levels of vesting of long-term incentives and the fact that Brian Cassin was not a participant in the CIP which vested in 2015.
The reduction in remuneration for the CEO illustrates the way Experians remuneration structure is closely aligned with business performance which, whilst good in 2015, has not been as strong as in previous years.
Percentage change in CEOs remuneration not audited The table below sets out the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and annual bonus between 2014 and 2015 and how this compares to the average percentage change for our UK and Ireland employees.
The Committee has selected employees in the UK and Ireland to illustrate the comparison because Experian is listed in the UK and resident in Ireland and has widely varying approaches to pay across the 39 different countries in which it operates.
There are complexities, including the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, involved in collating remuneration data across different geographical populations.
Brian Cassin was appointed CEO part-way through the year and, in order to provide a comparison with the full year figures for Don Robert in 2014, his salary, benefits and annual bonus, for the period between 16 July 2014 and 31 March 2015, have been annualised.
