Strategic Report Ocado Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 52 weeks ended 29 November 2015 9.
Chief Financial Officers Review For the period to 29 November 2015, we maintained double-digit sales growth in a highly challenging and competitive grocery environment.
At Group level, sales were driven primarily by growth in our retail Duncan Tatton-Brown business with the remainder from our agreement with Morrisons.
Chief Financial Officer Continued growth in retail sales was supported by improvements to our proposition to customers and an increase in the number of active customers in the period.
These factors drove strong order growth to the current average orders of 220,000 per week at the period end.
Operating profitability continued to strengthen in comparison to the prior period due to more efficient operational fulfilment mainly at CFC Dordon.
This was offset by lower margins reflecting the competitive and deflationary pressures in the market, our sustained investment in a number of strategic initiatives to support future growth of the business and higher depreciation and amortisation arising from CFC Dordon, vehicles and additional spokes to support current and future business growth.

Some of the cost increases were due to additional costs to operate the Morrisons services which are not recharged to Morrisons but for which the Group earns fees.
In addition we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives to support future growth in our non-food business and Ocado Smart Platform.
Share based management incentive costs increased due to the introduction of the third award under the long term incentive plan LTIP for 2015.
Share based management incentive costs are likely to stabilise in 2016 as the costs for the 2016 LTIP award which are spread over 2016, 2017 and 2018 will be offset by the drop out of costs for the first LTIP award made in 2013 which was spread over 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Marketing costs excluding voucher spend were marginally higher at 10.5 million 2014: 10.0 million but lower as a percentage of retail revenue at 1.0% 2014: 1.1%.
Despite this lower marketing spend as a percentage of retail revenue we continued to increase our new customer acquisitions per week, up over 20% versus 2014.
Total depreciation and amortisation costs were 60.1 million 2014: 55.0 million, an increase of 9.3% year-on-year and includes an impairment charge of 1.8 million 2014: 2.6 million.
The higher depreciation and amortisation is primarily from the increased investment required for the development of CFC Dordon, which includes depreciation on assets jointly owned with Morrisons, and from the increased number of vans and LGVs required to support business growth.
The impairment charges are due to the write off of certain assets at CFC Hatfield and as a result of a detailed review of our legacy systems due to the rewrite a number of key systems as part of our replatforming.
