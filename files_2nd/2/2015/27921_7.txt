49.7 million of the Companys own shares were acquired in the market under the buy-back programme announced last year, which will be extended by a further amount of up to 50.0 million in the new financial year, improving capital efficiency and further enhancing shareholder returns.
The Groups average loan book grew by 7.0%, driving the increase in the Groups profit and earnings.
New buy-to-let lending increased by 102.0% to 1,326.6 million 2014: 656.6 million, with the pipeline of new business being 72.1% greater at 713.7 million at 30 September 2015 2014: 414.8 million, which should lead to a positive start to the new financial year.

The Group was also assigned an investment grade corporate rating by Fitch.
Immediately following the year end the Group announced the purchase by Paragon Bank of the Five Arrows Leasing Group, an established SME asset finance business, from Rothschild & Co for 117.0 million.
The purchase, completed on 3 November, has diversified the Groups product range and given additional scale to Paragon Banks operations and deposit-taking activities.
The acquisition provides a significant opportunity for growth and was financed from the Groups existing resources, in line with its objective of improving its capital efficiency over time.
The progress made during 2015 leaves the Group well placed to continue to expand its business through greater levels of organic growth and additional product diversification.
There is a strong demand for the Groups products across its various divisions and despite challenges that may arise from increased regulation and taxation changes, further growth is expected to continue in the future.
The larger and more diversified funding base supports strong growth, together with giving capacity for other potential acquisitions and capital management activity that will in turn provide increasing returns for the Groups shareholders.
