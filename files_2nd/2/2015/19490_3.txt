Strategic Report Chief Executives review TRANSFORM In the context of challenging trading conditions our overall performance for the year was in line with the expectations we set out in July 2015.
Itwas a year of considerable change for Rolls-Royce: in our management, in some market conditions and in our near-term outlook.
At the same time, there were some important constants: the underlying growth ofour long-term markets, the quality of our mission-critical technology and services, and strength of customer demand for these, which are reflected in our growing order book.
While we have some near-term challenges, these constants provide us with confidence in a strong, profitable, cash-generative future.
