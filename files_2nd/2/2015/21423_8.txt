com 16 Chief executives statement Our balanced portfolio was a key factor in achieving both modest growth and an improved combined ratio.
Beazley delivered another excellent performance in 2015, generating a profit before income tax of$284.0m 2014: $261.9m on gross premiums that rose by 3% to $2,080.9m 2014: $2,021.8m.
Our combined ratio of 87% was slightly lower thanouraverage for the prior five years, reflecting therisk assessment skills of our underwriters atatimeofwidely declining premium rates, aswell asabenign claims environment.
I am particularly pleased that Beazley succeeded in achieving moderate growth in 2015 in a market that denied many insurers the opportunity to grow without sacrificing profitability.
Andrew Horton In this we were once again supported by our US operations, Chief executive where premiums rose 21%.
This was buoyed by continuing strong demand for data breach insurance, but other specialist management liability and professional liability lines of business have also responded well to the strength of the US economy.
We have now had a local underwriting presence in the US for 11 years and our locally underwritten US premiums accounted for 26% of our total business in 2015, up from 17% five years ago.
However, it would be misleading to read the success of our US business as an achievement that is independent of our London operations.
We rely on many of the same broker relationships to sustain both our London and US business and most of the lines we offer in the US are underwritten usually for larger clients by our London underwriters.
Most of our underwriting and claims teams operate on a global basis, sharing knowledge constantly and moving personnel frequently.
London continues to serve as a laboratory for innovation in global insurance and reinsurance and that will continue to benefit all our underwriters, wherever they are located.
