average resource grade increased by 15% to 4.8 g t gold equivalent as a result of high-grade resource additions.
We continued to use conservative gold and silver price assumptions, of uS$1,100 oz and uS$15 oz respectively, in both reserve and resource estimates in 2015 2014: uS$1,200 oz and uS$17 oz.
in 2016, we plan to complete independent audits of the initial resource estimates at our PgM project in Karelia viksha and at the newly acquired assets: lichkvaz in armenia and Dolinnoye in Kazakhstan.
