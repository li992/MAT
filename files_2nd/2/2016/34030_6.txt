Regionally, trading conditions in the North and Midlands have been stronger than those seen in the South.
Our total forward sales including JVs as at 4 September 2016 were up 4.1% on the strong prior year figures at a value of 2,416.5m 6 September 2015: 2,321.9m, equating to 11,364 plots 6 September 2015: 10,755 plots.

Outlook We have started the new financial year in a good position, with 592.0m year end net cash, a healthy forward order position and an experienced management team in place.
We have industry leading quality and customer service, and talented employees.
There remains an undersupply of new homes, strong government support including Help to Buy Equity Loan, and a mortgage market willing to lend.
As a result, we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of both the housing sector and our business.
Our sales trends since the start of the new financial year have been encouraging, and underpin an increasingly business-as-usual stance whilst we continue to monitor consumer, economic and other lead indicators closely following the EU referendum vote.
I am proud to lead our first class team and we are all determined to build on this years outstanding operational and financial performance in the future, as well as delivering on our targets for key financial metrics and our capital return plans in FY17.
