08 Capita plc Strategic report Governance Accounts CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW 2016 was a tough year, with weaker financial performance.
We are confident that the decisive actions we are taking will create a clear path to return to sustainable profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.
Andy Parker, Chief Executive A challenging year 2016 was a tough year and our financial performance was weaker than we had expected at the outset of the year.
There were a number of reasons for this.
The business process management BPM market in 2016 was generally more subdued, some client decisions were deferred and we also won a lower proportion of major bids than in recent years.
Furthermore, some of our businesses underperformed and we experienced weakness in a number of discretionary services toward the year-end.
This weaker financial performance masked a number of positive developments over the course of the year.
We renewed and extended a significant number of contracts, including our Department for Work and Pensions Personal Independence Payments and BBC TV Licensing contracts, and announced our first strategic transformational customer management partnership in Europe with mobilcom-debitel.
