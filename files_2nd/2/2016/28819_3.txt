6 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2016 Chief Executives review 2016 has been an important year as we accelerated the transformation of Rolls-Royce.
Warren East Chief Executive Introduction Overall, we have performed ahead of our expectations for the year as a whole while delivering significant changes to our management and processes.
We increased our large aero-engine production output by 25%, supported the needs of our customers, and made good technical progress in the final stages of the development of the three new large engines, due to enter service over the next twelve months.
At the same time we have improved manufacturing lead times for our key Civil Aerospace programmes, an important goal as we ramp up production over the next few years.
Progress with our transformation programme was also better than expected, delivering over 60m of in-year benefits compared to our initial target of between 30-50m.
Overall, the performance improvements have helped offset a number of changing trading conditions and higher research & development R&D spend.
