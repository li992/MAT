Chief Executives strategy overview A year of good progress Mitie has made good progress during the year.
We have held our own in a competitive marketplace, against the backdrop of a somewhat challenging environment.
However, outsourcing remains the most effective way for public and private sector organisations to innovate and improve efficiency and achieve competitive advantage.
We have a flexible, resilient business model and a track record of responding to changing market conditions and client needs.
We look after our clients buildings, facilities and people and we continue to do these things very well.
We are recognised as the outsourcing partner of choice as well as the employer of choice, twin strengths that enable us to deliver high quality services and the greatest innovation in our chosen markets.
Our mission is to create stakeholder value by focusing on sustainable, profitable growth and we achieve this by implementing a clear strategy.
