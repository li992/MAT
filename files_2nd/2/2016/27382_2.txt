Strategic Report Chief Executives Review Overview NEXT Brand full price sales were up 3.9%, underlying profit before tax was up 5.0% and underlying Earnings per Share EPS were up 5.4%.
Full price sales were slightly ahead of the central guidance of 3.5% we issued in March last year.
Profits advanced more than sales, mainly as a result of better bought-in gross margins in the first half.
We are proposing a final ordinary dividend of 105p, making 158p in total for the year, up 5.3%.
During the year we also paid a further 230p of special dividends.
In order to give a picture of the underlying performance of the business, throughout this report numbers are generally stated on a 52 week versus 52 week basis.
This year was in fact a 53 week year.

co. uk 24471.04 8 April 2016 11:49 AM Proof 2 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Objectives for the Year Ahead The year ahead may well be the toughest we have faced since 2008.
We are very clear on our priorities going forward and whatever challenges we may face, it is important that we remain focused on ensuring that the Companys product, marketing, services and cost controls all improve in the year ahead.
The Companys main operational objectives are set out in the table below.
They remain broadly unchanged from those set out last year, with the addition of a plan to upgrade elements of the NEXT Directory: Develop the NEXT Brand Continue to develop and advance our buying and design capabilities: delivering better design, improved quality and quicker response to new trends.
Upgrade Directory Develop new online advertising and email techniques for recruiting new customers and reactivating existing customers.
Improve the presentation of our website with particular reference to mobile devices.
Defend, develop and promote our credit business.
Rationalise and expand the distribution of our printed publications.
Invest in online growth businesses Continue to invest in and develop NEXT overseas through investment in new advertising and promotion techniques and the development of our existing delivery hubs.
Continue to develop LABEL through the addition of new key brands, improving stock availability and stock control.
Invest in profitable new space Open profitable new retail space, maintaining the Companys payback and profitability hurdles of 15% net store profit before central overheads and payback on net capital invested in 24 months.
Control costs Control costs through constantly innovating and developing more efficient ways of operating.
This must be done without detracting from the quality of our products and services.
co. uk 24471.04 8 April 2016 11:49 AM Proof 2 Strategic Report Product The drive to improve our product remains at the heart of the business.
Without great product all our other endeavours cannot succeed.
We have continued to focus on improving aspects of our buying and design process and are now beginning to buy product in two very different ways.
The first is our more traditional buying process, the long game, which involves a nine month buying cycle and focuses on long lead time product from far away territories.
Secondly, there is short game buying, which focuses on a more spontaneous reaction to new trends typically sourced from nearby territories.
Long lead time product long game For long lead time Far Eastern product, emphasis is on the development and direct sourcing of better fabric, yarns, trims and embellishment.
This involves more work at the front end of the buying cycle.
It also means buying fabrics and yarns before we know exactly what garments they will be used for.
We expect these improvements to begin to be reflected in our ranges from Autumn 2016 onwards.
Short lead time product short game For short lead time product sourced closer to home we are working on accelerating the decision making process: encouraging our buying and merchandise teams to make more decisions outside formal selection meetings.
This method of buying represents a big cultural change for NEXT and will take time to implement properly.
However the early signs are positive and we expect short game product to steadily increase as a percentage of our offer as the year progresses.

In these circumstances, with property commitments rising faster than sales, it is surprising that Retail margins moved forward.
The main reason for the margin improvement is that our buying teams over-achieved against their target margin in the Spring and Summer seasons, assisted by better currency rates.
The table below sets out significant margin movements by major heads of costs.

Store occupancy Rent and rates reduced margin mainly as a result of negative same-store sales.

Both figures meet Company investment hurdles of 15% store profitability and 24 months capital payback.
Looking ahead, we estimate that we will add around 275,000 square feet of net trading space in 2016 17 and a further 350,000 square feet in 2017 18.
Of course, these estimates are only a rough guide at this stage: much will depend on the property deals we are able to achieve and required planning permissions.
Looking at the openings we have planned for the next 12 months, there are six key locations where we have decided to stretch our payback criteria, although never to more than 30 months.

To address this issue we have increased Directorys overall stock holding in Spring and Summer.
For Autumn and Winter we have made a more fundamental change: we have re-written our stock ordering systems to allow more accurate allocation of our buy budget in favour of items that appear in our smaller New In publications.

This benefit was partially offset by the APR reduction in October 2015.

Net operating margin on total sales this year 24.4% The Changing Face of Next Directory Over the last five years the NEXT Directory has changed profoundly.
Sales have grown by 75% and we have developed two new businesses: an online overseas business and a third party branded business, LABEL.
Between them these have added over 300m to Directorys turnover and are still growing strongly.
However, growth in the core UK Directory business has inevitably slowed as the business has matured.
Partly this is as a result of competitors catching up with our delivery and warehousing capabilities: partly as a result of changes in the ways customers are shopping online.
It is this last point that provides us with the opportunity to improve the business going forward.
improving directory UK There is a great deal we are doing to improve Directory.
The following paragraphs outline some of the ways in which we will be upgrading the business.
Projects can be categorised into four areas: Improving user interfaces Catalogues and marketing Delivery service Credit The way our customers trade with us is changing in four important ways.
1 The devices they use to purchase items have changed, 2 their desire for catalogues has reduced, 3 their propensity to take credit has diminished and 4 their preference to collect deliveries from stores has increased.
The table below shows just how marked some of the changes have been: Catalogues and User interface marketing Credit Deliveries 2010 95% of orders by 89% of customers 95% of orders by 87% of orders delivered value on desktop PC.

co. uk 24471.04 8 April 2016 11:49 AM Proof 2 Strategic Report improving user interfaces The graph below shows the conversion rates the percentage of people visiting our website that place an order for customers shopping using different devices.
Conversion rates on mobile phones are always likely to be lower than on desktops, however we believe we can narrow the difference.
Sales conversion rates by device 10.0% 8.0% 8.5% 6.0% 7.7% 4.0% 4.2% 2.0% 0.0% Desktop Tablet & iPad Mobile phone mobile site Until very recently, the vast majority of mobile phone users would have been presented with our normal desktop website on their phone screen.
We have recently switched customers browsing on mobile phones excluding iPhones to a mobile version of the site m. next.
The results have been encouraging with conversion rising significantly, from 4.2% to 5.8%.
Over the course of the next few months we will also switch over iPhone users to the mobile site.
co. uk 24471.04 8 April 2016 11:49 AM Proof 2 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information ipad app In August last year we launched our new iPad App.
The aim was to give customers the best of both worlds the look and feel of a page-turning book alongside the search and filtering abilities of a website.
The results have been encouraging and we have seen conversion rates improve from 8% to 10% for those customers using the App.
Over the course of the year we will focus on converting more iPad customers to the App.
In May, we will release a new version NEXT iPad app of our iPhone App to mirror the improved functionality on the iPad.
In July we will launch an Android version of our iPad App.
Catalogues and marketing Those customers who continue to receive catalogues still value them, so we do not intend to abandon our printed brochures.
Indeed, for the 1.6m customers that want catalogues, providing a regular flow of new and exciting publications remains the most important way we can engage with these customers.
We currently publish four large hardback seasonal catalogues, five smaller softback brochures, two hardback home brochures and four LABEL brochures.
This means our best customers now receive over 7,000 pages of printed material.
Over the course of the next year we will be rationalising and expanding the distribution of brochures and catalogues.
The aim is to ensure that we maximise the opportunity to profitably distribute printed materials to those customers that respond well to them.
However, there are a growing number of new customers who no longer require catalogues and we need to replace the interest they provide with other marketing methods.
In particular we believe that we can make much better use of online advertising and email marketing technologies.
Over the course of the coming year we will invest an additional 8m UK and overseas combined in various forms of targeted online advertising and email campaigns.
This marketing will be aimed both at re-activating existing customers and recruiting new customers.
Online advertising campaigns must satisfy our internal investment hurdle rate of at least 30% Internal Rate of Return IRR, which means that on average campaigns will achieve more than that and breakeven at around one year.
On the downside, this means that we will be adding costs in the current year that are unlikely to generate a profit until the following year.
From Autumn we will begin the process of personalising our website.
This technology will also facilitate more targeted advertising through third party websites to existing customers.
delivery Service Over the course of the year we will be working to improve our delivery service in two important ways: By giving customers the option to collect and return goods through third party parcel shops target rollout September 2016 By narrowing the window of our home deliveries to a pre-advised two hour window target rollout from December 2016 13 nextplc.

The table below sets out the trend in our credit customer base over the last four years showing the average active customer accounts.
As can be seen from the table below, the decline in numbers has been offset by the fact that remaining customers are spending more, so we appear to be losing our least active credit customers.

During the year, we made two important changes to our credit offer.
Firstly, we reduced minimum payments to improve account flexibility, and secondly we lowered interest rates by 2%.
The combined result of these changes was that credit revenues increased as existing customers took advantage of more flexible terms and increased their balances.
Over the course of the next year we believe we can further improve the way in which we target and market our credit offer.
We will also improve our statements and enhance the My Account area of our website.
However, even with these improvements, we expect our credit customer base to continue to decline by around 5% in the year ahead.
We anticipate that it will take a number of years for our credit customer base to stabilise.
directory overseas Directory overseas continues to trade well with full price sales up 20%, in line with our guidance.
Stripping out the effect of the pounds appreciation, sales in local currencies were up 41%.
Sales and profit history The table below sets out the last four years sales, profits and net margins for Directory overseas, along with an estimate for the year ahead.
Last year, margin was eroded by 2% mainly due to the decision to absorb some of the effect of currency devaluations, primarily in Russia and the Ukraine.
co. uk 24471.04 8 April 2016 11:49 AM Proof 2 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information distribution hubs In previous years, our focus has been on translating our site into different languages and accepting local currencies.
Our website now trades in 18 languages and 34 currencies.
This year the emphasis has been on improving speed of delivery in key territories, building on the success of our hub in Northern Ireland, which opened in October 2014.
In 2015, we opened distribution hubs in Russia March, China October and Germany October.
In Russia and China, we have been able to reduce waiting times by more than 6 days with the majority of our customers now able to order stocked items for delivery within 3 days of ordering.
In Germany we were able to deliver next day by air, so the new hub has given little in the way of service improvement, but has allowed us to operate more cost effectively.
In the year ahead, we do not intend to open any new hubs and will focus on operational improvements to existing hubs.
These improvements will focus on the following areas: Stock level management within the hubs and bulk replenishment methods from the UK Cost management and efficiency Expanding the territorial reach of hubs mainly from the German hub Stock rebalancing between the hubs and the UK international marketing Until recently, we had been unable to find many profitable advertising methods for our overseas business.
We have now begun to experience some success with online advertising in certain countries.
We plan to invest 3m in online marketing overseas in the year ahead.
As with all our online advertising, campaigns must satisfy our internal hurdle rates of at least 30% IRR.
LaBEL We have continued to engage with new brands that do not directly compete with NEXT ranges and enhance our overall offer.
Last year we added 20 major new brands.
Sales grew by 25%, but some of this growth was driven by markdown sales.
Profit margins in the year have reduced due to a higher level of surplus stock.
The table below sets out the last two years sales, profit and margins for our LABEL business, along with our estimate for the year ahead.
VAT 145 180 196 Profit 20 22 29 3 Profitability 14% 12% 15% 3 Excludes interest income on LABEL items purchased on the NEXT Directory account.
co. uk 24471.04 8 April 2016 11:49 AM Proof 2 Strategic Report Looking to the year ahead, we expect to add a further 7 important new brands to the business.
We expect LABEL full price sales to grow by around 14% with net margins improving to circa 15%.
The improvement in planned net margin comes largely as a result of lower anticipated markdowns.
We believe we can improve both markdown and service level the percentage of stock available to order as we get a better understanding of what sales volumes individual brands are able to achieve.
Cost Inflation and Cost Control This year we have offset cost increases with cost savings.
The tables below outline the main contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.
Cost control remains at the heart of the business and we remain determined that cost savings must come through innovation and efficiency rather than any compromise to our product quality or services.
Costs and savings in the year ending January 2016 Cost increases m Cost of living awards and other wage costs 24 Rent and rates 7 New systems 5 Home warehouse and distribution 3 Total cost increases 39 Cost savings m Net margin on product 17 Property savings including fully depreciated assets 13 Retail productivity and cost improvements 9 Banking costs 4 Interest income and bad debt 3 Total cost savings 46 Costs and savings in the year ahead In the year ahead we expect cost increases of around 55m.
Anticipated wage increases account for 23m of this, the majority of which comes from our annual wage award.
We again expect cost increases to be more than offset by cost savings and other income streams of 59m, including 17m of additional interest income.

On a 52 week basis, sales increased by 11% and profits by 22%.
Some of the apparent improvement was caused by currency movements and underlying profits were up only 13%, mainly as a result of better cost controls.
The table below sets out the performance of the business in Sterling and in Dollars.
international Retail and franchise stores Our franchise partners operate 181 stores in 35 countries, which is similar to last year.
Franchise sales in the year have reduced by -12%.
The decline is due to a combination of adverse currency movements and weak trading conditions in some important territories.
Underlying sales in local currency were down -3%.
We own 13 stores in Europe which have broadly broken even.

We are budgeting on the basis of no gain or loss in the year ahead.
interest and taxation The interest charge was 30.5m, slightly higher than last years 29.9m.
We are budgeting for a 36m interest charge next year.
The anticipated increase in interest cost is largely as a result of a potential bond issue.
Our full year tax rate of 20.2% is commensurate with headline UK corporation tax rates.
We expect our effective tax rate to be similar next year, and from 2017 18 we would expect it to fall below 20% following the UK Governments decision to reduce the rate further.
Capital Expenditure, Net Debt and Shareholder Distributions Capital expenditure This year our capital expenditure was 151m, which was 41m ahead of last year.

The underlying cost of shop-fitting new space rose by 4% to 143 per sq.
ft. this was mainly as a result of enhanced specification, but partly as a result of some inflation in building costs.
We increased expenditure on cosmetic refits and maintenance to 15m: in the year ahead we expect maintenance capex to return to the more normal level of 11m.
In the year to January 2016, warehouse capex of 22m included 12m of expenditure on a new automated furniture warehouse.
This new warehouse will be operational in the current year after a further 19m of investment.
Investment in systems includes the hardware costs associated with renewing our retail till systems.
Expenditure on head office infrastructure increased to 15m as we continue the process of upgrading central facilities.

The table below sets out net debt at the start and end of the year and summarises the significant movements in the year: m Net debt Cash flow Net debt January 2015 515 Surplus cash from operations after tax, capital expenditure and ordinary dividends but before funding additional Directory debt 372 Special Dividends -341 Financing for additional Directory debt -215 Buybacks brought forwards from 2016 17 -151 Net debt January 2016 850 Underlying surplus cash generated from operations, after deducting interest, tax, capital expenditure and ordinary dividends, but before funding additional Directory debt, was 372m.
This figure was boosted by 14m from the 53rd week and 8m deferred proceeds from the sale of our investment in Cotton Traders.
Surplus cash was distributed to shareholders by way of special dividends amounting to 341m.
As explained in our half year statement, we increased net debt to fund additional Directory debt of 215m caused by the change in minimum payments.
In January, we brought forward additional shareholder returns of 151m through share buybacks which will be financed through cash flows in the year ahead.
Overall, net cash outflow for the year was 335m.
Cash flow for the year ahead Looking forward to the year ahead, we expect to generate surplus cash of around 350m.
We will continue to return surplus cash to shareholders through either share buybacks or special dividends.
We anticipate distributing a total of 200m to shareholders in 2016 17, representing 350m of expected surplus cash flow less the 151m of share buybacks brought forward to January 2016.
We have already paid a special dividend of 88m in February 2016, so the balance remaining is 112m.
Year end net debt is expected to fall to around 740m.

In October 2016, our 213m bond matures and during the year we intend to replace this with a further bond of between 250m and 350m.
When and if we issue a replacement bond, we are likely to have bonds and facilities comfortably in excess of our peak borrowing requirements.
We are not currently planning to use any of these surplus facilities to fund further buybacks in excess of our surplus cash flow, however we would not want to rule out further buybacks in the event market conditions were favourable.
Such buybacks would be subject to our usual constraints that: We believe them to be in the interests of shareholders generally We do not jeopardise our investment grade credit rating Shares are purchased below our buyback price limit which currently remains at 69.62 based on an Equivalent Rate of Return of 8% Final dividend We have proposed a final ordinary dividend of 105p, to be paid on 1 August 2016 and taking the total ordinary dividends for the year to 158p.
The increase on last years 150p is broadly in line with growth in EPS.
Shares will trade ex-dividend from 7 July 2016 and the record date will be 8 July 2016.

Although employment rates are at record highs, growth in real earnings the difference between wage growth and inflation slowed markedly from September last year.
In addition, growth in output across services, manufacturing and construction all decelerated throughout the course of the year.

Looking at the latest available figures for consumer spending, which were for Q3 2015, the graph below shows growth in spending for groceries, clothing 4 and travel, recreation, and going out.
Although Q3 2015 was a good quarter for clothing, it can clearly be seen that growth in experience related expenditure such as eating out, travel and recreation was much stronger.
GDP growth 2015 Q3 vs 2014 Q3 10% 8% 6% 8% 4% 4% 2% 0% -1% -2% Food & Drink Clothing Travel, Recreation & Going Out These wider consumer and economic trends may reverse as the year progresses.
However our instinct, along with the volatility of our own sales, suggest that it would be sensible to prepare for a tougher economic environment.
We are therefore revising our full year guidance for sales and profits in the year ahead.
Going out includes: culture, restaurants, hotels and tourism.

At this stage in the year there is inevitably a high degree of uncertainty and we recognise that there is an upside risk to the numbers if we have a colder winter the fourth quarter of last year being unusually warm.
However at this stage we think it is best to prepare ourselves for what could be a difficult year.
Our sales and profit guidance for the year ahead is shown in the table below.

Summary It looks as though we may be set for a challenging year, with economic and cyclical factors potentially working against us.
We are very clear about where we need to focus our energies in the year ahead.
Continue our efforts to improve our buying processes, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve in terms of design and quality.
Upgrade the UK Directory business, developing new ways of recruiting customers, stimulating sales from existing customers, presenting our website, personalising our offer and improving our delivery service.
Continue to develop Directorys two growth businesses LABEL and Overseas.
Develop and profitably expand our UK retail store network.
In many ways we have more to do than ever before with complex challenges to our working practices across product, marketing and systems.
It may well feel like walking up the down escalator, with a great deal of effort required to stand still.
It will not be the first time we have felt this way, and our experience is that the effort put into improving the business in tough times can pay handsome rewards when conditions improve.
