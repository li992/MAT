CHIEF EXECUTIVES REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW FY16 has been a challenging year and the Group has delivered a disappointing full year financial performance impacted primarily by a tough trading environment in the second half across our Sports Retail businesses.
Our continued investment in upgrading and relocating stores, including 'Key Location Doors' such as Leeds and Plymouth, has been well received by our leading third party brand partners.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS The Board manages the Groups performance by reviewing a number of Key Performance Indicators KPIs.
The KPIs are discussed in this Chief Executives Report and Business Review, the Financial Review, and the Corporate Social Responsibly Report.

PROGRESS ON OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES Sports Direct aspires to be a leading sports retailer internationally and to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders in the medium to long term by offering our customers an unrivalled range of high quality leading brands, and maximising the efficiency, capacity and effectiveness of our operations to deliver this experience.
This strategy has delivered shareholder growth and generated rewarding careers for many of our people over our 34-year history, and the Board believes it is important that we continue to strive to live our values, and to evolve and embed our high performance culture to continue to work towards achieving our goals in the medium to long term.
We remain committed to our organic and inorganic growth strategy alongside the review of our people strategy, and will continue to maintain our active search for strategic opportunities, both in our existing markets and in new territories.
Below we have outlined the progress on our key strategic initiatives for FY16.
Strategic acquisitions and investments The Groups acquisition and investments strategy, parameters and decision-making is performed by the Board, and delegated at a certain materiality level to be performed by the Executive Directors within the agreed strategy.
The Group is focused on opportunities that will deliver extensions or enhancements to our customer offering, broaden or enhance our commercial relationships, broaden or enhance our retail channels, selectively grow our market share, further diversify our operations, further expand our gross margin, and or deliver operational efficiencies.
Given the breadth of our business, our strategic benefits can be varied and extensive, and the Group employs an array of mechanisms to facilitate strategic discussions with potential partners towards varied strategic goals.
During the year we completed the acquisition of the remainder of the Heatons business in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for consideration of 48.0m.
The acquisition will build upon the Groups existing relationship with Heatons and strengthen our presence in the Republic of Ireland.
Additionally during the year, we also acquired a standalone gym in West London to add to our Fitness Division.
Completion of our Shirebrook Campus In late 2015 the Group completed the latest phase of our ongoing Shirebrook campus development, our National Distribution Centre, which added an additional c. 700,000 sq.
ft. of warehouse and office space to the site.
The extension has enhanced our supply chain and distribution capabilities: the Groups online capacity: improved our office space and ability to bring teams together to benefit from co-location: and enhanced our training environment for staff, with an International Training Academy supported by Nike and Puma located on site.
The additional office space has also enabled us to incorporate more office space for third party brand partners to help us to continue to work closely together on building a better business.
Developing our stores and in-store customer experience Consistent with our plans in FY15, this year we have focused on re-locating, re-configuring and upgrading our store portfolio across all of our fascias and geographies to enhance the customer experience.
We have continued our focus on growing our larger format stores, our 'Key Location Doors', and this year we opened Leeds and Plymouth, and we recently announced the acquisition of the freehold property at 161-167 Oxford Street, London.
This property, once redeveloped, will operate as a flagship site in London for a c. 20,000 sq.
ft of prestige office space.
Our 'Key Location Doors' enable us to construct exceptional visual merchandising and specialist performance areas, often in partnership with leading third-party brand partners, creating an inspiring store experience for our customers, and a rewarding experience for our third-party brand partners.
With this investment in stores, we expect to be able to offer our customers even more in premium ranges from leading global brands as well as the Groups better and best branded products, as part of our commitment to offer the broadest range of brands in our stores and online.
With the acquisition of the remainder of Heatons completed during the year, the Group plans a substantial investment in the Heatons store portfolio over the coming years to enhance the sports offering and to continue to develop the store experience.
Extending the Fitness Division During the year we opened two gyms which were co-located with SPORTSDIRECT.
com retail stores in Newport and St Helens.
The gyms offer membership value consistent with SPORTSDIRECT.
This is a proactive strategy to capture market share in the low cost fitness market and to generate synergies from co-locating our gym and retail offering, given the natural lifestyle fit.
Enhancing our online offering Online is a growing channel for the Group and we have always maintained discipline to ensure that this channel is profitable.
In FY16 we made a number of enhancements to our websites, which included improved search capabilities, optimisation of the speed of the platform, enhancing the platform for mobile and tablet devices and improvements in security and data protection.
We have also fully integrated the SPORTSDIRECT.
com website with social media channels, to execute partner marketing initiatives, and developed an additional 14 non-UK local websites, to facilitate demand and complement our stores in these countries.
Building our world famous brand portfolio 19 The Group is dedicated to enhancing the value of our Group Brands, and during the year we successfully appointed  celebrities and sporting professionals as brand ambassadors, as well as announcing that Slazenger had secured a further three year partnership with The Championships, Wimbledon during the year.
This relationship has stood for 114 years and is the longest relationship of its kind in sporting history.
Slazenger was also excited to announce that four time Olympic Medallist swimmer Rebecca Adlington and cricket player Jason Roy had joined as brand ambassadors, and British snowboarder and GB Olympian Billy Morgan was secured to fly the flag for No Fear which is expected to be a great partnership.
USA Pros partnership with world-famous girl band, Little Mix, was announced during the year and we are set to launch a co-branded clothing range which is expected to be in stores in FY17.
Growing our licensing relationships Our strategic focus for our Group Brands continues to be on growing our licensing partners, having signed 35 new license agreements in FY16, as well as renewals of existing licensees with contracted minimum royalties of US$15.5m over the life of the contracts.
We expect to maintain our presence in our current markets, and will focus on growing our presence and licensing partners in Asia and Australia.
Increasing our wages for our UK workforce During the initial review of the Groups workplace practices in its Shirebrook warehouse undertaken by the Board, in December 2015 the Group determined to increase the wages of directly employed UK employees and directly engaged casual workers from being on the National Minimum Wage, to being above the National Minimum Wage, from 1 January 2016, resulting in an annualised cost increase of c. 10m.
Engaging with local communities The Group engages at various levels with the local communities in which we operate.
In relation to our Shirebrook campus, we have engaged with the Shirebrook Forward NG20 Working Group, which aims to help Shirebrook to retain its community spirit, its breadth of services and help local support functions in community initiatives.
The Group Brands also supported local communities and causes in various ways.
For example, Karrimor was proud to support Jo Brand in her Hell of a Walk for Sport Relief earlier this year, which saw Jo walk for 150 miles from Hull to Liverpool, in just seven days.
Karrimor provided jackets to Jo and her entire crew for the challenge, which ultimately raised over 1m.
Additionally, Everlast, Antigua, Dunlop, Lonsdale and Sondico supported a variety of sports, youth and charity related organisations throughout the year.
These included the Salvation Army, The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and The Jerry Colangelo Prostate Cancer Event, amongst others.
CHIEF EXECUTIVES REPORT AND BUSINESS REVIEW Continued PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW In the midst of a tough trading environment, particularly in the second half, the Group has achieved a disappointing financial result for FY16 with underlying EBITDA largely flat on FY15.
Group revenue increased by 2.5% to 2,904.3m in the year.
This was primarily due to the increase in Sports Retail revenue of 3.9% to 2,491.6m, which includes the impact of the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the Heatons business during the year, and the increased store footprint.
Premium Lifestyle revenue fell by 12.7%, largely due to the closure of loss-making stores in the period, and revenue was up 2.3% in Brands, with increases in both wholesale and licensing.
Group gross margin in the year increased by 40 basis points from 43.8% to 44.2%.
Sports Retail maintained the previous years gross margin at 44.6%, while the Brands division gross margin increased by 180 basis points from 40.3% to 42.1%, and Premium Lifestyles gross margin increased by 330 basis points from 38.8% to 42.1%, which was largely due to discounting and clearance of stock in the prior year.
We expect gross margin to be impacted significantly by negative movements in exchange rates in FY17 and beyond, given the recent movements in the US Dollar compared with the pound.
Group operating costs increased by 5.3% to 905.7m FY15: 860.5m, as a result of completion of the Shirebrook campus and associated increased costs, the part year impact of the Groups decision to increase wages from the National Minimum Wage to above the National Minimum Wage for directly employed UK employees and directly engaged casual workers, and the impact of acquisitions.
As a result, Group underlying EBITDA pre-Share Scheme costs for the year was down 0.5% to 381.4m FY15: 383.2m.
Sports Retail underlying EBITDA was down 2.2% to 349.0m FY15: 356.8m, while the Premium Lifestyle and Brands division underlying EBITDA increased to -5.1m and 37.5m respectively FY15: -7.7m and 34.1m.
The Premium Lifestyle division achieved a breakeven Underlying EBITDA result in H2 FY16.
Excluded from underlying EBITDA is a 7.1m FY15: 10.1m charge in respect of the 2011 Share Scheme.
This charge has been taken centrally and is not reflected in the divisional numbers in this report.
The depreciation charge has increased by 41.0% to 95.6m FY15: 67.8m due to the acquisition of the controlling interest in Heatons and increased investment in our store portfolio.
Group underlying profit before tax decreased 8.4% to 275.2m, due to lower EBITDA and higher depreciation charges.
In line with this movement, underlying EPS for the year decreased by 8.7% to 35.5p FY15: 38.9p.
20 The Group generated underlying free cash flow during the year of 309.1m, up from 301.8m in the prior year, and net debt increased by 39.9m to 99.6m at year end as a result of investment in inventory, freehold property and the acquisition of Heatons.
Net debt currently stands at 0.31 times reported EBITDA 26 April 2015: 0.16 times.

The Premium Lifestyle gross margin for the year increased by 330 basis points to 42.1% FY15: 38.8% as a result of the clearance of legacy stock in the prior year.
Premium Lifestyle operating costs decreased by 7.8% to 81.3m FY15: 88.2m due to the continued rationalisation of the USC and Republic businesses and synergies gained by the consolidation of key head office functions in Flannels, Cruise and van mildert and the integration of the distribution function.
We continue to strengthen our relationships with key third party suppliers and have introduced several new brands in the period.
Growth at Cruise, Flannels and van mildert also reflects the Groups buying disciplines and online expertise.
The Underlying EBITDA loss for Premium Lifestyle decreased to 5.1m FY15: 7.7m loss and achieved breakeven in H2 FY16, as we continue to see the benefit of rationalisation of the businesses.
We expect to see further benefits of this in future years.
At the year end, the Premium Lifestyle division traded from 83 stores under four main fascias: 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 USC 50 66 Cruise 10 10 Van Mildert 9 10 Flannels 9 8 Other 5 9 Total 83 103 BRANDS The Brands portfolio includes a wide variety of world-famous sport and lifestyle brands.
The Groups Sports Retail division sells products under these brands in its stores, and the Brands division sells the brands through its wholesale and licensing activities.
The Brands division continues to sponsor a variety of prestigious events and retains a variety of globally-recognised, high-profile celebrities and sporting 22 professionals as brand ambassadors.
The Brands divisions total revenue increased by 2.3% to 231.5m FY15: 226.4m.
Wholesale revenues were up 1.8% to 196.7m FY15: 193.3m, including growth in the challenging UK market.
Trading in the US market was in line with expectations and continues to represent c. 20% of total wholesale sales.
Brands gross margin increased by 180 basis points to 42.1% FY15: 40.3%.
Wholesale gross margins increased 180 basis points to 31.9% FY15: 30.1% largely due to a shift in the sales mix away from lower margin lines.
Licensing revenues in the year were up 5.1% to 34.8m FY15: 33.1m.
During the year we signed 35 new licence agreements and renewed several existing licensees, covering multiple brands, product categories and geographies, with minimum contracted values of $15.5m over the life of the agreements.
Longer term, we still regard licensing as the key driver of the Brands divisions profitability and central to the overall growth of the Brands business.
The key growth areas are expected to include Australasia and Asia Pacific.
Brands operating costs increased by 5.3% to 60.0m FY15: 57.0m primarily due to increased bad debt costs in the year.
Underlying EBITDA increased by 10.0% to 37.5m FY15: 34.1m.
CONTRACTS ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS OF THE GROUP The Group has long-established relationships with Nike and adidas, the major suppliers of third party branded sporting goods, and considers that continued supplies from these companies are critical to the business of the Group.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Corporate Social Responsibility Report is on pages 28 to 35 and a review of the assessment of the Groups impact on the environment is included in this report.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Group designs clothing and some footwear for sale in stores and has arrangements with suppliers for the research and development of goods for the Brands division.
OUTLOOK Trading since the start of May and leading up to the EU referendum was broadly in line with management expectations albeit with the continued volatility seen in the wider retail sector.
Since the EU vote we expect the current political uncertainty, and potential weakness in the UKs short to medium term economic outlook, is likely to act as a continuing drag on consumer confidence.
When combined with the structural difficulties for UK retailers, including high street footfall, and our exposure to the weakness of the pound against the US Dollar as announced on 24 June 2016, these factors make the current outlook for FY17 somewhat uncertain and therefore hard to predict.
We shall continue to focus on delivering an enhanced retail offering for our customers through an expanded product range and availability as well as optimising our online capability to benefit the overall Group performance.
Furthermore we will continue to invest for the future by upgrading and relocating stores and working closely with our key third party brand partners on our assortment and new generation concept stores.
We will continue to update the market on FY17 performance as the situation becomes clearer.
