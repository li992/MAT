STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW Financial performance I am delighted to present Wizz Airs second annual report as a publicly listed company.
The financial year ended 31 March 2016 was another remarkable year for us as we delivered a strong operating performance across all key metrics.
We continue to build on our market leadership in Central and Eastern Europe and have a strong balance sheet and an attractive order book of existing and new technology aircraft to drive growth in 2017 and beyond.
Wizz Air delivered a profit for the year of 192.9 million, and an underlying profit after tax of 223.9 million, a 53.2 per cent improvement compared to FY 2015.
Our underlying net profit margin increased from 11.9 per cent to 15.7 per cent over the course of the year and passenger number increased by 21.2 per cent to 20 million.
Our strong performance was driven by capacity expansion, passenger growth and continued improvements to our industry leading ultra-low cost base.
In numbers the Company delivered: E ticket revenue up 12.7 per cent to 894.9 million: E ancillary revenue up 23.2 per cent to 534.2 million: E total unit cost decline of 5.4 per cent to 3.43 cent per ASK: E a 19.1 per cent increase in the capacity offered to the market as measured by available seat kilometres or ASKs, as we extended and deepened our network of routes to and from Central and Eastern Europe: and E an increase in our average load factor by 1.5 percentage points to 88.2 per cent in the financial year, despite the significant capacity expansion.
Order book to drive growth In the year we made significant investment in our fleet and order book.
We added twelve aircraft to the fleet in the period, taking the fleet to 67 aircraft at the end of March 2016.
The finalisation of the order for 110 Airbus A321neo aircraft, overwhelmingly supported by our shareholders, and the introduction of the Airbus A321ceo to our fleet provide significant capacity growth into the next decade, meaning we can grow at around 15 per cent each year until 2024.
While we have flexibility within our order book to align deliveries with our actual growth, we are confident in our ability to deploy this capacity given our business model and the characteristics of the markets we serve.
A321ceo The Airbus A321ceo aircraft underpin our near term growth plans ensuring that we maintain our industry leading ultra-low cost base.
Our first A321ceo entered service in November 2015 and we have a total of 30 to be added to our fleet between now and the end of 2018.
As of today, we have five A321ceos in operation and will have a total of eleven in service by the end 2016 calendar year.
The composition of our fleet at the last financial year end and as currently anticipated at the next end of the next two is the following: March 2016 March 2017 March 2018 Actual Planned Planned A320 without winglets 180 seats 35 35 35 A320 with winglets 180 seats 28 28 31 A321 with winglets 230 seats 4 15 25 Fleet size 67 78 91 Share of fleet with winglets 47.8% 55.1% 61.5% Average number of seats per aircraft 183 190 194 Wizz Air took delivery of four new A321ceo aircraft during FY 2016, further contributing to one of the most efficient fleets and to the Companys drive for ever decreasing unit costs.
The benefits we are seeing from the operation of the A321ceo are in line with the Companys expectations and the initial 27 A321ceo order was increased to 30 units through the conversion of three additional A320ceo delivery slots, all of which will be delivered by the end of the 2018 calendar year.
A321neo In addition to the A321ceo deliveries, another crucial milestone in the Companys history took place last year when a new purchase agreement was entered into with Airbus for the purchase of 110 A321neo aircraft.
The neo version will bring further fuel burn efficiency and even lower unit cost making it the perfect replacement for those aircraft being returned to lessors as well as the foundation for Wizz Airs continued growth.
Deliveries of our A321neos start in 2019 and will continue until the end of 2024.
The purchase agreement includes uncommitted purchase rights for 90 additional A321neo aircraft as well as certain flexibility for conversion to the A320neo, providing flexibility for to ensure that deliveries match the Companys capacity needs.
On the basis of our current order book, our fleet will reach close to 160 aircraft in 2024: more than double our current size.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 10 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Building our strong market position CEE comprises 21 countries with a total population of over 300 million people, a larger overall market than that of Western Europe.
However as this market is relatively underserved by airlines and in particular low-cost airlines, it represents a huge opportunity for a low-cost airline.
At present Wizz Air has operations in 17 CEE countries.
We serve the market by offering a network of 25 bases and 124 destinations.
We are convinced that the ultra-low cost business model is best placed to serve this market and as such the Company offers safe, reliable operations, low fares and hassle-free services and a distinctive brand designed to appeal to the whole market.
This approach has enabled the Company to become the number one or number two low-cost airline in all but one of its base countries.
The Companys aggregate market share in CEE reached 42.6 per cent.
in the 2016 financial year, up from 39.2 per cent.

I am delighted to take this opportunity to welcome our new Chief Financial Officer CFO, Ms Sonia Jerez Burdeus to the Wizz Air team.
Sonia brings to the Company significant experience as a chief financial officer and board member of a European low-cost airline and we look forward to working with Sonia as we continue to drive the growth of the business.
Her appointment will take effect on 1 June 2016.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 12 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Management changes continued As announced earlier in the FY 2016 financial year Mike Powell our previous CFO stepped down from that position.
We would like to thank Mike for his contribution to the Group over the past eight years, during which he sat on the Company's Senior Leadership Team and contributed to the growth and success of the business today.
He was also central to the successful listing of the business on the London Stock Exchange in 2015 and we wish him well for the future.
I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate David Morgan, Chief Flight Operations Officer and Johan Eidhagen, Chief Marketing Officer, who were appointed to their new roles and have now joined Wizz Airs Leadership Team.
Hedging positions Wizz Air operates under a clear set of treasury policies supervised by the Board.
The aim of the Companys hedging policy is to reduce short-term volatility in earnings and liquidity.
Therefore Wizz Air hedges a minimum of 50 per cent.
of the projected US Dollar and jet fuel requirements for the next twelve months 40 per cent.
on the full 18-month hedge horizon.
Details of the current hedging positions as at 24 May 2016 are set out below: Foreign Exchange FX hedge coverage Euro US Dollar F17 F18 Period covered 11 months 12 months Exposure million $657 $820 Hedge coverage million $359 $115 Hedge coverage for the period 55% 14% Weighted average floor $1.09 $1.10 Weighted average ceiling $1.13 $1.12 Fuel hedge coverage F17 F18 Period covered 11 months 12 months Exposure in metric tons '000 693 877 Coverage in metric tons '000 414 71 Coverage with zero cost collars 5% 8% Coverage with fuel caps 55% - Hedge coverage for the period 60% 8% Blended capped rate $675 $505 Blended floor rate $708 $456 Fuel caps provide the Company with protection against the risk of higher fuel prices and also enable the Company to benefit from lower fuel costs should fuel prices fall.
The blended floor rate for fuel hedges shown in the table is only applicable to zero cost collar hedges.
Sensitivities E Pre-hedging a $10 per metric ton movement in the price of jet fuel impacts the 2017 financial year fuel costs by $7.1 million.
E Pre-hedging a one cent movement in the Euro US Dollar exchange rate impacts the 2017 financial year operating expenses by 6.0 million.
In the Companys view, the profit impact of such changes is likely to be less given the empirical evidence of major industry-wide movements in input costs being passed through to air fares with a lag of three to twelve months.
Outlook 2017 financial year Thanks to our ultra-low fares and our growing route network across CEE, we continue to experience strong demand and forward booking momentum.
We expect to continue to grow capacity by around 17 per cent.
Assuming the jet fuel price and Euro US Dollar exchange rate remain close to the prevailing spot levels $450 per metric ton and $ 1.12 respectively, the Company expects total operating cost per available seat kilometre CASK to be 5 per cent.
This comprises an anticipated fuel CASK decline of 15 per cent.
and a broadly flat non-fuel CASK.
The expected fuel CASK decline reflects the combined impact of lower fuel prices and fuel consumption savings, offset by a stronger US Dollar and a higher cost of complying with the EU-ETS carbon scheme.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 13 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Outlook continued 2017 financial year continued As previously indicated, lower fuel prices are feeding through to lower air fares and Management continues to believe that the earnings benefit from declining fuel prices is limited over the short term.
Based on current booking trends management expects total revenue per available seat kilometer RASK to decline by a mid single-digit percentage in H1 and remains cautious regarding the revenue performance for the second six months of the financial year H2, when capacity growth is planned to be 16 per cent.
Notwithstanding the fact that Easter fell one week earlier in 2016 than in 2015 pushing a higher proportion of this high yield traffic into the previous financial year, we currently expect a further significant rise in the Groups net profit over F16 to a range of between 245 million and 255 million excluding exceptional items.
This guidance is heavily caveated by the H2 revenue performance, a period for which we currently have limited visibility.

in the June quarter and anticipates a modest rise in load factor versus the same period of the previous year.
Management expects the timing of Easter to result in a net profit in Q1 June quarter only marginally ahead of Q1 of last year.
The last twelve months have been extremely exciting and as I outlined during the year, I remain fully committed to this business.
At just twelve years old, Wizz Air is one of the strongest airlines in Europe and the market leader in CEE.
I am very proud of what we have achieved as a management team in particular during 2015 with our listing on the London Stock Exchange and our major A321neo aircraft order with Airbus.
We have made a considerable investment in the future growth of the business.
I look forward to leading the Wizz Air team in 2016 and well beyond as we build on our position as the leading low-cost airline in CEE and to bringing a World of Opportunities to all of our customers.
