The USA is our most significant opportunity and we are particularly pleased with the recently announced agreement to acquire Utility Service Partners Inc. USP which will increase our US utility partner footprint to 42m households.
Our business is built on developing long-term relationships with our affinity partners.
Through a membership model we offer our customers heating, plumbing and electrical repairs and services.
In the UK and USA we also offer heating installation services.
Our extensive repair network comprises directly employed, franchised and sub-contract networks of engineers.
The Group has five operating segments: UK, USA, France, Spain and New Markets.
The New Markets division comprises our business in Italy, investment in innovation and digital initiatives and our international development activities.
Prior to its disposal on 1 September 2015, New Markets also included our investment in developing a German business.
Focusing on our strategic priorities, we have made good progress across a number of areas of the business.
We have added 11 new partnerships in the USA and renewed six long-term agreements in the UK such that we now work with over 90 affinity partners across the Group.
We continue to invest in business development in all of our markets to establish relationships and sign new affinity partners.
Customer numbers increased 11% from 6.3m to 7.0m with good growth across all the businesses.
In the UK we ended the year with 2.2m customers, up 3% on the prior year FY15: 2.1m, principally reflecting good marketing performance combined with 0.1m customers added through the acquisition of Home Energy Services Limited.
Response rates remain strong in the USA, where we have added 0.7m gross new customers and have increased year end customer numbers by 17% to 2.3m FY15: 2.0m.
8 | HomeServe plc Strategic report Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Chief Executives review This has been another very good year for HomeServe with all businesses performing well.
We are particularly excited by the prospects for our US business.
Profits have increased significantly whilst at the same time delivering strong customer growth.
The agreement to acquire Utility Service Partners, whilst providing a significant boost to FY18 profits will increase our US affinity partner households by 9m to 42m and will, as a result, enable us to accelerate our growth.
In the UK we have a strong business, which has grown profit and customers.
France had an excellent year, achieving the 1.0m customer milestone, and we saw continued customer and profit growth in Spain.
I am confident we will deliver on our expectation of further good growth in FY17, alongside continued investment in marketing, business development, international expansion and innovation initiatives.

HomeServe plc | 9 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Chief Executives review continued Very pleasingly we have seen renewed sales momentum in France, following the signing of Lyonnaise des Eaux last year.
We have delivered 7% customer growth, achieving the 1.0m customer milestone FY15: 0.9m.
Spain increased customer numbers by 11% to 1.2m following continued success with its largest partner Endesa FY15: 1.1m.
This year we completed over 2m repairs FY15: 1.8m across the Group and once again delivered an improved customer experience, with a reduction in customer complaints and increased levels of customer satisfaction.
Customer loyalty also remains strong with a Group retention rate of 83%, consistent with the prior year.
During the year we completed the acquisition of Home Energy Services Limited in the UK which, combined with our existing franchise and sub-contractor network, significantly increases our gas delivery capability in the UK.
Focusing on heating services, we now offer heating installations services in the USA with investment planned in the UK to further develop our franchised heating installation network.
In addition to good customer growth, we also achieved good profit growth across the Group with a 9% increase in Group adjusted profit to 93.0m FY15: 85.4m and 15% adjusted EPS growth.
Underpinning this growth was the USA, with adjusted operating profit up 89% to 12.1m FY15: 6.4m together with increases in the UK and Spain.
Adjusted operating profit in France increased 7% in local currency although Sterling profit of 23.2m, was 0.2m lower than the prior year, reflecting adverse foreign exchange movements of 1.4m.
On 31 March 2016, we signed an agreement to acquire USP, which is expected to complete in the first half of FY17 following normal course regulatory approvals.
USP brings 0.4m customers, 9.4m households, over 300 partnerships and a relationship with the National League of Cities, an organisation dedicated to helping city leaders and an advocate for 19,000 cities, towns and villages across the USA.
We expect this acquisition to be earnings neutral in FY17 and then to add $15m of EBITDA in FY18.
We continued to invest in digital innovation, establishing a digital hub to develop an end to end, consistent, digital experience for our customers enhancing the self-serve customer journey and enabling more effective product sales.
While still early days, we have commenced appraisal of extending our services to other international markets with a view to entering the home services market in partnership with local utilities.
10 | HomeServe plc Strategic report Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Chief Executives review Technology investment We have invested in our core customer system and other digital and technology solutions to make us more efficient and to improve our customer service.
We are pleased with the progress we are making with the implementation of our new core Pega Customer Management System, which will be operational in the UK business in FY17 with rollout to the USA thereafter.
This system provides a single view of the customer and all their interactions with us.
This will enable more informed discussions with customers, reduce the customer effort, improve our marketing effectiveness and reduce our cost to serve.
We also now intend to invest in upgrading our claims handing and contractor deployment technology to improve the claims process for our customers giving them better visibility over the progress of their claim and their engineer.
People During the year we continued to invest in strengthening our team, appointing Chris Havemann as a new Non-Executive Director to the Board, Rafaele Petruzzo as our Chief Digital Officer to lead our digital hub investment and Giles Desforges as Chief Executive of Global Partnerships to lead our International expansion.
Our total headcount now stands at over 4,800 FY15: 4,025, a good indicator of our strong performance and growth.
Our people continue to deliver great service to our customers and we are therefore delighted employee engagement is now 81%, 3 percentage points higher than last year.
Dividend Given the Groups good performance and the Boards confidence in its future prospects, the Board is proposing a 13% increase in the final dividend to 8.9p per share, bringing the total ordinary dividend for the year to 12.7p FY15: 11.5p an increase of 10% which is 1.72x covered by the FY16 adjusted earnings per share compared to 1.65x in FY15.
A special dividend of 30p per share 99.4m proposed in the prior year was paid to shareholders in July 2015.
Outlook All of our businesses are performing well and have good prospects.
Looking ahead, we expect Group growth to be driven primarily by our international businesses, with the UK continuing to deliver a solid performance.
We are particularly excited by the prospects for our US business where profits increased significantly in FY16 whilst at the same time delivering strong customer growth.
As previously announced, the acquisition of Utility Service Partners will be earnings neutral in FY17 due to increased marketing investment and integration costs however, we expect adjusted EBITDA in FY18, the first full year of ownership of USP, to be enhanced by around $15m.
The Group anticipates further good growth in FY17, alongside continued investment in marketing, business development, international expansion and innovation initiatives.
