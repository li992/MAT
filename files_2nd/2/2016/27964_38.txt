OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMPANY INFORMATION Chief Operating Officers introduction to the divisional Operating reviews Executing on our strategy, building for the future 2016 has been a year of transformation, coming together as one Paysafe team, and building for the future.
Our divisions have all delivered against our strategic pillars while proving our ability to execute and integrate bold M&A, a track record that sets us up well for the future.
I have been particularly encouraged to see our divisions working together this year and demonstrating our combined Group values.
Success in collaborating, effectively crossselling across the Group, leveraging expertise in each division and introducing existing clients to new and additional products will be key to deliver sustainable organic growth into the future.
On the technology side, we started work early on our consolidated payments platform.
Weve invested in this area with senior hires and the launch of a new development hub in Hyderabad, India.
The Paysafe team in India will support the ongoing development of the integrated data platform, with digital payment experts in open source and data analytics technology working with the Groups existing development centres in Europe and the Americas.
Were also working on deepening our appeal to the developer community, with the launch of our developer portal which makes it easier for merchants and developers to access, familiarise and integrate Paysafe products through open Application Programming Interfaces and Software Development Kits.
Technology innovation is one of our strategic pillars, which underpin divisional performance now and into the future.
The following business reviews explain the performance of each division in more detail and some of their key achievements against our Group strategy during the year.
