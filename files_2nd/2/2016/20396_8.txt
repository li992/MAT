We also saw a substantial fall in our all-in sustaining costs aISC to uS$958 per ounce, which was 14% below 2015 levels and at the bottom of our guidance range of uS$950 to uS$980 per ounce.
This was a result of the changes that were made to the business in late 2015, improved operating efficiencies at the assets and the increased production profile.
If we were to focus purely on asset performance, and remove the impact of the increase in the share price on the valuation of share-based payments, our aISC would have been uS$921 per ounce, 17% below 2015 and well below our guidance range.
I was especially pleased with the return to free cash generation during the year, which is our primary focus.
Over the past 12 months we doubled our net cash on the balance sheet to uS$218 million which provides significant flexibility for us going forward.
at the same time, the success of North Mara meant that a corporate tax charge amounting to uS$55 million was incurred, which included a uS$20 million cash prepayment agreed with the Tanzanian Revenue authority in Q1 2017. year in review 2016 was a very strong operational year as we saw the benefit of the first full year of operations at the Gokona underground at North Mara.
This deposit was previously mined as a high-grade open pit and commenced underground mining in mid 2015 after we made the strategic decision to go underground in 2014.
The mine delivered ahead of expectations in 2016, partly due to a 61% increase in mined grade compared to the resource model.
This drove additional ounces and the overall mine achieved a record production year of 378,443 ounces, brad gordon a 32% increase over 2015. at Bulyanhulu, we overcame an extended CHIEF ExECuTIVE OFFICER process plant shutdown in the third quarter which led to a loss of approximately one month of milling capacity to deliver 289,432 ounces, a 6% increase on 2015.
This demonstrates the increased operational resilience as part of our ongoing programme to unlock the geological and operational potential of the asset.

at Bulyanhulu, aISC fell by a further 16% to uS$1,058 given in October 2016 of approximately 820,000 per ounce as a result of the restructuring that took place in Q4 2015. at Buzwagi, we saw aISC above expectation at uS$1,095 per ounce ounces.
Performance was driven by North Mara, due to the lower ounce profile, though this was still 8% lower than 2015. where the mine had a record year, and at Bulyanhulu, Together, this led to a 14% fall in the headline aISC to uS$958 per which registered its highest production year for ten ounce, over uS$150 per ounce lower than 2015.

This includes the uS$20 million corporate tax cash prepayment, uS$28 million on debt repayments, uS$20 million on dividends and uS$36 million on share-based payments as a result of the vesting of awards during the year.
