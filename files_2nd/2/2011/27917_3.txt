Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Chief Executives review During the year ended 30 September 2011 the Group has successfully pursued its strategy to deliver shareholder value through purchasing portfolios, recommencing new lending, entering into new servicing agreements and continuing the careful management of the extant portfolios.
Since the year-end the Group has completed a further, substantial, portfolio acquisition and successfully executed a 163.8 million securitisation under difficult market conditions, the Groups first since 2007.

Both divisions include internally originated and acquired assets.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports primary segmental information.
Chief Executives review 7 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The underlying operating profits of these business segments are detailed fully in Appendix B to the annual report and are summarised below.
2011 2010 m m Underlying operating profit First Mortgages 67.3 50.6 Consumer Finance 13.8 15.5 81.1 66.1 Net interest income increased by 1.8% to 135.8 million 2010: 133.4 million, reecting improved margins and the impact of new loan assets, both acquired and originated, on the balance sheet, partially offset by a 2.1% reduction in the size of the loan book during the year.
At 30 September 2011, 95.8% 2010: 95.1% of the Groups loan assets were first mortgages.
Other operating income was 15.1 million for the year, an increase of 4.1% from 14.5 million in 2010, increased income from third party account servicing and insurance commissions being partially offset by lower levels of account fees.
Operating expenses during the year were 6.6% higher at 45.4 million 2010: 42.6 million.
The increase is primarily due to staff costs, following the recruitment of additional staff to support loan administration and increasing lending volumes, and increased expenditure on enhancing the Groups IT capabilities to support future growth.
The cost:income ratio was in line with our expectations at 30.1% for the year Appendix A and remains signicantly below the industry average.
Notwithstanding the strong growth in profits, the Board will remain focused on controlling operating costs through the application of rigorous budgeting and monitoring procedures.
The charge for impairment provisions of 24.4 million was 37.8% lower than the charge of 39.2 million for 2010, reecting an improvement in arrears performance.
As a percentage of loans to customers note 32 the charge has reduced to 0.28% from 0.44% in 2010.
Low interest rates have increased affordability for customers, reducing the incidence of new arrears and assisting the correction of past arrears.
The loan books continue to be carefully managed and credit performance remains in line with our expectations.
During 2010 gains on repurchases of the Groups own debt securities of 5.7 million were made.
No such repurchases took place during the year ended 30 September 2011 as increased bond prices made similar transactions less attractive.
Yield curve movements during the year resulted in hedging instrument fair value net losses of 0.3m 2010: nil, which do not affect cash ow.
As the fair value movements of hedged assets or liabilities are expected to trend to zero over time, this item is merely a timing difference.
The Group remains economically and appropriately hedged.
Cash generation has remained strong over the period, with free cash balances increasing to 195.0 million at 30 September 2011 from 147.8 million a year earlier.
Corporation tax has been charged at an effective tax rate of 26.2%, compared to 24.9% last year.
profits after taxation of 59.6 million 2010: 53.9 million have been transferred to shareholders funds, which totalled 742.0 million at the year-end 2010 restated note 2 : 692.0 million, representing 250p per share 2010: 234p per share Appendix C. Net interest income increased by 1.8% to 135.8 million 2010: 133.4 million, reflecting improved margins and the impact of new loan assets, both acquired and originated, on the balance sheet 8 Chief Executives review Annual Report & Accounts 2011 BUSINESS REVIEW New business volumes Year ended 30 September 2011 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m Number Number First Mortgages Buy-to-let 132.8 14.6 841 254 Consumer Finance Secured lending 0.1 0.5 5 34 132.9 15.1 846 288 First Mortgages Following the Groups return to new lending in September 2010, application levels have increased as the distribution base has been expanded and the product range widened.
By 30 September 2011 business agreements were in place with the major mortgage adviser networks, directly authorised mortgage intermediaries and buy-to-let specialist advisers and the Groups product range had been widened to optimise the value of those arrangements.
By 30 September 2011, 127.0 million of loans had been advanced under the Groups new products and a further 5.8 million 2010: 14.6 million of further advances had been made to existing borrowers.
The credit quality of the new lending business written in the year has been excellent, with an average loan to value ratio of 69.2% and no loans in arrears.
At 30 September 2011, the buy-to-let portfolio was 8,231.7 million, compared with 8,323.9 million a year earlier.
The credit performance of the portfolio over the year has again been exemplary, with the percentage of loans three months or more in arrears standing at 0.63%, including acquired loans and receivership cases, at 30 September 2011 30 September 2010: 0.94% and remains considerably better than the market average of 1.91% as recorded by the Council of Mortgage Lenders at that date.
This improved performance is reected in the reduction in the impairment charge attributable to first mortgages, to 5.6 million for the year ended 30 September 2011 from 18.6 million in the previous year.
At 30 September 2011 there were 1,483 properties across all portfolios where a receiver had been appointed 30 September 2010: 1,398.
Of those available for letting, 93.9% were let 30 September 2010: 93.5% with rental income comfortably covering the mortgage payments.
Following the Groups return to new lending in September 2010, application levels have increased and the product range widened... by 30 September 2011, 127.0 million of loans had been advanced under the Groups new products Chief Executives review 9 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The buy-to-let portfolio redemption rate has fallen to 2.2% for the year 2010: 3.0%.
This is a consequence of market conditions: landlords continue to display a long-term commitment to property investment: and alternative offerings from other lenders remain unattractive as a result of generally higher funding and capital costs.
At a broader level, the performance of the housing market continues to be characterised by historically low transaction levels, weak first-time buyer demand and at-to-falling house prices.
There are significant regional variations, with the market generally performing better in the South, particularly in London, and less well in the North where low demand is impacting both transactions and house prices.
With the social rented sector constrained, demand has inevitably focussed on the private rented sector.
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors noted in its latest Residential Lettings Survey that rents continue to increase, driven by high tenant demand and a shortage in the supply of homes available to rent.
This was supported by the Association of Residential Letting Agents who, in their third quarter 2011 report, noted that tenant demand remained high and that in some regions the sector is nearing capacity.
This high demand is benefitting landlords who are seeing rental levels improve and are experiencing little in the way of void periods.
Nevertheless, landlords are not expanding the supply of rented property rapidly for a variety of reasons: there remain supply constraints on the finance available: house price weakness and tight lending criteria mean that they do not have access to the same levels of equity that were available for new purchases prior to the credit crunch: and landlords are cautious in the current economic environment and are not compelled to buy when prices are at or indeed trending down marginally.
The buy-to-let mortgage market has, however, returned to growth with the Council of Mortgage Lenders reporting that the value of buy-to-let advances increased by 37% to 12.5 billion in the course of the financial year 2010: 9.1 billion whilst credit quality in the sector continues to improve with industry-wide buy-to-let arrears once again lower than in the owner-occupied market note 6.
The owner-occupied book reduced to 128.7 million from 151.7 million during the year ended 30 September 2011 and performed in line with the Groups expectations.
Save for the management of this book in run-off, there has been little activity in recent years in this area as the Group has focused on other lending markets, portfolio acquisitions and other sources of revenue generation.
Consumer Finance At 30 September 2011, the total loans outstanding on the Consumer Finance books were 363.8 million, compared with 435.6 million at 30 September 2010.
The redemption rate remains low relative to pre credit crunch rates as a result of the shortage of alternative offerings from other lenders, itself a consequence of tight credit conditions and the low level of housing activity.
Lending during the period has been limited to a small number of further advances to existing customers.
The Groups secured loan portfolio at 30 September 2011 was 340.1 million 2010: 391.9 million.
The percentage of accounts in this book with arrears of two months and over, excluding the portfolio acquired in August 2011, has increased from 10.03% at 30 September 2010 to 12.36% at 30 September 2011, reecting both the effects of economic conditions on borrower performance and the contraction in the size of the portfolio.
The arrears performance continues to compare favourably with the industry data recorded by the Finance & Leasing Association FLA of 19.3% at 30 September 2011 2010: 18.8%.
The residual unsecured loan, retail finance and car finance portfolios, totalling 23.7 million at 30 September 2011 30 September 2010: 43.7 million performed satisfactorily and in line with expectations.
The buy-to-let mortgage market has returned to growth with the Council of Mortgage Lenders reporting that the value of buy-to-let advances increased by 37% to 12.5 billion in the course of the financial year 2010: 9.1 billion 10 Chief Executives review Annual Report & Accounts 2011 During the financial year Idem invested a total of 22.7 million in three consumer loan transactions PORTFOLIO OPPORTUNITIES A major area of strategic focus for the Group has been the development of new sources of recurring income with the acquisition of loan portfolios through Idem Capital and the servicing of third party loan portfolios through Moorgate Loan Servicing.
Progress has been excellent and has resulted in an increase in operating profits in these areas to 7.6 million 2010: 4.9 million during the financial year and the prospect of significant growth in profit in the future.
These initiatives take advantage of the opportunities being created by the fide-leveraging activities of the larger banks and financial institutions.
Idem Capital Idem Capital invests in loan portfolios either as principal, where Idem acquires pools in its own right or as co-investor alongside other investors with, typically, Moorgate Loan Servicing appointed to act as servicer.
Co-investing has the potential for higher returns where the Group also derives income from servicing the loans within the underlying portfolio.
During the financial year Idem invested a total of 22.7 million in three consumer loan transactions and the transfer of the servicing of two of these portfolios to our systems has now been completed and is in progress with the other.
In addition, in October 2011 Idem Capital acquired a portfolio of unsecured loans from Royal Bank of Scotland for 43.2 million, paid from the Groups cash resources, bringing the total of portfolio investments since 2009 to 89.5 million.
The Group has a long and established track record in acquiring loan portfolios and successfully transferring the loan servicing in-house and managing the books effectively thereafter.
The portfolios of second mortgages and buy-to-let loans acquired in previous years have continued to perform well.
Our view remains that a number of loan portfolios owned by banks and other financial institutions will become available for sale as these institutions fide-leverage and restructure their balance sheets.
This is an important strategic opportunity for the Group, with the potential to deliver excellent returns to shareholders.
We will continue to pursue opportunities in this area.
Moorgate Loan Servicing Good progress has been made with the development of third party loan servicing through Moorgate Loan Servicing and its division, Arden Credit Management, which utilises our core administration and collection skills.
Our experience in loan management established over many years has enabled us to extend this service to our third party clients, providing significant added value to the performance of their loan portfolios.
Moorgate Loan Servicing assumed servicing of a further 49,768 accounts during the year with the result that 58.6% of accounts under management by the Group at 30 September 2011 were managed on behalf of third parties 2010: 54.3%.
A further agreement is in place whereby approximately 33,000 accounts will come under the Groups management during the year ended 30 September 2012.
Moorgate is well placed to take advantage of other opportunities that may arise over the coming years, particularly as portfolio disposals take place as part of the wider financial sector fide-leveraging process.
Chief Executives review 11 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC FUNDING On 10 November 2011 the Group completed a 163.8 million securitisation of buy-to-let loans, through Paragon Mortgages No.
16 PLC, despite very poor market conditions.
This securitisation, the Groups first securitisation since 2007, released warehouse capacity to accommodate further lending growth.
Notes, rated Aaa by Moodys Investors Service and AAA by Fitch Ratings, totalling 131.7 million were sold to investors with the Group retaining the remaining unrated notes.
This was the Groups 54th securitisation since first pioneering the methodology in 1987 and was an important landmark for the Group, being the first buy-to-let securitisation by any issuer in the UK since the credit crunch.
The notes were priced at LIBOR plus 275 basis points, reecting bond market conditions.
Whilst the notes match-fund the collateralised loans to maturity, we have the ability to call the notes after three years, should more attractive funding rates be achievable at that time.
The Group funds its mortgage originations through a 200.0 million revolving warehouse provided by Macquarie Bank, in which loans are warehoused prior to arranging term funding in the securitisation markets and, following the successful completion of the issuance by Paragon Mortgages No.
16, we plan to return to the securitisation markets regularly as business volumes increase.
Dependant on volume and market conditions, additional warehousing capacity may be sought in due course.
REGULATION Further consultation and rules owing from the FSAs Mortgage Market Review, including the provision of enhanced prudential supervision of non-bank lenders, had been expected during the Summer but have been delayed and are still awaited.
Certain of the Groups operations are already authorised by the FSA in respect of residential mortgage and insurance activity and we expect the Group to be well placed to comply with any changes in the regulatory framework.
The European Commission has recently published its proposed directive on credit agreements relating to residential property, which proposes additional disclosure and underwriting requirements for all mortgage lending to consumers secured on residential property.
It is unclear at this stage whether regulation will be extended to buy-to-let lending and we are engaged with the authorities on their proposal.
We will continue to maintain an active dialogue with the UK and European regulatory authorities as any proposals develop.
CONCLUSION The performance of the Group has been strong across the year, with great progress also evident in the delivery of valuable new opportunities.
Through Idem Capital we have made a number of portfolio investments during the year and after the year end, all of which should be immediately earnings enhancing.
Further, we have successfully re-established our buy-to-let new lending business and completed a securitisation of buy-to-let assets originated during the year, our first since 2007.
This augurs well for a strong start to 2012.
