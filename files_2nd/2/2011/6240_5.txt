Chief Executive Ofcers Report Our growth strategy seeks to optimise the mining valuechain: exploration, development, construction andoperations.
We continue to strengthen our precious metals position with a commitment to disciplined and sustainable growth.
Our continuous and growing investment in exploration in recent years has resulted in a strong pipeline of projects at all stages of exploration and development, ensuring long-term organic growth and advancing our strategic objectives.
We begin 2012 well positioned in the precious metals industry with a low cost production prole, rich resource base, robust growth pipeline andstrong cash position.
I believe the renewed focus on safety and corrective measures weare taking following our unacceptable 2011 safety performance, combined with a more deeply embedded risk management culture will support long-term value creation for all Fresnillo stakeholders.
Our growth strategy The fundamentals of the precious metals market have signicantly changed in the past decade, with exchange traded funds and investment demand now seen as the primary drivers of pricing, which in turn are strongly inuenced by global macroeconomic instability and geopolitical tensions rather than the once typical cycle of our industry: rising demandhigher pricesproducer expansionrising inventoriessofter prices.
See Market Overview pages 1619 Jaime Lomeln Our strategy of consistent investment across precious metals cycles Chief Executive officer seems particularly prescient when those cycles are increasingly volatile and unpredictable.
Given the typical 10 year span from I am pleased to report strong financial results in discovery of an ore body to commissioning of a mine and the difficulty of predicting metal prices, we believe that consistent 2011, driven by the strength of precious metal investment in exploration and low cost production is most likely prices and record gold production.
While silver toensure long-term, profitable growth.
Furthermore, this strategy production dropped at our agship Fresnillo has allowed us to continuously employ a stable and loyal workforce mine due to declining ore grades and additional with the skill mix required for all stages of the project cycle, which is a competitive advantage during times such as these when skilled safety measures, it was largely compensated for workers are in high demand.
by the successful start-up of the Saucito mine.
As a result of this strategy, in 2011 we commissioned the new Saucito mine silver, completed construction of Noche Buena gold and expanded production capacity at Soledad-Dipolos gold, all of which were early exploration prospects at a time when silver and gold prices were nowhere near their levels today.
Maximising the potential of our operations Of course revenue generation is driven by prevailing prices at the time our concentrates reach the market.
Our margins are driven by continued improvements in production, productivity, replacement of ore reserves and cost controls.
10 Fresnillo plc Annual report 2011 Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Strategic Review Our agship Fresnillo silver mine has been in near continuous operation for almost 500 years and is still the worlds single largest Total attributable silver resources primary silver mine, producing 2.8% of global production in 2011.
1.8 billion ounces 23.0% The challenge is to compensate for the trend of declining grades in current reserves by identifying new high grade areas and increasing 2010: 1.5 the volume of ore processed, while profitably mining the plentiful, lower grade resources.
To do so, we continue to explore in the mines area of inuence and plan to expand milling capacity from 8,000 to 10,000 tpd in 2013-2014.
To reinforce safety conditions in the mine, we restricted production Total attributable gold resources at certain higher grade stopes at Fresnillo for several months to 23.5 million ounces 16.9% ensure adequate backlling and ground control.
This resulted in annual silver production at this mine of 30.3 million ounces, lower 2010: 20.1 than the expected 34.7 million, but reafrmed our commitment tothe safety of our employees.
The San Carlos shaft was commissioned at year end, which will reduce hoisting and haulage costs by providing direct access to the western zone of the San Carlos vein.
Sales by metal The successful commercial start-up of the Saucito mine in April Our growing prole as a gold producer is reected 2011, the Groups fifth operating mine, compensated for the lower in the composition of sales since the time of our production of the Fresnillo mine.
The ramp-up of production to 5.9million silver ounces over the course of the year exceeded the IPO in 2008. revised target of 5.5 million ounces, itself up from the original full US$2,307.4m 37.5% 2008: US$839.6m year target of 4.7 million ounces.
Higher than expected production was achieved by milling at full capacity of 3,000 tpd, treatment of 2008 US$839.6m 2011 US$2,307.4m stockpiled ore from the pre-operative phase and ore from the initial production stopes.
Over the course of 2012 the mine and plant operations should stabilise and concentrate quality improve as more ore becomes available from production stopes.
Total attributable silver production in the year included 3.9 million ounces of silver accrued under the Silverstream Contract, 10.8% higher than in 2010.
2008 2011 The Group achieved record gold production of 448,866 attributable Silver 479.1 1,214.2 ounces, up 21.6% over 2010.
This was due to the successful Gold 303.5 1,009.4 ramp-up of expanded production capacity at Soledad-Dipolos Lead 30.0 43.0 to158,513 ounces, exceeding the target of 130,000 ounces Zinc 27.0 40.8 attributable production at this mine was 88,767 ounces : higher volumes from Herradura and Saucito: and the commissioning of Cinegas plant expansion and development ore from its new satellite mining area, San Ramn.
These results put us on track to meet our revised production targets for 2018 of 65 million ounces of silver and 500,000 ounces of gold per year, with 650 million ounces of silver and 5.0 million ounces of gold in reserves at that time.
Lead and zinc production increased by 13.0% and 2.9% respectively, due to the increased volumes of ore processed and higher ore grades at Fresnillo and Saucito.
These base metals are by-products of the Groups core operations.
11 Chief Executive Ofcers Report continued Silver continues to account for a majority of Group revenues, but the Capex 2011 share of gold rose from 36.1% in 2008 to 43.7% in 2011.

We also expanded milling capacity at Cinega and the sinking of the shaft to stabilise gold production at this mine at 110,000 ounces per year.
We also completed the sinking of the Jarillas shaft at Saucito, which will reduce hoisting and haulage costs when operational in late 2012: and began construction of the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura, Estimated project delivery programme which will process high grade ore from Herradura and SoledadOn track to produce 65moz of silver and Dipolos, increasing the gold recovery rate from approximately 70% obtained with the current heap leaching process to 95% once 500koz of gold by 2018 operational in 2013.

Strengthening the sustainability framework Our business model is dependent on community support and constructive labour relations, sound environmental management, and exemplary safety and healthy performance.
Indeed, a core pillar of our strategy is strengthening the Groups sustainability framework.
Yet our safety performance in 2011 was unacceptable, particularly in the context of our strong track record, with 11 fatalities in our mining operations during the year, and an additional fatality in early 2012.
Whether these were contractors or employees, new or experienced personnel, the result of human error or equipment failure, no fatality is ever acceptable.
With deep sadness, the Board of Directors and entire Senior Management team extends our condolences to the families and colleagues of the deceased.
