From the Chief Executive During 2011 Exillon increased oil production by 1 90%, EBiTDA by 314% and 2p reserves by 12%.

Dear Shareholders, our recent share price performance has been very disappointing.
The underlying performance of our operations has been excellent, but we have not been able to meet our own high growth expectations and those of our investors.
in 2012 we will strive to improve our operational performance further, and to improve our levels of transparency and communication.
in 2011 we witnessed rapid growth, increasing production by 90% and EBiTDA by 314%.
This growth was a result of our ongoing drilling programme and investment in infrastructure.
in 2011 we drilled 24 wells one exploration, five appraisal, three water injection, fourteen producers and one water supply well.
net loss for the year, which includes depreciation costs, foreign exchange translation effects, loss on writeoff of non-current assets and share based compensation costs, amounted to US$10.4 million compared to US$3.6 million in 2010.
Our most significant infrastructure achievement was the completion of the Transneft oil terminal at Exillon WS.
This is 100 km closer than the nearest alternative and will allow us to reduce significantly our transportation costs and to guarantee independence from third parties.
This terminal is expected to become operational in 2012.
We also completed oil processing facilities and gas power generators in Exillon Tp and Exillon WS.
in February 2012 we published a review of reserves from Miller & lents.
"This recorded a 12% increase in proven reserves 1P to 125 million barrels and total proved plus probable ""2P"" reserves increased by 11% to 265 million barrels."
"Total proved plus probable plus possible ""3P"" reserves decreased by 9% to 400 million barrels."
We were also able to secure the ETp Vii licence immediately to the south of our ETp ii licence.
Financially, we ended the year with US$117.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, and US$49.0 million of debt.
In February 2012 we secured a loan facility of US$100 million to replace our US$50 million facility.
