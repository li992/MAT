Performance Overview We maintained silver production levels in 2011 and exceeded our annual production target for gold despite lower average ore grades.
We drew on our technical expertise to increase volumes of ore milled and improve recovery rates, while successfully ramping up operations at Saucito and expanding capacity at Soledad-Dipolos andCinega.

In addition, we implemented a 6.5% wage increase in Mexican pesos, plus 1.5% in fringe benets.
Our value chain The adverse effect of a 1.7% revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar affected peso-denominated production Mines in operation costswhen translated into US dollars.
Given the scarcity of trained industry experts, we were pleased Fresnillo Saucito toincrease our team of exploration geologists and engineers from Cinega Herradura 70to80 professionals in 2011.
This helped grow our exploration Soledad-Dipolos programme from 341,265 metres of drilling in 2010 to 509,330 metres in 2011.
Measured, indicated and inferred resources Development projects San Ramn at Cinega at operating mines Saucito II at Saucito expanded by 23.0% for silver and 16.9% for gold.
We also increased Dynamic leaching our claim holdings from 1.9 million to 2.1 million hectares in Mexico, plant at Herradura and from 29,135 to 78,800 hectares in Peru.
