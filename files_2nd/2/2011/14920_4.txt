Thereafter, we saw a sequential decline throughout the second half which resulted in an end to the year which was far more subdued than the beginning.
Nonetheless, although current demand is lower than in the prior year, it is undoubtedly the case that overall, market conditions remain in far better shape than those we saw in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
It is also true that just as sentiment can deteriorate very quickly, it can also move in a positive direction equally rapidly.
Whatever 2012 has in store for us, we remain confident that we will make the best of it.
We will manage the business prudently but we will not lose sight of the great medium term prospects for our business and where appropriate we will invest to ensure that the Groups future lives up to its potential.
In the meantime we are an agile, cash rich business with a twenty five year track record of profitability.
Our seasoned management team has seen all market scenarios and has become increasingly adept in recent years in driving the best available result from uncertain circumstances.
