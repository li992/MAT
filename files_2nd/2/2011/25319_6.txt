This allowed the business to make good progress despite the expected increase in funding costs following the 2010 refinancing and higher early settlement rebates arising from the implementation of the EU Consumer Credit Directive, which together totalled 23.6 million.
At the start of 2011 our key objective was to accelerate growth against a backdrop of improving economic conditions in all our markets.
Our plan was to drive growth by recruiting more agents, increasing investment in marketing and by the selective easing of credit controls.
