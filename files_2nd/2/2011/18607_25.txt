Profit from sales of property including CHARM, was 81.0m compared to 61.5m in 2010 including a 1.4m release of net realisable value provision.
This was generated from gross sales proceeds of 223m compared to 173m in 2010.
This movement in volume was driven mainly by an increase in investment sales properties with tenants in place and other sales which rose from 39.9m to 63.9m.
Overall margins rose from 34.8% to 36.3% assisted by an increased contribution from our development business.
Fees have risen to 8.0m from 6.5m assisted by increased G:res fees fees have been driven by increased asset values and higher rents and income from both G:RAMP and the Sovereign Reversions joint venture.
