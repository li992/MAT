Strategic report Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements Overall balance of measures for variable pay for FY14 Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors The chart below details the composition of each Executive Directors remuneration package and how it varies at different levels of performance under the policy set out above.
It demonstrates the balance between fixed and variable pay at threshold, on-target and maximum performance levels under the normal remuneration policy for the Executive Directors.
On target target annual bonus of 60% of salary plus target LTIP awards of 90% of salary plus matching awards of 60% of salary.
Maximum maximum annual bonus of 100% of salary plus maximum LTIP awards of 150% of salary plus matching awards of 150% of salary.
Whilst the maximum award limit under the LTIP is 200% of salary, historically it has been 150% of salary and therefore it is this value which has been used in the above.
Salary levels on which other elements of the packages are calculated are based on those applying from July 2014.
The value of taxable benefits is based on the actual values paid in FY14.
Richard Harpin participates in a defined benefit scheme which has been valued according to BIS regulations.
The other Executives participate in a defined contribution scheme, receiving 20% of basic salary as pension provision.
The Executive Directors may participate in all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees.
The value that may be received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits.
For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the above charts.
The chart excludes the impact of share price growth.
