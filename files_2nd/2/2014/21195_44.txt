This index has been chosen because it is a recognised equity market index of which Aviva is a member.
The companies which comprise the current LTIP comparator group for TSR purposes are listed in the TSR Targets section above.

Percentage change in remuneration of Group CEO The table below would ordinarily set out the increase in the basic salary, bonus and benefits of the Group CEO and that of the wider UK workforce.
The UK employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group, as all EDs are based in the UK albeit with a global role and responsibilities, and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.
Table 18: Percentage change in remuneration of Group CEO % change in % change in % change in basic salary bonus benefits 2013 2014 2013 - 2014 2013 - 2014 Group CEO 15.56% 77.41 % 1 All UK-based employees 4.01% 15.72 % 5.51% Notes 1 The decrease in bonus awards for all UK based employees in 2014 was expected given the exceptional performance and hence high level of bonuses of the UK businesses against their targets in 2013.
Although performance in 2014 was also strong, as flagged in the 2013 DRR, it was anticipated that, given the high level of payout in 2013, bonus awards for 2014 were not likely to remain at this level.
