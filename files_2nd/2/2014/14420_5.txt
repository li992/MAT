Capital expenditures were up from $99.1 million in 2013 to The re-classification has been done following on from an $162.5 million in 2014 predominantly due to the TGT H5 exhaustive technical study performed by ERC Equipoise, development and exploration activity in Africa.

It is now our intention to commission c. $200 million, bringing the total returned in the Companys an independent reserve report covering all of our short history of making distributions to c. $333 million.
With our significant financial flexibility, fully funded capex programme and strict cost discipline, we can continue our strategy of focusing on cash flow generation and delivering to shareholders both value through cash returns and growth, be it organic or inorganic.
The short term priority is to shape the business, which is already resilient in a downside scenario of persisting low oil prices, and to put plans in place for delivering sustainable growth as the oil price recovers.
| Annual Report and Accounts 2014 SOCO INTERNATIONAL PLC ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT 8 CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVES STATEMENT CONTINUED VIETNAM The TGT field has been a great investment for SOCO and the cash flow from the field has enabled the Company to initiate cash returns to shareholders.
The TGT field has attractive economics and cost recovery terms, low operating costs and benign operating and geopolitical backdrop.
But the field economics also mean that the cash flow profile and returns are significantly geared to the oil price.
The ERCE study of the TGT field has significantly advanced our understanding of the field and by most indications improved that of our partners.
The dynamic model developed by ERCE, a result of almost a years work of a multidisciplinary team, incorporating all available geological and field performance data, is the best tool available yet.
The modelling study demonstrates a broad range of interpretations and of potential recovery scenarios depending on the level of development drilling, infrastructure optimisation and upgrade, as well as the most optimal reservoir performance management to optimise field recovery.
Clearly, the scope of the development programme in the updated full FDP will to a large extent depend on the oil price outlook at the time and JOC partners alignment on a development path and appetite to commit capital.
Consequently, a substantial amount of TGT 2P reserves has been re-classified into 2C Contingent Resources, reflecting the fact that currently only the original FDP and H5 FDP wells are being drilled and that, at this stage, there is no agreement among the JOC partners on the scope of development and level of investment going forward.
Therefore, we believe that the prudent approach to 2P reserve booking against this background, taking into account the level of reservoir complexity and uncertainty, is to include only the P50 recoverable volumes based on existing and likely near term wells, and optimal field management.
Additionally, a portion of the 2P reserves has been recognised as 3C Contingent Resources reflecting a degree of geological uncertainty around the range of oil-in-place estimates and partner alignment on the level of future capital investment in the field.
For CNV, our previous commercial reserve estimates were largely predicated on the successful drilling of the CNV-7P well, which was targeting the previously untapped south west area of the field and material increase in production, leading to further development drilling.
Disappointingly, due to unexpected geological issues the well failed to reach the target reservoir despite several attempts to sidetrack.
Thus, we have significantly reduced our estimates of the 2P reserves for CNV and re-classified undrilled wells including the CNV-7P well into Contingent Resources.

The well results are being analysed in order to determine the continuity of the productive reservoirs of the well with the WILL BE ON BRINGING nearby discoveries in the Marine XII Block and to progress towards potential unitisation with the Litchendjili field.
TGTS H5 FAULT BLOCK The reserves associated with the Viodo field in Marine XI have been re-classified to Contingent Resources as there are no plans for commercial standalone development.

Our production guidance range for 2015 remains at 10.5-12 kboepd, reflecting reduced scope of the 2015 TGT ADDITIONAL drilling programme, largely due to the uncertain oil price environment, and conservative estimates of initial flow rates from TGT H5.
