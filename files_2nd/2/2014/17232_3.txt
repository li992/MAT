convenience stores, develop We have identified significant opportunities to generate substantial free cash flow through growth, meaningful reductions in capital expenditure, our online capabilities and improved management of our working capital and from property disposals.
We will maintain our balance sheet strength, underpinned by a disciplined approach to capital management, supported by a commitment do more of what matters to a strong, investment-grade, credit rating over the medium term.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE to help our customers.
Our capital expenditure programme has three elements: the maintenance of our asset base, the development of our infrastructure and the growth of our new channels and manufacturing capability.
The total of 1.1bn that we spent in 2013 14 represents the peak level of our capital expenditure investment and will reduce significantly in the years ahead.
Our future top line growth will be driven principally through the fast growing online and convenience channels, both of which are relatively capital-light compared to developing new supermarket space.
Accordingly our investment focus in future will be on these channels.
We will only acquire new supermarket sites in exceptional circumstances.
As a result of these measures, our requirement for capital expenditure has been reduced significantly from its current year level of 1.1bn, and from previous guidance, to 550m in 2014 15, reducing to around 400m annually thereafter.
WORKING CAPITAL Our ongoing investment in upgrading IT systems across the whole business continues to progress and will provide significant opportunities to optimise our control of working capital, particularly in relation to inventory and the management of our supply chain.
All you need, in one go Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2013 14 Strategic report 10 Chief Executives review A CLEAR VISION & STRATEGY CONTINUED PROPERTY Morrisons property portfolio has an estimated market value of around 9bn.
Over 90% of our core estate is freehold, a considerably greater proportion than our major competitors.
As indicated at our Interim Results we have been reviewing opportunities to manage our property portfolio more actively than we have historically, in order to release surplus cash whilst improving shareholder returns.
This review has been undertaken on the basis that we will: value the clear control and flexibility benefits associated with freehold ownership of stores: retain an overwhelmingly freehold position in our core estate strongest in the sector: maintain a strong, conservative and prudent capital structure: and not change the risk profile of the Company.
It is expected that the freehold element of our core estate will not fall below 80%, the highest ratio in the sector.
In line with these criteria we plan to monetise some 1bn of property value by 2016 17.
We will do this principally through the disposal of our Morrisons property portfolio non-core assets, our development assets, our newer distribution assets and our investment properties including, in a small number of cases has an estimated market where it makes sense to do so, the associated stores.
We expect to realise 400m 500m of disposals in 2014 15. value of around 9bn.
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS The current year is the final year of a three year commitment, made Over 90% of our core estate in March 2011, to provide a minimum annual dividend increase of 10%.
The Boards confidence in Morrisons strategic direction and the long-term prospects of the business is reflected by its commitment to a progressive is freehold, a considerably dividend policy, moving to two times cover over time.
This is underpinned by a commitment to a minimum 5% increase in 2014 15. greater proportion than our CAPITAL ALLOCATION At our Interim Results announcement in September 2013 we set out major competitors.
a framework by which we would allocate capital within our business.
Our first priority is to invest to support our estate and infrastructure and to reduce our cost base.
Thereafter we will seek to maintain debt ratios which support a strong investment grade credit rating, before investing in profitable growth opportunities and paying dividends in line with policy.
Any capital which is surplus to these requirements will be returned to shareholders over time.
We anticipate that the combination of a reduction in capital investment, improvements in our working capital and an active property estate management programme as set out above, will lead to the generation of significant free cash flow.
Subject to our commitment to an investment grade credit rating over the medium term, this will be returned to shareholders in an appropriate form, to be determined at the start of each financial year.
Our balance sheet is strong.
We have a valuable real estate portfolio, which provides great flexibility to the business.
We will realise value from our property portfolio, whilst retaining a significantly higher freehold mix than our peers.
We have substantial free cash flow generation opportunities.
Overall, we expect to generate 2bn of free cash flow in the three years to 2016 17.
