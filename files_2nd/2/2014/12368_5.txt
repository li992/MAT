at underground mines, and enhancing risk management Our efforts during the year to come will be focused on: In 2014, we considerably expanded our reserves to 21.6 Moz activities with particular attention given to underground mining In 2014, our drilling volumes increased by a further 22% step-out drilling at Kyzyl, including the drilling to establish of gold equivalent.
This was a result of the Kyzyl acquisition and blasting works.
The total capital expenditure on resources for the Bolshevik deposit and Bakyrchik 6.7 Moz, coupled with a significant resource-to-reserve exploration increased to US$72 million in line with the increased exploration area: conversion and initial reserve estimate completed at several Project development volumes, including capital-intensive underground exploration at of our operating mines and advanced exploration projects The key focus of management will increasingly shift towards Albazino and drilling at the newly acquired Kyzyl project.
continuing brownfield exploration near the Omolon and including Albazino underground, Svetloye, Kutyn and Veduga.
our new projects Kyzyl being the largest.
Our efforts in 2015 Khakanja operations: Mineral resources additional to ore reserves declined by will centre around completion of the full feasibility study for the As a result, significant resource to reserve conversions were step-out drilling at the flanks of known-ore bodies at Albazino: 12%, mainly as a result of the resource-to-reserve conversion, project in Q4 2015 and the start of full-scale construction in achieved during the year, along with maiden reserve and particularly at Albazino, Svetloye and Olcha Dukat hub.
We will proceed with the construction of the Svetloye resource estimates completed for several greenfield projects.
in-fill drilling at Svetloye ahead of the expected Additionally, with the acquisition of Kyzyl, we increased mine, approved in 2014, with mining expected to start in These included: commencement of mining in Q4 2015: resources by 3.8 Moz.
We will also continue geological and metallurgical initial reserve estimate at Svetloye Khakanja hub of 677 Koz completing the PGM resource assessment at the Semcha studies at Viksha Semcha our PGM project in Karelia.
with an additional 80 Koz of resources, which was followed area and prospecting for new objects with PGM mineralisation The moderate gold and silver prices, of US$1,200 oz and by Board approval of the project development decision: in the region.
US$17 oz respectively, used in both reserve and resource estimates in 2014 2013: US$1,300 oz and US$22.5 oz did not have a material impact on the final size of either but we felt that our more conservative approach was warranted.
Breakdown of exploration assets by stages Drilling volume 268.8 km Mainly as a result of the Kyzyl acquisition, our average ore Exploration works focused on 29 licenced areas reserve grade increased by 16% to 4.3 g t GE and is one of the highest in the sector see chart on page 13.
The average mineral resource grade also increased by 11% to 4.2 g t, also 200.5 15 2 mainly due to the addition of Kyzyl mineral resources at 6.9 g t. 68.3 12 Geological studies Greenfield exploration Development Brownfield Greenfield 26 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 27
