Subject to achieving the FY15 EBITDA target, and satisfactory personal performance, a further c. 20 million shares are expected to vest under the 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme.
The 2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme underlying EBITDA targets before scheme costs, relate to performance between FY12 and FY15.
The FY12 target of 215m, the FY13 target of 250m, and the FY14 target of 260m have all been achieved.
