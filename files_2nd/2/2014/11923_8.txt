We can meet this demand by accelerating our shift to digital, to services and to fast-growing economies: and committing to deliver measurably improved learning outcomes through our efficacy framework.
Our primary segments for management reporting are Geographies North America, Core and Growth as this is how we drive business performance.
This is how we reach learners, through content and digital services in individual classrooms: through broad partnerships with public and private education institutions and, in certain markets, by directly expanding capacity through our own schools and colleges.
This geographical structure is wholly dependent upon a parallel product development strategy, in which we organise by learning ages and stages School, Higher Education and Professional.
By focusing our product development around the needs of the learner, we are able to centre evidence and expertise where it can be best applied to improving outcomes for people.
