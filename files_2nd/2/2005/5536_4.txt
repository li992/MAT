Chief Executives Review Results 2005 has been another good year of consolidation and progress for Enterprise Inns.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 29% to 520.2 million, driven by growth in average operating profit per pub of 8% and the successful integration of the Unique business which was acquired in March 2004.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 33% to 63.2p, rounding off a ten year run since Enterprise floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1995 which has delivered compound annual growth in earnings per share of more than 30%.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 5 Chief Executives Review At Enterprise, we are committed to improving the quality of our pubs, investing alongside our licensees to develop their businesses, gain market share and unlock additional profits.
During the year we invested 55 million of capital and revenue expenditure into the estate and, together with a similar level of expenditure by our licensees, have improved over 1,100 pubs, either through major schemes or minor refurbishments.
We continued to improve the quality of the estate through churn, buying 21 top quality pubs for a total consideration of 14 million and selling 158 underperforming sites for 47 million, recording a profit on disposal of 3 million.
At 30 September 2005 our estate of 8,590 pubs was valued at 5.2 billion, reflecting a 5% increase in underlying pub values.
Since the beginning of the new financial year, we have purchased a further 34 pubs for 36 million and sold 14 for 7 million.
We continue to review all acquisition opportunities as they arise, judging them against our strict quality, risk and return criteria and their ability to deliver long term enhancement in shareholder value.
Over the past year we have continued to see improvements in the quality, value and earnings potential of our pubs, with average operating profit per pub up by 8% to 60,100.

It is the link between the quality of our pubs, our operating profit and our licensees profitability which is the key to our long-term success.
Running a pub is one of the most demanding jobs around, requiring great professional and people skills, boundless energy and enthusiasm and a willingness to work long hours.
Against a backdrop of increasing underlying costs and the endless ability of government to impose yet more regulation and bureaucracy, the best licensees look for quality outlets that give them a chance to make a good return for their effort and investment.
It is not just the quality of the pub itself which is important to the licensee, but the essential fairness of the overall package offered, especially the level of rent, the help and support given to licensees and the range of products offered.
In this latter regard, our licensees enjoy an unrivalled choice across the vast majority of beer brands available in the UK and we were delighted this year to extend our Society of Independent Brewers cask ale scheme across the whole estate.
Against a national decline in the availability and consumption of cask ales, we have worked with local and regional brewers to grow cask ale sales year on year, to a level where they now represent more than 13% of our beer volumes, against a national average estimated to be around 8%.
These brands may not deliver the highest level of unit margin to Enterprise but they offer our licensees the chance to develop their businesses and give their customers the range of products that they seek.
As a result of our continuing commitment to ensuring that rental levels are fair, we are pleased that, once again, our estate leads the field in providing worthwhile returns for our hard-working licensees.
We estimate that the level of licensee profitability has increased by 5% during the year to an industry leading average of 42,000.

As a result we are never short of good quality, fully funded applicants to take over pubs which become available for lease or tenancy.
Once again, this is supported by improvements in certain key performance indicators: Our database has more than 900 fully funded applicants, four times the number of pubs available to let.
An active lease assignment market has seen more than 600 businesses change hands during the year at an average lease premium of almost 70,000.
Rent concessions at 30 September 2005 amounted to just 0.4% of rent roll.
Over 1,100 rent reviews were completed during the year, with only two going through any form of arbitration, both of which were found in our favour.
Bad debt costs for the year reduced once again, and remain under 0.2% of turnover.
We remain convinced that the leased and tenanted format offers an excellent low-cost opportunity for entrepreneurial licensees to run their own businesses.
The Trade and Industry Select Committee looked at working practices within the tied-pub sector and concluded that, on the whole, they are fair and work well in the interest of all parties.
In particular, we are pleased that the industry standard Code of Practice, recently issued by the British Beer and Pub Association, reflects practices and recommendations that have been the norm at Enterprise for a long time.
Legislative background Licensing reform The past year has seen the industry get to grips with the substantial costs and workload arising from implementation of the Licensing Act 2003.
The Enterprise team worked hard throughout the year to help licensees to develop their business operating plans and submit their applications.
In the end, some 7,500 of our pubs applied to extend their existing opening hours and the majority have been approved without difficulty.
We do not anticipate a material increase in turnover and profitability arising from the additional hours, simply a greater flexibility to allow responsible licensees better to serve the needs of their customers.
Flexible opening hours have, however, become part of the debate surrounding binge drinking and anti-social behaviour.
Whilst it is convenient for government to point the finger of blame at pubs, in a few cases with justification, this is a debate which has far wider implications including education and personal responsibility, sensible advertising and promotions, the pricing and control of the sale of alcohol in supermarkets and effective policing and control of rogue outlets and individual drinkers.
The vast majority of pubs are responsibly run by well trained and professional licensees.
It is essential that the government and the police recognise that the problems are associated with a small minority of the population and continue to target those outlets and individuals who encourage or engage in anti-social behaviour.
Smoking in public places The governments approach to the control of smoking in pubs is causing uncertainty and concern across the industry.
Whilst most would agree that smoking is unacceptable where food is being consumed, the key issue in this debate should be maintaining choice for consumers, whilst giving due consideration to health and safety and the protection of staff.
8 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 Chief Executives Review The reforms as currently proposed will force many pubs to choose between selling food in a smoke free environment or abandoning food and simply supplying drink to customers who would then be allowed to smoke.
Furthermore, some 20,000 clubs, many of which operate in direct competition to pubs, are to be exempt from the legislation under proposals that appear to take little account of the health and welfare of bar staff and club stewards.
The legislation as currently proposed will undoubtedly change and potentially damage the traditional British pub, often in rural or community surroundings, which survives by providing an all round service to its customers, a social meeting place to have a drink with friends and at the same time an excellent location for a good meal out, complementary activities vital both to the community and to the financial viability of the pub.
The industry had been working towards the same rules applying to all, with the objective being the cessation of smoking at the bar and the steady reduction in the space available for smokers in pubs, culminating in separately defined smoking rooms or outside spaces designated for customers who wish to smoke.
We hope that through the consultation process we will return to a solution which is sensible for employees and consumers and which will not put many small community and rural pubs under pressure, with the resulting loss of jobs, tax revenues and amenity.
Conclusion This has been another great year for Enterprise.
Working alongside our licensees, we have seen growth in market share and profitability in a market which remains highly competitive and where rising costs and weakness in consumer confidence have presented special challenges.
The Enterprise team has successfully managed the integration of the Unique estate while coping with the additional workload imposed as a result of licensing reform.
We have once again delivered substantial growth in earnings and dividends and we are now in a position to return surplus cash to shareholders through a rolling share buy back programme.
The new financial year has started well but we expect to see the opportunities arising from flexible opening hours tempered by continuing pressure on consumer discretionary spend.
However, great pubs will always do well, whatever the economic backdrop and the team looks forward to another challenging year of continued success and growth in shareholder value.
