What we think The Advertising & Marketing Services Industry New markets and new technologies WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell reports Annual Report 2005 70 What we think What we think 005 was a surprisingly strong year, after 2004, which marked the full recovery from the internet bust of 2000.
In theory, 2005 should have been the weakest of the four-year cycle to 2008, with no events to boost advertising and marketing services spending.
It was, however, WPPs best year ever measured by all metrics.
It achieved, for the first time, 15% operating margins under old 2004 UK GAAP measures.
2006 has already shown more improvement.
It should, in theory, be even better a mini-quadrennial boosted by mid-term Congressional elections in the US, the Winter Olympics in Turin and soccers World Cup in Germany.
