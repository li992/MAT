Chief Executives Review Our portfolio is now totally concentrated in central London enabling us to devote all our specialist skills to creating value in one of the worlds most dynamic and exciting property markets Toby Courtauld Chief Executive We have made good progress against all of our management objectives over the past twelve months: net assets per share have grown strongly: the prospects for the Groups portfolio have been strengthened through sales totalling 135 million and acquisitions of 223 million, of which 134 million was acquired in our joint venture: our development programme has continued to expand with the addition of new projects: our focused asset management is keeping voids well below market levels: and the return of 101 million to shareholders combined with further rationalisation of our debenture portfolio have both lowered our cost of debt and established a more appropriate level of balance sheet gearing for this point in the property cycle.
Following the sales of our remaining provincial properties, the portfolio is now totally concentrated in central London enabling us to devote all our specialist skills to creating value in one of the worlds most dynamic and exciting property markets.
London alone accounts for almost 20% of UK Gross Domestic Product and has consistently outgrown the rest of the country over the last ten years: this is a trend which looks set to continue.
Before reviewing our activity over the past year, I would first like to set the scene by looking at current market conditions.
Twelve months ago, we were cautiously optimistic about the prospects for commercial property in London: we remain so.
Although the amount of space being leased by businesses in London today is broadly in line with the long-term average, vacancy rates are now falling across the market, due primarily to the lack of new supply coming on stream.
This is particularly the case in the West End where 77% of our portfolio is located.
Here, we estimate that only 3.6 million sq ft will be delivered by the development industry over the next three years.
Even without an increase in take-up, we think vacancy rates are set to fall further during this year putting upward pressure on rents as occupiers seeking new premises outnumber the supply of new, quality office space.
In fact, we expect the rate of take-up across central London to increase during the year, helping to reduce overall vacancy rates from 11% today to approximately 9% by this time next year and 8% in the West End, down from 9%.
For the short term, at least, we maintain our more cautious stance on the City market as, despite encouraging levels of tenant demand, there remains a surfeit of space to let.
However, we expect the vacancy rate to fall during the year from its current level of 13%, and with rental growth likely to return during 2006, this is a market which we will be studying closely for acquisition opportunities.
In the central London investment markets, turnover levels have continued their record breaking run, fuelled by the plentiful supply of relatively cheap money and the attractiveness of commercial property yields compared to other asset classes.
This yield gap helps explain the estimated 10 billion of transactions over the past year.
Competition for well let investments remains fierce, resulting in market capitalisation rates falling by as much as 100 basis points over the period.
We have consistently taken the opportunity to dispose of assets where we feel pricing to be out of line with their real worth.

First, portfolio capitalisation rates fell with the equivalent yield reducing by some 53 basis points: second, rental values increased throughout the portfolio: and third, significant progress was made within our development portfolio.
Although the let portfolio remains marginally over-rented to the tune of 5.3% down from 6.9% as at March 2004, rental values increased, on a like-for-like basis, by 9.4% or 4.4 million.
Reflecting the points made above on the gentle recovery in market leasing conditions, most of the increase was in the second half 5.9% versus 3.5% in the first six months and in the West End office portfolio up 12.8%, the latter dominated by a strong performance at Met Building, 22 Percy Street, W1 formerly Metropolis House of 18.7%.
The four properties in the course of development increased in value by 14.9 million or 15.8%, net of capital expenditure.
Met Building showed the strongest gain at 29.8% whilst 190 Great Portland Street, W1, where work recently started, increased by 21.2% over the second six months.
As at 31 March 2005, the 100% owned portfolio was valued at 804.4 million by CB Richard Ellis with a further 156.7 million held in our 50:50 joint venture with Liverpool Victoria, the Great Victoria Partnership, valued by Atisreal.
During the year, we sold our remaining properties outside London and at the year end 77% was in the West End with the remaining 23% in the City.
A detailed breakdown of the sector splits and their individual performances can be found in the Portfolio Statistics on pages 24 to 27.
Management of Income and Voids A central theme of our property strategy is the constant focus on ways to improve the income profile of our properties.
The past year has been no different with a total of 134 lease events executed by our Asset Management group, all within the context of each propertys detailed business plan.
As we bring a number of properties forward for development, a key ambition of the team has been the delivery of vacant possession to allow work to begin.
During the year, 21 surrenders were negotiated to meet this need and of the 31 units where tenants vacated at lease expiry or on the exercise of a break clause out of a possible 57, 21 were deliberately left vacant.
Nevertheless, 30 lettings allowed us to maintain the Groups void rate at 2.6%, showing no change from March or September last year and comparing well to the central London rate of approximately 11%.
As developments are completed, the Group void rate will rise from these low levels: following practical completion at Met Building it rose to 6.4%.
Development Update Turning to our development programme, as I have been reporting over the past two years, we have again made good progress in our ambition to upgrade materially the quality of our portfolio and its growth prospects through development and significant refurbishment.
We have four schemes on site representing a total of 250,000 sq ft and a further three major projects where planning permission has been granted.
These seven projects plus schemes at Tooley Street, SE1 planning application recently submitted and 60 62 Margaret Street, W1 recently acquired with vacant possession represent our near-term programme.
They will deliver almost 680,000 sq ft of new, high quality office and retail space an increase of almost 300,000 sq ft, or 74%, cost a total of approximately 185 million to build excluding the existing land value, should generate net new rents of almost 19 million up from 5.1 million today and are expected to deliver an average overall profit on cost of some 20%.
At Met Building, 22 Percy Street, W1 practical completion was achieved on 6 May bringing to a close the successful reconstruction of this 112,000 sq ft office and retail scheme both on time and on budget: the property is already 43% let by rental value.
Improvements in the buildings design during the construction process, healthy increases in rental values and keener capitalisation yields have combined to produce an estimated surplus on cost for this project in excess of 22 million, or 50%.
Our major refurbishment to deliver 100,000 sq ft of office and retail space at 190 Great Portland Street, W1 commenced in January this year and we anticipate completing the project early in 2007.

These three schemes were the subject of a complicated series of linked planning discussions with Westminster City Council designed to address stringent requirements on the provision of residential space, including affordable housing, in all new developments in Westminster.
Obtaining these valuable consents whilst providing the Council with their requirements, is a testament both to the skill of our in-house development team and the benefits of a close working relationship between developer and planning authority.
We expect to begin demolition work at Knighton House during early 2006 with Titchmor and 79 83 Great Portland Street commencing shortly thereafter.
Following a carefully planned site assembly, we recently completed the design process at Tooley Street, SE1 submitting a detailed planning application to Southwark Borough Council in March.
Our proposals for an office and retail development of 220,000 sq ft continue the regeneration of this area of Southwark and include the refurbishment of three existing period buildings fronting a new 180,000 sq ft courtyard office scheme directly opposite the new 3 million sq ft More London development.
Including Tooley Street, we expect to go on site at a further five locations during this financial year, four of which are in the West End, developing new lettable space of approximately 430,000 sq ft to add to the 250,000 sq ft currently under development.
Looking further ahead, preliminary discussions are under way with adjoining owners in relation to the redevelopment of one of our largest holdings at the corner of Bishopsgate and Camomile Street, EC3.
Following the acquisition of Ellerman House, 12 20 Camomile Street, completing our site assembly earlier in the year, a full professional team is engaged in designing a scheme.
Disposals and Acquisitions Two years ago, I commented that we would focus our attention on sourcing new opportunities for growth, having completed the bulk of our strategic sales programme.
Since then, investment markets have often proved prohibitively expensive and we have continued to capitalise on these conditions by satisfying investors exceptional demand through sales of properties where, in our view, further opportunities for value creation were limited.
During the year we disposed of seven properties generating sales proceeds of 135.5 million, some 11.6 million or 9.4% ahead of their March 2004 valuations.
At Clarendon House, 17 18 New Bond Street, W1, we sold our 125 year leasehold interest for 50 million representing a yield of 4.5% following a successful asset management programme on the adjacent property, Bond Street House, the positive effect of which we were able to capture in the Clarendon House price.
The sale generated a profit of 6.5 million, or 14.9% over the March 2004 book value.
We also crystallised the value of our lease restructuring activity at Barnards Inn, 86 Fetter Lane, EC4, through a sale to an institution for 37.6 million along with 38 Finsbury Square, EC2, for 18.5 million realising net uplifts on March 2004 values of 2.6 million or 7.4% and 1.9 million or 11.8% respectively.
Following our disposals of interests in Maidenhead and Hounslow, our last remaining properties outside London, all of our activities are now focused entirely in the capital.
Since the year end, we have sold 55 Drury Lane, WC2 to an institution for 16.75 million.
This 28,000 sq ft office building was built by the Company in 1992 and had a weighted unexpired lease term of 6.4 years.
The price paid reflects a yield to the purchaser of 5.4%, and a premium to its March 2004 book value of 32%.
Despite the competitive investment environment, we continue to unearth interesting opportunities to buy.
In my report at the Interim stage, I mentioned acquisitions in Broadwick Street, Soho, Tooley Street, SE1, Camomile Street, EC3 and in January we acquired a 22,000 sq ft redevelopment opportunity at 60 62 Margaret Street, W1 for 5.75 million, which sits directly behind our holdings in Market Place, and which brings the total value of acquisitions on the balance sheet to March 2005 to 89 million.
GREAT PORTLAND ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2005 13 Chief Executives Review Also at the Interim stage I announced the creation of the Great Victoria Partnership GVP, seeded by four properties, two of which were new to the Group, and which had acquired a leasehold interest in Mount Royal, 508 540 Oxford Street, W1 for 80 million.
In January, GVP acquired the Prudentials intermediate interest in Mount Royal for 10.9 million, adding 1.9 million to the propertys rent roll.
Since the year end a new joint venture with Liverpool Victoria, the Great Victoria Partnership No.
2 GVP2, has been created and has acquired 208 222 Regent Street, W1 with the adjacent Lasenby House, W1 for a total of 66.5 million, bringing the total amount of acquisitions on balance sheet and in joint venture to 295 million since March 2004.
Let to retailers Liberty and Gap and with Barclays and MWB Business Exchange above, 208 222 Regent Street represents a good example of the sort of acquisition we favour.
The property was held on a 46 year lease from the Crown Estate and offers a number of opportunities for improving the retailing configuration.
Since the purchase, we have restructured our leasehold interest, buying a longer 125 year lease from the Crown at a lower ground rent for 6 million.
Including the headlease regear, GVP2s total purchase price was 72.5 million compared to its valuation carried out by Atisreal of 78 million immediately following our asset management activity.
We have subsequently sold Lasenby House to Shaftesbury PLC, a neighbouring owner, for a small surplus.
In total, the properties acquired during the year, including those in GVP, increased in value by 21.9 million or 9.4% after all costs.
Outlook Occupational markets in central London continue to recover, albeit slowly.
The West End remains our favoured location due to its healthier balance of supply and demand when compared to the City.
Within it, there are some encouraging signs occupiers looking for quality office space of a staple size between 5,000 and 10,000 sq ft are hard pressed to find a variety of options, particularly at the value end of the rental spectrum.
The development pipeline, although increasing, remains limited which will only serve to accentuate this market dynamic.
Great Portland Estates is in good shape: our development pipeline is growing and is geared to deliver quality space, at good value, into an undersupplied West End market: our disposal and acquisition programmes are transforming the prospects of the Groups portfolio and producing healthy profits: our focused asset management continues to maintain a virtually fully let portfolio: our restructured balance sheet is helping to drive returns to shareholders, whilst preserving the financial flexibility we need to execute our development and acquisition programmes: and our teams are working well together to unearth further opportunities for value enhancement.
I look forward with confidence to building on the real progress we have made this year.
