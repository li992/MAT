Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2005 07 Ferrybridge and Fiddlers Ferry Power Stations In July 2004, SSE acquired the coal-fired power stations at Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire and at Fiddlers Ferry in Cheshire.
Together, the stations have an installed capacity of almost 4,000MW, enough to meet the needs of four million homes.
The stations allow SSE to manage further its exposure to changes in commodity prices for fuel by balancing its gas portfolio with a coal portfolio.
This, in turn, reinforces its ability to compete successfully for industrial and commercial customers.
In 2002, Ferrybridge became the first power station in the UK to co-fire fuel from renewable sources in order to displace fossil fuels and Fiddlers Ferry followed suit shortly thereafter.
The renewable resource is biomass, which is classed as carbon neutral as the donor crop absorbs sufficient carbon dioxide while growing to offset the carbon dioxide given off when it is burnt.
k Right Generation: Ferrybridge Power Station.
