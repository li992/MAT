In last years report I explained our The UK car insurance market intention to reduce our growth rate in cycle: Boil a frog slowly 2005.
We Did you know that if you want to boil wound up reducing our growth rate in a frog note: no frogs have been boiled premium from 27% in 2004 to 13% in in the making of these accounts or the 2005.
We did this because the best part writing of this commentary and you of the market cycle was behind us and throw the frog into boiling water it will it would not have been beneficial to jump right out?
But if you put the frog grow so rapidly into the poorest part of in a pot of cool water and turn up the the cycle.
We increased prices steadily heat, it will boil quite nicely?
The UK in the first half of the year to put the car insurance market is now akin to brakes on, finishing the half-year 3% that slowly boiling frog.

However, the were more like throwing the frog into market lagged well behind these the boiling pot.
The market would increases and our conversion rate scream and react.
The current cycle is ADMIRAL GROUP plc 11 characterised by a gentle deterioration: of claims inflation, albeit probably less a slow boil.

There isnt much to say about market rates in 2005 because they didnt Why did the market deteriorate a bit move very much!
