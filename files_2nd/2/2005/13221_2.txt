REVIEW EMEA made strong progress in the year with average occupancy increasing from 68% in 2004 to 73% in 2005.
The average number of available workstations has decreased by 6% to 25,871 2004: 27,431 driven by the closure of underperforming workstations in 2004.
We have strengthened our EMEA management team through recruiting specialised individuals and restructuring the regional organisation.
Regus gives me a unique opportunity to change the way our customers are working.
It is a great proposition and customers are realising the opportunities we can offer them to help grow their businesses ef ciently and without the risks.

REVIEW Asia is our smallest region but continues to grow rapidly with a 33% increase in revenue, driven by strong pricing and occupancy in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Average occupancy fell slightly from 76% to 75% driven by the impact of new centre openings with low starting occupancy.
REVPAW grew by 8% year-on-year to 6,137 and we have added a total of 15 new centres.
The average number of available workstations has increased by 23% to 5,475 2004: 4,435.
As a sales orientated person I feel immensely inspired by the Regus vision, the business model and the great concepts of changing the way people work.
The satisfaction comes from not just closing a deal or helping customers nd an of ce, but to tailor a Regus solution applicable to the global needs of different corporations.
