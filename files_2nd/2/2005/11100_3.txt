Chief Executives Review INTRODUCTION Sales up In the year to January 2005 Group turnover was 2,858m, 13.6% ahead of the previous year.
Sales in NEXT Retail were up 13.7% and 13.6% in NEXT Directory were up 12.9%.
Operating The net margins of the business moved forward mainly as a result of improved buying margins and good control over central overheads, profit up this resulted in operating profits increasing by more than sales at 17.5%.
Profits after interest were up 18.1%, a lower tax rate and share 17.5% buybacks further enhanced earnings per share to give growth of 26.2%.
Earnings Our financial objective is the delivery of long term sustainable growth in earnings per share.

We aim to achieve this in our operating businesses in the following ways: Improving and developing NEXT product ranges Profitably increasing NEXT selling space Increasing the number of customers shopping from home with the NEXT Directory Buying back shares for cancellation as and when it is in the interests of our shareholders generally Opportunity We explained last September that we felt that the retail environment would be more challenging for NEXT in 2005.
We are still very to grow cautious about the outlook for consumer spending: however we believe that NEXT will continue to grow both its sales and profits in sales and the year ahead even though achieving underlying like-for-like growth may be challenging.
profits THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT PRODUCT RANGES Improving style, quality and value NEXTs approach to improving value is simple: as long as we can maintain our profitability then we will pass on the benefits of improved buying to our customers.
Over the last year we have continued to make significant advances in sourcing and this, combined with a weaker dollar, has enabled us to pass on noticeable improvements in value to our customers without sacrificing gross margin.
Outlook for improving value in 2005 6 Quality & We will continue, where trading conditions permit, with our drive to deliver better value products to our customers.
Although price design more remains important we believe that improving quality and design will be more important to the consumer for the Autumn Winter season.
important THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT RETAIL Rationale for space expansion We have made excellent progress in the acquisition of profitable new space.
Most of this growth has come from retail parks on the edge of, or out of, town.
In these locations we have sufficient critical mass with Womenswear, Menswear, Childrenswear and Home to make a real difference to the popularity of the parks we go onto.
The acquisition of new space remains governed by strict financial criteria.
Every new store aims to pay back the net capital invested in less than 24 months and to achieve at least 15% store profit on sales before distribution and central costs.
When appraising new stores we account for downturn in neighbouring stores and do not factor in any future like-for-like growth.
The store must achieve the Sales from investment criteria based on its expected first year sales.
new space exceeding Performance of new space target New space opened during the year is exceeding its appraised sales target by 11% and is forecast to pay back the net capital invested in by 11% 15 months.
4 Chief Executives Review Profile of new space During the year we added a net 483,000 square feet to our trading space, increasing the total by 17% to 3,327,000 square feet.
The table below shows how our store portfolio has changed over the last three years.
Inevitably this includes all those stores that have been adversely affected by new openings.
Total like-for-like sales for the sales year were up 1.4% whilst those stores unaffected by new openings were up 3.6%.
up 3.6% When preparing our budgets or analysing the performance of our ranges we focus on the true like-for-like sales before deflection.
If we were to use total like-for-likes as a measure of success, it would discourage us from acquiring profitable new space.
Putting profit first NEXT is aware that some commentators use total like-for-like sales as the key measure of retail success.
Indeed some reports do not mention total sales growth or growth in earnings per share.
Nonetheless, it would not be logical to allow this potential for adverse publicity to inhibit our efforts to acquire profitable new space, which will continue.
New space in the year ahead Increase We currently expect to increase net selling space by at least 800,000 square feet in the year ahead, significantly more than was achieved net selling in each of the last two years.
space We believe that taking new space in a potentially difficult year is the right strategy, as long as the space we are taking is the right space.
A lease commitment is rarely for less than fifteen years, so the economic environment in any one particular year should not be the determining factor when considering a new store.
In this respect, it is an important feature of our appraisal process that we do not assume any like-for-like growth when considering a new site.
Trial store in Denmark Last year we opened a trial store in Copenhagen.
After one full year the forecast ongoing profitability of the store before central overheads is 5% and the payback on capital invested is 52 months.
Clearly neither the return on capital nor the profitability satisfies our appraisal criteria.
Whilst the store is not yet successful enough to warrant any roll out, it is sufficiently profitable to justify continuing our trial in Denmark.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT DIRECTORY 14.8% Growing the customer base growth in The growth in new customers has been the most significant contributor to the growth of sales in our home shopping division.
We start Directory the new year with 14.8% more customers than a year ago.
customers January 2005 January 2004 Growth Total active customers 1,905,000 1,660,000 14.8% 5 Chief Executives Review Expansion of pages and product offer Growth in pages has been more limited and we do not foresee the opportunity to significantly increase the Directory product offer in the coming year.

We currently takes 30% take more than 30% of our orders this way and envisage that its participation will grow in the future.
In the coming year we estimate of Directory sales over the Internet will be in the region of 200m.
However, the vast majority of Internet customers use the Directory to select orders garments then use the Internet to order and manage their accounts.
We believe we can further develop our website, in particular through the addition of much improved search facilities.
WAREHOUSE INVESTMENT During the year we extended and consolidated our warehousing for palletised stock to accommodate the growth in our home furnishings business.
This involved the successful commissioning of a 600,000 square foot warehouse with a capital spend of 10m.
Warehouse development 2005 6 Increased By the end of the year our boxed and palletised warehouses were working to their maximum capacity and this produced a significant capacity for strain on warehouse operations.
In August of this year we expect to further increase capacity in both boxed and palletised warehousing.
boxed and palletised We will open the highly mechanised extension to our boxed warehouse which is being fitted out at a cost of 40m.
We will also lease product a 500,000 square foot warehouse for palletised product with a fit out cost of circa 4m.
The opening of these facilities will result in a rise in our fixed costs of approximately 5m per annum, but are necessary to support continued growth.
Outlook for warehousing 2006 7 In 2006 we expect to open the extension to our bulk storage of hanging garments.
The capital expenditure for this project will be in the order of 10m, some of which will be spent in the year ahead.
Beyond 2006 7 By 2008 we anticipate we will need to spend a further 50m opening additional boxed and palletised warehouses.
The timing of this will depend very much on the growth of the business between now and then, as yet we have made no commitments in respect of this potential investment.
Average selling price and warehouse requirements The decreases we have achieved in average selling prices over the last few years have placed particular pressure on warehouse operations, as unit sales have grown faster than cash revenue.
In the Autumn Winter 2005 season we will be focusing more on improving quality than reducing prices, so we expect the rate of growth in units to be more in line with sales growth going forward.
6 Chief Executives Review NEXT SOURCING Next We have merged NEXT Asia and NEXT Near East into one overseas sourcing operation, and renamed it NEXT Sourcing Limited NSL.
In Sourcing Hong Kong, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Romania and other locations we now employ over 1,000 people engaged in the design, sourcing, buying, competes merchandising and quality control of NEXT products.
In Sri Lanka NSL owns and operates a garment sewing factory which employs a with third further 2,000 people.
parties NSL operates as a profit centre and must compete on an even footing with other factories and independent sourcing offices.
It charges commission on the product it sources, operating costs are deducted and the balance is reported as profit.
This year NSL profits amounted to 28.5m compared with 23.7m last year.
We are not budgeting for a significant change in NSL profits for the coming year, as any increase in turnover is likely to be offset by the cost of developing the new structure.
NEXT FRANCHISE Our overseas franchise operation had another successful year, with sales increasing by 16.4% and profit by 13.6% at 6m.
At the end of January 2005 there were 80 franchise stores compared with 70 the previous year.
The Middle East continues to be our largest region with 32 stores.
Our partner in Japan now has 24 stores.
VENTURA At the beginning of the last financial year we indicated that we expected Venturas profit to fall back significantly as a result of renegotiating its biggest contract to a much more competitive margin.
This affected the last six months of the financial year.
The detrimental effect of this re-negotiation was to some extent mitigated by better than expected growth in new business.
As a result Ventura achieved profits of 12.9m as against 15.4m last year.
Ventura currently subcontracts some work to a partner in India.
We believe that, in the long run, we cannot be reliant on third parties for what is an increasingly important resource for Ventura.
As a result we will be opening our own call centre in Pune, near to Mumbai.
Capital investment will be in the order of 8.5m.
It is anticipated that both NEXT Directory and Ventura will be operating out of this facility by the end of the current year.
Broad Ventura now has a broad client base and its services are priced competitively.
However, much of our revenue is dependent on the client underlying growth of our clients businesses.
Given our caution about the general economy we remain cautious for Venturas underlying base and prospects in the year ahead.
As a result of this, and approximately 2m of start up costs for the Indian call centre, we expect Venturas competitive profit for the coming year to be in the order of 10m.
pricing OTHER ACTIVITIES The Other Activities charge was 1.8m.
Other activities include our Property Management Division, Choice an associated company which operates a chain of fourteen discount stores, Cotton Traders an associated company selling its own brand products and Central Costs, the largest element of which is a pension charge.
The total cost of the Groups pension schemes increased to 18.6m from 17.6m last year, including a charge of 5m in respect of the past service deficit.
We estimate that the year end deficit was 44m, unchanged from last year.
During the year the Company made additional cash contributions of 7.5m and we expect these further contributions to continue for the foreseeable future.
SHARE OPTIONS Over 9,500 Over 9,500 of our employees currently hold options over almost 10 million shares in NEXT.
Our employee share ownership trust purchases employees shares in the market and issues them to employees when options are exercised.
It currently holds 9 million shares.
Our main employee have share share scheme, which was first approved by shareholders in 1995, is due for renewal and a resolution will be put to this years AGM.
options Due to a change in accounting standards we are required to recalculate the charge for share options.
This results in reducing the previous years charge of 5.1m down to 0.2m and a charge for the year just ended of 1.4m.
For the coming year, accounting standards are changing again and, whilst we can not yet be certain of the impact, we currently anticipate a charge in the region of 7m.
7 Chief Executives Review SHARE BUYBACKS Another During the year we purchased a further 4 million shares for cancellation at an average price of 1444p, for a cash cost of 57m.
This was 1.5% 1.5% of the shares in issue at the beginning of the year.
We intend to continue with our strategy of buying back shares as and when it purchased is in the interests of shareholders generally.
and cancelled Share buybacks are not made at the expense of capital investment in the business.
The primary use of capital will continue to be investment in the development of the core businesses and we aim to maintain the Companys investment grade credit rating.
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW At January 2005 net borrowings were 250m compared with 306m the previous year.
The cash inflow of 56m was after the 57m cost of shares purchased for cancellation.
Borrowings are financed through a 300m 5.25% 10 year bond, which was issued in June 2003, and medium term bank facilities.
The majority of our borrowings are at fixed interest rates and therefore, at current levels of debt, any rate changes in the medium term will not have a significant impact on our cost of borrowing.
Capital expenditure amounted to 144m, of which 97m was spent on stores and 36m on warehousing.
Stock levels at 302m were broadly in line with our requirements.
Debtors of 436m include the 311m account balances of our Directory customers.
DIVIDEND Dividend The Directors recommend a final dividend of 28p against 24p last year, bringing the total for the year to 41p compared with 35p last increase year, an increase of 17%.
The dividend is covered 2.9 times by earnings per share of 118.5p.
17% CURRENT TRADING Current trade For the seven weeks to 20 March, NEXT Retail sales are 8.2% ahead of the previous year.
Like-for-like sales in the 279 stores which have been trading for at least one year and have not been affected by the opening of new space are down 0.9%.
Like-for-like sales in the 333 stores including those which, as planned, have been impacted by the opening of new space are 3.5% below last year.
NEXT Directory sales for the seven weeks are 10.4% ahead of the previous year.
Taken together, sales for the NEXT Brand are 8.8% ahead.
Outlook Response Whilst there are parts of our ranges that we believe could be better, we think that the poor performance during the last seven weeks is to tougher indicative of an underlying easing of consumer demand.
As we indicated in September 2004, we anticipated a more challenging times consumer environment in the current year and do not foresee any significant economic improvement for at least six months.
We are clear about what our response to the challenge of a tougher environment will be: We will continue to focus on delivering well designed, good quality clothing and where possible pass on the benefit of better buying to the consumer.
However, increasing fixed costs will require a more conservative approach to selling price reductions.
We will continue to invest in profitable new space where our strict investment criteria are met.
We will place even greater emphasis on controlling costs in the business but will not sacrifice the long term prospects of the Company in return for short term cost savings.
Our next trading statement will be made on 18 May 2005, which is the date of our Annual General Meeting.
