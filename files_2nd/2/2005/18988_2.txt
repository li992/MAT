Chief Executives statement It is with great pleasure that I introduce Mapeley Limiteds annual report for 2005.
This is our first annual report as a public company and it covers an exceptional year for the business.
In June 2005, we listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, raising over 140 million.
At the time of the IPO we laid out a very simple strategy for Mapeley: to pay a stable and growing dividend to our shareholders.
We do this by creating attractive, sustainable returns through a strategy of investing in commercial real estate and maximising the return from our property portfolio.
We have delivered this strategy through retaining our focus on driving growth in our current portfolio and expanding our real estate outsourcing businesses while continuing our drive into the direct property investment market.
Above: Jameson Hopkins, CEO The money raised from the IPO has helped us to deliver on this strategy and I am delighted to report that, for 2005, we have paid and proposed dividends totalling 130 pence per share.
The dividends have provided investors with an annualised dividend yield of 5.5% based on a closing share price of 26.85 on 3 1 December 2005, significantly outperforming the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Indexs dividend yield of 2.4%.
Mapeley is a major investor in the property market Dividend per share paid and proposed per quarter and now owns and manages a diverse portfolio of real estate in the UK of over 1,650 properties with a value in excess of 1.6 billion.
During 2005, a year in which the market experienced extensive yield compression, our direct property investment business acquired 507.2 million of assets producing a weighted average yield of 7.2%.
The performance from our two major outsourcing contracts was in line with expectations and we continue to provide a range of property related services to our main clients, HM Revenue & Customs 30.0 pence 30.0 pence 33.0 pence 37.0 pence and Abbey National plc, and work closely with them Q1 2005 Q2 2005 Q3 2005 Q4 2005 regarding their accommodation requirements.

I believe Mapeley is well positioned to continue to improve returns from the existing portfolio.
This will be underpinned by the impact of two recently implemented key cost improvement initiatives and the exploitation of the remaining asset management opportunities in the estate.
Asset management performance is currently in line with expectations and the Group will see benefits 1,301,627 1,427,241 1,455,864 1,569,862 1,800,141 from this area beyond 2006.
