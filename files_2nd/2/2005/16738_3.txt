These decreases were partly offset network refurbishment carried out under the three year framework by increased revenues associated with the recovery of market contract awarded in June 2003 by Electricity Supply Board ESB.

The proposals envisage some form of payment to capacity of 400MW.
This is against the background of electricity reward generators for making capacity available.
