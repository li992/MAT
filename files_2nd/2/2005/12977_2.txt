Chief Executives review Introduction The reporting of the Groups financial results for 2005 is affected by a number of changes to the Groups structure and by the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards.
This is the first year that we have presented our accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
As a consequence we have separated the performance of Deluxe Film and Deluxe Media Services classied as operations held for sale within the income statement.
This has reduced our adjusted pre-tax profits and earnings per share in 2005.
The results for 2004 have been restated accordingly.
In addition we now report Blue Squares revenue as gross win where previously we had reported settled stakes.
This has reduced Group revenues in 2004 and in 2005 but has no effect on reported profit.
Mike Smith Chief Executive Results Continuing operations The Groups 2005 adjusted operating profit was down 13.6% to 85.4m 2004 98.8m.
Group operating profit before exceptional items was down 6.3% to 127.5m 2004 136.1m.
Hard Rock generated the strongest performance with increased revenues and operating profit rising 24.7% to 34.8m 2004 27.9m.
This was driven by increased contributions from Hard Rocks hotel and gaming interests as well as the continued resurgence of our owned cafes.
Despite slightly higher revenue, operating profit within our Gaming division was 9.6% lower at 105.8m 2004 117.0m.
Revenue in Mecca Bingo was broadly at, with higher spend per head but lower admissions.
In Grosvenor Casinos we experienced healthy rises in admissions but Revenue m handle-per-head fell.

In April 2005, the 2005 Gambling Act was enacted in Parliament.
The first changes to gaming regulations allowed under the new Act took Pension fund effect from October 2005.
Following our agreement to sell Deluxe Film we entered into discussions with our Group pension plan trustee in relation to the funding The abolition of the 24-hour membership rule means that new requirements of the Groups defined benefit plan which has been members may enter and play in a casino or bingo club upon closed to new entrants since 2000. production of suitable identication, without the need to register 24 hours in advance.

With This agreement is subject to formal clearance from the Pensions new members tending initially to stake lower amounts we saw also the Regulator, who has confirmed agreement in principle to this proposal.
We believe that by taking action to address our pension liability we are Under the 2005 Gambling Act, further reforms of UK gaming will take effect safeguarding the long term interests of our pensioners, our employees from 2007: in bingo, the regulations governing the use of roll-over prizes are and our shareholders.

new casinos in Aberdeen and in Dundee.
The Rank Group Plc 4 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 We are taking measures to manage the introduction of the smoking ban in our Scottish bingo clubs and will monitor their effectiveness as we prepare for a UK-wide smoking ban from the summer of 2007.
Due to the comprehensive nature of the legislation in Scotland we believe that our bingo clubs are not competitively disadvantaged by the smoking ban.
In the short term it is likely to impact trading as our members and our employees adapt to the changes.
Changes to VAT and Gaming Duty In December 2005 the VAT-exempt status of Section 21 gaming machines was withdrawn.
For reasons of timing this had a minimal impact on results in 2005 but we believe that it could depress 2006 profits by as much as 5m.
The Government has stated that it will seek to align the level of Amusement Machine Licence Duty across all categories of gaming machine.
We await news on how and when this will be implemented, but recognise that it could impact on the profitability of our gaming machines.
Current trading and outlook Since the start of 2006, revenue in Mecca is up slightly, with higher spend per head compensating for a 2% drop in admissions.
Casino admissions are up 16% year-on-year but spend per head is lower.
In Blue Square, total stakes continue to grow and win margins are stronger than over the same period in 2005.
In Hard Rock, like-for-like sales in company-owned cafes are up by more than 10% over the same period last year, although this is due in part to the performance of our relocated cafe in New York City, which was opened in the summer of 2005.
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the trend towards higher admissions in our casinos and the opportunity to grow handle-perhead from new members.
And in both Mecca Bingo and in Grosvenor Casinos revenue from gaming machines will continue to be a key driver of growth.
The advent of a smoking ban in Scotland, prospective changes to duty rates and increasing cost pressures pose challenges in both of these businesses.
We expect Blue Squares sports betting and on-line gaming to benefit from a busy sporting calendar, which includes the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.
In Hard Rock we expect to achieve improved results across all of our activities, but with no significant uplift from new hotels and casinos, growth is likely to be slower than in 2005.
