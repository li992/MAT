TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Chief executives review For the year ended 31 December 2005 Introduction Although 2005 has been more challenging than recent years, our businesses have performed well in relative terms against sector peers and significant progress has been made in the strategic development of the group.
We faced two key challenges in 2005: integrating the Wickes acquisition, which enabled the group to enter a substantial new market for building materials, and coping with the first decline in trade market volumes experienced since 1990.
The integration programme for Wickes has gone well, with all key integration milestones and combined targets for synergy and buying gains exceeded.
Previously, with strong and rising demand for building materials, the group had been able to increase trading and operating margins whilst growing its like-for-like turnover below market rates.
Early in 2005 we decided to adapt our trading stance to a market with weaker demand.
Performance In 2005 we focussed our efforts on tight management of cash and costs, achievement of synergy and buying gains and more active management of profitable sales at each of our merchanting and retailing branches.
In merchanting, we selectively made a margin investment in some branches and brought our like-for-like sales growth up to market levels by the end of the third quarter.
This market relative performance has been sustained, our gross margin is stable, and we are making a net positive profit contribution from this investment.
Despite lower like-for-like sales volumes, action on costs has meant that productivity increased over the level achieved in 2004.
At Wickes, through sharp cost reductions and active management of gross margins, we have improved operating margin to become the highest in the sector.
Price competition increased in the fourth quarter in the DIY market, and our market share gains made in the first nine months were reversed.
We have, however, held on to our gains in gross margin and yet have maintained our pricing advantage against our DIY competitors.
This performance reflects the resilience of Wickes low assortment model and the loyalty it engenders amongst its core customers.
The acquisition of Wickes and our continued successful programme of expansion in our merchanting network has meant our revenue base is now about 50 per cent larger than in 2004.
This expansionary growth, a feature of the groups progress over many years, adds further scale benefits through improved buying terms and operational gearing of overheads.
This increased scale meant we set an ambitious target, comprising synergies and stretched buying gains, for lowering our costs of goods sold and overhead costs.
We exceeded our overall target despite lower than anticipated purchase volumes from weaker like-for-like sales trends.
Our focus on cash generation meant we were able to continue to fund our expansion programme and reduce the proforma debt level in the year by over 70 million see note 33.
6 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Overall, weaker market conditions meant that like-for-like sales and profit performance were below our expectations.
Management actions helped offset much of the shortfall in profit contribution, and the groups profits before tax ended up just ahead of the prior year.
Markets The long term market trends for both trade and retail continue to be strong: the UK needs more new dwellings than it is building: much of the existing housing stock needs upgrading and public sector infrastructure also requires significant investment.
These trends give us confidence that we can continue to expand our networks in the UK to meet rising demand.
However, conversion of these long term trends into current spending depends on a number of cyclical factors, particularly conditions in the housing market and general consumer confidence.
Both consumer confidence and consumer spending were weak throughout 2005 reflecting pressure on consumers disposable incomes as non-discretionary spending increased and lower mortgage equity withdrawal as house price inflation weakened.
In addition, the housing market experienced lower transaction levels and weaker inflation than in 2004.
These trends initially adversely affected retail sales in 2005 and then trade sales from spring onwards, particularly on improvement projects.
Turnover related to repair and maintenance activities remained stable.
Overall we experienced stronger performance in those divisions with a higher penetration of Market share Share of the DIY & builders merchants market based on company estimates - total market size of 28.7bn commercial, industrial and government work, and the weakest in those most closely allied to the consumer.

Travis Perkins Competitor 1 Competitor 2 Competitor 3 Competitor 4 Overall the group has a good spread of business by product, customer type and geographic region.
7 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC All our businesses enjoy distinct and strong competitive positioning in their respective markets.
Our trade businesses offer superior service levels, product quality and availability with flexibility in commercial terms to match customers requirements.
Our retail business, Wickes, operates a low assortment model, where its concentrated stock range drives low operating costs and strong gross margins from a high penetration of own label product.
This enables us to offer the best value for money to DIY consumers.

Our strategy to achieve this aim is designed to generate superior shareholder returns through the execution of three key programmes: 1.
CONTINUE TO DRIVE SCALE BENEFITS Acquisition growth There is significant scope to add bolt-on acquisitions in the merchant industry where around one third of the market is owned by around 3,200 independent merchants.
The group has maintained a comprehensive database of operators both in the general builders merchant market and in other specialist merchanting sectors that also distribute products for the built environment.
Acquisitions have provided an excellent platform for growth for the group over the past decade and we have a good pipeline of businesses under negotiation.
We maintained our disciplined stance to acquisition prices based on stringent return on capital criteria.
Brown field expansion In catchments where no attractive acquisition targets are available, we have been successful in recent years in acquiring brown field sites and opening new stores.
We continue to seek suitable properties to fill gaps in our national coverage of our merchant and retail brands and with a current pipeline potential of around 100 branches, we are confident of continuing growth through this strategy in the future.
Adaptable trading in merchanting Our approach is to seek to maximise profits by adapting our trading stance in terms of range and price to the conditions we experience in each of our catchments.
This approach is operated within an environment of financial controls and incentives that ensures standards are maintained and return on capital employed is maximised.
We continually monitor the success of the trading stance adopted at each merchant branch, and seek to refine our approach further to improve performance.
Refresh our service offer and gain market share We aim to stretch our lead on service criteria in merchanting where external survey data has shown our relative positioning to be above average.
There is always room to improve and we have an established set of performance indicators in place at all outlets of both the merchant and retail operations.
8 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Review our category presence in each outlet We intend to extend the application of best practice category management techniques across all brands.
Improved merchandising techniques and use of space will enable us to deepen and extend some of the ranges available in Wickes whilst maintaining a low cost, low assortment approach.
Develop or acquire specialist channels in selected categories We currently serve markets worth 28 billion.
In addition there are building material markets totalling around 8 billion where the group has a limited presence.
We are examining the scope for entering one or more of these markets on a selective basis in the latter part of 2006.
SEEK FURTHER GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION We have further scope to improve our synergies and buying gains.
The 2006 synergy programme has already made good progress in the area of timber milling.
Our major projects in 2006 include range harmonisation, in particular kitchens and bathrooms in both trade and retail.
We have now established a global sourcing capability.
We have refreshed our Quality Assurance capability with a permanent presence in China and expanded our central warehousing capacity.
DRIVE FURTHER PRODUCTIVITY AND RETURNS ON CAPITAL With a network of almost one thousand outlets we have many opportunities to continue to reduce operating costs by reviewing our targets and performance using benchmarking techniques.
Labour productivity has improved during 2005 in part driven by these analyses.
We are confident that applying these techniques will facilitate cost reduction and productivity in labour, distribution, sales, marketing and information management.
Overall productivity in merchanting has increased by 2.1 per cent.
Like-for-like headcount in merchanting and retail are 4.6 per cent and 10.6 per cent lower respectively in 2005 compared to 2004.
Merchanting productivity per employee 000 200 196k 192k 182k 171k 150 160k 100 50 0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 9 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC The business continues to be focused on return on capital with variable pay for all management teams from branch to plc board having a significant return on capital element.
This culture is important in driving the working capital improvements that we have seen in 2005 with improvements in both stock turn and debtor collection.
We continue to maximise the efficeincy of our property portfolio, pursuing relocation opportunities and surplus property sales which maximise value.
Development of the group Following the gross Growing and improving the network addition of a record 241 branches of which 171 is represented by 31 Dec Acquisition Brown field Consolidation 31 Dec Net 2006 7 March 31 Dec Acquisition Brown field Consolidation 31 Dec Net 2006 7 March 2004 2004 2005 2005 movement movement 2006 2006 the Wickes acquisition at 31 December 2005 we traded from to date to date 5 brands across 983 locations.
In 2005 we continued the expansion of the 4 brand Wickes - - 171 171 5 5 - - 176 176 - - 176 176 networks in our merchanting division.
Total branches 751 190 51 9 983 7 990 751 190 51 9 983 7 990 The acquisition of Wickes represented a major strategic move for the group, opening a further channel for the distribution of building materials.
This market is worth some 16 billion, involving groups of customers not previously well served by the group.
Subsequent to the acquisition we have, as expected, found Wickes to be an excellent business, with a robust and attractive business model, an experienced and capable management team and significant potential to expand.
In the more difficult than expected trading conditions experienced in 2005, Wickes profits have held up more strongly than all other DIY chain operators.
This underlines the resilience of the business and its attractive position in the market.
In acquiring Wickes, we estimated that the DIY Market would turn down, but not by as much as the eventual out turn.
With the prospect of further synergies, attractive operational gearing and expansion potential, and prospects for a return of normal market growth we are confident of generating attractive returns from this investment.
Environment The group recognises its corporate responsibility to carry out its operations whilst minimising environmental impacts.
We continue to maintain accreditation of our Environmental Management System to the ISO 14001 standard.
No significant changes were made to our environmental policy during 2005: we aim to comply with applicable environmental legislation: prevent pollution and minimise the extent of environmental damage and continuously improve our environmental performance.
Environmental improvement plan We have continued the implementation of our Environmental Improvement Plan.
Where our targets and performance data are based on a measure of output per of relevant sales, the sales figure is inflation adjusted to relate our progress to the volume of business transacted.
The charts presented show data from a combination of specific measurements and some estimates for the group excluding Wickes, though Wickes figures for the full year of 2005 are described in the text for information.
Wickes data will be integrated into the total group figures in future years.

We now estimate that about ninety five per cent of our 10 total electricity demand is satisfied from these carbon free 0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2008Target sources this has been the main reason for our reduction in CO 2 emissions.
For Wickes we estimate the emissions to have VOC emissions Tonnes amounted to a further 40,800 tonnes for the full year of 2005, T giving a total annual emission level of 104,600 tonnes.
Our new 300 target is to achieve a reduction of five per cent in CO emissions 2 277 T 250 per of sales for the group by the end of 2008.
200 Volatile organic compound VOC emissions Over 150 the past four years we have achieved a major reduction in 100 57 % emissions of VOCs through a programme of replacement of organic solvent-based treatment fluids with aqueous based 50 81 % 94 % 97 % solutions.
We have reduced this in absolute terms to less than 10 0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 tonnes in 2005, a reduction of 97 per cent compared to 2001.

By the end of 2005 20 estimated certification levels had increased to 70 per cent, with 36 per cent from FSC sources and with the balance mainly from 0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2008Target PEFC sources with a small volume from sources certified to a variety of other national standards in use elsewhere.
We continue to challenge all suppliers who are not currently providing certified material to work towards certification and as a minimum we ask all suppliers to certify that timber supplied has been handled in accordance with all relevant legislation.
Wickes have implemented a similar plan in recent years and increased the certified percentage from 71 per cent in 2004 to 87 per cent in 2005 of which 55 per cent is from FSC sources.
Given our good progress over recent years we have revised our target for the overall group from 75 per cent by the end of 2006 to 85 per cent by the end of 2008.

In total we estimate our waste sent to landfill in 33 30 2005 was just over 57,000 tonnes of which 23,000 tonnes was T m 9 % in Wickes.
Our target is to achieve a five per cent reduction in the 24 % 26 % 28 % 20 31 % group tonnage per of sales by the end of 2008.
Fuel consumption and vehicle emissions As we 10 reported last year, a number of filters fitted to our transport fleet 0 in the first year of our programme failed during 2004 and 2005.
2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2008Target 241 vehicles, or 12 per cent of our total fleet 2004: 17 per cent now have the phase two filter systems fitted these continue to operate satisfactorily.
During 2006 we expect to see the first Euro IV compliant vehicles supplied by the manufacturers with these filtration systems fitted as standard.
In the meantime we have sent vehicles with filters fitted to the most sensitive locations, in particular within central London.
Complaints and notifiable events We investigate any complaint received and endeavour to rectify the causes promptly.
During 2005 only two complaints were received in our merchanting businesses relating to environmental matters 2004: 10.
Both related to noise from forklift bleepers and both were resolved through the fitting of less obtrusive white noise warning devices.
Within Wickes there were eight incidents, four relating to waste issues, two to noise pollution, one to housekeeping and the final one relating to the inappropriate discharge of sewage to a controlled body of water.
All incidents were promptly rectified.
Our emergency procedures are designed to ensure that even relatively minor events are reported to the Environment Agency.
There were two events within the merchant businesses that required us to contact the Agency during 2005, both relating to minor spillages of hydraulic fluid that were dealt with immediately on site.
There were also two reportable incidents arising from Wickes operations relating to minor spillages from ruptured vehicle fuel tanks.
No further action is expected from the relevant authorities.
Our target remains to have zero complaints or notifiable events.
We are pleased to report that we had no prosecutions for environmental matters during 2005.
Community relations With 990 branches in a wide variety of locations throughout Great Britain, we recognise our role in, and responsibilities towards, the community.
Our branches are encouraged to support their local community through involvement in local affairs, such as sponsoring organisations or donating materials.
In our merchanting business we raised more than 350,000 for charities during the year.
At a national level, we support three particular charities, the NSPCC, Children First Scotland and MacMillan Cancer Relief.
The Charity Committee is chaired by the company chairman.
During the course of the Travis Perkins Group Chief Executive Geoff Cooper presents cheques totalling more than 281,000 to representatives of the NSPCC, Children 1st year our staff take part in a variety of activities to support our Scotland and Macmillan Cancer Relief.
These activities encourage donations from 12 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC customers and suppliers as well as our own workforce.
Included above are direct donations made by the group to these and other charities which, in the year amounted to 53,794 2004: 124,534.
In addition, we operate a payroll giving scheme through which staff donated 16,713 2004: 18,147 to charity during the year.
Our retail business supports a variety of organisations through a Charities Aid Foundation account and our colleagues are also able to make a donation to their chosen charities through a corporate Gift Aid scheme.
Travis Perkins has been the main sponsor of Northampton Saints rugby club for the last five years.
People and organisation Following the acquisition of Wickes, we have implemented a series of changes to our management arrangements and strengthened our management capabilities.
A new executive committee of the board has been constituted, comprising the executive directors together with selected managing directors from the groups eight businesses and central functions.
The executive committee formalises pre-exisiting arrangements and facilitates more effective management of the wider span of activities now represented in the group.
In addition, the Wickes board members have joined the pre-existing group trading board.
We have strengthened our property management through the appointment of Martin Meech as Group Property Director, who joined us in September from a FTSE 100 retailer.
This will help us in an important aspect of our plans for the further development of the group through network expansion.
We replaced the head of our plumbing and heating business, with John Frost, the Managing Director responsible for building our highly successful Travis Perkins business in the South West.
Norman Bell, an external appointee with experience in both the trade and retail sectors, including a brief period at Wickes, has taken over responsibility for the South West.
The group has been able to deal with the challenges it has faced in 2005 through the dedication and hard work of its people.
I visit our branches, stores, distribution centres, mills and other locations through the year via a regular cycle of visits.
I am constantly struck by the commitment, skill and enthusiasm displayed by colleagues throughout our business and I would like to thank all of them for their dedication in what has been a significant year in the groups development.
