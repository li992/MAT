Chief Executive Officers review of operations Our industry is one which changes constantly, but in the past year the shift has been particularly noticeable Technology is now influencing lifestyle rather than simply reflecting Our strategic priorities it: the Blackberry device, for example, has fundamentally changed It is our ambition for all digital products to be powered by ARM the work-life balance for large numbers of professionals worldwide: technology and we are well on the way to becoming the architecture the merging of mainstream media with our everyday lives is made for the digital world.
In the future, digital products will contain possible by easy access to the internet, any time and anywhere, and increasing amounts of our technology, including processor and physical in turn makes that access critical.
We expect our household appliances IP, other systems IP and embedded software.
In addition, we will to have an increasing number of features, our cars to be safe and continue to provide the software development tools that enable reliable, our cameras to react automatically to prevailing light designers to build innovative ARM Powered products: in 2005 our conditions, and our mobile telephones to incorporate myriad Partners shipped 1.7 billion of these, up 31% on 2004, and in May features.
A silent revolution in the way ordinary people interact 2005, we announced that we expect total shipments to increase to with technology is underway.
This is a revolution which ARM has foreseen and, indeed, has We use the analogy of a human body to describe how ARM technology pioneered.
In recent years we have transformed our business, brings digital products to life: our processor IP is the brain controlling organically and by acquisition, from one which was primarily focused and driving the system: our data engine IP forms the specialist organs, on the development of microprocessor intellectual property IP, to one such as the lungs: fabric IP makes up the nervous system which which is now capable of delivering a total solution from beginning enables the brain to communicate with the other parts of the body: to end of the design process to our customers.
Our 2004 acquisitions and our physical IP the libraries and memories are the cells from of California-based companies Artisan Components, which designs which the entire body is made.
Our tools are the parents and teachers physical IP, and Axys, which provides electronic system-level ESL which shape the body and develop its thoughts: and our software IP design tools, were augmented in October this year by the acquisition are the thoughts that go through the brain and provide the intelligence of Keil.

At the beginning of the year we set ourselves an objective: to take ARM into the next phase of its growth.
Looking back, we have done just that.
We have positioned our enlarged group to capitalise on 6 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 the huge potential benefits which accrue from the combination of ARM willingness to outsource the development of physical IP when it makes and Artisan: we have delivered a number of new products which economic sense to do so, and when we have the right products.
As the underpin the proliferation of our IP: and we have delivered meaningful cost and complexity of developing physical IP increases, we anticipate earnings growth for our shareholders.
that an increasing number of our Partners will realise the commercial and technical wisdom of outsourcing it from us.
Building on the combination of ARM and Artisan We completed the acquisition of Artisan Components in December During the year, we also developed our first optimised products 2004.
One year on, we have successfully integrated Artisan, now our through the combination of physical IP and processor IP.

In October, at the second sales team is a combination of the former ARM and Artisan sales annual ARM Developers Conference in California, we introduced teams: based on an account management structure, it uses technical the Cortex-A8 processor: at the same time, we introduced the specialists from across the group.
Advantage CE libraries which increase the processors performance and efficiency.
Our Partners will be able to license optimised physical During the year, we began to see good progress in effecting the IP to maximise the Cortex-A8 processors performance while, at the strategic plan for the acquisition.
This was, first, to outsource physical same time, minimising size and power consumption.

During the year, we increased licence revenues in the account for the other 90%, but represent ARMs traditional customer Processor Division PD by 19% building on 27% growth in 2004 and base.
We made progress on this and exceeded our expectations by signed 71 new licences, including 12 for ARM11 family products which completing seven deals encouraging early indications of our Partners are now increasingly being licensed for use outside the mobile sector.

The Cortex-A8 processor is the industrys fastest embedded processor and our first complete We also made significant advances in technology in PIPD with the processing solution to comprise a wide range of ARM technology to acceleration of the development of leading-edge products.
Its performance and power consumption ensure that we have the ability to support large IDMs and fabless characteristics make it ideal for consumer products which run multicompanies which, as a result of rapid increases in the cost and channel video, audio and gaming applications.
We expect it to complexity of physical IP arising from the continuing advances in silicon revolutionise consumer and low-power mobile devices, and to enable process technology, are increasingly looking to us to provide third-party even more innovative product features to be delivered to end users to physical IP.
To this end we have successfully developed 90nm and, provide higher levels of functionality and entertainment.
The Cortex-A8 more recently, 65nm physical IP products, enabling us to sell leadingprocessors attributes were recognised by the winning of four highedge physical IP to a number of major foundries, including Chartered profile industry awards: Electronic Products magazines Product of the Semiconductor and IBM.

In When we updated our estimate of future shipments of ARM Powered October, we announced that there were already five lead licensees for products, we also rationalised our application-oriented approach to the product, including Freescale, Matsushita, Samsung and Texas target markets in line with the changing nature of the electronic Instruments.
We expect the Cortex-A8 processor to be available for industry: we now focus on solutions for the mobile, home, enterprise, general licensing by mid-2006.

We continued the development of our other products in the Cortex By the final quarter of the year, our Partners had shipped a record family, including the Cortex-M3 processor, which was available for 499 million units the equivalent of approximately 5.5 million each general release by early 2006.
We licensed it to four lead licensees in day.
The mobile market continued to grow strongly: we shipped more 8 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 than 1 billion units into mobile for the first time and also increased Looking ahead penetration by attaining an average of 1.4 ARM processors per Our extensive portfolio of technology for licensing, increasing handset.
The first shipments of ARM11 family-based phones were momentum in royalties, the growth in sales of development systems, made in Japan from the FOMA N902i: with multiple versions now and the prospect of more revenues arising from the combination of shipping.
We expect this strong growth in mobile up 23% from 2004, processor IP and physical IP, gives us confidence for another strong to continue in 2006, driven by shipments of ultra-low-cost handsets performance in 2006.
We enter the year in an excellent position to ULCH in emerging markets and by the increased popularity of smarter continue to build on our market leadership.
We also achieved significant growth 46% over 2004 in non-mobile markets: our Partners shipped 600 million units in 2005 approximately the same number as was achieved for mobile Warren East Chief Executive Officer shipments in 2003.
This was over a broad base of applications, particularly hard disk drives, games consoles, smartcards, printers, DVD players, flash memory products, digital still cameras, Wi-Fi chipsets and automotive products.
We continued to make strategic investments to speed our growth in non-mobile areas.
The microcontroller sector promises particular potential and we expect this to reach approximately 1 billion units by 2010.
Our acquisition of Keil maximises the opportunity for success in the microcontroller market: we are aiming to provide an easy transition for developers from their older 8- and 16-bit technologies to new ARM 32-bit microcontrollers.
We believe we can accelerate this by providing a consistent development system platform for building applications.
We introduced our first combined development product, the RealView Microcontroller Development Kit, in January 2006.
