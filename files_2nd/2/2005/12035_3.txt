This is especially so, because as commented upon widely, 2005 was a most challenging year for the industry.
During the year the market was characterised by uncertainty and a general lack of confidence amongst potential purchasers due to concerns over house price stability.
At Persimmon, we were able to respond to these more demanding conditions in a number of ways.
We started 2005 with a good forward order book despite a relatively quiet autumn period in 2004.
We had ensured that we had increased outlets for marketing during the early months of 2005 and continued to focus on forward selling ahead of construction on all our sites during this important sales period.
We also ensured that, through our local teams, we remained flexible with the type, specification and price range of homes we were offering to the market.
Through this process we SOUTH experienced a greater demand in some areas for lower priced properties in preference to some of our mid price range homes, The South division performed well once again increasing the which in some regions, resulted in an increase in volumes at a number of completions to 6,388 from 6,187 in 2004.

The Groups average selling price 2004: 2,183 at a reduced average selling price of 178,988 increase of 5% reflects these changes of mix as well as some 2004: 183,768.
This was achieved by ensuring that the real price growth.
