Initially Informa World will contain academic on-line information only, but this will be expanded to include more of the Groups content during 2006 and beyond.
We had a successful year for new journal titles and have acquired or are launching an additional 64 titles for 2006 and a further 12 titles are already in hand for 2007.
Technological developments in automated manuscript processing and print-on-demand are helping us to drive efficiencies in the books production process and reduce levels of physical inventory.
We now have nearly 6,000 titles available in print-on-demand format, out of a total catalogue of more than 40,000 titles.
