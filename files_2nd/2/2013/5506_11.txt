We also added 74.9 million barrels of oil to REPORT 2P reserves: this was achieved through the sanction of the Kraken development, the extension of the planned Alma Galia field life, selective asset acquisitions, such as our stake in the producing Alba field, and from upward revisions to our existing fields.

In 2012, EnQuest entered Malaysia with an initial investment of only US$3 million, to acquire Nio Petroleum Sabah Limited and thereby a 42.5% interest in Blocks SB307 and SB308, offshore Sabah, Malaysia.
In 2014, a well is being matured for drilling offshore Sabah, Malaysia.

This gives EnQuest increased production and additional net 2P reserves of 4.7 MMboe, as at the economic date of 1 January 2013.
We see significant potential to improve production both through infill drilling and through exploring further prospects in the area.
With Scolty, Crathes and Avalon all nearby and the possibility of a tie-back to Kittiwake, this acquisition creates the potential for a substantial new EnQuest hub and for an extension to the field life of GKA.
