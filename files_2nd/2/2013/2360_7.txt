The two transactions involve approximately 500 homes, of which circa 250 would legally complete in 2014 with the remainder in 2015.
The profit delivery combined with the acceleration of capital turn enabled by these transactions would act as a further positive contributor to increasing the Groups return on capital employed in both 2014 and 2015.

The sales achieved in 2014 to date combined with the expected growth in active sales outlets should enable the Group to deliver a strong increase in total reservations during 2014, assuming current market conditions continue.
From these reservations excluding any potential volume arising from the PRS transactions 250 homes in 2014, the Group aims to deliver between 3,400 and 3,600 legal completions in 2014 and a stronger forward order book for 2015.
