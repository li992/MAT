These assessments which include product development processes, operational performance and operating systems, have been benchmarked against both best-in-class world standards and best current IMI practice.
Findings based on this sample benchmarking exercise indicate that there are significant opportunities to improve the Groups operational performance which will result in improved efficiencies and better working capital utilisation: collaboration: until this year, throughout its history IMI has operated as a diverse engineering group with significant autonomy provided to each of the underlying businesses.
Given this structure there has been limited incentive or requirement for inter-divisional collaboration.
Our more focused portfolio now provides an opportunity to improve how our businesses work together.

The competitive dynamics of the industries we serve demand a continued focus on the value and benefits we bring to these customers including responsiveness to market demand and geographical alignment in terms of manufacturing.
Looking forward Mark Selway visiting a Severe Service facility in China.
Building on the Groups inherent strengths, the positive early findings emerging from the review indicate that the Group is well placed to exploit a range of growth opportunities over the medium term.
The review is planned to be completed around the time of the Groups 2014 interim results at which time we expect to share the key findings and provide an update on the Groups future direction.
I would like to close by thanking all those who have helped and supported me since I joined IMI.
I look forward to leading a great team as we work together to ensure that the Company achieves its full potential to the benefit of all IMIs stakeholders.
