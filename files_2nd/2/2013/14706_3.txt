the group has grown consistently, and the resilience and flexibility of our business model continues to allow us to offer an unparalleled product range at the best available prices.
we will continue to be the consumers champion.
56 new sports retail stores opened during the year in the uk and europe, with the group continuing to put the consumer at the forefront of our business by offering the best combination of product range and value for money.

our premium lifestyle division has continued to expand, having acquired 114 republic stores from the administrator in february 2013. the division offers its customers an enhanced shopping experience, following the previous acquisition of companies including usc, flannels, cruise and van mildert.
