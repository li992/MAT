CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OUR BUSINESSES 07 MICHAEL FOSTER Chief Executive The Board considers that the best measure of the extent Review of 2008 to which Charter is generating shareholder value is adjusted 2008 was a year of contrasts.
The first three quarters were earnings per share, which excludes exceptional and other marked by high levels of activity, escalating commodity prices items considered by the Board to be not directly related to and the need for both ESAB and Howden to manage potential the underlying performance of the Group.

Howden acquired Aeolus Industria worth some 390 million for delivery in 2009, and a further e Comercio Ltda, a Brazilian industrial fans manufacturer.
Howdens order book During the year, Charter renewed its financing facilities and continued to grow in January, and the size of the order presently has committed facilities of 145 million with maturity book also benefitted from exchange rate movements.
In addition to fulfilling these orders, a principal objective for 2009 outlook Howden in 2009 is to maintain a strong order book throughout As we progress through the early part of 2009, there is no clear the year.
Overall, we continue to see opportunities in each visibility yet of how general market conditions will develop.
of Howdens principal markets around the world and the level of enquiries remains encouraging, although we expect that the ESAB rate of order intake will be slower in the first half of 2009 than ESAB has started the year with volumes of consumables generally it was in 2008 due to the current financial environment and in line with expectations.
We expect continuing instability as economic downturn.

power demand is likely to lead to lower new build activity.
We believe that the measures that we implemented in the fourth Demand for Howdens compressors from customers in the quarter of 2008 and are in progress in the first quarter of 2009 oil and gas and petrochemical sectors is holding up well are appropriate to meet the lower levels of activity which we at present: this part of Howdens business is becoming are likely to see in 2009 but we will continually monitor market more significant as time goes on.

CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OUR BUSINESSES 09 Management remains vigilant to any softening of demand.
Howden has worked extensively to ensure that its growth in recent years has been built on flexible supply chains and relatively low levels of fixed cost.
With the visibility of a strong order book, Howden will be able to respond pro-actively to any slowdown in order intake.
Concluding comments Since October 2008 there has been a marked deterioration in global economic and financial conditions which had led to reduced demand for ESAB welding consumables and equipment.
Notwithstanding this slowdown, as we progress through 2009, we can take confidence from the global presence, market leadership positions, strong technology and flexible cost bases of both ESAB and Howden, which are supported by Charters strengthened balance sheet and positive long-term dynamics in the businesses key end-user segments.
All of these we believe will assist Charter to resume growth as and when economic and financial conditions improve.
