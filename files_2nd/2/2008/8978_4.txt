The first quarter of 2008 saw severe winter conditions and metal production throughout the first half was lower than 2007, but a combination of focused management and improved equipment availability meant that the targets were recovered during the second half of the year.
Ore extraction in 2008 increased by 5% to 35,675 kt.
The rise in ore output is reected in the higher copper in concentrate production, which increased 7% to 371 kt.
Copper cathode equivalent production, from own material, was 343 kt, ahead of 2007 and previous guidance.
Cathode production of 340 kt was in line with 2007 but an additional 3.5 kt of copper in concentrate cathode equivalent of 3.3 kt was sold without being converted to metal.
These trial sales of copper concentrate were started in 2008.
The concentrate market offers considerable potential, particularly in China, where there is spare smelting capacity.
We need to develop our understanding of this market, especially as our new growth projects move forward.
The 17% increase in generated electricity at Ekibastuz GRES-1, during 2008, was driven by growing demand from the market within Kazakhstan during the first half of the year.
However, major industrial customers reduced electricity consumption at the end of 2008, as they lowered production in response to lower metal prices.
This reduction resulted in a decrease in demand and output during the latter part of 2008 and demand in 2009 is likely to be below the level of 2008. www.

Cathode output from own material in 2009 is likely to reduce by around 10% to 15%, due to several actions that we are taking, Financial summary for 2008 following a general review of operations.

Labour costs were also rising during the first half of 2008, Coupled with a reduction in by-product revenues, these factors led to an average unit cash cost during the year of 116 US cents with Kazakh ination running at an annual rate of around 19% per lb, compared to 33 US cents per lb in 2007.
