The Company reached some important milestones across the business: shipments of ARM technology-based chips rose to four billion in the year 2007: 2.9 billion, ARMs growth was ahead of both the FTSE 250 and the semiconductor industry and six of the top 20 semiconductor companies licensed ARM physical IP products.

The semiconductor requires a large amount of R&D company will design and manufacturer a chip utilising the ARM investment and expertise.
The chip will then be incorporated into a digital electronic semiconductor company would need product, which is sold to the consumer.
ARM receives a royalty, typically to spend between $50 million and based on a percentage of the chip price, for every chip sold by the $150 million every year to reproduce semiconductor company containing ARM technology.
This represents an additional $20 billion of annual cost It takes an average of 3-4 years from the time the semiconductor company for the industry.
