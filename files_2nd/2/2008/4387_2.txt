Chairman and Chief Executives statement Dear Shareholder It is extremely pleasing to report that excellent progress has been made across all key areas of the Companys business during 2008.
Despite the extremely difficult global economic conditions now prevailing, which have resulted in an unprecedented and rapid deterioration of the oil price over recent months, Dana delivered record profits and earnings per share for the full year.
2008 also saw the achievement of new record highs in oil and gas reserves, production, revenue and cash flow.
Dana has developed a strong and balanced asset base combining healthy cash reserves, a robust production portfolio delivering strong cash flow, a range of development opportunities and an extensive and exciting exploration programme.
2008 was Tom Cross, Chief Executive the most active year of exploration in Danas history with 11 wells completed during the year, including notable successes in the North Sea and the Nile Delta, with a further four wells being drilled at the year end.
These exploration successes have allowed the Group to replace reserves during 2008 by nearly 300%, resulting in a new high for year end proven plus probable reserves of 194.1 mmboe, up from 165.8 mmboe at the end of 2007.
Group production for the 2008 full year reached a new record high for Dana of approximately 39,400 boepd, giving a second successive year of around 30% growth.
The Group also successfully delivered first production from the Grouse oil field development in the Central North Sea and sanctioned two further developments during the year, the E18 gas project in the Dutch sector and the Babbage gas field in the UK Southern North Sea.
These new Colin Goodall, Chairman developments are expected to add to the production portfolio in 2009 and 2010 respectively.
As the Company undertakes further operated activity, in seismic acquisition, onshore and offshore drilling, and offshore operations, a focus on Health, Safety and the Environment Revenue million HS&E becomes increasingly important.
Dana has set ideals it strives to achieve, in terms 518.0 2008 of no harm to people, property or the environment in its operations.
Annual goals and targets 2007 are set to achieve these ideals and excellent results were delivered in 2008 in respect of these 2006 goals and targets.
Further, more challenging goals and targets have been set in 2009 with the 2005 aim of achieving continual improvement in HS&E.

Board and Corporate governance As planned, Angus Pelham Burn retired as a non-executive director at the AGM in July 2008.
Angus was a key member of the Dana Board and had always shown great skill, intelligence and integrity during more than eight years of service to the Company.
We would like to record our thanks and appreciation to Angus for his significant contribution during the development of the Group and we wish him a long and happy retirement.
Following the 2008 AGM, Ian Rawlinson assumed the role of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, relinquishing the role of Chairman of the Audit Committee, which in turn was assumed by Philip Dayer from the same date.
Brian Johnston was appointed as a nonexecutive director on 24 April 2008.
Brian enjoyed a highly successful 34 year career with Bank of Scotland HBOS, and has joined Ian and Philip serving as independent directors on the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
We look forward to working with him as the Company continues to grow over the coming years.
Business development Business development continues to play a significant role in delivering Danas future growth and, over the past few years, Dana has consistently undertaken a high level of commercial activity ranging from exploration farm-ins, to individual asset deals and corporate portfolio acquisitions.
This activity has continued with the recent announcement in February 2009 that the Company has entered into an agreement with Bow Valley Energy Ltd Bow Valley, that provides for the acquisition by Dana of the entire share capital of Bow Valley, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Bow Valley is a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed upstream company, predominantly focused on oil production and development in the UK North Sea.
This acquisition is directly in line with Danas successful strategy of growing reserves and production in its core operating areas through both exploration and acquisition.
In connection with this transaction and as a broader corporate refinancing initiative, Dana has agreed a new three year USD400 million revolving credit facility with the Bank of Scotland, replacing the Companys existing undrawn facility which was due to mature in March 2009.
This new facility will provide funding both for the circa USD35 million acquisition costs and for 4 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 settling Bow Valleys bank indebtedness, which stood at an estimated USD142 million at 31 December 2008.
The Bow Valley acquisition and the refinancing have been achieved despite extremely difficult market conditions.
These significant steps forward for the Group are testament to the skills and very hard work of Danas talented team of industry professionals.
On behalf of the Board, we would like to recognise and thank all staff for their valuable contributions, enthusiasm and dedication to the Company.
Outlook 2009 has started with an exceptionally high level of exploration activity, with a total of seven exploration wells expected to complete during the first quarter of the year.
Early results are very encouraging.
They include the discovery of a third oil field at Rinnes, in the Hudson area of the Northern North Sea, a gas condensate discovery at the Fulla prospect in Norway, and a large gas discovery at the Anchois structure, offshore Morocco.
A further 10 exploration wells are scheduled for the remainder of the year, including the Companys first two wells in the prospective West of Shetlands area, the Eitri and Trolla wells in Norway, a potential two further wells in the offshore Nile Delta in Egypt, and onshore at the Taffejart prospect in Morocco.
The Bow Valley acquisition, once complete, is expected to add a further 7,000-8,000 boepd net to Dana, and thus ensure a good level of production growth in 2009.
This acquisition and the exploration programme are both expected to add significant reserves to the Group this year.
Dana now holds an unprecedented portfolio of opportunities for medium and long-term growth of reserves and production.
During 2009, Dana expects to invest some 235 million on its existing fields and exploration licences.
Approximately 95 million will be spent on production and development activity and 140 million on exploration and appraisal.
This capital expenditure programme can be funded from existing cash resources, cashflow from operations and the new finance facilities secured in 2009.
This figure will continue to be subject to volatility in the GBP:USD exchange rate, given the USD drilling component of the investment programme and potential changes due to joint venture partners continuously reviewing their priorities for capital allocation.
Whilst the macro threats to all businesses in the current difficult economic environment are well documented, Danas board believes that further attractive growth opportunities will continue to be identified by the Company, which is technically strong and financially sound, and therefore very well positioned.
Dana has an exceptional management team which has a track record of growing value for shareholders and there is a real determination to continue that success.
On behalf of the directors and staff we would like to thank Danas shareholders for their ongoing support and interest in the Company as we look forward together to emerging successfully from these challenging times.
