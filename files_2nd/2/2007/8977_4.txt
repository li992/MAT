Business Review 06 Chief Executives Review In 2008 we see further exciting opportunities, from our existing assets, our growth projects and diversi cation in the region In 2007 total ore output in our core copper business Zinc metal in concentrate production was 132.8 kt, was 34.0 MT, compared to 39.2 MT in 2006.
The compared to 129.1 kt, mainly as a result of the average copper grade of 1.22% was slightly higher increased output of zinc bearing ores, particularly than 2006, at 1.17%, though this was largely due to from the Kosmurun mine.
By-product gold the reduced output from the Zhezkazgan Complex production, excluding tolled material, increased and the low grade Kounrad mine, which was closed to 113.4 koz, bene ting from increased grades for a scheduled push back in 2007.

Progress was made on health and safety in 2007, but there is much more still to do.
The total number of fatalities in 2007 was 23, a signi cant reduction from 32 in 2006.
I regret to announce that there have been six fatalities in the first two months of 2008, which are currently being investigated.
As mentioned at the time of our Interim Results, we saw a signi cant improvement in fatalities from roof falls, where the fatality rate decreased from 14 in 2006 to four in 2007.
This was a result of changing methods of inspecting and securing the roof.
A second major source of fatalities has been from electrical equipment.
A visit was made to mines in South Africa in 2007, following which revised working practices have been successfully introduced.
