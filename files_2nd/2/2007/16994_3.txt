Industry analysts, Infield Systems Ltd, have estimated that capital expenditure on deepwater developments has increased from approximately $9bn in 2004 to $19bn in 2007.
Over the next five years, they expect this expenditure to increase further to in excess of $25bn per annum.
As oil companies move in to more remote areas, and deeper water depths, the use of floating production facilities has become more prevalent.
Flexible pipelines are a critical element of the majority of FPSO developments: connecting the wellheads to the surface via flexible risers.
Thus, the increased use of FPSOs worldwide has been one of the drivers for rapid growth in Wellstreams business.

100 The most important regions globally for this type of development are Latin America and West Africa which together account for over 40% of the global 50 installed base for FPSOs.
The market in Latin America dominates the worldwide flexible market, underpinned by Brazil, and if the potential of the major 0 discoveries made in the country during 2007 is realised, this trend is expected to continue.
A significant market is also developing in Asia.
In addition to FPSOs, subsea developments are also an important driver for Wellstreams business.
Whilst much of the subsea market has evolved in support of floating production vessels and deepwater developments, subsea tiebacks in shallow water remain significant, particularly in mature production basins like the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico.
In these regions, the current high oil and gas prices have made the development of marginal fields economic.
Many of these developments have been facilitated by the use of flexible flowlines, which can be quickly 2 Total U. S. Wells Completed manufactured and rapidly installed using readily available and cost effective 70,000 offshore installation vessels.

The Frade project accounted for some two thirds of the annual production in Newcastle and at year end the programme was on schedule and over 70% complete.
The year also featured eight major projects for Petrobras.
These projects involved both the Newcastle and Niteri operations.
Of particular note was the technically complex P52 16 inch loading line contract which was successfully completed in July and has now been installed offshore by the customer.
Other major contracts included UNBC phase 1 which is the first project to be entirely executed and manufactured in Brazil.
The UNBC projects are continuing into 2008 where several pipe designs are being delivered from the Niteri plant.

The period also saw the successful introduction of 5.5 inch and 6 inch diameter products.
The first 6 inch pipe delivery is destined for Pemex in Mexico.
South America continues to show promise with Petrobras placing initial orders and negotiations continuing in Venezuela.
The American and Canadian markets continue to underpin the business and despite the drop-off in the Canadian gas market, the high pressure market for the TM FlexSteel product has remained positive.
