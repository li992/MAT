These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports primary segmental information.
This is a change from the basis reported in 2006 in that the closed, owner-occupied first mortgage book, which at 30 September 2007 amounted to 293.8 million, and the closed, unsecured book of 56.9 million, both of which comprised the Other Operations category last year, are now included within the First Mortgages and Consumer Finance segments respectively.
For reporting purposes these books were absorbed within the results from the two main business areas because their reduced size had rendered the Other Operations segment insignificant in terms of assets, revenue and net profits.
