The Engineering & Production Facilities EBITA margin increased from 7.2% to 8.3%, due primarily to increases in the underlying margins for both our engineering and production facilities up 48% activities.
The slight improvement in the Well Support EBITA margin from 10.0% to 10.1% was driven by the positive margin impact of increasing revenue in areas of activity where we have operational gearing, and the bene t of new higher margin services and products.
