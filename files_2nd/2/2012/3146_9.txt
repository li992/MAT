39 Management Discussion & Analysis and Business Review 2 Cash Cost per Ounce Calculation: Cash costs per ounce is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Cash Cost per ounce is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a period by the total gold production over the same period.
Operating costs represent total operating costs less administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortization.
Management uses this measure internally to better assess performance trends for the Company as a whole.
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use such non-GAAP information to evaluate the Companys performance and ability to generate cash ow.
The Company believes that these measures provide an alternative reection of the Groups performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its expected performance in future periods.
Cash costs is intended to provide additional information, does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
This measure is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash ow from operations as determined under GAAP.

41 Management Discussion & Analysis and Business Review investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further Concession Agreement Court case investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Courts in Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, We do not yet know when the appeal will conclude, amongst others, an independent member of the previous although are aware of the potential for the process in parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the Egypt to be lengthy.
The Company has taken extensive agreement that confers on the Group rights to operate legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading in Egypt.
This agreement, the Concession Agreement, Egyptian law rms who have confirmed that the proper 2 was entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority EMRA and exploitation lease.

In the event that the appellate court fails to Law 222 of 1994. be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the Group, the operations at Sukari may be adversely effected In summary that judgment states that, although the to the extent that the companies operation exceeded the Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, 2 exploitation lease area of 3km referred to in the original sufficient evidence had not been submitted to Court court decision.

It appears that an In January 2012 the Group received a letter from executed original document was not supplied to the Court.

These included both lodging a formal appeal of production.
It is understood that the reason that this before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November letter was issued was that Chevron had received 2012 and, in the first instance, lodging an Objection a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General to Enforcement in respect of the original ruling with the Petroleum Corporation EGPC.

On 20 March 2013 the Court upheld this application thus The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter suspending the initial decision and providing assurance and in consequence in June lodged an appeal against that normal operations will be able to continue whilst the EGPCs decision in the Administrative Courts.
Again, the appeal process is underway.
Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is good prospect of success.
However, EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the 27 November 2012, the day after the Companys appeal continuation of supply, the Group has since January was lodged.

43 Management Discussion & Analysis and Business Review PRINCIPAL RISKS AFFECTING THE CENTAMIN GROUP The Group faces a variety of risks which could adversely affect its performance, earnings, financial position and prospects.
In addition, there may be additional risks unknown to Centamin and other risks, which are currently believed to be immaterial and could turn out to be material.
These risks, whether they materialise individually or simultaneously, could signicantly affect the groups business and financial results.
In addition, Centamin could also be affected by risks relating to the gold mining industry generally and the risks and hazards involved in the business of mining metals, which are largely outside its control.
It is for this reason that the Group conducted a variety of risk assessments throughout the year as part of its normal business performance and operational reviews, the results of which have been considered by the Audit and Risk Committee, and the Board, on a regular basis as required by the UK Code on Corporate Governance and relevant Canadian requirements.
Centamin has taken a number of steps to mitigate some of these risks and will continue to evaluate ways in which it can manage and mitigate risks accordingly.
Notwithstanding this, due to the very nature of risks no assurance can be given that mitigating actions taken or planned will be wholly effective.
A description of the key risks affecting the Company and the steps taken to mitigate them is set out in the table below.
This table should be read in conjunction with the commentary under the heading Concession Agreement Court case which describes in detail the risks to the Groups operations in Egypt raised by the judgment handed down on 30 October by the Administrative Court.

s The nature of underground mining operations makes it difficult to calculate resources in advance of expending money on development.
As a consequence, underground reserves and resources are likely to remain low compared with the levels of expected production.
s Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and reserve growth.
It is the opinion of management and Directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, based on current information.
However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve denition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts.
