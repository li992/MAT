Analysis of production results operating results achieved.
Actual gold equivalent production Mining Delivering on production and sales targets for the year was 1,063 Moz, a 31% increase compared Stripping volumes in 2012 grew by 6%, while underground to 2011, and exceeded the elevated guidance.
Annual gold production was 589 Koz, up 33% year-on-year, development increased by 33% to 46.7 thousand metres, driven mainly by successful ramp-up at Omolon and Albazino.
mainly due to our Dukat hub where ore is increasingly sourced Major contributions to production growth were attributable Annual silver production was 26.5 Moz, up 33% year-on-year, from underground.
Ore mined was 12,591 Kt, a 14% increase to four operations: as a result of higher grades and recoveries at Dukat, over 2011 level.
The bulk of ore mined 87%, is sourced from successful processing of high-grade Sopka ore at Omolon, open-pit.
The key contributors of growth in ore mined were Q Dukat with the increased grade prole due to and increased silver grades at Khakanja.
Khakanja due to intensied mining at pit 3 and completion of implementation of new underground mining methods, underground mining at Yurievskoye and Omolon full capacity expansion of mining at Goltsovoye, and sustainably achieved at Sopka and commencement of mining at Tsokol, improved recovery levels at the main Omsukchan further complemented by a 45% increase in ore mined at concentrator.
Albazino as the mine achieved full capacity.
Q Albazino Amursk hub as a result of the Albazino mine and concentrator reaching design throughput and recoveries The average gold equivalent grade in ore mined was 4.1 g t, by the second quarter of the year and commencement increasing by 10% over the 2011 level of 3.8 g t. The solid of commercial production at the Amursk POX, combined increase in grade prole was driven mainly by increased share with continued concentrate sales to third-party offtakers.
