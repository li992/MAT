Directors Report and Business Review Chief exeCutives Review OvERviEw 2011 presented the Retail Sector with the perfect economic storm.
Consumer demand was anaemic, held back by a combination of high inflation, low growth in wages and limited growth in consumer credit.
Our own input costs rose as soaring cotton prices and overseas wage inflation were passed on by our manufacturers.
This, along with the higher VAT, placed upward pressure on our selling prices.
Taken in this context, NEXT has performed remarkably well.
The NEXT Group increased sales on continuing business by 4.3%, operating profit by 5.6% and underlying earnings per share by 15.1%.
The latter figure was boosted by strong cash generation, share buybacks and a lower tax rate.
The explanation of these numbers comes in three parts: Sales, Margins and Cash.
Sales On the sales front, although underlying sales in our existing retail stores were down as expected, this was more than compensated for by two significant avenues of sales growth: The addition of profitable new retail space which added 2.9% to Group sales.
The continued growth, both overseas and in the UK, of our online business the NEXT Directory, which now accounts for nearly a third of the Groups total turnover.
Margins The Groups net operating margins were maintained despite a significant increase in manufacturing costs.
We worked to re-source product from new, cheaper sources of supply and negotiated hard with our existing supply base.
But this was not enough to completely offset underlying cost increases and, rather than compromise quality, we passed on some of this cost inflation in the form of 7% higher selling prices.
Stocks were managed tightly and in line with our budget, we did not discount in the run up to Christmas and we improved clearance rates in our End of Season Sale.
Inflationary pressures in our cost base, mainly in wages, warehousing and occupancy costs, were more than offset by cost saving initiatives in the Group.
Cash One of NEXTs most important qualities is its ability to turn profits into cash.
As the Company has matured we have been very careful to maintain the quality of our earnings and ensure that surplus cash, generated after healthy capital investment and dividends, is consistently returned to shareholders through share buybacks.
In the year ending January 2012 cash generation, combined with buybacks, increased earnings per share by 6%.

VAT exclusive sales were down -1.4%, although the cash taken through the till including VAT remained in line with last year.
Negative like for like sales were offset by sales from new space.
Profit margins were maintained with profits down broadly in line with sales at -1.6%.
new Space We increased trading space by 402,000 square feet, an increase of 6.6%, taking the Retail portfolio to 6.5m sq.
Sales from new space contributed 4.3% to retail sales.
The table below sets out the growth in stores and square footage.
The net increase in stores is entirely as a result of adding new Home stand-alone stores and although the trading space of clothing increased by around 200,000 sq.
feet the number of trading locations reduced by 3.
indd 5 10 04 2012 10:17:24 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Directors Report and Business Review The new space performed in line with our expectations: net branch profitability and the payback on net capital invested were comfortably within the 15% and 24 month hurdles maintained by the Company.
The table below sets out forecasts which are based on sales since the date of opening.
forecast Sales vs forecast Payback Target Profitability months Mainline 7.9% 22.4% 18.4 Home 1.3% 19.1% 23.4 Total 5.7% 21.4% 20.2 In August we opened a new large concept store in Shoreham which has proven extremely successful.
The store consists of a Fashion and a Home shop, sitting side-by-side, on one stand-alone site with its own car park.
The Home part of the shop carries an extended range which includes light DIY products and a small garden centre.
We have identified 19 other sites around the UK where we would ideally like to open similar stores.
However we expect progress to be slow as almost all of these sites require planning permission.
We will open at least two more in the year ahead, one near Ipswich the other near Warrington.
We expect to open around a further 300,000 sq.
feet in the year ahead and that sales from new space will contribute around 4% to retail sales during the year.
This projection has reduced since September as a number of complex projects, many of which require planning permission, have slipped into the following year.
Home Stand-alone Stores There is a question as to whether it is wise to be opening Home shops in a market which is so obviously having a difficult time.
There are two reasons why we are confident to carry on opening stores in the current environment.
The first is that they are extremely profitable and provide an efficient return on capital invested.
The Home stand-alone portfolio makes a 21% net branch profit.
The second is that we do not believe that the current rate of decline in the home furnishings market will continue forever, though admittedly it may take a few years to recover.

We remain convinced that there is a continued place for fashion retail stores and that increasingly customers will see stores and online as part of a single service.
We continue to see more and more Directory customers using our shops to receive and return our products.

We rarely take on leases of more than 10 years.
All lease renewals are reviewed, and we continue to monitor underperforming stores with a view to disposing of them before they become loss making.
This year we closed 14 underperforming stores which collectively traded 79,000 sq.
feet and whose combined profitability was 7.9%.
The table below sets out the percentage of our turnover taken from mainline stores in different profitability bands: our portfolio of stores remains extremely profitable with very little space making less than 5% profit and 90% of our stores making more than 15% profit contribution.
Profitability Percentage of space of turnover 20% 73% 15% 90% 10% 97% 5% 99% 0% 99.7% Profit and Margin analysis Retail Retail profitability remained flat as achieved gross margins moved forward offset by increases in occupancy and overhead costs.
The table below details the margin movement in the major heads of costs.
net operating margin last year 14.8% Increase in bought-in margin 0.3% Reduced markdown costs 0.4% increase in achieved gross margin 0.7% Decrease in store payroll 0.3% Increase in store occupancy costs -0.4% Increase in distribution & warehouse costs -0.3% Increase in central costs -0.3% net operating margin this year 14.8% The Companys decision to order stock earlier, and increase stock-holding throughout the year, meant that we were able to reduce the amount of air freight required to transport stock last minute.
This increased our bought-in margin by 0.3%.
Improved clearance rates in the End of Season Sale and reduced markdowns added a further 0.4% to achieved gross margin, although some of this gain has been offset by increased handling charges as noted below.
Productivity savings in the stores more than offset the cost of living increase in branch wage rates and additional Boxing Day premium pay.
The net savings in wages added 0.3% to margin.
Store occupancy costs increased as a percentage of sales, mainly because like for like sales declined.
Underlying rent and rates increased by 1.8% and 4.7% respectively.
Rent increases incurred in any one year are the result of five yearly rent reviews, so this number represents the compound annual growth over the last five years.
We anticipate that rental inflation will fall further in the year ahead.
Distribution and warehousing costs rose due to wage rate inflation, additional costs incurred re-balancing stock between stores, and as a result of the growth in furniture sales requiring two-man Home deliveries.
Central costs included additional amounts for employee incentives, Carbon Tax and NEXTs commercial arrangements for the 2012 Olympics.

indd 7 10 04 2012 10:17:25 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Directors Report and Business Review DiRECTORY The NEXT Directory has had another very good year with sales growing 16.4% and profits up 18.3%.
Directory Sales Directory sales were driven by a combination of growth in UK full price sales, additional End of Season markdown sales, the new Offers tab which is the equivalent of an online version of our Retail Clearance stores and international sales.
The table below sets out the different components of growth: Contribution to growth UK Full Price Sales 8.4% International Online 2.4% UK Offers Tab 2.5% Increased End of Season Sale 3.1% Total Growth 16.4% Directory stock for the Sale was up 26% on last year, whereas markdown stock across the brand was up only 10.7%.
The disproportionate growth in Directory was mainly the result of transferring less surplus stock from Directory to Retail.
The Offers tab sells prior season stock that has already been written down to one third of cost in exactly the same way as our Clearance stores operate in Retail.
These sales do not therefore adversely affect margin in the season they are sold because the obsolescence cost of the stock has already been taken in the previous season.
new Customers Directory active customers increased by 9.6% to just under three million, only 3.4% of the growth in customers came from traditional credit customers and 6.2% from new cash-only customers.
The table below sets out the growth in new customers by category of customer.
Contribution Jan Jan to customer 2012 2011 growth Credit customers 2,557 2,464 3.4% Cash customers UK 356 230 Cash customers Overseas 82 37 Total cash customers 438 267 6.2% Total active customers 2,995 2,731 9.6% Although credit customers only grew by 3.4%, sales to credit customers grew by 12%, as existing customers increased their average annual spend.
improving Service Whilst much of the growth in our internet business has come as a result of the underlying growth in the use of the internet generally, we believe that our service improvements have made a significant difference to sales.
In particular, the fact that we now deliver next day as standard to customers who order any time up till 9pm at night.
We intend to continue to improve our delivery services in the year ahead with the introduction of Sunday and evening deliveries both of which will be charged at a premium rate.
The key to our ability to improve our service offer lies in the 236m of capital we have invested over the last ten years in new warehousing capacity and automation.
This means that most stocked items can be cost effectively picked, packed, sorted and ready for despatch from our warehouses within 90 minutes of an order being taken.
Directory Overseas Directory continues to make good progress overseas with annual sales reaching 33m last year against only 10m the previous year.
We now trade online in 48 countries overseas with sales being particularly strong in Germany, USA, Australia, Eire, Poland and Russia the last of which only commenced trading in September last year.
We are budgeting for international online sales of 50m in the year ahead, at a profitability of circa 20%.
We now trade in most of the major consumer markets, but there is still the opportunity to open in a further 15 new markets during 2012, the most important of which are likely to be Middle Eastern countries in which we already have successful franchises.
We anticipate a Chinese language site will be operational in mainland China during the year, though this has proven harder to get up and running than initially anticipated.

indd 8 10 04 2012 10:17:25 Profit and Margin analysis Directory Over the course of 2011, margins in NEXT Directory have improved by 0.4%, the reasons for which are detailed below.
net operating margin last year 23.7% Increase in bought-in gross margin 0.6% Reduction in markdown costs 0.2% increase in achieved gross margin 0.8% Improvement in bad debt 0.4% Reduced service charge income -0.9% Reduction in net service charge -0.5% Increase in warehouse and distribution costs -0.7% Decrease in marketing, other and central costs 0.8% net operating margin this year 24.1% The achieved gross margin increased by 0.8%.
As in Retail, Directory bought-in gross margin increased as a result of lower air freight costs.
In addition, higher margin clothing sales grew faster than Home sales, which were restrained by the opening of new stand-alone Retail Home stores.
Markdown costs reduced, as improved clearance rates more than offset the 26% increase in stock for the Directory Sale.
We continued to see an improvement in bad debt rates, a trend which we have seen for over two years now.
Bad debt rates are now the lowest we have ever known them.
We believe that this is a result of the credit crunch, which reduced credit availability generally, thus reducing consumers ability to take on debt they could not afford.
Overall service charge income increased in value but decreased as a percentage of sales.
Service charge income grew by 8% whilst total sales were up 16%, so net margins were reduced by -0.9%.
An increase in warehousing and distribution costs reduced margin by -0.7%.
Most of this cost increase came from warehousing and was the result of additional labour used to improve stock distribution between Retail and Directory.
It was this exercise that allowed us to improve the efficiency of our clearance online.
In addition, staffing costs were inflated by the increased use of agency staff, the annual cost of living wage award and increased management cover.
There were significant inflationary rises in the underlying costs of parcel distribution but these were offset by greater use of our stores for deliveries and returns, along with a reduction in free post and packaging promotions throughout the year.
Increases in central overheads, including the payment of higher staff incentives, were more than offset by marketing and call centre savings.
These costs were reduced by increased use of the internet and a reduction in the number of customers requesting printed catalogues.
inTERnaTiOnal RETail The majority of this business is conducted through our franchise partners.
In total, they operate 164 NEXT stores in 30 countries.
Reported partner sales increased by 9% in total and 5% on a like for like basis.
Sales in our 26 wholly owned and joint venture overseas stores were only marginally up on last year.
Revenue and income for our international business is set out below.

Sales increased by 1.8% in Sterling terms and slightly more in local currencies.
Profit, of 21m, was down on last year as the reduced commission rates implemented in 2010 took full effect.
In addition NEXT Sourcing took a significant one off provision relating to faulty stock, most of which was identified before delivery.

OTHER PROfiT anD lOSS MOvEMEnTS ventura In July we announced the sale of Ventura to The Capita Group plc for 65m.
The proceeds were returned to shareholders through share buybacks and the effect of the transaction was neutral in terms of earnings per share.
Ventura is shown as a discontinued business in these accounts and the profit of 40.6m is made up of: The 2.6m post-tax trading profit up to the date of sale, Plus the sale proceeds, Less the net asset value and sale costs.
lipsy After a very difficult first half, the second half was somewhat better.
The sales increase came through Lipsy stores and online, with use of the NEXT infrastructure being of significant benefit.
Lipsy now operates 49 stores, 17 are stand-alone and 32 are either separate stores carved out of a NEXT property or integral within a NEXT store and thereby leveraging staff, systems and services.
We expect Lipsy to have 55 stores by the end of the year and the majority will be of the integral type.
Online sales increased by 70% to 9m and, whilst sales through the Lipsy site increased, the biggest growth came from a specific Lipsy tab on the NEXT Directory site.
This brings Lipsy products to many more potential customers, along with the Directory customer service offer.
interest and Taxation The underlying interest charge of 28m was as forecast and included costs relating to the issue of a new 10 year bond, redemption of 158m existing bonds and renewal of our medium term bank facility.
Debt averaged 630m at an average rate of 4% on our mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
For the year ahead we expect debt to average 600m and a similar interest charge of 28m.
Our tax rate would have reduced to 26.3% due to the reduction in corporation tax rates.
However, we have resolved a significant prior year issue and this resulted in a further rate reduction to 25.1%.
On the assumption that corporation tax rates continue to reduce as announced, we expect our tax rate to be 25% or less in each of the next two years.
BalanCE SHEET anD CaSH flOw Cash flow During the year the Group generated just over 200m of cash and a further 63m from the sale of Ventura.
This cash generation was after capital expenditure, tax and dividends but before buybacks and additional ESOT cover.
Capital expenditure amounted to 126m and we are planning for 115m in the year ahead, we will continue to invest in profitable new stores and will spend less on warehouse developments.
At the end of last year we significantly increased our stock-holding to improve availability, so throughout the year stock levels were significantly up.
As this step change annualised stock levels came into line with last year and were just 1% up at the year end.
Directory debtor balances rose 74m to 574m, up 15% and only slightly less than the growth in sales and was marginally ahead of our expectations.

indd 10 10 04 2012 10:17:25 At the half year we reported on the issue of a new 10 year bond and can now advise that we have renewed our medium term, committed bank facility.
We have a syndicate of six banks who commit to provide up to 300m over the next five years.
Total debt facilities available are as follows: m 2013 bonds 85 2016 bonds 213 2021 bonds 325 Total bonds nominal value 623 2016 committed bank facility 300 Total debt facilities available 923 We believe NEXT will continue to generate cash in the year ahead to fund growth, pay dividends and continue with share buybacks.
We currently estimate a cash inflow of around 200m after capital expenditure, interest, tax and dividends, but before share buybacks.
Share Buybacks and Debt During the year we acquired 12.5 million shares 6.9% of those in issue at the start of the year at an average price of 23.21 and a cost of 290m.
Since the year end we have purchased a further 0.6m shares at a cost of 16m.
We will continue to use buybacks to manage our capital base efficiently.
It is our intention to maintain investment grade credit rating and we will not pursue buybacks to the detriment of developing the business.
Subject to market conditions, we intend to return between 140m and 200m to shareholders via share buybacks in the current year.
In this scenario, we expect net debt will fluctuate between 550m and 700m for the majority of the year and will again be around 575m by January 2013.
DiviDEnDS We have proposed raising our final dividend to 62.5p, taking the total dividend for the year to 90p.
This is an increase of 15% and broadly in line with growth in underlying EPS.
Dividend cover remains at 2.8 times.
In previous years, we have paid the final dividend in early July.
We are moving the payment date to early August.
This better aligns the dividend outflow of 100m to the matching cash inflows from our late July Summer Sale.
inTERiM ManaGEMEnT STaTEMEnT Our next statement will cover the first quarter to the end of April and is provisionally scheduled for Wednesday 2 May 2012.
OuTlOOK The outlook for the year ahead is very uncertain, and in this environment we think it is sensible to again be cautious in our budgeting.
Outlook for the consumer There is some important good news for the consumer.
As expected, inflation has begun to fall and looks set to ease further.
So by the third quarter consumers should see their incomes rising broadly in line with prices a welcome end to deflation in real earnings.
Inflation in our own prices has also evaporated and selling prices going forward will be in line with those last year.
However, in 2012 there remain two important constraints to growth in consumer spending: Employment took a turn for the worse in the middle of last year and currently the creation of jobs in the private sector is only barely keeping pace with the reductions in public sector employment.
So it looks as though there is little chance of increased employment improving the consumer economy.
Credit availability remains very tight for business and consumers alike.
The recent increases in mortgage rates, announced by several UK lenders, is indicative of a world where credit conditions are unlikely to ease.
In addition any worsening in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis would further undermine UK employment and put additional pressure on banks balance sheets.
So this possibility remains a significant downside risk to the UK consumer.
On balance we believe that these ongoing constraints outweigh much of the upside potential for 2012 and accordingly we are budgeting conservatively.

indd 11 10 04 2012 10:17:25 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Directors Report and Business Review Outlook for Sales Our plan for the year ahead is similar to the approach taken last year.
We anticipate that underlying retail sales will remain negative but that we can continue to move the top line forward albeit modestly through the addition of profitable new space and the continued development of the NEXT Directory.
It is too early to give a full year forecast but our budget for the first half is for Brand sales to be up between 1% and 4%, with Retail sales between 0% and -3% and Directory between 9% and 12%.
It is worth noting that the growth in the first quarters sales is likely to be lower than the second, as last years first quarter was boosted by an exceptionally warm Easter and the Royal Wedding.
Last year growth in the first quarter was 5.2% but in the second only 1.3%.
Outlook for Margins and Costs We anticipate that bought-in gross margin for the full year the difference between the cost of the stock and its retail selling price before markdown will be level with last year, with manufacturing costs and selling prices both remaining in line with last year.
Stocks are being managed tightly and if sales are within our budgeted range we do not anticipate any significant change to markdown and obsolescence costs.
We estimate that annual inflation in our existing cost base i. e. excluding the costs of new space will be around 36m, driven mainly by wage inflation of 2.5% and underlying increases in rent and rates.
However we believe that we can offset at least 28m of this increase with cost saving initiatives.
Outlook for Cash and Buybacks We anticipate that the Company will generate 200m of surplus cash after allowing for capital investment, tax and dividends.
We intend to use up to this amount to buy back shares and at a price of 28.00 that sum would buy around 4% of the shares in issue.
Scenarios for full Year Profit and Earnings per Share Our budget for the Autumn Winter season has yet to be finalised.
However, if sales for the full year fall within our range for the Spring Summer season and we buy back 4% of the Companys shares, then the table below sets out the likely ranges for growth in sales, profits and EPS.
low High Scenario Scenario Total Brand Sales 1% 4% Full Year Profit Before Tax 560m 610m Full Year Profit Before Tax -2% 7% EPS Growth 3% 12% in Summary NEXT has performed well in a difficult year, delivering good growth in sales and profits combined with exceptional advances in earnings per share and dividends.
The year ahead looks no less challenging but the Group is well prepared and has further opportunities for growth.
We remain strongly cash generative and have every chance of delivering another year of increased sales and earnings per share.
