The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Chief Executives review During the year ended 30 September 2012 the Group has successfully pursued its strategy to deliver shareholder value through purchasing portfolios, developing new lending, entering into new servicing agreements and continuing the careful management of the extant portfolios.
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONSOLIDATED RESULTS For the year ended 30 September 2012 2012 2011 m m Interest receivable 293.8 258.0 Interest payable and similar charges 136.0 122.2 Net interest income 157.8 135.8 Other operating income 12.4 15.1 Total operating income 170.2 150.9 Operating expenses 51.9 45.4 Provisions for losses 24.1 24.4 Underlying pro t 94.2 81.1 Fair value net gains losses 1.3 0.3 Operating pro t being pro t on ordinary activities before taxation 95.5 80.8 Tax charge on pro t on ordinary activities 23.3 21.2 Pro t on ordinary activities after taxation 72.2 59.6 Dividend rate per share for the year 6.0p 4.0p Basic earnings per share 24.2p 20.2p Diluted earnings per share 23.5p 19.6p The Group is organised into two major operating divisions: First Mortgages, which includes the buy-to-let and owner-occupied first mortgage assets and other sources of income derived from first charge mortgages: and Consumer Finance, which includes secured lending, car, retail finance and unsecured loan books and other sources of income derived from consumer loans.
Both divisions include internally originated and acquired assets.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports primary segmental information.
Chief Executives review 7 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The underlying operating pro ts of these business segments are detailed fully in appendix B to the annual report and are summarised below.
2012 2011 m m Underlying operating pro t First Mortgages 61.6 67.3 Consumer Finance 32.6 13.8 94.2 81.1 Net interest income increased by 16.2% to 157.8 million 2011: 135.8 million, re ecting the impact of new loan assets, both acquired and originated, on interest income and margins, partially offset by a 0.3% reduction in the size of the loan book during the year.
Other operating income was 12.4 million for the year, compared with 15.1 million in 2011, the reduction re ecting, principally, a lower level of third party fee income as a result of the purchase of accounts previously administered by the Group, early in the year.
Operating expenses during the year were 14.3% higher at 51.9 million 2011: 45.4 million.
The increase is primarily due to employment costs, following the recruitment of additional staff, during the year and in the second half of 2011, to administer purchased and third party loan portfolios.
The cost:income ratio was in line with our expectations at 30.5% for the year appendix A, a similar level to last year, and remains signi cantly below the industry average.
The Board remains focused on controlling operating costs through the application of rigorous budgeting, management reporting and monitoring procedures.
The charge for impairment provisions of 24.1 million was 1.2% lower than the charge of 24.4 million for 2011, an increase in the charge within the First Mortgages division, to more normal levels from a low level of charge in 2011, being more than offset by a reduction in the impairment charge within the Consumer Finance division.
As a percentage of loans to customers note 31 the charge has remained at 0.28%, the gure recorded in 2011.
Low interest rates have increased affordability for customers, reducing the incidence of new arrears and assisting the correction of past arrears.
The loan books continue to be carefully managed and credit performance remains in line with our expectations.
Yield curve movements during the year resulted in hedging instrument fair value net gains of 1.3m 2011: losses of 0.3 million, which do not affect cash ow.
As the fair value movements of hedged assets or liabilities are expected to trend to zero over time, this item is merely a timing difference.
The Group remains economically and appropriately hedged.
Cash generation has remained strong over the period.
Free cash balances stood at 127.7 million at 30 September 2012 2011: 195.0 million, after investing signi cantly in both asset purchases and in the development of our buy-to-let lending business, detailed below.
Corporation tax has been charged at an effective tax rate of 24.4%, compared to 26.2% in 2011, the decrease being attributable to the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
Pro ts after taxation of 72.2 million 2011: 59.6 million have been transferred to shareholders funds, which totalled 803.5 million at the year-end 2011: 742.0 million, representing 269p per share 2011: 250p per share appendix C. BUSINESS REVIEW OPERATING SEGMENTS First Mortgages Buy-to-let loans advanced under the Groups new lending products were 184.3 million for the year 2011: 127.0 million and a further 4.6 million 2011: 5.8 million of loans were made to existing borrowers in respect of further advances.
This brings the total value of completions under the Groups new products since the recommencement of new lending in October 2010 to 311.3 million.
Application levels continued to increase over the year, with the pipeline of applications and offers outstanding totalling 129.9 million at 30 September 2012 2011: 67.5 million.
The credit quality of the new lending business written in the year has been excellent, with an average loan to value ratio of 70.1% 2011: 69.2% and no arrears on loans advanced since the recommencement of lending in October 2010.
8 Chief Executives review The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Group has continued to focus mainly on the higher margin professional landlord business under the Paragon Mortgages brand.
Paragons professional landlord business is widely sourced from a large number of mortgage and commercial finance introducers, giving us the capacity to support materially higher business volumes in due course.
At 30 September 2012, the buy-to-let portfolio was 8,196.4 million, compared with 8,231.7 million a year earlier.
The redemption rate on the back book remained low at 2.2% for the year 2011: 2.2% with landlords continuing to display a long-term commitment to property investment, whilst alternative offerings from other lenders remain unattractive as a result of generally higher funding and capital costs.
The credit performance of the portfolio over the year has again been exemplary, with the percentage of loans three months or more in arrears including acquired loans and receivership cases but excluding possession and receivership cases held for sale standing at 0.48% at 30 September 2012 30 September 2011: 0.63% and remains considerably better than the comparable market average of 1.51% as recorded by the Council of Mortgage Lenders CML at that date 30 September 2011: 1.90%.
Despite an improved arrears performance over the year, the impairment charge attributable to First Mortgages increased to 12.4 million for the year from 5.6 million for 2011 a return to normal levels of provisioning after a low level of charge last year and following an increase in receiver of rent activity, where a charge for impairments may be made for accounts that are less than three months in arrears.
At 30 September 2012 there were 1,504 properties across all portfolios where a receiver had been appointed 30 September 2011: 1,483.
Of those available for letting, 94.2% were let 30 September 2011: 93.9%.
The latest Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS UK Residential Lettings Survey again con rms that tenant demand has continued to grow whilst landlord supply of property new to the lettings market has stabilised.
As a consequence of the high level of demand, the RICS survey indicates that rents are expected to continue to increase.
The latest survey data from the Association of Residential Letting Agents con rms a similar picture with agents on balance noting an increase in achievable rents over the six months to June 2012.
Whilst volumes remain low by historical standards, buy-to-let remains the only growth sector of the mortgage market, with the CML reporting that the value of buy-to-let advances increased by 25.6% to 15.7 billion in the course of the financial year 2011: 12.5 billion whilst credit quality in the sector continues to improve with industry-wide buy-to-let arrears once again lower than in the owner-occupied market note 6.
The owner-occupied book reduced to 99.2 million from 128.7 million during the year ended 30 September 2012 and performed in line with the Groups expectations.
Save for the management of this book in run-off, there has been little activity in recent years in this area as the Group has focused on other lending markets, portfolio acquisitions and other sources of revenue generation.
Consumer Finance At 30 September 2012, the total loans outstanding on the Consumer Finance books were 399.0 million, compared with 363.8 million at 30 September 2011, this increase being due to portfolio purchases covered fully below and the continuing low level of redemptions across the portfolios.
The performance of the Consumer Finance book, including the acquired assets, remains satisfactory and in line with our expectations.
The Groups secured loan portfolio at 30 September 2012, including the acquired assets, was 279.9 million 2011: 340.1 million.
The unsecured loan, retail finance and car finance portfolios, including the acquired assets, totalled 119.1 million at 30 September 2012 30 September 2011: 23.7 million.
PORTFOLIO OPPORTUNITIES A major area of strategic focus has been the acquisition of loan portfolios through Idem Capital and the servicing of third party loan portfolios as opportunities are created through the ongoing process fide-leveraging by the larger banks and other financial institutions, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
Idem Capital has rmly established itself as one of the top consumer debt buyers in the UK, with total investments in the financial year of 115.4 million 2011: 22.7 million.
In addition to assets acquired in its own right, Idem, through its sister companies, Moorgate Loan Servicing and Arden Credit Management, has established four new servicing contracts with co-investment partners during the year.
These add volume to the Groups servicing operations and enhance earnings, with little or no capital investment.
Progress has been excellent and has resulted in an increase in operating pro ts from these transactions to 26.3 million 2011: 7.6 million during the financial year.
Chief Executives review 9 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Idem Capital Idem Capital invests in loan portfolios either as principal, where Idem acquires pools in its own right, or as co-investor alongside other partners with, typically, Moorgate Loan Servicing appointed to act as servicer.
Co-investing has the potential for higher returns where the Group also derives income from servicing the loans within the underlying portfolio.
Investments are made only after signi cant due diligence work on the portfolio and sensitivity testing of potential returns.
In October 2011 Idem Capital completed the purchase of a portfolio of unsecured consumer loans, previously serviced by the Group, from The Royal Bank of Scotland plc RBS for 43.2 million.
In addition, under the terms of a forward ow agreement with RBS, a total of 0.6 million of unsecured consumer loans were acquired in the year, and further opportunities are anticipated.
Another signi cant portfolio purchase was completed in December 2011 when Idem Capital acquired a portfolio of closed UK credit card receivables from MBNA Europe Bank Limited, for 55.7 million.
The management of these accounts was transferred to the Group during the second quarter of the year.
The acquisition of a further portfolio of closed UK credit card receivables from MBNA Europe Bank Limited was announced on 3 September 2012.
The consideration payable on completion was 16.1 million and the management of these accounts was transferred to the Group before the year end.
By 30 September 2012, total investment in portfolios by Idem Capital since 2009 had reached 161.9 million.
A number of potential portfolio investments are currently under review and the Groups track record in loan servicing, risk management and portfolio investment positions it well to exploit similar opportunities as they arise in future.
Moorgate Loan Servicing The Groups third party loan servicing business operates through Moorgate Loan Servicing and its division, Arden Credit Management, utilising our core administration and collections skills.
Our experience in loan management established over many years has enabled us to extend this service to our third party clients, providing signi cant added value to the performance of their loan portfolios.
During the year Moorgate Loan Servicing has assumed the servicing of four further portfolios, comprising 149,000 accounts, on behalf of third parties 2011: 50,000 accounts with the result that 49.9% of accounts under management by the Group at 30 September 2012 were managed on behalf of third parties 2011: 58.6%.
Moorgate is well placed to take advantage of other opportunities that may arise over the coming years, particularly as portfolio disposals take place as part of the wider financial sector fide-leveraging process.
REGULATION Regulation is undergoing material change across the financial services sector.
Some aspects will affect the current operations of the Group, although the impact is unlikely to be signi cant.
The Financial Services Authority FSA has concluded, through its Mortgage Market Review, that there will be enhanced prudential supervision of non-deposit takers engaged in regulated lending.
Regulation of second charge mortgages will transfer from the Of ce of Fair Trading to the FSAs successor bodies in 2014.
Separately, it is proposed that those successor bodies will, in due course, assume responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit.
Certain areas of the Groups operations are already authorised by the FSA in respect of residential mortgage and insurance activity and we expect to be well placed to comply with the proposed changes in the regulatory framework.
The European Commissions proposed directive on credit agreements relating to residential property, which may impose additional disclosure and other requirements for all mortgage lending to consumers secured on residential property, has yet to be concluded.
It remains unclear to what extent these obligations will apply to buy-to-let lending.
We will continue to maintain an active dialogue with the UK and European regulatory authorities as these proposals develop.
10 Chief Executives review The Paragon Group of Companies PLC FUNDING On 10 November 2011 the Group completed a 163.8 million securitisation of buy-to-let loans, through Paragon Mortgages No.
This securitisation, the Groups first since 2007, released warehouse capacity to accommodate further lending growth.
Notes totalling 131.7 million, rated Aaa by Moodys Investors Service and AAA by Fitch Ratings, were sold to investors with the Group retaining the remaining, unrated, notes.
This was an important landmark for the Group, being the first buy-to-let securitisation by any issuer in the UK since the credit crunch.
The notes were priced at LIBOR plus 275 basis points, re ecting the poor bond market conditions at that time.
Whilst the notes match-fund the collateralised loans to maturity, we have the ability to call the notes after three years.
After the year end, on 25 October 2012, the Group completed a 200.0 million securitisation of buy-to-let loans, through Paragon Mortgages No.
PM 17 comprises 175.0 million of AAA rated notes, 10.5 million of AA rated notes and 10.0 million of A rated notes at margins of 135, 190 and 290 basis points over three month LIBOR respectively.
4.5 million of subordinated notes were retained by the Group, which also invested 6.0 million in the first loss fund, bringing the Groups total investment in PM 17 to 10.5 million, or 5.25% of the issue amount.
The pricing of the PM 17 transaction re ected the strong credit pro le of the Groups buy-to-let assets and our experience as an issuer of high quality bonds in the mortgage backed securities market.
This was only the second securitisation of buy-to-let loans since the credit crunch, the first to issue junior, single A rated, bonds since 2008 and was the Groups 55th securitisation since pioneering the methodology in 1987.
The Group funded its mortgage originations during the year through a 200.0 million revolving warehouse provided by Macquarie Bank.
This facility was renewed and extended for a further two years after the year end and the amount available for drawing increased to 250.0 million.
On 27 September 2012, the Group signed an additional 200.0 million revolving warehouse facility provided by the wholesale division of Lloyds Bank.
The facility, rated by Fitch Ratings, will be available to Paragon Fifth Funding Limited, an orphan special purpose vehicle company, and interest will be charged on the amount drawn at three month LIBOR plus 275 basis points.
The facility is structured with a three-year term to permit drawings and re-drawings in its first eighteen months, or up to 24 months, subject to a capital markets re nancing of part of the facility in the first twelve months.
The Group uses the warehouse facilities to originate mortgage loans prior to arranging term funding in the securitisation markets and, following the successful completion of the issuances by Paragon Mortgages No.
17, we plan to return to the securitisation markets regularly as business volumes increase.
Dependant on volume and market conditions, additional warehousing capacity may be sought in due course.
CONCLUSION The buy-to-let and portfolio purchase businesses have grown strongly and contributed to record pro ts.
The developments in funding capacity in the last 15 months leave the Group well funded to support the further development of the buy-to-let business, while the strong operational cash ows generated put the Group in a good position to continue to bene t from future portfolio acquisitions and servicing opportunities arising out of bank fide-leveraging.
