Thesechanges should extend the life of the F3SO vessel, 27,000 toupto 15 years, and will allow additional wells in any second 23,698 development phase.
With the extended eld life, the gross 22,802 21,074 eld23 reserves are increased from 29 MMboe to 4 MMboe.
This relates only to the existing first phase of development.
Thenet effect of the capital cost increases, the benefit of the 13,613 reserves increase and the operational improvements to the 10,150 project, isapositive increase in the net present value overall: theimprovements also create the potential for additional reserves and value in a potential second phase.

We are enthusiastic about Kraken, and anticipate it becoming a key part of EnQuests asset base.
Kraken is anticipated to have a long eld life and therefore a production prole that complements shorter life elds such as the Don elds and Alma Galia.
Along with Alma Galia, Kraken should help to secure EnQuests medium term production and reserves growth.
EnQuests execution team is leading the development, utilising its integrated project development capabilities.

Tell us why the Heather return to drilling project is such a milestone for the platform 2013 marks the 40th anniversary of the discovery of the Heather eld and 35 years of production.
Twice in her life Heather faced the prospect of decommissioning, and EnQuests Return to Drilling R2D2 project is designed to extend eld life to around2030.
The prime objective of the upgrade project is to provide an enhanced drilling facility in preparation for a comprehensive drilling programme, and the team has already identied many innovative project solutions.
Work is still to be completed, but great progress has been made so far thanks to the teamwork, creativity and collaboration shown by EnQuest and our core contractors.

In addition to first oil from Alma Galia, production improvements will come from three production wells in our existing producing elds: one new production well on Don Southwest, one well coming back onstream as a result of a workover on Heather, and another new well on Thistle.
In total in 201, EnQuest plans to deliver 12 wells.
This includes three exploration appraisal wells, with one each at both Cairngorm and Kraken and a further exploration appraisal well is expected to be drilled in Malaysia in late 201.
"Why are you considering potential opportunities inNorway"" Entering the Norwegian market is a sensible step for EnQuest as it seeks to expand internationally."
The geology in the Norwegian North Sea is very similar to that in the U. CS.
The extensive skill set we have within the Company is transferable and we already have a small team working out of Stavanger.
Norway provides an ideal opportunity to replicate our existing business model of targeting undeveloped assets with near eld appraisal and exploration prospects.
