ADVANCING OUR STRATEGY TO BECOME A LEADING INCOME-FOCUSED REIT CHIEF In November 2011, we set out our strategy, which is detailed on pages 4-5 of this report, to address areas of historical EXECUTIVES underperformance and deliver better future returns to our shareholders.
REVIEW In order to implement our strategy, we set out a clear plan with four key priorities: 01 Reshaping the existing portfolio by divesting non-core assets which do not meet our strategic and financial criteria and reducing non-income producing assets as a proportion of the total portfolio: 02 Seeking profitable growth by reinvesting in core markets and asset types by taking advantage of attractive development and acquisition opportunities: 03 Reducing net debt and financial leverage over time and introducing further third party capital where appropriate: and 04 Driving our operational performance across the business through greater customer focus, knowledge sharing, efficiency improvements and cost reductions.
Our focus throughout 2012 has been on delivering against these four priorities and making further progress towards our ambition of being a leading owner, asset manager and developer of industrial properties and a leading incomefocused REIT.
INTRODUCTION We are pleased with the progress made by the business over the past year.
Our strong operational performance in 2012 has driven good earnings growth.
Through disposals, selective acquisitions Against our strategic priorities we have and development, we have taken made considerable progress in the first substantial steps forward with our full year of our three to five year strategy to build a high-quality portfolio journey to reshape our portfolio, reduce the level of net borrowings and of modern, well-located warehouses, drive further improvements in our light industrial and data centre assets.
We will continue to work towards each of these objectives in the current year and beyond.
