Managing health risks 100 000 medical consultations provided for employees, their families and local communities 24% reduction in number of malaria cases Group level malaria incidence falls below 50%, and at least 30% below initial baselines at all mines 10% increase in number of employees attending voluntary testing for HIV AIDS We believe that a healthy workforce and their immediate family are critical to the productivity and functioning of our mines.
HIV AIDS Malaria Occupational health Current potential impact on the business Our mines are located in isolated parts of Africa where access to basic healthcare tends to be extremely limited and where infectious diseases can create significant human and business risks.
That is why health issues, such as malaria and HIV AIDS, appeared prominently in our materiality assessment in 2013.
We believe that a healthy workforce and the security of knowing their immediate family are healthy are critical to the productivity and functioning of our mines.
As part of our sustainability policies, we provide free basic medical Access to services to employees, their immediate family and to community healthcare members within a 10km radius of each of our mines.
Our policy is to establish health clinics both on the mine and in nearby villages, with the aim of the latter being to transfer control to local authority over the medium-term.
In 2014, the community clinic in Kibali was transferred to the provincial authority.
In 2014, we operated seven clinics across our five mines and their communities.
This resulted in just over 100 000 medical consultations of which around 70% were for employees.
The total number of consultations is down slightly on last year, reflecting the contraction in the size of the workforce as a whole.
Randgold Resources Annual Report 2014 134 Importance to stakeholders The Loulo and Tongon clinics are two of seven across Randgolds operations which provide free basic healthcare to employees and the surrounding communities.
One of the biggest health issues of 2014 was the Ebola outbreak, which threatened West Africa and the DRC.
A full explanation of our approach to this crisis can be found earlier in this report see: Prepared for crises: Managing the Ebola risk and the appropriate policies and protocols will continue to be applied at all our sites throughout 2015.
As with all our health initiatives, we have sought to work with local partners whenever possible.
Some of the local NGOs that we worked with in 2014 included IDEAL Initiative Dveloppement Environnement Afrique Libre, BFED Bureau fide Formation et fide Conseil en Dveloppement and CSP Coalition of the Private sector in the fight against HIV AIDS.
We also helped with the distribution of medical equipment through North American partners CURE.

it is preventable and we are glad to report zero deaths from the disease among our host communities in 2014.
The total number of malaria cases across the group reduced from 8 102 in 2013, to 6 163 in 2014 a reduction We believe that the battle against the disease is one of of 24%.
This brought group level malaria incidence below our best investments.
Over 4 000 sick leave days were 50% for the first time, and puts incidence at all mines at recorded due to malaria in 2014 around 28% of total least 30% below the initial baselines set before the mine absenteeism and reducing these losses helps make started.

Our HIV AIDS HIV AIDS programme aims to help stop the spread of the disease by encouraging safe sex, raising awareness and promoting Voluntary Counselling and Testing VCTs.
The target for our HIV programme is no new infections among our employees.
In 2014, we spent over $27 000 on our HIV AIDS programme.
Among other measures, this helped to enable the distribution of over 161 000 condoms, funded mobile video education units in the communities and AIDS awareness month in December, and supported training for peer educators.
Our peer educators are members of the community, including employees and sex workers, who are trained in counselling about HIV such as heavy metal in the blood, silicosis, tuberculosis and communicating the risks and tend to have more and hearing issues and include biological and radiation resonance with their peers than others can.
