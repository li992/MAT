Strategic Report Strategy Risk overview What may challenge the delivery of our strategic priorities We face a diverse range of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect any one or more parts of our business and the delivery of our strategic priorities.
Our approach to risk management is designed to encourage clear decision making on which risks we take as a business and how we manage risk, informed by an understanding of the potential commercial, financial, compliance, legal and reputational implications.
We outline below the principal risks that could have a material adverse effect on the business or results of operations.
We also outline how these risks link to our strategic priorities and some of the risk management actions taken in response.
