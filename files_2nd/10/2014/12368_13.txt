The following analysis shows deferred tax A reconciliation between the reported amount of income tax expense attributable to loss before income tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 balances presented for financial reporting purposes: is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2014 2013 31 December 31 December US$000 US$000 2014 2013 US$000 US$000 Deferred tax liabilities 205,506 63,085 Loss before income tax 137,875 157,620 Deferred tax assets 61,787 88,484 Statutory income tax expense at the tax rate of 20% 27,575 31,524 143,719 25,399 Loss incurred in tax-free jurisdictions 75,444 8,309 Share-based compensation 375 4,720 Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by ZK Mayskoye LLC, Albazino Excess profit taxes payable in Kazakhstan 8,313 Resources LLC, Amursky Hydrometallurgy Plant LLC, Svetloye LLC and the JSC Polymetal during the period up to 2024.
Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes.
The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable Income tax provision in respect of Magadan Silver 6,865 income of other entities of the Group.
As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 the aggregate tax losses carried forward were Deferred tax asset provided for 3,627 US$371.4 million RUB 20.6 billion and US$426.8 million RUB 13.9 billion, respectively.
Adjustments recognised in the current year in relation to the current tax of prior years 2,016 15,210 The Group believes that recoverability of the recognised deferred tax asset DTA of US$74.2 million at 31 December 2014 is more likely than not Tax effect of non-deductible expenses and other permanent differences 15,245 35,389 based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and available tax planning strategies.
Total income tax expense 71,965 40,417 Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2014.
The Group has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable income in the carry-forward period.
The actual tax expense differs from the amount which would have been determined by applying the statutory rate of 20% for the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan to profit before income tax as a result of the application of relevant jurisdictional tax regulations, which disallow certain deductions The Groups estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be economically developed.
which are included in the determination of accounting profit.
These deductions include share-based payment expenses, social related expenditures and other non-production costs, certain general and administrative expenses, financing expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.
The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufficient supporting evidence that the Group will generate taxable earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios.
The amount of the DTA considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.
if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced due to delays in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve Out of the large operating companies of the Group, tax authorities have audited CJSC Gold of Northern Urals and CJSC Magadan Silver up to estimates, increases in environmental obligations, or reductions in precious metal prices.
The Groups tax losses carried forward expire as follows: 2012, Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC, LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company CJSC and Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC up to 2010, and JSC Varvarinskoye for the period up to 2010.
