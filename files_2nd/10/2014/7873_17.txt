Risk appetite is higher for new product introduction, acquisitions and major change projects in keeping with our growth strategy but lower for health, safety and environmental controls, regulatory compliance, cyber security and IT resilience.
Our risk appetite has been communicated to the Executive Management to ensure their decision making behaviour is consistent with the risk appetite set by the board.
