com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 145 Risk review Risk performance Credit risk The Groups approach to manage and represent credit quality Asset credit quality All loans and advances are categorised as either neither past due nor impaired, past due but not impaired, or past due and impaired, which includes restructured loans.
For the purposes of the disclosures in the balance sheet credit quality section below and the analysis of loans and advances and impairment section page 148 : A loan is considered past due when the borrower has failed to make a payment when due under the terms of the loan contract The impairment allowance includes allowances against financial assets that have been individually impaired and those subject to collective impairment Loans neither past due nor impaired consist predominantly of wholesale and retail loans that are performing.
These loans, although unimpaired, may carry an unidentified impairment Loans that are past due but not impaired consist predominantly of wholesale loans that are past due but individually assessed as not being impaired.
These loans, although individually assessed as unimpaired, may carry an unidentified impairment provision Impaired loans that are individually assessed consist predominantly of wholesale loans that are past due and for which an individual allowance has been raised Impaired loans that are collectively assessed consist predominantly of retail loans that are one day or more past due for which a collective allowance is raised.
Wholesale loans that are past due, individually assessed as unimpaired, but which carry an unidentified impairment provision, are excluded from this category.
Home loans and credit card receivables that are subject to forbearance in the retail portfolios are included in the collectively assessed impaired loans column in the tables in the analysis of loans and advances and impairment section page 148.
Included within wholesale loans that are designated as neither past due nor impaired is a portion of loans that have been subject to forbearance or similar strategies as part of the Groups ongoing relationship with clients.
The loans will have an internal rating reflective of the level of risk to which the Group is exposed, bearing in mind the circumstances of the forbearance, the overall performance and prospects of the client.
Loans on forbearance programmes will typically, but not always, attract a higher risk rating than similar loans which are not.
A portion of wholesale loans under forbearance is included in the past due but not impaired column, although not all loans subject to forbearance are necessarily impaired or past due.
Where wholesale loans under forbearance have been impaired, these form part of individually assessed impaired loans.
The Group uses the following internal measures to determine credit quality for loans that are performing: Retail lending Wholesale lending Probability of Probability of Credit Quality Default Grade default default Description 1-3 0.0-0.60% 0.0-0.05% Strong 4-5 0.05-0.15% 6-8 0.15-0.30% 9-11 0.30-0.60% 12-14 0.60-10.00% 0.60-2.15% Satisfactory 15-19 2.15-11.35% 20-21 10.00% 11.35% Higher Risk For loans that are performing, these descriptions can be summarised as follows: Strong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.
Satisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to retail facilities, such as credit card balances and unsecured loans, which have been classified as satisfactory, regardless of the fact that the output of internal grading models may have indicated a higher classification.
At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of some deterioration, mortgages with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.
Higher risk: there is concern over the obligors ability to make payments when due.
However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency.
There may also be doubts over value of collateral or security provided.
However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.
Loans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Groups impairment policies.
These loans are all considered higher risk for the purpose of this analysis of credit quality.
Debt securities For assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer.
Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies.
The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.
Balance sheet credit quality The following tables present the credit quality of Group assets exposed to credit risk.
Overview As at 31 December 2014, the ratio of the Groups assets classified as strong improved to 84% 2013: 83% of total assets exposed to credit risk.
Traded assets remained mostly investment grade with the following proportions being categorised as strong: 94% 2013: 95% of total derivative financial instruments, 91% 2013: 95% of debt securities held for trading and 98% 2013: 96% of debt securities held as available for sale.
The credit quality of counterparties to reverse repurchase agreements held at amortised cost remained broadly stable at 78% 2013: 76%.
The credit risk of these assets is significantly reduced as balances are largely collateralised.

The credit quality profile of the Groups wholesale lending improved with counterparties rated strong increasing to 72% 2013: 70%, primarily due to increases in collateral balances generally rated strong in the Investment Bank.

CRLs decreased 4.0bn to 9.3bn primarily due to a reduction within Non-Core of 3.2bn to 2.1bn as a result of the reclassification of Spanish loans now held for sale and a write-off of a single name exposure.
Loan impairment charges improved 28% to 2.2bn due to the non-recurrence of impairments on single name exposures, impairment releases on the wholesale portfolio as a result of confirmation on Government subsidies in the renewable energy sector and improved performance in Europe, primarily due to improved recoveries and delinquencies in the mortgages portfolio.
This led to a decrease in the loan loss rate to 46bps 2013: 64bps.

The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.
The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged.
Further detail on the Groups policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented on page 190.
Geographic concentrations As at 31 December 2014, the geographic concentration of the Groups assets remained broadly consistent with 2013.
For balance sheet assets, the most significant change in concentrations was for cash held at central banks.
A significant reduction in Europe was noted, primarily with the European Central Bank, following the change in composition of the liquidity pool with the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve.
Balances in the UK and US contributed a higher proportion of the total as a result.
Overall reverse repurchase agreements have decreased due to reduced matched book trading and a focus on reducing the leveraged balance sheet.
This is reflected in balances within the Americas, UK and Europe.

Risks associated with a potential partial break-up of the European Union EU include: Direct risk arising from sovereign default of a country exiting the EU and the impact on the economy of, and the Groups counterparties in, that country: Indirect risk arising from the subsequent impact on the economy of, and the Groups counterparties in, other Eurozone countries: and Indirect risk arising from credit derivatives that reference Eurozone sovereign debt see page 154.
Contingency planning began in early 2012 based on a series of potential scenarios that might arise from an escalation in the crisis.
Multiple tests have subsequently been run to establish the impact on customers, systems, processes and staff in the event of the most plausible scenarios.
Where issues have been identified, appropriate remedial actions have been completed.
As a consequence of renewed concerns over a potential Greek exit from the Eurozone, these contingency plans have been reviewed and refreshed to ensure they remain effective.
Whilst the Groups net exposure to Greece is low, a risk of contagion spreading to other EU countries is evident and plans are in place for such a scenario.
During 2014, the Groups net on-balance sheet exposures to Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus and Greece reduced by 18% to 43bn.
This primarily reflects a reduction of 17% in exposures to Spain, Italy and Portugal as part of the Non-Core strategy.
During 2014, the net funding mismatch decreased 1.7bn to 9.9bn in Italy and decreased 1.1bn to 1.9bn in Portugal.
The surplus in Spain increased 1.2bn to 4.3bn.
For Ireland there is no local balance sheet funding requirement by the Group as total liabilities in this country exceeds assets.
Net exposure to Greece was 27m 2013: 85m with negligible net funding required from Group.
On a gross basis exposure to Greece was 1,279m 2013: 906m consisting of derivative assets with financial institutions.
The exposure is mitigated by offsetting derivative liabilities and cash collateral.
Other emerging risks being monitored outside the Eurozone include Russia and China.
Net exposure to Russia of 1,943m largely consists of loans and advances to financial institutions of 1,076m.
Gross exposure to Russia was 3,776m including derivative assets with financial institutions.
The gross exposure is mitigated by offsetting derivative liabilities Net exposure to China of 4,831m largely consists of loans and advances mainly cash collateral and settlement balances to sovereign 1,664m and financial institutions 1,388m.
The gross exposure to China excluding offsetting derivative liabilities was 4,999m.
Basis of preparation The Group presents the direct balance sheet exposure to credit and market risk by country, with the totals reflecting allowance for impairment, netting and cash collateral held where appropriate.
Trading and derivatives balances relate to Investment Bank activities, principally as market-maker for government bond positions.
Positions are held at fair value, with daily movements taken through profit and loss: Trading assets and liabilities are presented by issuer type, whereby positions are netted to the extent allowable under IFRS.
Where liability positions exceed asset positions by counterparty type, exposures are presented as nil Derivative assets and liabilities are presented by counterparty type, whereby positions are netted to the extent allowable under IFRS.
Cash collateral held is then added to give a net credit exposure.
Where liability positions and collateral held exceed asset positions by counterparty type, exposures are presented as nil Assets designated at fair value include debt and equity securities, loans and reverse repurchase agreements that have been designated at fair value.

Summary of Group Exposures The following table shows the Groups exposure to Eurozone countries monitored internally as being higher risk and thus being the subject of c particular management focus.
Detailed analysis on these countries is on pages 151 to 154.
The net exposure provides the most appropriate measure of the credit risk to which the Group is exposed.
The gross exposure is also presented below, alongside off-balance sheet contingent liabilities and commitments.
Gross exposure reflects total exposures before the effects of economic hedging by way of trading portfolio liabilities, derivative liabilities and cash collateral, but after taking into account impairment allowances and IFRS netting.
b In addition, the Group held cash with the central banks of these countries totalling 0.2bn 2013: 0.2bn.
Other material balances with central banks are classified within loans to financial institutions.
c Detailed analysis is not provided for Ireland as there is no redenomination risk due to local funding and due to significant risk relating to the underlying assets residing in an alternative country.
The exposures for Cyprus and Greece are deemed immaterial to the Group.

Analysis of indirect exposures Indirect exposure to sovereigns can arise through a number of different sources, including credit derivatives referencing sovereign debt: guarantees to savings and investment funds which hold sovereign risk: lending to financial institutions who themselves hold exposure to sovereigns and guarantees, implicit or explicit, by the sovereign to the Groups counterparties.
A geographic and industrial analysis of the Groups loans and advances, including lending to European counterparties by type, is set out on pages 149 to 156.

The proportion of the overall balance concentrated towards governments and central banks remained stable at 11% 2013: 12% and towards home loans at 12% 2013: 13%.
com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Analysis of specific portfolios and asset types This section provides an analysis of principal portfolios and businesses in the retail and wholesale segments.
In particular, home loans, credit cards, overdrafts and unsecured loans are covered for retail segments while exposures in Investment Bank and PCB including watch-list analysis are covered for wholesale segments.
In general, improved economic conditions in the UK and US aided better performance in 2014.
While, European portfolios continued to show signs of stability, they remain susceptible to adverse market pressures.
South African portfolios were resilient despite challenging market conditions with contracting economic growth.
Following an enhancement to the retail methodology in 2014, management adjustments to impairment allowances have now been aligned to the appropriate segments of a portfolio rather than a segment.
As a result, the coverage ratio for the single segment would be higher in 2013 than 2014.
The reverse would apply to segments to which management adjustments have now been allocated in 2014.
There has been no impact on the overall impairment coverage at a portfolio level.
This applies, in particular, to secured home loans and credits cards.
Secured home loans Total home loans to retail customers of 161bn 2013: 173bn represented 72% 2013: 73% of the Groups total retail balances.
The reduction in balances was principally due to the classification of Spain assets as held for sale 2013 home loans: 13bn.

Arrears and charge-off rates improved reflecting the continuing low base rate and improved economic conditions.
Balance weighted LTV reduced to 51.6% 2013: 56.3% due to an increase in average house prices, which was particularly marked in London and the south east.
The house price increase resulted in a 60% reduction in home loans that have LTV 100% to 641m 2013: 1,596m.
Within the UK home loans portfolio: Owner-occupied interest-only home loans comprised 33% 2013: 36% of total balances.
The average balance weighted LTV on these loans reduced to 48.7% 2013: 54.2%, and 90 day arrears reduced to 0.1% 2013: 0.3% : and Buy-to-let home loans comprised 8% 2013: 8% of total balances.
The average balance weighted LTV reduced to 57.6% 2013: 62.9%, and 90 day arrears remained broadly steady at 0.1% 2013: 0.1%.
The recoveries impairment coverage reduced to 8.3% 2013: 14.7%.
In 2014, management adjustments to impairment allowances were better aligned to appropriate segments of the portfolio, resulting in a reduction of the impairment allocated to the recoveries book.
The overall impairment coverage of the total home loans portfolio remained unchanged.
Africa South Africa: Gross loans and advances reduced by 5% as inflow of new business was outweighed by the paydown on the existing book.
The improvement in the charge-off rates to 1.9% 2013: 2.6% was due to the continued strong performance of new lending as well as focused collections strategies that led to the reduction of the recoveries book.
Balances with 100% LTV reduced 28% to 390m, primarily due to a reduction in the size of the recoveries book.
BNC Italy: Gross loans and advances reduced by 11% reflecting the amortisation of the existing portfolio, depreciation of local currency, and reduced new business flows.
The impact of a reduction in the average house price was offset by paydown of the existing book, and the average balance weighted LTV remained steady at 60.0%.
The proportion of home loans in recoveries increased to 3.0% 2013: 2.4%.
This was due to the lengthy local legal process and difficult property market conditions.
New bookings rose by 19% to 20.3bn, which was broadly in line with the growth in the industry.
South Africa: The proportion of new home loans above 85% LTV increased to 33.5% 2013: 30.4% due to a revised strategy for existing bank customers which allows a greater proportion of higher LTV loans to be booked for low risk customers.
Italy: New bookings reduced by over 70% to 137m, which was reflective of the Groups continuing cautious lending practices in this region.
Exposures to interest-only home loans The Group provides interest-only mortgages to customers, mainly in the UK.
Under the terms of these loans, the customer makes payments of interest only for the entire term of the mortgage, although customers may make early repayments of the principal within the terms of their agreement.
Subject to such early repayments, the entire principal remains outstanding until the end of the loan term and the customer is responsible for repaying this on maturity.
The repayment may also be a result of the sale of the mortgaged property.
Interest-only lending is subject to bespoke underwriting criteria that includes: a maximum size of loan, maximum LTV ratios, affordability and maximum loan term among other criteria.
Borrowers on interest-only terms must have a repayment strategy in place to repay the loan at maturity and a customer contact strategy has been developed to ensure ongoing communications are in place with interest-only customers at various points during the term of the mortgage.
The contact strategy is varied dependent on our view of the risk of the customer.
Interest-only mortgages account for 51bn 2013: 53bn of the total balance of 127bn 2013: 123bn of the UK home loans portfolio and consist of 42bn 2013: 45bn to owner-occupied customers and 9bn 2013: 8bn to buy-to-let customers.
Interest-only mortgages to owner occupied customers comprise 35bn 2013: 37bn of interest-only mortgages and 7bn 2013: 7bn being d the interest-only component of part and part P&P mortgages.
Notes a Portfolio marked to market based on the most updated valuation including recoveries balances.
Updated valuations reflect the application of the latest house price index available in the country as at 31 December 2014. b Valuation weighted LTV for Italy home loans for 2013 was restated to include the recovery balances in line with other home loan disclosures.
c 2013 new bookings for South Africa home loans was revised to fully include new advances to existing customers.
d Analysis excludes the interest only portion of the part and part book which contributes 6.6bn 2013: 7.3bn to the total interest-only balance of 41.9bn 2013: 44.5bn.
Total exposure on the part and part book is 9.8bn 2013: 11bn and represents 7% of total UK home loans portfolio.

Exposures to mortgage current accounts MCA reserves The MCA reserve is a secured overdraft facility previously available to home loan customers in the UK on either a fully amortising or interest-only mortgage loan, which allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home.
It permits draw-down up to an agreed available limit on a separate but connected account to the main mortgage loan facility.
The balance drawn must be repaid on redemption of the mortgage.
Of the total 944k home loan customers in the UK, 505k have MCA reserves, with total reserve limits of 17.9bn 2013: 18.3bn.

The 14% decrease in balances to 62.2bn was due to reductions in the main mortgage account following a withdrawal of the product from sale in December 2012.
The rate of reduction was consistent with the previous year.
Utilisation was broadly steady at 32.3% 2013: 31.9%, while the average balance weighted LTV reduced to 47.7% 2013: 53.9% due to an increase in average house prices and paydown of the main mortgage loan.
Although the product has been withdrawn from sale, existing customers can continue to draw against their available reserves.

Recovery balances increased due to a reduction in debt sale activity.
US cards: Gross loans and advances increased by 36% to 14.0bn due to the combined impact of new account volumes and portfolio acquisitions.
Arrears rates remain stable at 2.1% and 1.0% for 30 days and 90 days, respectively, driven by a strategy focused on high quality customers and low risk partnerships.
Barclays Partner Finance: Gross loans and advances increased by 23% to 3.4bn driven by growth in the motor lending portfolio.
Reduction in recoveries coverage to 76.8% 2013: 83.2% was due to the adoption of an improved loss given default model.
UK personal loans: Arrears and charge-off rates reduced over the year, as a result of the improved economic conditions and previous changes to credit criteria that have taken full effect.
The recoveries proportion reduced to 10.0% 2013: 15.8% as the write-off policy was fully embedded in 2014.
Iberia cards: Arrears rates remained stable while charge-off rates improved as performance stabilised following the completion of system migration that initially impacted direct debit processing.
Balances in recovery decreased to 6.3% of outstandings 2013: 9.9% driven by debt sale activity.
South Africa cards: Recoveries coverage increased to 75.7% 2013: 70.7%, in part due to a change in the mix of the recoveries book in store cards which have higher associated losses.
Notes a For UK and US cards, outstanding recoveries balances for acquired portfolios recognised at fair value which have no related impairment allowance have been excluded from the recoveries impairment coverage ratio.
Losses have been recognised where related to additional spend from acquired accounts in the period post acquisition.
b US cards risk metrics exclude the impact of a 440m portfolio acquisition made in April 2014.

Analysis of Wholesale balances on watch list early warning list Wholesale accounts that are deemed to contain heightened levels of risk are recorded on graded watch lists Investment Bank or early warning lists all other businesses comprising three categories graded in line with the perceived severity of the risk attached to the lending, and its probability of default: Category 1: a temporary classification for performing obligors who exhibit some unsatisfactory features: Category 2: performing obligors where some doubt exists, but the belief is that the obligor can meet obligations over the short term: and Category 3: obligors where definite concern exists with well-defined weaknesses and failure in the short term could arise should further deterioration occur.
In the table below Category 3 includes impaired, non-performing and potential problem assets in line with how balances are managed and reported by the businesses.
Where an obligors financial health gives grounds for concern, it is immediately placed into the appropriate category.

Forbearance Balances on forbearance programmes reduced 23% to 6.4bn driven primarily by i fewer customers requiring forbearance as macroeconomic conditions improved: and ii the ongoing impact of enhanced qualification criteria.
The decrease in impairment coverage to 16.8% 2013: 17.6% was due to a reduction in the coverage on the wholesale portfolios partially offset by an increase to retail portfolios.
Wholesale forbearance reduced by 27% to 2.5bn primarily driven by the exit of a single Investment Bank counterparty from the forbearance portfolio and further reductions across the BNC portfolios.
The reduction in impairment coverage to 20.7% 2013: 26.3% was primarily due to the exit of higher coverage Non-Core cases in Spain.
The reduction in 2014 to balances on forbearance in BNC principally reflects the fact that Spain assets were reclassified as held for sale during the year.

PCB UK home loans : Balances under forbearance decreased 22% to 1,842m, principally due to a reduction in the proportion of accounts meeting the MCA reserve forbearance classification criteria.
This type of forbearance comprises 68% 2013: 70% of the total, with term extensions comprising a further 17% 2013: 17%.
Total past due balances reduced 29% to 355m due to the improved economic environment.
Africa South Africa home loans : Reduction in forbearance balances to 207m 2013: 248m is due to enhanced qualification criteria which resulted in a more appropriate and sustainable programme for the customer, and local currency depreciation.
Barclays Non-Core Italy home loans : Forbearance balances decreased 9% to 279m, predominantly due to customers exiting forbearance schemes that were established by the government.
Impairment coverage increased to 3.9% 2013: 3.2%, reflecting a higher proportion of accounts on forbearance that are more than 90 days past due.
Forbearance balances on principal credit cards, overdrafts and unsecured loan portfolios decreased by 19% to 943m.
UK Cards: Forbearance balances decreased by 21% to 724m, driven by the continued reduction in new repayment plan volumes caused by the implementation of enhanced qualification criteria in 2012.

See pages 139 to 144 in Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report for more detail on management measures and the differences when compared to regulatory measures.
The table below shows the total Group management VaR by asset class, as well as the impact of diversification.
The majority of VaR arises out of the Investment Bank.
Additional limited trading activity is undertaken in Africa Banking on behalf of clients.
VaR also arises in Treasury in relation to certain products mainly for hedging and liquidity purposes.
Finally, certain legacy positions in BNC attract VaR.
Limits are applied against each asset class VaR as well as total management VaR, which are then cascaded further by risk managers to each business.
The management VaR numbers in the table below include add-ons, to better represent the market risk where the VaR model may not fully represent some risk factors.
See page 144 in Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report for a description of risks not in VaR RNIVs.
Note a The primary risk factors for banking book assets and liabilities are interest rates and to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rates.
Credit spreads and equity prices will also be a factor where the Group holds debt and equity securities respectively, either as financial assets designated at fair value see Note 14 or as available for sale see Note 16.

The three main contributors to average management VaR were credit, interest rate and equity risk.
Average credit risk VaR decreased 39% to 11m reflecting lower volatility driven by low credit spreads.
Spread risk and Basis risk VaR decreased in part due to lower interest rates environment.
Average commodities VaR declined 60% to 2m primarily as a result of risk reduction in Non-Core businesses.
Average Equity VaR was broadly stable compared to the previous year and also saw an environment of low volatility for most of the year.
Average Foreign Exchange VaR was broadly stable over the year, but saw a peak of 23m in late December 2014 due to an increase in positions that were held for a brief period of time.
Foreign Exchange VaR fell back before the year-end when the positions were closed out.
See also the Group management VaR graph below.
The business remained within the management VaR limits that were reported to the Board Financial Risk Committee BFRC throughout 2014 for both asset class VaR and total VaR.
For 2014, this includes daily trading revenue generated in the Investment Bank except for Private Equity and Principal Investments, Treasury, Africa Banking and Non-Core.
The BNC business does not undertake trading activities other than strategic disposals.
Please see page 241 for a discussion of BNC financial performance in 2014.
Daily trading revenue includes realised and unrealised mark to market gains and losses from intraday market moves, commission and advisory fees.
The VaR measure above is not designed to be reconciled to the full revenue measure from the trading business.
VaR shows the volatility of a hypothetical measure that reflects unrealised mark to market changes in positions under the assumption that they are held over a one-day period.
VaR informs risk managers on the risk implications of current portfolio decisions.
The average daily revenue decreased 22% to 32m: however, there were more positive trading revenue days in 2014 than in 2013, with 98% 2013: 97% of days generating positive trading revenue.
The chart shows lower variability in daily income levels, which appears consistent with the decrease in average management VaR and lower market volatility.
The daily VaR chart illustrates a declining trend in 2014.
The rise in late December 2014 was associated with an increase in positions in a specific market that were held for a brief period of time.
VaR fell back when the positions were closed out.
See the discussion of VaR by asset class on the previous page.
Note a Diversification effects recognise that forecast losses from different assets or businesses are unlikely to occur concurrently, hence the expected aggregate loss is lower than the sum of the expected losses from each area.
Historic correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments.
The high and low VaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole.
Consequently a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.

Note, however, that due to differences in data sets for market risk and IFRS reporting some assets that do not generate market risk could be included.
The Other assets line contains i business lines that are primarily defined as banking book, and ii line items that should not generate market risk.

Market risks arising from the individual portfolios listed above diversify to provide total management VaR for the Investment Bank, Non-Core and Head Office.
Some functions such as Treasury and Client Capital Management show exposure as a result of the service it provides to the client facing franchise, such as managing the firms exposure to counterparty default or providing funding to execute business.
Business Scenario Stresses As part of the Groups risk management framework, on a regular basis the performance of the trading business in hypothetical scenarios characterised by severe macroeconomic conditions is modelled.
Up to six global scenarios are modelled on a regular basis, for example, a sharp deterioration in liquidity, a slowdown in the global economy, terrorist attacks, global recession and a sovereign peripheral crisis.
Similarly to 2013, throughout 2014, the scenario analyses showed the biggest market risk related impact would be due to a severe deterioration in liquidity and a rapid slowdown in the global economy.
Review of regulatory measures The following disclosures provide details on regulatory measures of market risk.
See pages 141 and 145 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report for more detail on regulatory measures and the differences when compared to management measures.
The Groups market risk capital requirements comprise two elements: Trading book positions booked to legal entities within the scope of the Groups PRA waiver where the market risk is measured under a PRA approved internal models approach, including regulatory VaR, Stressed Value at Risk SVaR, Incremental Risk Charge IRC and All Price Risk APR as required: and Trading book positions that do not meet the conditions for inclusion within the approved Internal Models Approach.
Their capital requirement is calculated using standardised rules.
The below table summarises the regulatory market risk measures, under the internal models approach.
See table Minimum capital requirement for market risk in Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report for a breakdown of capital requirements by approach.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 179 Risk review Risk performance Market risk Non-traded market risk Net interest income sensitivity The table below shows sensitivity analysis on the pre-tax net interest income for the non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities.
The sensitivity has been measured using the Annual Earnings at Risk AEaR methodology as described on page 145 in Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report.
The benchmark interest rate for each currency is set as at 31 December of the same year.
The effect of structural hedging is taken into account.
The tables below show that net interest income would increase given a rise in rates: however, this analysis does not include the potential impacts on the impairment charge due to the effect of interest rates on affordability.
This effect would depend on the wider economic environment and have the opposite effect on total profit.
Banking book exposures held or issued by the Investment Bank are excluded from the interest rate sensitivity tables as these are measured and managed using VaR.
This was predominantly due to an increase in PCB account balances for which a structural hedge is in place.
AEaR to the -200bp shock increased to 380m 2013: 293m predominantly due to the inclusion of re-pricing lag risk in the PCB model.
This is the risk of being unable to re-price products immediately after a change in rates due to mandatory notification periods.

Barclays measure some non-traded market risks using an economic capital EC methodology.
EC is predominantly calculated using a daily VaR model and then scaled up to a 1 year EC confidence interval 99.98%.
For more information on definitions of prepayment, recruitment and residual risk, and on how EC is used to manage market risk, see the market risk management section on page 145 in Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report.
The table on the next page shows the EC figures for the main non-trading businesses, where non-traded market risk EC is part of the business limit framework.
Notes a Only retail exposures within BNC are included in the calculation.
b Other consists of Treasury and adjustments made for hedge ineffectiveness.
The hedge ineffectiveness accounts for the portion of the movements in hedging instruments that cannot be deferred from the income statements to the hedge reserves.
This arises where the movement in the hedging instrument exceeds the movement of the hedged item in absolute terms.

Analysis of equity sensitivity The table below measures the overall impact of a - 100bps movement in interest rates on available for sale and cash flow hedge reserves.
This data is captured using PV01 which is an indicator of the shift in asset value for a 1 basis point shift in the yield curve.

The movement in the AFS reserve shows lower sensitivity in 2014 due to the disposal of large debt security positions in Treasury.
Note that the movement in the AFS reserve would impact CRD IV fully loaded CET1 capital, but the movement in the cash flow hedge reserve would not impact CET1 capital.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk: i Transactional foreign currency exposure Transactional foreign exchange exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity.
The Groups risk management policies prevent the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside the trading portfolio managed by the Investment Bank which is monitored through DVaR.
Banking book transactional foreign exchange risk outside of the Investment Bank is monitored on a daily basis by the market risk functions and minimised by the businesses.
ii Translational foreign exchange exposure The Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies principally US Dollar, Euro and South African Rand.
Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.
The Groups strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by using the CET1 capital movements to broadly match the revaluation of the Groups foreign currency RWA exposures.
The economic hedges primarily represent the US Dollar and Euro preference shares and Additional Tier 1 instruments that are held as equity, accounted for at historic cost under IFRS and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.
Note a Only the retail exposures within Non-Core are captured in the measure.

Foreign currency net investments decreased by 16.9bn to 33.8bn 2013: 50.7bn driven predominantly by the restructuring of Group subsidiaries.
The hedges associated with these investments decreased by 16.9bn to 2.8bn 2013: 19.7bn.
Pension risk review The UK Retirement Fund UKRF represents approximately 92% 2013: 91% of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations globally.
The other material overseas schemes are in South Africa and the US where they represent approximately 4% 2013: 5% and 2% 2013: 2% respectively of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
As such, this risk review section will focus exclusively on the UKRF.
Note that the scheme is closed to new entrants.
Pension risk arises as the estimated market value of the pension fund assets might decline, or the investment returns might reduce: or the estimated value of the pension liabilities might increase.
See page 146 in the 2014 Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report for more information on how pension risk is managed.
Assets The Board of Trustees defines an overall long-term investment strategy for the UKRF, with investments across a broad range of asset classes.
This ensures an appropriate mix of return-seeking assets to generate future returns as well as liability matching assets to better match the future pension obligations.
The main market risks within the asset portfolio are against interest rates and equities.
Fair value of UKRF plan assets increased by 14% to 26.9bn.
See Note 35 on page 323 for details.
Liabilities The retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19 basis these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term inflation rate and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve : An increase in long-term inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities: and An increase in the discount rate corresponds to a decrease in liabilities.
Pension risk is generated through the Groups defined benefits schemes and this risk is deemed to move to zero over time as the chart below shows.
The chart below outline the shape of the liability cash flow profile, that takes account of future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries, with the majority of the cash flows approximately 75% falling between 0 and 40 years, peaking within the 21 to 30 year band and reducing thereafter.
The shape may vary depending on changes in inflation expectation and mortality and it is updated in line with triennial valuation process.
For more detail on liability assumptions see Note 35 on page 323.

This ensures that the risks, diversification benefits and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations and investments are adequately captured.
VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis at the pension risk fora such as the Market Risk Committee, Pension Management Group and Pensions Executive Board.
The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities based on an IAS 19 basis see Note 35 to the financial statements.
The trustees, receive quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.
The pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions.
See Note 35 to the financial statements for more details.
In addition to this, the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process.
Stress testing is performed internally at least on an annual basis, covering scenarios such as European economic crisis and quantitative easing.
The UKRF exposure is also included as part of the regulatory stress tests and exercises indicated that the UKRF risk profile is resilient to severe stress events.
The defined benefit pension scheme affects capital in two ways.
The IAS 19 deficit impacts the CET1 capital ratio.
Pension risk is also taken into account in the Pillar 2 capital assessment.
Triennial valuation Please see Note 35 to the financial statements for information on the current position of the fund.
Insurance risk review Insurance risk is managed within Africa Banking.
From an economic capital perspective, four significant categories of insurance risk are reported.
Please see page 146 in Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report for definitions and governance procedures.
The risk figures are based on economic capital principles and refer to 1 in 250 event levels.
The underwriting risk appetite for short term insurance for 2014 was calculated based on the projected net written premium.
See page 146 in Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report for a description of the risks and a discussion of their measurement.
The year-on-year utilisation as a percentage of approved appetite remained relatively stable, except for life insurance mismatch risk which is explained below.

Material movements in CET1 capital included: A 1.2bn decrease recognised for dividends paid and foreseen: A 0.6bn increase due to movements in the currency translation reserve primarily driven by the strengthening of USD against GBP: A 0.4bn increase due to gains in the available for sale reserve: and A 0.6bn increase due to lower regulatory adjustments and deductions, with decreased deductions of 0.5bn for holdings of own CET1 instruments, 0.3bn for expected loss over impairments and 0.3bn for PVA, partially offset by a 0.5bn increase in the deduction for goodwill and intangible assets.
The reduction in PVA results principally from the 0.9bn adjustment to the balance sheet valuation of the ESHLA portfolio at year end, which reduces the PVA relating to that portfolio.
Transitional total capital decreased by 0.1bn to 66.3bn largely due to capital redemptions in the period of 1bn non-cumulative callable preference shares and 1bn of callable fixed floating rate subordinated notes T2 capital.
These decreases were partially offset by the increase in fully loaded CET1 capital and a T2 capital issuance of $1.25bn of fixed rate subordinated notes.
The sale of the Spanish business, completed on 2 January 2015, would decrease RWAs further by 5.0bn: Book quality decreased 5.3bn due to improvements in underlying Investment Bank and PCB exposure risk profiles: Model updates increased 11.9bn, primarily driven by the implementation of a revised credit risk model for assessing the probability of counterparty default: Methodology and policy decreased 12.9bn due to regulatory changes to the treatment of high quality liquid assets: and Foreign exchange movements decreased 1.5bn due to the depreciation of ZAR and EUR against GBP, partially offset by the appreciation of USD against GBP.

The European Commission is implementing the amendments into the CRR via a delegated act which came into force from January 2015.
Barclays does not believe that there is a material difference between the BCBS 270 leverage ratio and a leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the delegated act.

SFTs decreased 35bn to 157bn driven by a 26bn reduction in IFRS reverse repurchase agreements and 9bn in SFT adjustments reflecting deleveraging in BNC and a seasonal reduction in trading volumes.
a Total derivative exposures decreased 8bn due to a 16bn reduction in the potential future exposure PFE, partially offset by an increase in IFRS derivatives and cash collateral.
PFE on derivatives decreased 16bn to 179bn mainly due to reductions in business activity and optimisations, including trade compressions and tear ups.
This was partially offset by an increase relating to sold options driven by a change to the basis of calculation.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 189 Risk review Risk performance Funding risk Capital Economic Capital EC and its use as part of the ICAAP assessment Pillar 2 RWAs are measured based on generic regulatory capital rules that assume all financial institutions have a well diversified portfolio.
An alternative approach to measure capital risk is to use an EC calculation approach that takes into consideration firm specific concentrations e. g. sector, geography, single name, risk exposures and portfolio correlations.
EC is an internal measure of the risk profile of the bank expressed as the estimated stress loss at a 99.98% confidence level.
The Group assesses capital requirements by measuring the Groups risk profile using internally developed models.
The Group assigns EC primarily within the following risk categories: credit risk, market risk, operational risk, fixed asset risk mainly property and pension risk.
The Group regularly reviews its EC methodology and benchmarks outputs to external reference points.
The framework uses default probabilities during average credit conditions, rather than those prevailing at the balance sheet date, thus seeking to remove cyclicality from the EC calculation.
The EC framework takes into consideration time horizon, correlation of risks and risk concentrations.
EC is allocated on a consistent basis across all businesses and risk activities.
UK Firms, as part of Pillar 2 framework, are required to update annually the firms Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The information provided by the Group within the ICAAP is used by the PRA BoE to support the regulator capital solvency review.
Requirements for local ICAAPs also exist in a number of jurisdictions in which the Group operates e. g. South Africa.
The Group ICAAP is used to assess Groupwide capital adequacy to cover for all risks to which the Group is exposed.
As part of the Group ICAAP, and in line with PRA BoE rules, the internal measure of Capital EC is used to support the Groups assessment of the appropriateness of capital allocated to each risk type.
EC is also used to assess capital adequacy of a number of subsidiaries as part of Local ICAAPs.
Key risks considered as part of the Group and local ICAAPs are: Pillar 1 risks i. e. Credit, Market and Operational risk : for which capital requirements are primarily based on the Regulatory Capital framework IRB and Standardised approaches and calculated in line with PRA rules set out in GENPRU BIPRU.
Regulatory Capital requirements are then benchmarked against our EC calculations as part of the Groups ICAAP assessment.
Non-Pillar 1 risks: for which we have bespoke approaches that are mainly included in the EC framework.
Main non-Pillar 1 risks: Pension risk: the Group does not have ownership of the investments within the pension fund but rather works with the Trustees dedicated investment team to ensure that the risk profile is appropriate and within risk appetite.
Concentration risk e. g. single name, industry, geography : managed and monitored as part of BAU, mainly through Group risk appetite framework, policy setting, monitoring, stress testing and EC framework.
For EC purposes concentration risk is accounted for within each relevant risk type mainly as part of the Wholesale Credit Risk EC calculation Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book IRRBB : also called Non-traded interest rate risk included as part of Market Risk in charts below.
The Groups objective is to minimise non-traded interest rate risk and this is achieved by transferring IRRBB from the business to Group Treasury, which in turn hedges the net exposure via the Investment Bank with the external market.

This is the level of liquidity risk the secure such resources only at excessive cost.
This also Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations.
The key expression of the liquidity results in a firms inability to meet regulatory liquidity risk is through internal stress tests.
It is measured with reference to the requirements.
This risk is inherent in all banking liquidity pool compared to anticipated stressed net contractual and operations and can be affected by a range of Groupcontingent outflows for each of three stress scenarios.
Liquidity Risk Appetite As part of the LRA, the Group runs three primary liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the PRAs prescribed stresses: All disclosures in this section pages 192 to 208 are unaudited and exclude BAGL unless otherwise stated A 90-day market-wide stress event: A 30-day Barclays-specific stress event: and Overview A combined 30-day market-wide and Barclays-specific stress event.

Summary of performance in the period During 2014, the Group strengthened its liquidity position, building a larger surplus to its Liquidity Risk Appetite.
This positions the Group well for potential rating changes as credit rating agencies assess sovereign support in Barclays Bank PLCs credit ratings.
This resulted in an increase in the Group liquidity pool to 149bn 2013: 127bn.
The estimated CRD IV Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR increased to 124% 2013: 96%, equivalent to a surplus of 30bn 2013: shortfall of 6bn.
The Group funding profile remains stable and well diversified.
Wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 171bn 2013: 186bn.
The Group was active in wholesale unsecured, secured and debt capital markets, issuing 15bn 2013: 1bn net of early redemptions.

The PRA defines both eligible liquidity pool assets and stress outflows against reported balances.
The Group also monitors its position against the CRD IV Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and the Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR.
The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a banks liquidity risk profile by ensuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days.
The NSFR has a time horizon of at least six months and has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
In October 2014, the European Commission published a final Delegated Act for the LCR under the European CRD IV regime.
The CRD IV requires phased compliance with the LCR standard from 1 October 2015 at a minimum of 60% increasing to 100% by January 2018.
The methodology for estimating the LCR is based off the final published Delegated Act which becomes EU law in October 2015.
The PRA released a consultation paper in November 2014 setting out the proposed new regime, requiring 80% compliance with the LCR standard from 1 October 2015.
In October 2014, the BCBS published a final standard for the NSFR with the minimum requirement to be introduced in January 2018 at 100%.
The methodology for calculating the NSFR is based on an interpretation of the Basel standards published in October 2014 and includes a number of assumptions which are subject to change prior to adoption by the European Commission through the CRD IV.
Based on the CRD IV and Basel III standards respectively, as at 31 December 2014, the Group had a surplus to both of these metrics with an estimated CRD IV LCR of 124% 2013: 96% and an estimated Basel III NSFR of 102% 2013: 94%.

The maintenance of the liquidity pool increases the Groups costs as the interest expense paid on the liabilities used to fund the liquidity pool is greater than the interest income received on liquidity pool assets.
This cost can be reduced by investing a greater portion of the Group liquidity pool in highly liquid assets other than cash and deposits with central banks.
These assets primarily comprise highly rated government bonds, and their inclusion in the liquidity pool does not compromise the liquidity position of the Group.
The composition of the liquidity pool is subject to limits set by the Board, Treasury Committee and the independent credit risk and market risk functions.
In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency, asset type and country.
Given the incremental returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.
The Group manages the liquidity pool on a centralised basis.
As at 31 December 2014, 92% of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC 2013: 90% and was available to meet liquidity needs across the Group.
The residual liquidity pool is held predominantly within Barclays Capital Inc. BCI.
The portion of the liquidity pool outside of Barclays Bank PLC is held against entity-specific stressed outflows and regulatory requirements.
To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group.
Notes a 122bn of the liquidity pool is PRA eligible as per BIPRU 12.7.
In addition, there are 12bn of Level 2 assets available, as per PRAs announcement in August 2013 that certain assets specified by PRA as Level 2 assets can be used on a transitional basis.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 195 Risk review Risk performance Funding risk Liquidity Contingent liquidity In addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
In either a Barclays-specific or market-wide liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted.
In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at heavily discounted prices, the Group could generate liquidity via central bank facilities.
The Group maintains a significant amount of collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available to raise funding.
For more detail on the Groups other unencumbered assets see page 200.
Funding structure and funding relationships The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a solid funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due.
The Groups overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base both geographically and by type and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.
Within this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding.
As such, retail and commercial customer loans and advances are largely funded by customer deposits, with the surplus funding the liquidity pool.
Other assets, together with other loans and advances, and unencumbered assets are funded by long-term wholesale debt and equity.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements.
The liquidity pool is predominantly funded through wholesale markets.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information PCB, Barclaycard, Non-Core retail and Africa Banking activities are largely funded with customer deposits.
As at 31 December 2014, the loan to deposit ratio for these businesses was 89% 2013: 91%.
The Group loan to deposit ratio as at 31 December 2014 was 100% 2013: 101%.
The excess of the Investment Banks loans and advances over customer deposits is funded with long-term debt and equity.
The Investment Bank does not rely on customer deposit funding from PCB.
As at 31 December 2014, 128bn 2013: 122bn of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS and other similar schemes.
In addition to these customer deposits, there were 4bn 2013: 3bn of other liabilities insured by governments.
Although, contractually, current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice, the Groups broad base of customers numerically and by depositor type helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances.
Such accounts form a stable funding base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs.
The Group models the behaviour of both assets and liabilities to assess balance sheet funding gaps.
The behavioural modelling approach reflects the forward-looking macroeconomic outlook and captures customer roll-over and optionality behaviour within a given asset or liability product.
These behavioural maturities are used to determine funds transfer pricing interest rates at which businesses are rewarded and charged for sources and uses of funds.

The Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and long-term investors through its clients worldwide, and is an active participant in money markets.
As a result, wholesale funding is well diversified by product, maturity, geography and major currency.
As at 31 December 2014, total wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 171bn 2013: 186bn.
75bn 2013: a 82bn of wholesale funding matures in less than one year, of which 22bn 2013: 23bn relates to term funding.

As at 31 December 2014, outstanding wholesale funding comprised 33bn 2013: 35bn of secured funding and 138bn 2013: 151bn of unsecured funding.
In preparation for a Single Point of Entry resolution model, the Group has started to issue debt capital and term senior unsecured funding out of Barclays PLC, the holding company.
The Group expects to refinance most debt capital and term senior unsecured debt out of Barclays PLC over time.
These notes are issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.
Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by 74bn 2013: 45bn.

Across wholesale funding, the composition of wholesale funding is materially unchanged.
Term financing The Group issued 15bn 2013: 1bn of term funding net of early redemptions during 2014.
In addition, the Group raised 6bn through participation in the Bank of Englands Funding for Lending Scheme.
The Group has 23bn of term debt maturing in 2015 and 13bn maturing in a 2016.
The Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt in 2015, in order to maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and distribution channel.
Encumbrance Asset encumbrance arises from collateral pledged against secured funding and other collateralised obligations.
Barclays funds a portion of trading portfolio assets and other securities via repurchase agreements and other similar borrowing, and pledges a portion of customer loans and advances as collateral in securitisation, covered bond and other similar secured structures.
Barclays monitors the mix of secured and unsecured funding sources within the Groups funding plan and seeks to efficiently utilise available collateral to raise secured funding and meet other collateralised obligations.
As at 31 December 2014, 208bn 2013: 202bn of the Groups assets were encumbered, which primarily related to firm financing of trading portfolio assets and other securities, cash collateral and secured funding against loans and advances to customers.
Encumbered assets have been identified in a manner consistent with the Groups reporting requirements under European Capital Requirements Regulation CRR.
Securities and commodities assets are considered encumbered when they have been pledged or used to secure, collateralise or credit enhance a transaction which impacts their transferability and free use.
The 2013 balances have been revised to align with the CRR reporting.
In addition, 313bn 2013: 356bn of the total 396bn 2013: 428bn securities accepted as collateral, and held off-balance sheet, were on-pledged, the significant majority of which related to matched-book activity where reverse repurchase agreements and off balance sheet stock borrows are matched by repurchase agreements and off balance sheet stock loans entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder primarily relates to reverse repurchases used to settle trading portfolio liabilities, stock lending or other similar secured borrowing as well as collateral posted against derivatives margin requirements.
As at 31 December 2014, 333bn 2013: 331bn of assets were identified as readily available.
These consist of on and off-balance sheet assets that have not been identified as encumbered and are in transferable form.
They include cash and securities held in the Group liquidity pool as well as additional unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these additional assets are not relied upon to meet the Groups liquidity stress testing requirements, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
Loans and advances to customers are only classified as readily available if they are already in a form such that they can be used to raise funding without further management actions.
This includes excess collateral already in secured funding vehicles and collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available for use in secured financing transactions.
As at 31 December 2014, 212bn 2013: 217bn of assets were identified as available as collateral.
These assets are not subject to any restrictions on their ability to secure funding, be offered as collateral, or sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, but are not immediately available in the normal course of business in their current form.
They primarily consist of loans and advances a proportion of which would be suitable for use in secured funding structures but are conservatively classified as not readily available because they are not currently in transferable form.
Not available collateral consist of assets that cannot be pledged or used as security for funding due to restrictions that prevent their pledge or use as security for funding in the normal course of business.
Derivatives and reverse repurchase agreement assets relate specifically to reverse repurchase agreements, derivatives and other similar secured lending.
These are shown separately as these on-balance sheet assets cannot be pledged.
However, these assets can give rise to the receipt of non-cash assets which are not recognised on the balance sheet, but can be used to raise secured funding or meet additional funding requirements.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2014 I 201 Risk review Risk performance Funding risk Liquidity Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements The Group enters into repurchase and other similar secured borrowing agreements to finance its trading portfolio assets.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by offsetting repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder are used to settle trading portfolio liabilities.
Due to the high quality of collateral provided against secured financing transactions, the liquidity risk associated with this activity is significantly lower than unsecured financing transactions.
Nonetheless, the Group manages to gross and net secured mismatch limits to limit refinancing risk under a severe stress scenario and a portion of the Groups liquidity pool is held against stress outflows on these positions.
The Group secured mismatch limits are calibrated based on market capacity, liquidity characteristics of the collateral and risk appetite of the Group.
The cash value of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions will typically differ from the market value of the collateral against which these transactions are secured by an amount referred to as a haircut or .
Typical haircut levels vary depending on the quality of a the collateral that underlies these transactions.
For transactions secured against highly liquid collateral, lenders demand relatively small haircuts typically ranging from 0-2%.
For transactions secured against less liquid collateral, haircuts vary by asset class typically ranging from 5-10% for corporate bonds and other less liquid collateral.
As at 31 December 2014, the significant majority of repurchase activity related to matched-book activity.
The Group may face refinancing risk on the net maturity mismatch for matched-book activity.

As regulation has evolved, credit rating agencies have communicated their intention to remove part or all of this support over time.
In line with this intent, on 3 February 2015, S&P took action to remove the government support notches from certain UK and Swiss bank nonoperating holding companies, including Barclays PLC, the holding company of Barclays Bank PLC.
This resulted in a downgrade of Barclays PLC by two notches to BBB A-2 with stable outlook as they believe the prospect of extraordinary government support to its senior creditors is now unlikely.
S&P also placed the long-term and short-term ratings of most UK, German and Austrian bank operating companies, including Barclays Bank PLC A A-1 and its subsidiaries and branches, the counterparties for customer and client relationships on Credit Watch with negative implications as they assess how the legislative bail-in powers may operate for bank operating companies in practice.
A credit rating downgrade could result in contractual outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts.
Outflows related to a multiple-notch credit rating downgrade are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk.
Credit ratings downgrades could also result in increased costs or reduced capacity to raise funding.
