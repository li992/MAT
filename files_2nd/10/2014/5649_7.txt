In addition, trends in certain markets may reduce the demands for the Companys products.
Should Essentras customers decide to satisfy their requirements internally or from other suppliers and if Essentra were unable to secure new business this could result in a significant loss of business.
Due to the acquisitions that the Company has made in 2014, Essentra must serve an increased size and complexity profile of customers who will be heavily reliant on our business in some cases.
