Report of the Directors RISK COMMITTEE A Risk Committee has been established and its membership and Terms of Reference are available on the Companys website www.
The Committees primary focus is around investment risk in its broadest sense, including elements such as counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Committees work has focused on two levels: 1 the direct exposures of the Company itself, for instance to AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and cash counterparts: and 2 the exposures embedded within AllBlue, its investment characteristics and the risks associated with owning AllBlue The Committee meets regularly and has, over the course of its first year, spent time defining the scope and mandate of its operations, reviewing key documentation, developing key reporting and interacting with BlueCrest and JTC to examine and understand the risks that the Company is exposed to at both levels.
Further information relating to the work of the Risk Committee is explained in the Risk Committee report on page 38.
BRIBERY The Directors have undertaken to operate the business in an honest and ethical manner and accordingly take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption.
The key components of this approach are implemented as follows: The Board is committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships: The Company will implement and enforce effective procedures to counter bribery: and The Company requires all its service providers and advisors to adopt equivalent or similar principles.
INTERNAL CONTROLS & RISK MANAGEMENT REVIEW The Board is responsible for the Companys system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board confirms that there is an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the significant risks faced by the Company.
31 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited Report of the Directors The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, carries out an annual review of the internal financial controls of the Company.
In addition, ISAE 3402 or equivalent reports have been obtained from the relevant service providers where available to verify these reviews.
The Management and Remuneration Committee also conducts regular reviews of the Companys service providers.
The internal controls are designed to meet the Companys particular needs and the foreseeable risks to which it is exposed.
Accordingly, the internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and by their nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss.
The Company has put in place arrangements with AllBlue and BlueCrest as appropriate for the Company to receive weekly estimated NAVs and estimated and final monthly NAVs in relation to AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged electronically as soon as they are released to AllBlue investors, together with certain factsheets produced on each fund and other administrative information and reports.
The purpose of these arrangements is to ensure that the Directors have sufficient timely information to enable them to monitor the Companys investments in AllBlue.
In addition, the appointment of Andrew Dodd to the Board, together with his alternate director, allows the Board immediate direct access to senior representatives of the BlueCrest group to discuss issues and receive information on matters which may impact Shareholders.
The Risk Committee of the Company meets quarterly to review risk reporting information and consider the Companys risk management systems, including consideration of a risk matrix which covers various areas of risk including corporate strategy, accuracy of published information, compliance with laws and regulations, relationships with service providers and investment and business activities.
The Board considers that the Company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify, mitigate and manage the primary risks to which the Company is exposed.
The Company is a self-managed investment company with no separate investment manager.
Accordingly no fees are payable to an investment manager.
BlueCrest is the investment manager of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged.
Administration and Secretarial duties for the Company are performed by JTC.
The Board considers that the systems and procedures employed by the Administrator and AllBlue provide sufficient assurance that a sound system of internal controls is in place.
The Directors of the Company clearly define the duties and responsibilities of their agents and advisors.
The appointment of agents and advisors is conducted by the Board after consideration of the quality of 32 BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited
