For instance, as the Group has acquired land successfully, the operational risk shifts to the progression of these sites into the build and sales phase, with the challenges of gaining detailed planning and of operationally gearing up the Group to increase build and sales activity.
With sales conditions improving, risks move to our people and the stresses within the supply chain.
