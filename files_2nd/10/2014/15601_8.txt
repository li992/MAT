Principal risks and uncertainties A key challenge for any business is to identify the principal risks it faces and to develop and monitor appropriate controls.
A successful risk management process balances risks and rewards and relies on sound judgement of their likelihood and impact.
The Group maintains a Key Risk Register of the principal risks faced by the Group, including the likelihood and impact of risks and the controls and procedures implemented to mitigate them.
Our process for identifying and managing risks is set out in more detail on page 40 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014.
The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the Group, and examples of relevant key controls and mitigating factors.
The Board considers these to be the most significant risks faced by the Group.
They do not comprise all the risks associated with the Group and they are not set out in any order of priority.
Additional risks not presently known to management, or currently deemed to be less material, may also have an adverse effect on the business.
As customers disposable income remains stretched, the competitive intensity of the retail marketplace also continues to grow.
It is against this backdrop that there has been a trend towards increasing net risk during the year.
Whilst the economic situation in our principal market, the UK, is beginning to show some improvement, there are increased levels of economic, political and regulatory volatility in the wider global marketplace which have increased the assessed level of net risk that the business faces in these areas.
The ongoing austerity programmes in Asia and Europe and the fiscal and regulatory measures that apply to the retail sector, for example the DIDA Act in South Korea, have continued to challenge the business.
An increase in the rating of economic, political and regulatory risks since last year is principally driven by a revised view of the likely impact of these risks on the business, particularly in the context of the global marketplace and the financial and trading position of the Group.
The ongoing delivery of our multichannel vision, combined with a growing focus on customer data, has also heightened our sensitivity to the impact of technology risks.
The impact assessment of technology has therefore increased and this remains a key area of focus.
Significant efforts by management to mitigate risks and strengthen controls have reduced the assessment of the likelihood of certain risks occurring.
Notable examples include: product safety and ethical trading, reputation and property.
Changes to the Groups property strategy in the year have also reduced the overall property net risk rating.
