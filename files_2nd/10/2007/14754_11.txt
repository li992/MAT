36 37 Risks and uncertainties Risks and uncertainties There are risks and uncertainties connected to the Groups businesses.
The factors listed below are among those that the Group thinks could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.
Risk management is an important element of the system of internal control.
This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute assurance against material loss.
During the previous financial year a comprehensive review of the risk management process was undertaken with the aim of further improving and strengthening the system and embedding risk management within the operational and executive management throughout the Group.
Overall responsibility for the risk management process lies with the Global Operating Committee GOC.
The risk management process involves making all managers within the Group responsible for risk management and for ensuring that a full assessment of risks, both financial and non-financial, has been completed.
This is achieved by a bottom-up and top-down review of risks throughout the Group.
From this, a Group Risk Matrix has been developed and is actively managed by the GOC.
An overview of the process is presented below: Board of Directors Audit Committee Business Assurance External Audit Group risk register managed by GOC GOC Divisional risk register managed by Divisional Management Divisional Management Team Unit risk register managed by Unit Management Operating Unit Risk Description Mitigating action and management Disruption to the Group Supply Chain Failure, e. g. at a factory, by a third party supplier, Dual sourcing and ability to switch production or a failure at a warehouse Follow up on recommendations from the annual Business Interruption Review Development and continuous review of business continuity plans Failure of New Product Development NPD Failure in NPD pipeline resulting in loss of sales Defined methodology for controlling and profits NPD projects Steering Committees chaired by the Chief Executive to monitor NPD activities Commercial risks Unforseen competitor activity Continuous market surveillance to gather Increased margin pressure from large information on competitor activity retail groups NPD process focused on delivering value Geographic expansion into emerging markets added products to customers Effects on financial performance of economic Group-wide management of key accounts downturn in a major market Robust financial and risk analysis of geographic expansion including the use of external advisers Strong management reporting structures ensure that emerging risks are identified quickly Continuous effort to spread revenue generation across global operations Inadequate succession planning Recruiting and retaining key members of staff Group HR continually reviews the talent pool in the organisation and identifies succession risks Remuneration and HR policies to ensure that the Group employs highly motivated, wellremunerated, success-oriented people Wide-ranging training opportunities to provide continuous development opportunities IT system failure Failure of IT system to support key business Continuous testing of backup procedures processes functions resulting in loss of sales and disaster recovery plans and profits Group IT provides system support in key markets Failure to comply with regulatory matters, Major product liability claims Product liability insurance including environmental and Health and Inability to supply products resulting from Strong technical and quality assurance team Safety matters failure to comply with regulatory demands ensuring that all products comply with all leading to financial loss and damaged necessary regulations brand reputation Key principle within the Group to use regulation Impact on reputation resulting from negative as a competitive advantage environmental or Health and Safety reports Dedicated team conducting environmental and H&S audits in operating facilities Risk management is a standing agenda item at the GOC meetings.
