17 How We Manage Risk Evolution of Our Framework We recognise that risk management is an important part of our business and continually seek to improve our process.

Our Risk Process Our risk process is designed to support everyone, at all levels of the business, in identifying and managing risks.
Identification of risk All risks, whether they are identified at the most senior level or throughout the business, are described, analysed and reported using a standard framework.
The central Corporate Assurance and Risk team acts as an advisory Monitoring Assessment and Framework function and provides independent challenge and reporting evaluation supported and review.
Each of our business functions also by central participates in the process, identifying any Corporate risks that may prevent them achieving their Assurance and objectives and describing these in terms of Risk team cause and consequence.
These are scored using a variety of impact measures, including financial, operational, reputational and people factors.
Controls for each risk are described and assessed.
Control Determination Each risk, at every level, has a designated owner effectiveness of response who is responsible for ensuring the described controls are effective and efficient.
We continually review the level of risk throughout the business and complete a formal submission every six months for reporting purposes as illustrated in our risk framework opposite.
