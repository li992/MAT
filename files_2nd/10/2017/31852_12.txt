Principal Risks and Uncertainties THE BOARD CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS CARRIED OUT A ROBUST ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS FACING THE GROUP, INCLUDING THOSE THAT WOULD THREATEN ITS BUSINESS MODEL, FUTURE PERFORMANCE, SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY.
THE BOARDS ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES FACING THE GROUP AND THE MITIGATION IN PLACE IS SET OUT BELOW.
The Worldstores Group was acquired during the year, and, as noted in the interim financial statements in February 2017, the Board decided that Failure to integrate the Worldstores business successfully was an additional principal risk which should be added to the register.

For reporting purposes this has now been absorbed into the competition, markets and customers section, the business efficiency section, and the finance and treasury section, in line with the relevant mitigating actions.
