Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial instruments and risk management We issue or hold financial instruments mainly to finance our operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage currency and interest rate risks.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and payables arise directly from operations.
How do we manage financial risk?
Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidityrisk.
Treasury operation We have a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as our exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the chairman, the chief executive or the group finance director.
There has been no change in the nature of our risk profile between 31March 2017 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
How do we manage interest rate risk?
Management policy Interest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings.
Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.
Our policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of ongoing net debt is at fixed rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the group finance director, director of treasury and risk management or the group treasurer who each have been delegated such authority from the Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage our interest rate profile, we have entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings are subject to fixed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
How do we manage foreign exchange risk?
Management policy Foreign currency hedging activities protect the group from the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect future net cash flows.
The Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions typically covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for each type of transaction.
The Board has delegated short-term foreign exchange management to the treasury operation and long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the group finance director, director of treasury and risk management or the group treasurer.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of our external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
Our non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
We enter into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency, capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific region currencies.
As a result, our exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.
We use cross-currency swaps to swap foreign currency borrowings into Sterling.

Sensitivity analysis The income statement and shareholders equity are exposed to volatility arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis: for interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies: and for foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies.
The impact of a 1% change in interest rates on the groups annual net finance expense was insignificant in 2016 17, 2015 16 and 2014 15.
The impact on equity, before tax, of a 1% increase in interest rates is as detailed below: 2017 2016 2015 m m m Increase Increase Increase At 31 March reduce reduce reduce Sterling interest rates 554 626 428 US Dollar interest rates 348 374 400 Euro interest rates 229 263 34 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
Our exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, and within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures was insignificant in 2016 17, 2015 16 and 2014 15. Credit ratings We continue to target a BBB Baa1 credit rating over the medium term.
We regularly review the liquidity of the group and our funding strategy takes account of medium-term requirements.
These include the pension deficit and shareholder distribution.
Our December 2030 bond contains covenants which require us to pay higher rates of interest since our credit ratings fell below A3 in the case of Moodys or A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 2.1bn at 31 March 2017, our finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 11m a year if the groups credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies.
Our credit ratings were as detailed below: 2017 2016 2015 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating agency Moodys Baa1 Negative Baa2 Positive Baa2 Positive Standard & Poors BBB Negative BBB Positive BBB Stable How do we manage liquidity risk?
Management policy We maintain liquidity by entering into short and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements, determined using short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the long-term funding requirements of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
We manage refinancing risk by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise.
The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings at 31 March 2017 is disclosed in note 25.
We have term debt maturities of 1.8bn in 2017 18.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Our treasury operation reviews and manages our short-term requirements within the parameters of the policies set by theBoard.
We hold cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2017 we had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 2.1bn 2015 16: 1.5bn, 2014 15: 1.5bn maturing in September 2021.
We also have an undrawn 364-day revolving bridge facility of 1.5bn maturing in March 2018, with the option to renew to March 2019.
The bridge facility contains mandatory prepayment and cancellation clauses in certain circumstances, such as the issuance of public debt securities.

How do we manage credit risk?
Management policy Our exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the Boards defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moodys and S&P.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
If counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria we will take action where appropriate.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.
Operational management policy Our credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
Where appropriate, we may minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
We take proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of counterparties to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.

The credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.
Where the opinion of Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.
The concentration of credit risk for our trading balances is provided in note 17, which analyses outstanding balances by line of business.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
We have also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a daily and weekly basis, the fair value position on notional 1,742m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
The related net cash inflow during the year was 100m 2015 16: 79m, 2014 15: 297m.
