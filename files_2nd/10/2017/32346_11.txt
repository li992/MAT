ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 25 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investment income Investment income of 360.8m represents the total income earned from the balance sheet portfolio in the year, analysed as follows: 31 March 2017 31 March 2016 Change Investment income m m % Interest income 144.7 126.0 15% Dividend and other income 14.7 21.4 31% Capital gains 201.4 128.6 57% 360.8 276.0 31% Interest income was above the prior period due to an increase in interest bearing assets in our corporate investments and capital market investments strategies.
Cash interest income has increased to 38% 2016: 30% of the total as the growing US mezzanine and real estate portfolios are weighted towards cash pay interest.
Dividend income was received from our real estate and senior debt funds.
The prior year included a dividend from our secondaries investment in the Diamond Castle Partner 2014 LP fund.
Capital gains were, as expected, particularly strong in the financial year as the income statement benefited from the delayed income statement recognition of 54.4m of capital gains recycled from reserves on realisation of the underlying assets.
In addition, the valuation of the portfolio as at 31 March 2017 benefited from the strength in global stock markets and the improved performance across a large number of portfolio assets over the last 12 months.
Net realised capital gains in the period were 235.3m 2016: 75.2m, of which 150.9m 2016: 51.2m had been recognised previously as unrealised gains in the income statement with the remaining 84.4m 2016: 24.0m recognised in the current year, including the recycling from reserves.
Fair valuing the equity and warrants gave rise to a further 112.5m 2016: 144.4m of unrealised gains in the current period.
Of this, 117.0m 2016: 104.6m is recognised in the income statement and a 4.5m unrealised loss in reserves 2016: 39.8m unrealised gain.
Interest expense Interest expense of 53.9m was 8.0m higher than the prior period 2016: 45.9m, due to the increase in private placement debt and the FX impact of interest paid on non-Sterling borrowings.
Operating expenses Operating expenses of the IC amounted to 77.3m 2016: 57.9m, of which incentive scheme costs of 54.2m 2016: 39.7m were the largest component.
The 14.5m increase is due to the cost of balance sheet carry, the Groups IC carry arrangements, increasing and a higher cash bonus accrued as a direct consequence of the high level of realisations in the year.
Other staff and administrative costs were 23.1m compared to 18.2m last year, a 4.9m increase.
This increase is due to an increase in business development costs, of which the largest component is related to the Australian Senior Loans strategy, and the amortisation on the ICG Enterprise Trust management contract.
Impairments During the period we took asset specific impairments of 57.6m compared to 42.8m in the last financial year, with write backs of 9.6m 2016: 3.4m resulting in net impairments of 48.0m 2016: 39.4m.
This is broadly in line with our historic average of 2.5% of the opening IC portfolio.

Fundraising activities have also enabled current assets held on the balance sheet to be transferred to third party funds.
Capital position Shareholders funds decreased by 6% to 1,172.6m 2016: 1,241.2m in the year, principally due to the 200m special dividend paid during the year.

Adjusted return on equity of 18.2% is up 5.3% points.
