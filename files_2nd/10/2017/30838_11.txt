Ourcontinuing success is dependent on how well we understand and manage ourrisks.
Risk management framework The risk management framework sets out our processes for Board identifying, reviewing and managing our risks and is regularly assessed and adapted as the Company, industry and macro environment evolves.
Risks are primarily controlled through the risk management process.
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of theprincipal risks facing the Company and details of these are set onout on the following pages.
Risk appetite and culture Our ongoing process for risk identication, review and management is set out below and is consistent with last year.
Management and Divisional Boards Have responsibility for: Management The development and operation of the risk management and Divisional framework and for theoperation of our systems of internal Boards control.
This includes: Risk identication and assessment and establishing controls and procedures tomonitor and mitigate risks Assessment and review of financial controls, policies and procedures to ensure risks are identied and the processes The Board and procedures are in accordance with and aligned to the strategy Operational Audit Reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of internal Risk Steering and Risk controls and putting in place remedial plans where Group Committee controls are weak or there are opportunities for improvement.
Seriouscontrol weakness if any is reportedto the Board and action taken as appropriate Routinely reviewing and challenging risks and mitigations.
Operation and Assurance three lines of defence We are continuing to develop our three lines of defence model to better manage our risks.
We are moving our approach to risk away from a rules and process driven systemto a cultural people driven solution, which we believeencourages a focus on prevention rather than reaction tofailure.

At an annual strategy meeting the Board assesses ITVs prospects and risks.
Amongst other topics, the Board reviews the five year financial plan, which is based on our strategic priorities.
Pages 18 to 19 of the Annual Report provide detail of ITVs prospects in the Strategy and Business Model section.
What is the assessment period for viability?
In its assessment of viability, the Board reviewed the planning horizon and is of the viewthat a three year period to 31 December 2020 continues to be most appropriate.
The factors the Board considered in adopting this timeframe were as follows: Visibility over ITVs broadcast advertising business is relatively short term, as advertising remains cyclical and closely linked to the UK economic growth impacted by Brexit and the uncertain UK macroeconomic climate The commissioning process and life cycle of programming gives the Studios division more medium term outlook.
However, while non-returning brands are replaced with newcommissions, over time there is less visibility as programmes can experience changes in viewer demand or come to a natural expiration Technology in the media industry continues to change the demand for content and alsohow it is consumed Pension funding, which is one of ITVs key funding obligations, is also agreed triennially with the Trustees of the pension scheme ITVs business model does not necessitate investment in large capital projects that would require a longer-term horizon assessment or returns Assessment of viability When considering the longer term viability of ITV, the Board reviewed each of ITVs principal risks and, taking into account current operational and financial performance, hasin particular analysed the impact of: Scenario modelled Link to principal risks pages 52 to 57 Scenario 1: There is a major decline in advertising revenues The Broadcast division experiencing a significant and ITV does not build sufficient non-NAR and sharp downturn, similar to the 2008 09 revenue streams to mitigate the financial financial crisis, with advertising revenues impact of this decline.
declining for two years followed by a year of flatrevenue.
This scenario could be regarded as cautious as recessions in the advertising market have historically not exceeded a two-year period and showed growth following that period.
Scenario 2: ITV fails to create and own a sufficient A number of key programme brands within the numberof hit programmes formats across its Studios division are not recommissioned.
While international portfolio of content companies.
the scheduling decisions of commissioners are made in advance, a number of key shows could come to an end at the same time.
58 ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional information Risks and Uncertainties In line with prior years, the Board has considered a scenario involving changes in pension funding obligations.
However, while the final actuarial valuation as at 1 January 2017 hasnot been agreed, the Board does not anticipate any material changes in funding obligations in the three year period under assessment.
The Board will continue to monitor the risk, as the next valuation as at 1 January 2020 could have an impact on theperiods assessed in future viability statements.
Further, the impact of the London Property project on the Groups viability was considered.
Due to the medium-term nature of the project, it is not currently anticipatedto have a significant impact on liquidity in the period reviewed in this statement.
TheBoard will continue to monitor the impact of the project as it progresses.
The viability review involved flexing the underlying strategic forecast for the above impacts, both individually and concurrently, and no specic mitigations were assumed.
The underlying strategic forecast assumed: business as usual capital spending: the ongoing availability of the nancing facilities as ITV remains within the covenants, current bank facilities are secured for more than three years and there are no major bondrepayments due in this period : and the Group maintains the stated dividend policy.
The scenarios used are hypothetical but are considered appropriate to model risks thatcould impact the viability of the Group.
In addition, there are options at the disposal of the Board to maintain liquidity and continue operations in the event of any of the scenarios arising, such as reducing M&A activity and non-essential capital expenditure aswell as reviewing the Groups dividend policy.
Viability statement Based on the results of this review, the Board has a reasonable expectation that ITV willbe able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 December 2020.
The assessment has been made with reference toITVs strategy and the current position and prospects.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by: Ian Grifths Chief Operating officer and Group Finance Director 28 February 2018 59
