We rate them according to likelihood of occurrence, potential impact and the likely velocity of each risk.
This measure reflects the expected time we would have to react were a risk to materialise.
The trend metric reflects the net position of a risk-taking into consideration both external factors and internal risk mitigation activities, when compared to the same time last year.
We consider our current and target exposure to each risk, which defines our risk appetite.
We updated our register of principal risks and uncertainties following our Executive Committee workshop held during FY2017 and made the following adjustments to the principal risks disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report: Financial risk has been removed.
We consider the diversified nature of our global operations and the financial strength of the Group provide appropriate mitigation such that this risk does not require a standalone disclosure.
Pension Funding risk has been removed.
We consider the increased strength of the funding level of the Groups defined benefit pension arrangements and the actions agreed on 17 November 2015 and 1 March 2016 in order to address potential funding shortfalls in the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme and TI Group Pension Scheme.
While we continue to monitor and manage a wider range of risks, the table below summarises those we feel most likely to have the greatest impact on the business if they were to materialise and the key mitigating actions taken to address them.
