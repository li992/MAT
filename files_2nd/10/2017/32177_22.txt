The Group is subject to a range of regulatory and tax reporting requirements.
In particular, as a multinational investment company, the changes to the tax landscape require careful monitoring as countries begin to consider and adopt the recommendations made by the OECDs Base Erosion and profit Shifting BEPS project.

The Group continues to monitor these tax developments.
