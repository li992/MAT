Analysis of the Balance Sheet Groups maximum exposure and collateral and other credit enhancements held Basis of preparation The following tables present a reconciliation between the Groups maximum exposure and its net exposure to credit risk: reflecting the financial effects of collateral, credit enhancements and other actions taken to mitigate the Groups exposure.
For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, maximum exposure to credit risk represents the balance sheet carrying value after allowance for impairment.
For offbalance sheet guarantees, the maximum exposure is the maximum amount that the Group would have to pay if the guarantees were to be called upon.
For loan commitments and other credit related commitments that are irrevocable over the life of the respective facilities, the maximum exposure is the full amount of the committed facilities.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 141 Risk review Risk performance Credit risk The Groups approach to management and representation of credit quality Asset credit quality All loans and advances are categorised as either neither past due nor impaired, past due but not impaired, or past due and impaired, which includes restructured loans.
For the purposes of the disclosures in the balance sheet credit quality section below and the analysis of loans and advances and impairment section page 156 : loans neither past due nor impaired consist predominantly of wholesale and retail loans that are performing.
These loans, although unimpaired may carry an unidentified impairment a loan is considered past due and classified as Higher risk when the borrower has failed to make a payment when due under the terms of the loan contract loans on forbearance programmes, as defined on page 153, are categorised as Higher risk the impairment allowance includes allowances against financial assets that have been individually impaired and those subject to collective impairment.
The Group uses the following internal measures to determine credit quality for loans that are performing: Wholesale lending Probability of Credit Quality Default Grade default Description 1-3 0.0-0.05% Strong 4-5 0.05-0.15% 6-8 0.15-0.30% 9-11 0.30-0.60% 12-14 0.60-2.15% Satisfactory 15-19 2.15-11.35% 20-21 11.35% Higher Risk For retail clients, a range of analytical tools is used to derive the probability of default of clients at inception and on an ongoing basis.
For loans that are performing, these descriptions can be summarised as follows: Strong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.
Satisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to unsecured retail facilities.
At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, mortgages with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.
Higher risk: there is concern over the obligors ability to make payments when due.
However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency.
There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided.
However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.
Loans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Groups impairment policies.
These loans are all considered higher risk for the purpose of this analysis of credit quality.
Debt securities For assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer.
Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies.
The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poors, Fitch or Moodys.
Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.
Balance sheet credit quality The following tables present the credit quality of Group assets exposed to credit risk.
Overview As at 31 December 2017, the ratio of the Groups assets classified as strong remained broadly stable at 89% 2016: 86% of total assets exposed to credit risk.
Further analysis of debt securities by issuer and issuer type and netting and collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments is presented on pages 157 and 158 respectively.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 143 Risk review Risk performance Credit risk Analysis of the concentration of credit risk A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.
The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged.
Further detail on the Groups policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented on page 149 of Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2017.
Geographic concentrations As at 31 December 2017, the geographic concentration of the Groups assets remained broadly consistent with 2016.

Risk metrics based on exposures to customers only.
Portfolio performance remained steady reflecting the continuing low base rate environment and stable economic conditions.
The non-performing proportion of outstanding balances decreased due to an improved performance and a reduction in repossession stock.
The recovery book impairment coverage ratio increased driven by a reduction in the number of customers entering recoveries, reflecting lower entries into collections and better customer payments rates from those in collections.
Within the UK home loans portfolio: owner-occupied interest-only home loans comprised 28% 2016: 31% of total balances.
The decrease was driven by a greater attrition rate compared to new business flow.
The average balance weighted LTV on these loans reduced to 39.7% 2016: 41.7% primarily driven by increases in the House Price Index HPI across core regions and the 90 day arrears rate excluding recovery book remained steady at 0.3% 2016: 0.2% buy-to-let home loans comprised 11% 2016: 9% of total balances.

b For UK and US cards, outstanding recovery book balances for acquired portfolios recognised at fair value which have no related impairment allowance have been excluded from the recovery book impairment coverage ratio.
Losses have been recognised where related to additional spend from acquired accounts in the period post acquisition.
UK cards: The annualised gross charge-off rate, which was higher in 2016 due to accelerated asset sales, normalised in 2017 to 5.0% 2016: 5.5% in line with expectations.
The recovery book proportion of outstanding balances increased, reflecting accelerated charge-off of non-compliant forbearance plans.
However, the recovery book impairment coverage ratio decreased, reflecting the one time asset sale impact of accounts with lower recovery expectations.
UK personal loans: The 30 day arrears rate increased to 2.5% 2016: 2.1% and the 90 day arrears rate increased to 1.2% 2016: 0.9% reflecting increased flow into delinquency from some 2016 bookings due to higher incidences of fraud and poorer performance on customers with multiple loans, coupled with a weaker performance in collections operations.
Both the recovery book proportion of outstanding balances of 4.7% 2016: 4.7% and the recovery book impairment coverage ratio of 77.2% 2016: 77.2% remained stable.
US cards: The annualised gross charge-off rate increased to 5.0% 2016: 4.5% broadly in line with trends across the industry and also reflecting a one-off asset sale contributing to a drop in outstanding balances.
As a result, recovery book proportion of outstanding balances increased to 2.8% 2016: 2.4%.
Barclays Partner Finance: Portfolio arrears and the annualised gross charge-off rate remained broadly stable during 2017.
Germany cards: 90 day arrears and the annualised gross charge-off rate remained stable, while the recovery book coverage ratio improved reflecting better recoveries.
In addition, Germany consumer loans increased to 1.4bn 2016: 1.2bn.

Analysis of loans and advances assessed as impaired The following table presents an analysis of gross loans and advances into those collectively or individually assessed as impaired.
The table includes an age analysis for loans and advances collectively assessed as impaired.
Loans that are collectively assessed as impaired consist predominantly of retail loans that are one day or more past due for which a collective allowance is raised.
Wholesale loans that are past due, individually assessed as unimpaired, but which carry an unidentified impairment provision, are excluded from this category.
Loans that are individually assessed as impaired consist predominantly of wholesale loans that are past due and for which an individual allowance has been raised.
Home loans, unsecured loans and credit card receivables that are subject to forbearance in the retail portfolios are included within the collectively assessed for impairment category.
Where wholesale loans under forbearance have been impaired, these form part of individually assessed impaired loans.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 151 Risk review Risk performance Credit risk Potential credit risk loans PCRLs and coverage ratios The Group reports potentially and actually impaired loans as PCRLs.
PCRLs comprise two categories of loans: credit risk loans CRLs and potential problem loans PPLs.
CRLs comprise three classes of loans: Impaired Loans: comprises loans where an individually identified impairment allowance has been raised.
This category also includes all Retail loans that have been transferred to a recovery book.
See page 153 for further analysis of impaired loans.
Accruing past due 90 days or more: comprises loans that are 90 days or more past due with respect to principal or interest.
Restructured loans: comprises loans not included above where, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtors financial difficulties, a concession has been granted to the debtor that would not otherwise be considered.
For information on restructured loans refer to disclosures on forbearance on pages 153 to 156.
PPLs are loans that are currently complying with repayment terms but where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to continue to comply with such terms in the near future.
If the credit quality of a wholesale loan on a watch list deteriorates to the highest category, or a Retail loan deteriorates to delinquency cycle 2 typically when past due 60 to 90 days, consideration is given to including it within the PPL category.
The CRL coverage ratio for retail portfolios increased to 88.6% 2016: 82.2% primarily due to movements in Barclays UK.
PPLs decreased to 1.4bn 2016: 2.2bn primarily within Barclays International.
The decrease was driven by Corporate and Investment Bank where the volume of PPL cases has decreased significantly.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Impaired loans The following table represents an analysis of impaired loans in line with the disclosure recommended by the Enhanced Disclosure Taskforce.
Impaired loans are a subcomponent of CRLs and comprise loans where an individually identified impairment allowance has been raised.
This category also includes all retail loans that have been transferred to a recovery book.
For the majority of products, transfer to a recovery unit occurs for loans that are past due over 6 months unless a forbearance agreement is agreed.
Earlier transfer points may occur depending on specific circumstances.
Impaired loans may include loans that are still performing, fully collateralised loans or where indebtedness has already been written down to the expected realisable value.

Balances on forbearance programmes decreased 2% driven by better portfolio performance.
Retail balances on forbearance reduced 10% to 1.2bn, reflecting an overall decrease in both Barclays UK and Barclays International portfolios.
Barclays UK: Reduction was driven by UK cards portfolio, where balances on forbearance plans were lower due to an asset sale and application of tighter entry criteria.
For the UK home loans portfolio the reduction was due to stable economic conditions and reduced forbearance entries.
Barclays International: US cards forbearance balances decreased due to an asset sale of high risk accounts.
The increase in impairment allowance was driven by updated modelling methodology.
Wholesale balances on forbearance remained broadly stable at 3.0bn 2016: 2.9bn.
Across the principal portfolios, the flow of new cases into forbearance during 2017 was offset by a range of repayments and credit improvements where clients returned to the performing book and a modest level of write-offs.

UK cards: Balances on forbearance plans reduced due to an asset sale and tighter entry criteria.
The forbearance impairment coverage ratio increased due to the inclusion of additional forbearance populations in 2017 which carry higher impairment provision rates.
UK personal loans: Impairment allowance held against forbearance stock decreased in line with the overall forbearance balance and the coverage ratio remained relatively stable US cards: Balances were lower due to asset sale of high risk accounts while impairment allowance increased due to a change in methodology.

UK cards: The reduction in the Repayment Plan book was driven by a one-time accelerated charge-off of legacy accounts in addition to reduced inflow as a result of tighter entry criteria.
This reduction was partially offset by the inclusion of new segments following a review of the forbearance population to better align with policy.

Historic correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments.
The high and low aR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low aR reported as a whole.
Consequently a diversification effect balance for the high and low aR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.

Business Scenario Stresses As part of the Groups risk management framework, on a regular basis the performance of the trading business in hypothetical scenarios characterised by severe macroeconomic conditions is modelled.
Up to seven global scenarios are modelled on a regular basis, for example, a sharp deterioration in liquidity, a slowdown in the global economy, global recession, and a sharp increase in economic growth.
In 2017, the scenario analyses showed that the largest market risk related impacts would be due to a severe deterioration in financial liquidity and global recession.

Summary of performance in the period The Group continued to maintain surpluses to its internal and regulatory requirements.
The liquidity pool increased to 220bn December 2016: 165bn reflecting the approach of holding a conservative liquidity position and through net deposit growth, the unwind of legacy Non-Core portfolios, money market borrowing and drawdown from the Bank of England Term Funding Scheme.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR increased to 154% December 2016: 131%, equivalent to a surplus of 75bn December 2016: 39bn to 100%, Wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 157bn December 2016: 158bn.
The Group issued 11.5bn equivalent of capital and senior unsecured debt from Barclays PLC the Parent company of which 6.1bn was in public senior unsecured debt, and 5.4bn in capital instruments.
In the same period 6.1bn of Barclays Bank PLC capital and senior public term instruments either matured or were redeemed, including the $1.375bn 7.1% Series 3 USD preference shares.
Liquidity risk stress testing Under the Liquidity Framework, the Group has established a Liquidity Risk Appetite LRA together with the appropriate limits for the management of the liquidity risk.
This is the level of liquidity risk the Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations.
The key expression of the liquidity risk is through internal stress tests.
It is measured with reference to the liquidity pool compared to anticipated net stressed outflows for specific scenarios.
166 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Liquidity Risk Appetite As part of the LRA, the Group runs three short term liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the PRAs prescribed stresses: 90-day market-wide stress event 30-day Barclays-specific stress event combined 30-day market-wide and Barclays specific stress event.
Under normal market conditions, the liquidity pool is managed to be at a target of at least 100% of anticipated outflows under each of these stress scenarios.
The 30-day combined stress scenario, results in the greatest net outflows of each of the liquidity stress tests.
The combined LRA scenario has been enhanced and improved to capture a Barclays specific stress coinciding with a market stress over the full stress horizon.
As part of the LRA, Barclays also establishes the minimum LCR limit.
Barclays also evaluates its long-term LRA, one year stress test based on prolonged closure of capital markets.
Key LRA assumptions include: For the year ended 31 December 2017 Drivers of Liquidity Risk LRA Combined stress key assumptions Wholesale Secured Zero rollover of maturing wholesale unsecured funding Loss of repo capacity on non-extremely liquid repos at contractual maturity date and Unsecured Roll of repo for extremely liquid repo at wider haircut at contractual maturity date Funding Risk Withdrawal of contractual buyback obligations, excess client futures margin, Prime Brokerage client cash and overlifts Haircuts applied to the market value of marketable assets held in the liquidity buffer Retail and Corporate Retail and Corporate deposit outflows as counterparties seek to diversify their deposit balances Funding Risk Intra-day Liquidity Risk Liquidity held against intraday requirements for the settlement of cash and securities under a stress Intra-Group Liquidity Liquidity support for material subsidiaries.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a banks liquidity risk profile by holding sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days.
The NSFR has a time horizon of 12 months and has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
The CRD IV LCR became effective on 1 October 2015, with a minimum ratio requirement in the UK of 80% as at 31 December 2016: this increased to 90% on 1 January 2017 and then to 100% on 1 January 2018.
As of 31 December 2017, the Group reported a CRD IV LCR of 154% 2016: 131%.
In October 2014, the BCBS published a standard for the NSFR with the minimum requirement.
On 23 November 2016, the European Commission published draft amendments to the CRR including its proposed implementation of NSFR in the EU.
This proposal made a number of changes from the Basel NSFR, particularly in the treatment of derivative and secured financing transactions.
In October 2017, the BCBS agreed to allow national discretion for the NSFRs treatment of derivative liabilities.
Barclays continues to assess the impact of these changes on its NSFR ratio, and notes that NSFR is not proposed to be a binding regulation in the EU until two years after the European legislation is finalised.
We remain above 100% well ahead of implementation timelines, based on a conservative interpretation of the Basel rules.
Internal and regulatory liquidity stress tests The LRA short term stress scenarios and the CRD IV LCR are comparable, in the sense that adequacy of defined liquidity resources is assessed against net stressed outflows over a short term stress horizon.
The CRD IV LCR stress tests provide an independent assessment of the Groups liquidity risk profile.
Stress Test Barclays short term LRA CRD IV LCR Time Horizon 30 - 90 days 30 days Calculation Liquid assets to net cash outflows Liquid assets to net cash outflows As at December 2017, the Group held eligible liquid assets well in excess of 100% of net stress outflows for both the 30 day combined marketwide and Barclays specific LRA scenario and the LCR.

This compares to 139% 2016: 134% under the 90 day market-wide scenario and 131% 2016: 120% under the 30 day Barclays specific scenario.
b 31 December 2016 reflects the Barclays specific scenario results of 120% being the lowest ratio of the three scenarios.
LCR and LRA includes BAGL in 2016.
The Group plans to maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory stress requirements at an efficient level, while considering risks to market funding conditions and its liquidity position.
The continuous reassessment of these risks may lead to appropriate actions being taken with respect to sizing of the liquidity pool.
Liquidity pool The Group liquidity pool as at 31 December 2017 was 220bn 2016: 165bn.
During 2017, the month-end liquidity pool ranged from 165bn to 232bn 2016: 132bn to 175bn, and the month-end average balance was 202bn 2016: 153bn.
The liquidity pool is held unencumbered and is not used to support payment or clearing requirements.

In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type.
Given the incremental returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.
As at 31 December 2017, 93% 2016: 91% of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC and was available to meet liquidity needs across the Group.
The residual liquidity pool is held predominantly within Barclays Capital Inc. BCI, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
The portion of the liquidity pool outside of Barclays Bank PLC is held against entity-specific stressed outflows and regulatory requirements.
To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group.
168 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Contingent liquidity In addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
In a Barclays specific, market-wide or combined liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted.
In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at heavily discounted prices, the Group could generate liquidity via central bank facilities.
The Group maintains a significant amount of collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available to raise funding.
For more detail on the Groups other unencumbered assets see pages 171 to 173.
Funding structure and funding relationships The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a solid funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due.
The Groups overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base geographically, by type and by counterparty and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.
Within this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding.
As such, retail and corporate loans and advances are largely funded by customer deposits, with the surplus primarily funding the liquidity pool.
Other assets, together with other loans and advances to customers and unencumbered assets are funded by wholesale debt and equity.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements.
Derivative liabilities and assets are largely matched.
A substantial proportion of balance sheet derivative positions qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset once netted against cash collateral received and paid.
These funding relationships are summarised below: 2017 2016 2017 2016 Assets bn bn Liabilities bn bn a a Loans and advances to customers 313 326 Customer accounts 387 374 Group liquidity pool 220 165 1 Year wholesale funding 57 70 1 Year wholesale funding 100 88 b Other assets 89 185 Equity and other liabilities 78 151 Reverse repurchase agreements, trading Repurchase agreements, trading portfolio portfolio assets, cash collateral and liabilities, cash collateral and settlement c settlement balances 273 190 balances 273 190 Derivative financial instruments 238 347 Derivative financial instruments 238 340 Total assets 1,133 1,213 Total liabilities 1,133 1,213 Deposit funding audited 2017 2016 Loans and advances to Customer Loan to Loan to Funding of loans and advances to customers customers deposits deposit ratio deposit ratio As at 31 December 2017 bn bn % % Barclays UK 184 193 Barclays International 101 162 d Total retail and corporate funding 285 355 80% 89% Barclays International and Head Office 81 74 Total Barclays Group 366 429 85% 93% Notes a Excludes cash collateral and settlement balances.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 169 Risk review Risk performance Treasury and capital risk Liquidity Although contractually current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice, the Groups broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances.
Such accounts form a stable funding base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs.
The Group assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer assets and liabilities to identify structural balance sheet funding gaps.
Customer behaviour is determined by quantitative modelling combined with qualitative assessment taking into account historical experience, current customer composition, and macroeconomic projections.
These behavioural profiles represent our forward looking expectation of the run-off profile.

a Wholesale funding The Group maintains access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, money markets, and repo markets.
The Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and long-term investors through its clients worldwide, and is an active participant in money markets.
As a result, wholesale funding is well diversified by product, maturity, geography and major currency.
As at 31 December 2017, the Groups total wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 157.4bn 2016: 157.8bn, of which 20.4bn 2016: 25.8bn was secured funding and 137.0bn 2016: 132.0bn unsecured funding.
Unsecured funding includes 44.8bn 2016: 37.6bn of privately placed senior unsecured notes issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.
During the year, the Group issued 11.5bn equivalent of capital and senior unsecured debt from Barclays PLC the Parent company, of which 6.1bn was in public senior unsecured debt and 5.4bn in capital instruments.
In the same period, 6.1bn of Barclays Bank PLC capital and senior public term instruments either matured or were redeemed, including the $1.375bn 7.1% Series 3 USD preference shares.
b As at 31 December 2017, wholesale funding of 57.2bn 2016: 70.3bn matures in less than one year, of which 13.8bn 2016: 21.5bn relates to term funding.
Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded the wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by 163bn 2016: 95bn.
The Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt in 2018 from Barclays PLC the Parent company, in order to maintain compliance with indicative MREL requirements and maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and market.

Encumbrance Asset encumbrance arises from collateral pledged against secured funding and other collateralised obligations.
Barclays funds a portion of trading portfolio assets and other securities via repurchase agreements and other similar borrowing, and pledges a portion of customer loans and advances as collateral in securitisation, covered bond and other similar secured structures.
Barclays monitors the mix of secured and unsecured funding sources within the Groups funding plan and seeks to efficiently utilise available collateral to raise secured funding and meet other collateral requirements.
Encumbered assets have been defined consistently with the Groups reporting requirements under Article 100 of the CRR.
Securities and commodities assets are considered encumbered when they have been pledged or used to secure, collateralise or credit enhance a transaction which impacts their transferability and free use.
This includes external repurchase or other similar agreements with market counterparts.
Excluding assets positioned at central banks, as at 31 December 2017, 193bn 2016: 168bn of the Groups assets were encumbered, primarily due to cash collateral posted, firm financing of trading portfolio assets and other securities and funding secured against loans and advances to customers.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 171 Risk review Risk performance Treasury and capital risk Liquidity Assets may also be encumbered under secured funding arrangements with central banks.
In advance of such encumbrance, assets are often positioned with central banks to facilitate efficient future draw down.
70bn 2016: 63bn of on-balance sheet assets were positioned at the central banks, consisting of encumbered assets and collateral pre-positioned and available for use in secured financing transactions.
342bn 2016: 277bn of on and off balance sheet assets not positioned at the central bank were identified as readily available for use in secured financing transactions.
Additionally, they include cash and securities held in the Group liquidity pool as well as unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these additional assets are not relied upon in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
Loans and advances to customers are only classified as readily available if they are already in a form, such that, they can be used to raise funding without further management actions.
This includes excess collateral already in secured funding vehicles.
198bn 2016: 231bn of assets not positioned at the central bank were identified as available as collateral.
These assets are not subject to any restrictions on their ability to secure funding, to be offered as collateral, or to be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, but are not immediately available in the normal course of business in their current form.
They primarily consist of loans and advances which would be suitable for use in secured funding structures but are conservatively classified as not readily available because they are not in transferable form.
Not available as collateral consists of assets that cannot be pledged or used as security for funding due to restrictions that prevent their pledge or use as security for funding in the normal course of business.
Derivatives and reverse repo assets relate specifically to derivatives, reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending.
These are shown separately as these on-balance sheet assets cannot be pledged.
However, these assets can give rise to the receipt of non-cash assets which are held off-balance sheet, and can be used to raise secured funding or meet additional funding requirements.
In addition, 548bn 2016: 406bn of the total 608bn 2016: 466bn securities accepted as collateral, and held off-balance sheet, were on-pledged, the significant majority of which related to matched-book activity where reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder relates primarily to reverse repurchase agreements used to settle trading portfolio liabilities as well as collateral posted against derivatives margin requirements.

Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements Barclays enters into repurchase and other similar secured borrowing agreements to finance its trading portfolio assets.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by offsetting repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder are used to settle trading portfolio liabilities.
Due to the high quality of collateral provided against secured financing transactions, the liquidity risk associated with this activity is significantly lower than unsecured financing transactions.
Nonetheless, Barclays manages to gross and net secured mismatch limits to limit refinancing risk under a severe stress scenario and a portion of the Groups liquidity pool is held against stress outflows on these positions.
The Group secured mismatch limits are calibrated based on market capacity, liquidity characteristics of the collateral and risk appetite of the Group.
The cash value of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions will typically differ from the market value of the collateral against which these transactions are secured by an amount referred to as a haircut or .
Typical haircut levels vary depending on the quality of the collateral that underlies these transactions.
For transactions secured against extremely liquid fixed income collateral, lenders demand relatively small haircuts typically ranging from 0-2%.
For transactions secured against less liquid collateral, haircuts vary by asset class typically ranging from 5-10% for corporate bonds and other less liquid collateral.
As at 31 December 2017, the significant majority of repurchase activity related to matched-book activity.
The Group may face refinancing risk on the net maturity mismatch for matched-book activity.

Credit ratings In addition to monitoring and managing key metrics related to the financial strength of the Group, Barclays also solicits independent credit ratings from Standard & Poors Global S&P, Moodys, Fitch and Rating and Investment Information R&I.
These ratings assess the creditworthiness of the Group, its subsidiaries and branches and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial attributes including capital strength, profitability, funding, liquidity, asset quality, strategy and governance.
Credit ratings As at 31 December 2017 Standard & Poors Moodys Fitch Barclays Bank PLC Long-term A A1 A Short-term A-1 P-1 F1 Outlook Stable Negative Rating Watch Positive Barclays Bank UK PLC Long-term A prelim P A1 A EXP Short-term A-1 prelim P P-1 F1 EXP Outlook Stable Unassigned Stable Barclays PLC Long-term BBB Baa2 A Short-term A-2 P-3 F1 Outlook Stable Negative Stable All credit rating agencies took rating actions this year to assign initial ratings to Barclays Bank UK PLC in anticipation of the establishment of this entity as the UK ring-fenced bank in April 2018.
There were also rating actions on the existing entities of Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays PLC by some of the credit rating agencies as detailed below.
In September 2017, Fitch assigned an expected rating to Barclays Bank UK PLC of A, reflecting a one notch uplift from the expected standalone rating of A.
This is due to the sufficient amount of junior debt they expect to be outstanding in Barclays Bank UK PLC, referred to as qualifying junior debt QJD.
In the same rating action, Fitch revised the outlook of Barclays Bank PLC from stable to rating watch positive in anticipation of assigning QJD uplift of one notch during 2018.
In October 2017, S&P upgraded long and short-term ratings of Barclays Bank PLC by one notch to A A-1 from AA-2 as S&P finalised their view of the status of Barclays Bank PLC.
They determined that Barclays Bank PLC would remain core to the Group revising their previous expectation of a highly strategic status.
Simultaneously, Barclays Bank UK PLC was assigned a preliminary rating of A in anticipation that it too would be core to the Group.
In November 2017, S&P also revised their view of UK economic risk for the UK banking sector, which led to outlooks for Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC being revised from negative to stable.
Moodys assigned a provisional rating to Barclays Bank UK PLC in October 2017 of P A1.
The negative outlooks for Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC have remained in place since the outcome of the EU referendum in June 2016.
Since October 2017, the implementation of ring-fencing has been included in the rationale for the maintenance Barclays Bank PLCs negative outlook.
Barclays also solicits issuer ratings from R&I and the ratings of Afor Barclays PLC and A for Barclays Bank PLC were affirmed in July 2017 with stable outlooks.
A credit rating downgrade could result in outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts.
Outflows related to credit rating downgrades are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk.
Credit ratings downgrades could also result in reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs.
174 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information The contractual collateral requirement following oneand two-notch long-term and associated short-term downgrades across all credit rating agencies, would result in outflows of 4bn and 6bn respectively, and are fully reserved for in the liquidity pool.
These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements.
These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity.
However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.
Contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities The table below provides detail on the contractual maturity of all financial instruments and other assets and liabilities.
Derivatives other than those designated in a hedging relationship and trading portfolio assets and liabilities are included in the on demand column at their fair value.
Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for settlement according to such maturity and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value.
Derivatives designated in a hedging relationship are included according to their contractual maturity.
Financial assets designated at fair value in respect of linked liabilities to customers under investment contracts have been included in other assets and other liabilities as the Group is not exposed to liquidity risk arising from them: any request for funds from creditors would be met by simultaneously liquidating or transferring the related investment.
Please refer to Note 43 for details.
Expected maturity dates do not differ significantly from the contract dates, except for: trading portfolio assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments, which may not be held to maturity as part of the Groups trading strategies retail deposits, which are included within customer accounts, are repayable on demand or at short notice on a contractual basis.
In practice, these instruments form a stable base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs because of the broad base of customers both numerically and by depositor type see Behavioural maturity profile on page 170 : and financial assets designated at fair value held in respect of linked liabilities, which are managed with the associated liabilities.

More details on monitoring and managing capital risk may be found in the Risk Management sections on pages 166 to 167 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2017.
Average UK leverage ratio 4.9% Summary of performance in the period Barclays continues to be in excess of minimum transitional and end point capital requirements, and regulatory minimum leverage requirements.
The fully loaded CET1 ratio increased to 13.3% December 2016: 12.4% principally due to a reduction in risk weighted assets RWAs of 52.6bn to 313.0bn.
The sell down of Barclays holding in BAGL to 14.9%, resulting in regulatory proportional consolidation, increased the CET1 ratio by c. 60bps with a 31.1bn reduction in RWAs offset by 1.8bn reduction due to BAGL minority interests no longer being included in CET1 capital.
Losses in respect of the discontinued operation due to the impairment of Barclays holding in BAGL allocated to goodwill, and the recycling of the BAGL currency translation reserve losses to the income statement, had no impact on CET1.
The CET1 ratio increased by a further c. 50bps as a result of other RWA reductions, excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, including reductions in Non-Core.
Excluding the impacts of BAGL and foreign currency movements, CET1 capital decreased further as profits relating to continuing operations, after absorbing the impact of the US DTA re-measurement, were offset by the redemption of USD preference shares and the payment of pension deficit reduction contributions in the year.
The average UK leverage ratio increased to 4.9% December 2016: 4.5% primarily driven by the issuance of additional tier 1 capital AT1 securities, the reduction in Non-Core related exposures and due to BAGLs regulatory proportional consolidation.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 179 Risk review Risk performance Treasury and capital risk Capital Regulatory minimum capital and leverage requirements Capital Barclays end point CET1 regulatory requirement is expected to be 11.4% comprising of a 4.5% Pillar 1 minimum, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer CCB, a 1.5% Global Systemically Important Institution G-SII buffer, a 2.4% Pillar 2A requirement, and an expected 0.5% Countercyclical Capital Buffer CCyB.
The CCB and the G-SII buffer, determined by the PRA in line with guidance from the Financial Stability Board FSB, are subject to phased implementation at 25% per annum from 2016 with full effect from 2019.
The CCB has been set at 2.5% with 1.25% applicable for 2017.
The G-SII buffer for 2017 was set at 2% with 1% applicable for 2017.
On 21 November 2016, the FSB confirmed that the G-SII buffer for 2018 has been set at 1.5% with 1.1% applicable for 2018.
On 21 November 2017, the FSB confirmed that the G-SII buffer will remain at 1.5% applicable for 2019.
On 25 September 2017, the Financial Policy Committee FPC reaffirmed that it expects to increase the UK CCyB rate from 0% to 0.5% applicable from 27 June 2018 and to 1% applicable from 28 November 2018.
Based on current UK exposures, Barclays CCyB is expected to be approximately 0.5% from November 2018.
Other national authorities also determine the appropriate CCyBs that should be applied to exposures in their jurisdiction however based on current exposures these are not material.
Barclays Pillar 2A requirement as per the PRAs Individual Capital Guidance ICG for Q417 and 2018 is 4.3% of which at least 56.25% needs to be met in CET1 form, equating to approximately 2.4% of RWAs.
Certain elements of the Pillar 2A requirement are a fixed quantum while others are a proportion of RWAs and are based on a point in time assessment.
The Pillar 2A requirement is subject to at least annual review.
For regulatory reporting purposes, BAGL is treated on a proportional consolidation basis based on Barclays holding in BAGL of 14.9%.
The CRD IV CET1 transitional minimum capital requirement for 2017 is 9.2% which comprised of a 4.5% Pillar 1 minimum, a 2.4% Pillar 2A requirement, a 1.25% CCB, a 1% G-SII buffer and a 0% CCyB.
Leverage In October 2017, following the FPC recommendation, the PRA increased the minimum requirement for the UK leverage ratio from 3% to 3.25%.
Barclays is subject to a leverage ratio requirement that is implemented on a phased basis, with a transitional requirement of 3.6% as at 31 December 2017: this comprises the 3.25% minimum requirement, a transitional G-SII additional leverage ratio buffer G-SII ALRB of 0.35% and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer CCLB which is currently nil.
Although the leverage ratio is expressed in terms of tier 1 capital, 75% of the minimum requirement, equating to 2.4375%, needs to be met with CET1 capital.
In addition, the G-SII ALRB and CCLB must be covered solely with CET1 capital.
The CET1 capital held against the 0.35% transitional G-SII ALRB was 3.4bn.
The fully loaded expected end point UK leverage requirement is 4.0%.

d As at 31 December 2017, Barclays fully loaded tier 1 capital was 50,376m, and the fully loaded tier 1 ratio was 16.1%.
Fully loaded total regulatory capital was 64,646m and the fully loaded total capital ratio was 20.7%.
The fully loaded tier 1 capital and total capital measures are calculated without applying the transitional provisions set out in CRD IV and assessing compliance of AT1 and T2 instruments against the relevant criteria in CRD IV.
e Of the 12.3bn transitional AT1 capital, fully loaded AT1 capital comprises the 8.9bn of contingent convertible instruments issued by Barclays PLC the holding company and related share premium accounts, and 0.1bn capital deductions.
It excludes 3.5bn legacy tier 1 capital instruments issued by subsidiaries that are subject to grandfathering.
For the leverage ratio, only the AT1 capital on a fully loaded basis is applicable.

The discontinued operation losses, resulting from the impairment of Barclays holding in BAGL allocated to goodwill and the recycling of BAGL currency translation reserve losses to the income statement, had no impact on CET1 capital with offsetting movements in the goodwill and intangible assets deduction and other qualifying reserves a 1.0bn decrease for dividends paid and foreseen a 0.4bn increase in the available for sale reserve primarily due to gains from changes in fair value on BAGLs remaining shares held as available for sale The currency translation reserve remained flat in the year largely due to the 1.4bn recycling of BAGL losses to the income statement which were offset by a 1.3bn decrease driven by the depreciation of period end USD against GBP a 0.9bn decrease in other reserves which included a 0.5bn decrease as a result of USD preference share redemptions and 0.4bn of separation payments in relation to the sale of Barclays holding in BAGL a 0.6bn decrease net of tax as a result of movements relating to pensions.
The pension asset capital deduction increase relates to the UK Retirement Fund, which is the Groups main pension scheme, moving from a small deficit in December 2016 to a 1.0bn surplus largely due to payment deficit contributions a 1.8bn decrease due to BAGL minority interests which are no longer eligible as a result of proportional consolidation of BAGL a 1.1bn increase due to a reduced goodwill and intangible assets deduction largely as a result of the impairment of Barclays holding in BAGL allocated to goodwill.

Both approaches exclude qualifying claims on central banks from the leverage exposures.
Barclays is also required to disclose a Capital Requirements Regulation CRR leverage ratio, which is based on the end point CRR definition of tier 1 capital and the CRR definition of leverage exposure.

The average UK leverage ratio increased to 4.9% December 2016: 4.5% primarily driven by the issuance of AT1 securities, the reduction in Non-Core related exposures and due to BAGLs regulatory proportional consolidation.
The CRR leverage ratio decreased to 4.5% December 2016: 4.6%.
The difference between the average UK leverage ratio and the CRR leverage ratio movement is primarily driven by an increase in cash at central banks, which are excluded from the UK leverage ratio calculation.
Additionally, the year end fully loaded tier 1 capital is lower than the average due to the re-measurement of US DTAs as a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December: loans and advances and other assets increased by 7bn to 714bn.
This was primarily due to a 69bn increase in cash and balances at central banks largely driven by an increase in the cash contribution to the Group liquidity pool mainly exempt under UK leverage rules, and a 70bn decrease in assets held for sale driven by the sell down of Barclays holding in BAGL reverse repurchase agreements increased 36bn to 112bn, primarily due to an increase in matched book trading net derivative leverage exposures decreased 33bn to 166bn due to a reduction in interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, the rundown of Non-Core related assets, a decrease in cash collateral and the depreciation of period end USD and JPY against GBP regulatory consolidation adjustments increased 14bn to 8bn primarily due to the proportional consolidation of BAGL following the sell down of Barclays holding weighted off-balance sheet commitments decreased 16bn to 103bn primarily due to the proportional consolidation of BAGL following the sell down of Barclays holding.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Foreign exchange risk audited The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk.
a Transactional foreign currency exposure Transactional foreign currency exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity.
The Groups risk management policies prohibit the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside the trading portfolio managed by Barclays International which is monitored through VaR.
Banking book transactional foreign exchange risk outside of Barclays International is monitored on a daily basis by the market risk function and minimised by the businesses.
b Translational foreign exchange exposure The Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies, principally USD and EUR.
Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.
The Groups strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the Groups foreign currency RWA exposures.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2017 185 Risk review Risk performance Treasury and capital risk Capital Pension risk review The UK Retirement Fund UKRF represents approximately 96 2016: 96 of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations globally.
As such this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF.
The UKRF is closed to new entrants and there is no new final salary benefit being accrued.
Existing active members accrue a combination of a cash balance benefit and a defined contribution element.
Pension risk arises as the market value of the pension fund assets may decline, investment returns may reduce or the estimated value of the pension liabilities may increase.
See page 167 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2017 for more information on how pension risk is managed.
Assets The Trustee Board of the UKRF defines its overall long-term investment strategy with investments across a broad range of asset classes.
This results in an appropriate mix of return seeking assets as well as liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations.
The main market risks within the asset portfolio are against interest rates and equities.
The split of scheme assets is shown within Note 35.
The fair value of the UKRF assets was 30.1bn as at 31 December 2017 2016: 31.8bn.
Liabilities The UKRF retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19 basis these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term price inflation rate RPI and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve : An increase in long-term expected inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities A decrease in the discount rate corresponds to an increase in liabilities.
Pension risk is generated through the Groups defined benefit schemes and this risk is set to reduce over time as the main defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants.
The chart below outlines the shape of the UKRFs liability cash flow profile as at 31 December 2017 that takes account of the future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries.
The majority of the cash flows approximately 88 fall between 0 and 40 years, peaking between 11 and 20 years and reducing thereafter.
The shape may vary depending on changes to inflation and longevity expectations and any members who elect to transfer out.
Transfers out will bring forward the liability cash flows.
For more detail on the UKRFs financial and demographic assumptions see Note 35 to the financial statements.
Proportion of liability cash flows IAS19 Pension Position in 2017 2 UKRF surplus deficit bn 0-10 years 19.4% 11-20 years 26.4% 21-30 years 25.3% 31-40 years 16.8% 41-50 years 9.1% 51 years 3.0% -2 Q4 2015 Q4 2016 Q4 2017 The graph above shows the UKRFs net IAS 19 pension position for each quarter-end for the past two years.
The volatility shown by the fluctuation in the net IAS 19 pension position is reflective of the movements observed in the market.
In Q2 2016, the UKRF IAS 19 position deteriorated as the AA discount rate moved lower, driven by both a decrease in long dated government bond yields as well as a tightening in credit spreads.
During H2 2016, this trend continued driven by the outcome of the EU Referendum in June as well as the Bank of Englands announcement on quantitative easing in August.
These events drove significant market moves adversely affecting the UKRF AA discount rate.
For example the market index IBOXXCorp AA yield was 53bps lower between June and September.
Gilt yields reverted higher in the months following September 2016 which was also reflected in a higher AA discount rate.
As a result the net IAS 19 position ended 2016 close to zero.
During 2017, the net improvement in the IAS 19 position was largely driven by bank contributions.
Changes to market levels, in particular equity prices and interest rates, largely offset each other over the year.
Please see Note 35 for the sensitivity of the UKRF to changes in key assumptions.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Risk measurement In line with Barclays risk management framework the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility of the pension positions on a total portfolio level.
This enables the risks, diversification and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations and investments to be adequately captured.
VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis.
Risks are reviewed and reported regularly at forums including the Board Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee, the Pensions Management Group and the Pension Executive Board.
The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities based on an IAS 19 basis see Note 35.
The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.
The pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are reviewed regularly.
See Note 35 for more details.
In addition the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process.
Stress testing is performed internally on at least an annual basis.
The UKRF exposure is also included as part of regulatory stress tests.
Barclays defined benefit pension schemes affects capital in two ways: An IAS 19 deficit is treated as a liability on the Groups balance sheet.
Movement in a deficit due to re-measurements, including actuarial losses, are recognised immediately through Other Comprehensive Income and as such reduces shareholders equity and CET1 capital.
An IAS 19 surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders equity: however it is deducted for the purposes of determining CET1 capital.
In the Groups statutory balance sheet an IAS 19 surplus or deficit is partially offset by a deferred tax liability or asset respectively.
These may or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of the Group at the particular time.
Pension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually.
The Pillar 2A requirement forms part of the Groups overall regulatory minimum requirement for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital.
More detail on minimum regulatory requirements can be found in the capital risk management section on page 166 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2017.
Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities MREL Under the Bank of Englands statement of policy on MREL, the BoE will set MREL for UK globally systemically important banks G-SIBs as necessary to implement the total loss absorbing capacity TLAC standard and institution or group-specific MREL requirements will depend on the preferred resolution strategy for that institution or group.
The MREL requirements will be phased in from 1 January 2019 and will be fully implemented by 1 January 2022, at which time G-SIBs with resolution entities incorporated in the UK, including Barclays, will be required to meet an MREL equivalent to the higher of i two times the sum of its Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements or ii the higher of two times its leverage ratio or 6.75% of leverage exposures.

The sensitivity has been measured using the Annual Earnings at Risk AEaR methodology as described on page 168 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2017.
Note that this metric assumes an instantaneous parallel change to interest rate forward curves.
The model floors shocked market rates at zero: changes in Net Interest Income NII sensitivity are only observed where forward rates are greater than zero.
The main model assumptions are: i one year time horizon: ii balance sheet is held constant: iii balances are adjusted for assumed behavioural profiles e. g. considers that customers may remortgage before the contractual maturity : and iv behavioural assumptions are kept unchanged in all rate scenarios.

EC is predominantly calculated using a VaR model using a 99% confidence interval aligning to other regulatory submissions.

The year on year movement in cash flow hedge reserve sensitivities was driven by structural changes in business activities and related hedging.
Movements in the available for sale reserve would impact CRD I fully loaded CET1 capital, however the movement in the cash flow hedge reserve would not impact CET1 capital.
Volatility of the Available for Sale portfolio in the liquidity pool Changes in value of Available for Sale exposures flow directly through capital via the Available for Sale reserve.
The volatility of the value of the Available for Sale investments in the Liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i. e. the Non-Traded Market Risk VaR.
Although the underlying methodology to calculate the non-traded VaR is identical to the one used in Traded Management VaR, the two measures are not directly comparable.
The Non-Traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the Available for Sale exposures.
These exposures are in the banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.
