Risk and Capital Management 5 Risk and Capital Management Insurance risk The Group is exposed to risks arising from insurance contracts as set out below: A Underwriting risk B Reserving risk A Underwriting risk Underwriting risk refers to the risk that claims arising are higher or lower than assumed in pricing due to bad experience including catastrophes, weakness in controls over underwriting or portfolio management, or claims management issues.
The majority of underwriting risk to which the Group is exposed is of a short-term nature, and generally does not exceed 12 months.
The Groups underwriting strategy aims to ensure that the underwritten risks are well diversified in terms of the type, amount of risk, and geography in order to ensure that the Group minimises the volatility of its insurance result.
Underwriting limits are in place to enforce appropriate risk selection criteria and pricing with all of the Groups underwriters having specific licences that set clear parameters for the business they can underwrite, based on their expertise.
The Group has developed enhanced methods of recording exposures and concentrations of risk and has a centrally managed forum looking at Group underwriting issues, reviewing and agreeing underwriting direction and setting policy and directives where appropriate.
The Group has a quarterly portfolio management process across all its business units where key risk indicators are tracked to monitor emerging trends, opportunities and risks.
This provides greater control of exposures in high risk areas as well as enabling a prompt response to adverse claims development.
Pricing for the Groups products is generally based upon historical claims frequencies and claims severity averages, adjusted for inflation and modelled catastrophes, trended forward to recognise anticipated changes in claims patterns after making allowance for other costs incurred by the Group, conditions in the insurance market and a profit loading that adequately covers the cost of capital.
Decisions on how much insurance risk to pass on to other insurers through the use of reinsurance is another key strategy employed in managing the Groups exposure to insurance risk.
The Group Board determines a maximum and the Group Corporate Centre determines a minimum level of risk to be retained by the Group as a whole and, therefore, the amount of central reinsurance cover purchased.
This is then distributed across the Group in accordance with deemed risk appetite.
Local operations may also purchase additional reinsurance within agreed local reinsurance appetite parameters.
Reinsurance arrangements in place include proportional, excess of loss, stop loss, catastrophe and adverse development coverage.
These arrangements aim to prevent the Group suffering total net insurance losses beyond the Groups risk appetite in any one year.
The Group remains primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured, although the reinsurer is liable to the Group to the extent of the insurance risk it has contractually accepted responsibility for.
B Reserving risk Reserving risk refers to the risk that the Groups estimates of future claims payments will be insufficient.
The Group establishes a provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the anticipated costs of all losses that have already occurred but have not yet been paid.
Such estimates are made for losses already reported to the Group as well as for the losses that have already occurred but are not yet reported losses together with a provision for the future costs of handling and settling the outstanding claims.
There is a risk to the Group from the inherent uncertainty in estimating provisions at the end of the reporting period for the eventual outcome of outstanding notified claims as well as estimating the number and value of claims that are still to be notified.
The Group seeks to reduce its reserving risk through the use of experienced regional actuaries who estimate the actuarial indication of the required reserves based on claims experience, business volume, anticipated change in the claims environment and claims cost.
This information is used by local reserving committees to recommend to the Group Reserving Committee the appropriate level of reserves for each region.
This will include adding a margin onto the actuarial indication as a provision for unforeseen developments such as future claims patterns differing from historical experience, future legislative changes and the emergence of latent exposures.
The Group Reserving Committee review these local submissions and recommend the final level of reserves to be held by the Group.
The Group has a Group Reserving Committee which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer and includes the Group Chief Executive, Group Underwriting Director, Group Chief Actuary and Group Chief Risk Officer.
A similar committee has been established in each of the Groups primary operating segments.
The Group Reserving Committee monitors the decisions and judgements made by the business units as to the level of reserves to be held.
It then recommends to the Group Board via the Group Audit Committee the final decision on the level of reserves to be included within the consolidated financial statements.
In forming its collective judgement, the Committee considers the following information: The actuarial indication of ultimate losses together with an assessment of risks and possible favourable or adverse developments that may not have been fully reflected in calculating these indications.
At the end of 2017, these risks and developments include: the possibility of future legislative change having retrospective effect on open claims: changes in claims settlement procedures potentially leading to future claims payment patterns differing from historical experience: the possibility of new types of claim, such as disease claims, emerging from business written several years ago: general uncertainty in the claims environment: the emergence of latent exposures: the outcome of litigation on claims received: failure to recover reinsurance and unanticipated changes in claims inflation: 118 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements The views of internal peer reviewers of the reserves and of other parties including actuaries, legal counsel, risk directors, underwriters and claims managers: The outcome from independent assurance reviews performed by the Group actuarial function to assess the reasonableness of regional actuarial indication estimates: How previous actuarial indications have developed.
Financial risk Financial risk refers to the risk of financial loss predominantly arising from investment transactions entered into by the Group, and also to a lesser extent arising from insurance contracts, and includes the following risks: Credit risk: Market risk including price, interest rate and currency rate risks: Liquidity risk.
The Group undertakes a number of strategies to manage these risks including the use of derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and long term inflation.
The Group does not use derivatives to leverage its exposure to markets and does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The policy on use of derivatives is approved by the Board Risk Committee BRC.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a counterparty to honour its financial or contractual obligations to the Group.
The Groups credit risk exposure is largely concentrated in its fixed income investment portfolio and to a lesser extent, its premium receivables, and reinsurance assets.
Credit risk is managed at both a Group level and at a local level.
Local operations are responsible for assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of their counterparties e. g. brokers and policyholders.
Local credit committees are responsible for ensuring these exposures are within the risk appetite of the local operations.
Exposure monitoring and reporting for fixed income investments and premium receivables is embedded throughout the organisation with aggregate credit positions reported and monitored at Group level.
The Groups credit risk strategy appetite and credit risk policy are developed by the BRC and are reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis.
This is done through the setting of Group policies, procedures and limits.
In defining its appetite for credit risk the Group looks at exposures at both an aggregate and business unit level, distinguishing between credit risks incurred as a result of offsetting insurance risks or operating in the insurance market e. g. reinsurance credit risks and risks to receiving premiums due from policyholders and intermediaries and credit risks incurred for the purposes of generating a return e. g. invested assets credit risk.
Limits are set at both a portfolio and counterparty level based on likelihood of default, derived from the rating of the counterparty, to ensure that the Groups overall credit profile and specific concentrations are managed and controlled within risk appetite.
The Groups investment management strategy primarily focuses on debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and seeks to limit the overall credit exposure with respect to any one issuer by ensuring limits have been based upon credit quality.
Restrictions are placed on each of the Groups investment managers as to the level of exposure to various rating categories including unrated securities.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk from the use of reinsurance in the event that a reinsurer fails to settle its liability to the Group.
The Group Reinsurance Credit Committee oversees the management of credit risk arising from the reinsurer failing to settle its liability to the Group.
Group standards are set such that reinsurers that have a financial strength rating of less than Awith Standard & Poors, or a comparable rating, are removed from the Groups authorised list of approved reinsurers unless the Groups internal review discovers exceptional circumstances in favour of the reinsurer.
Collateral is taken, where appropriate, to mitigate exposures to acceptable levels.
At 31 December 2017 the extent of collateral held by the Group against reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities was 585m 2016: 159m, which in the event of a default would be called and recognised on the balance sheet.
The increase reflects the UK Legacy reinsurance arrangement announced on 7 February 2017 which is fully collateralised.
The Groups use of reinsurance is sufficiently diversified that it is not concentrated on a single reinsurer, or any single reinsurance contract.
The Group regularly monitors its aggregate exposures by reinsurer group against predetermined reinsurer Group limits, in accordance with the methodology agreed by the BRC.
The Groups largest reinsurance exposures to active reinsurance groups are Berkshire Hathaway, Lloyds of London and Talanx.
At 31 December 2017 the reinsurance asset recoverable from these groups does not exceed 3.9% 2016: 2.4% of the Groups total financial assets.
Stress tests are performed by reinsurer counterparty and the limits are set such that in a catastrophic event, the exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 6.4% 2016: 6.1% of the Groups total financial assets.
The credit profile of the Groups assets exposed to credit risk is shown below.
The credit rating bands are provided by independent rating agencies.
The table below sets out the Groups aggregated credit risk exposure for its financial and insurance assets.

Market risk arises in our operations due to the possibility that fluctuations in the value of liabilities are not offset by fluctuations in the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses.
Market risk is subject to the Board Risk Committee risk management framework, which is subject to review and approval by the Board.
Market risk can be further broken down into three key components: i.
Equity and property risk The Group classifies its investment portfolio in debt securities and equity securities in accordance with the accounting definitions under IFRS.
At 31 December 2017 the Group held investments classified as equity securities of 764m 2016: 692m.
These include interests in structured entities as disclosed in note 27 and other investments where the price risk arises from interest rate risk rather than from equity market price risk.
The Group considers that within equity securities, investments with a fair value of 242m 2016: 170m may be more affected by equity index market price risk than by interest rate risk.
On this basis a 15% fall in the value of equity index prices would result in the recognition of losses of 36m 2016: 26m in other comprehensive income.
In addition the Group holds investments in properties and in group occupied properties which are subject to property price risk.
A decrease of 15% in property prices would result in the recognition of losses of 46m 2016: 50m in the income statement and 5m 2016: 5m in other comprehensive income.
RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 121 Risk and Capital Management continued This analysis assumes that there is no correlation between interest rate and property market rate risks.
It also assumes that all other assets and liabilities remain unchanged and that no management action is taken.
This analysis does not represent managements view of future market change, but reflects managements view of key sensitivities.
This analysis is presented gross of the corresponding tax credits charges.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on insurance liabilities.
This impacts both the fair value and amount of variable returns on existing assets as well as the cost of acquiring new fixed maturity investments.
Given the composition of the Groups investments as at 31 December 2017, the table below illustrates the impact to the income statement and other comprehensive income of a hypothetical 100bps change in interest rates on fixed income securities and cash that are subject to interest rate risk.
Changes in the income statement and other comprehensive income OCI : Increase in income Decrease in other statement comprehensive income 2017 2016 2017 2016 m m m m Increase in interest rate markets: Impact on fixed income securities and cash of an increase in interest rates of 100bps 18 20 412 452 The Group manages interest rate risk by holding investment assets predominantly fixed income that generate cash flows which broadly match the duration of expected claim settlements and other associated costs.
The sensitivity of the fixed interest securities of the Group has been modelled by reference to a reasonable approximation of the average interest rate sensitivity of the investments held within each of the portfolios.
The effect of movement in interest rates is reflected as a one time rise of 100bps on 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2017 on the following years income statement and other comprehensive income.
The impact of an increase in interest rates on the fair value of fixed income securities that would be initially recognised in OCI will reduce over time as the maturity date approaches.
Currency risk The Group incurs exposure to currency risk in two ways: Operational currency risk by holding investments and other assets and by underwriting and incurring liabilities in currencies other than the currency of the primary environment in which the business units operate the Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that can impact both its profitability and the reported value of such assets and liabilities: Structural currency risk by investing in overseas subsidiaries the Group is exposed to the risk that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact the reported profitability of foreign operations to the Group, and the value of its net investment in foreign operations Operational currency risk is principally managed within the Groups individual operations by broadly matching assets and liabilities by currency and liquidity.
Operational currency risk is not significant.
Structural currency risk is managed at a Group level through currency forward contracts and foreign exchange options within predetermined limits set by the Group Investment Committee.
In managing structural currency risk the needs of the Groups subsidiaries to maintain net assets in local currencies to satisfy local regulatory solvency and internal risk based capital requirements are taken into account.
These assets should prove adequate to support local insurance activities irrespective of exchange rate movements but may affect the value of the consolidated shareholders equity expressed in sterling.
At 31 December 2017, the Groups total shareholders equity deployed by currency was: Danish Pounds Krone Canadian Swedish Sterling Euro Dollar Krona Other Total m m m m m m Shareholders equity at 31 December 2017 2,607 414 506 201 222 3,950 Shareholders equity at 31 December 2016 2,516 284 477 236 202 3,715 Shareholders equity is stated after taking account of the effect of currency forward contracts and foreign exchange options.
The analysis aggregates the Danish Krone exposure and the Euro exposure as the Danish Krone continues to be pegged closely to the Euro.
The Group considers this aggregate exposure when reviewing its hedging strategy.
122 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements The table below illustrates the impact of a hypothetical 10% change in Danish Krone Euro, Canadian Dollar or Swedish Krona exchange rates on shareholders equity when retranslating into sterling: 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% strengthening weakening in strengthening weakening in strengthening weakening in in Pounds Pounds in Pounds Pounds in Pounds Pounds Sterling Sterling Sterling Sterling Sterling Sterling against against against against against Danish against Danish Canadian Canadian Swedish Swedish Krone Euro Krone Euro Dollar Dollar Krona Krona m m m m m m Movement in shareholders equity at 31 December 2017 38 46 46 56 18 22 Movement in Shareholders equity at 31 December 2016 25 31 43 53 21 26 Changes arising from the retranslation of foreign subsidiaries net asset positions from their primary currencies into Sterling are taken through the foreign currency translation reserve and so consequently these movements in exchange rates have no impact on profit.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the risk of loss to the Group as a result of assets not being available in a form that can immediately be converted into cash, and therefore the consequence of not being able to pay its obligations when due.
To help mitigate this risk, the BRC sets limits on assets held by the Group designed to match the maturities of its assets to that of its liabilities.
A large proportion of investments are maintained in short-term less than one year highly liquid securities, which are used to manage the Groups operational requirements based on actuarial assessment and allowing for contingencies.
The following table summarises the contractual repricing or maturity dates, whichever is earlier.

The capital and interest payable on the bonds and notes have been included until the dates on which the Group has the option to call the instruments and the interest rates are reset.
For further information on terms of the bonds and notes, see note 35.
Pension risk The Group is exposed to risks through its obligation to fund a number of schemes.
These risks include market risk assets not performing as well as expected, inflation risk and mortality risk over the lives of the members.
The Group and trustees of the schemes work together to reduce these risks through agreement of investment policy including the use of interest rate, inflation rate and mortality swaps.
Further information on the Groups management of pension risk is included within note 38.
Capital management It is a key regulatory requirement that the Group maintains sufficient capital to support its exposure to risk.
Accordingly, the Groups capital management strategy is closely linked to its monitoring and management of risk.
The Groups capital objectives consist of striking the right balance between the need to support claims liabilities and ensure the confidence of policyholders, exposure to other risks, support competitive pricing strategies, meet regulatory capital requirements, and providing adequate returns for its shareholders.
The Groups overall capital position is primarily comprised of shareholders equity, Tier 1 notes and subordinated loan capital and aims to maximise shareholder value, while maintaining financial strength and maintaining adequate regulatory capital.
In addition the Group also aims to hold sufficient capital so as to maintain its single A credit rating.
The Group operates in many countries, and its regulated entities hold appropriate levels of capital to satisfy applicable local regulations.
Compliance with local regulatory requirements is embedded within the BRC mandate, for the protection of the Groups policyholders and the continuation of the Groups ability to underwrite.
124 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements Regulatory solvency position during 2017 The Groups Solvency II Internal Model was approved by the PRA in December 2015 and forms the basis of the primary Solvency II solvency capital ratio SCR measure.
The Internal Model is used to support, inform and improve the Groups decision making across the Group.
It is used to determine the Groups optimum capital structure, its investment and hedging strategy, its reinsurance programme and to determine the pricing and target returns for each portfolio.
At 31 December 2017, the estimated SCR and corresponding eligible own funds were as follows: Unaudited 2017 2016 bn bn Eligible own funds 2.9 2.9 SCR 1.8 1.8 Coverage unrounded 163% 158% The impact on the Solvency II coverage ratio of a range of sensitivities is set out below: Unaudited Unaudited 2017 2017 Including Excluding pensions pensions Solvency II Sensitivities change in coverage ratio : 1 Interest rates: 1% non-parallel shift 11% 6% 1 Interest rates: -1% non-parallel shift 10% 7% Equities: -15% 8% 2% Property: -10% 3% 2% Foreign exchange: GBP 10% vs all currencies 3% 4% Cat loss of 75m net 4% 4% 2 Credit spreads: 0.25% parallel shift 4% 2% Credit spreads: -0.25% parallel shift 14% 3% Notes: 1.
Interest rate sensitivities use a non-parallel shift to reflect that the long end of the yield curve is typically more stable than the short end.
The IAS 19 surplus cap will dampen upside credit spread sensitivities, so these should not be extrapolated.
The above sensitivities have been considered in isolation.
Should sensitivities impact in combination there may be some natural offsets between them.

RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2017 125 Risk and Capital Management continued Own risk and solvency assessment ORSA The Solvency II directive introduced a requirement for undertakings to conduct an ORSA.
The Group defines its ORSA as a series of inter-related activities by which it establishes: The quantity and quality of the risks which it seeks to assume or to which it is exposed: The level of capital required to support those risks: The actions it will take to achieve and maintain the desired levels of risk and capital.
The assessment considers both the current position and the positions that may arise during the planning horizon of the Group typically the next three years.
It looks at both the expected outcome and the outcome arising when the plan assumptions do not materialise as expected.
The assessments of how much risk to assume and how much capital to hold are inextricably linked.
In some situations, it may be desirable to increase the amount of risk assumed or retained in order to make the most efficient use of capital available or else to return excess capital to capital providers.
In other situations, where the risks assumed give rise to a capital requirement that is greater than the capital immediately available to support those risks, it will be necessary either to reduce the risk assumed or to obtain additional capital.
The assessment of risk and solvency needs is in principle carried out continuously.
In practice, the assessment consists of a range of specific activities and decisions carried out at different times of the year as part of an annual cycle, supplemented as necessary by ad hoc assessments of the impact of external events and developments and of internal business proposals.
Papers are presented to the Board throughout the year dealing with individual elements that make up the ORSA.
The information contained in those papers and the associated decisions taken are summarised in an annual ORSA report, which is submitted to the Groups regulators as part of the normal supervisory process.
The ORSA is approved by the BRC.
