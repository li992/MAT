FY17 has seen IG continue to innovate and improve to ensure it serves clients via a channel of the clients choice.
IG has also increased its client facing headcount and improved its payments process, which has historically been a point of friction for clients.
These measures have resulted in 92% of clients rating IG good or very good.
