Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 161 SECTION 7 Risk management This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.
7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the risk management committees as explained in principal risks and uncertainties page 51 which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with the Groups trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable wood bre and pellets and other fuels, and the price of CO emissions allowances.
Price variations and market cycles have historically 2 influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO emissions allowances when profitable to do so.
All 2 commitments to sell power under xed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either xed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources.
All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a xed price, and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for xed price amounts, are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.
The Group purchases CO emissions allowances under xed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and 2 international sources.
All commitments to purchase CO emissions allowances under xed price contracts are designated as cash flow 2 hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO emissions allowances.
2 Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance sheet date.
The analysis is based on the Groups commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease increase by 1.5 million 2016: profit after tax would increase decrease by 3.4 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to oil derivatives: and the hedge reserve would increase decrease by 5.6 million 2016: increase decrease by 36.3 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, principally in relation to its net debt to the extent arising from floating rate debt instruments.
Historically, the Group has sought to mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities.
The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date: however, this risk management tool remains available to the Group.
Information about the Groups instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided below.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups loss after tax and net assets for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease increase by 2.2million 2016: profit after tax would decrease increase by 1.8 million as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period.
Foreign currency risk Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into principally in order to hedge purchases of fuel for use in the Power Generation business.
These purchases are typically denominated in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars or Euros.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts.
The Group enters into both forward currency purchase and currency option contracts to manage its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period for both contracted and forecast transactions.
162 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT 7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Foreign currency sensitivity If Sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would increase decrease by 351.1 million 285.5 million 2016: profit after tax would decrease increase by 252.6million 277.7 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts: and other equity reserves would decrease increase by 111.1million 122.8million 2016: decrease increase by 78.7 million 87 million as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and nancing commitments.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.
As at 31 December 2017 Within 3 months 3 months 1 year 1 year Total m m m m Term loan, gross value 1.6 41.7 43.3 Revolving credit facilities, gross value 18.7 18.7 Loan notes, gross value 2.2 21.9 637.2 661.3 Finance lease liabilities, carrying value 0.1 0.8 0.9 Borrowings, contractual maturity 20.9 23.6 679.7 724.3 Trade and other payables 525.2 204.8 6.5 736.5 546.1 228.4 686.3 1,460.8 As at 31 December 2016 Within 3 months 3 months 1 year 1 year Total m m m m Term loans, gross value 3.0 46.7 326.7 376.4 Finance lease liabilities, carrying value 0.1 0.1 1.0 1.2 Borrowings, contractual maturity 3.1 46.8 327.7 377.6 Trade and other payables 400.1 181.7 10.1 591.9 403.2 228.5 337.8 969.5 Interest payments are calculated based on forward interest rates estimated at the balance sheet date using publicly available information.
The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on our term loans was 4.38% 2016: 4.17%.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked to market, based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows.
Where the amount payable or receivable is not xed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date.
As at 31 December 2017 Within 1 year 12 years 2 years Total m m m m Commodity contracts, net 161.9 69.4 16.6 247.9 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts, net 1,104.0 1,173.9 2,331.0 4,608.8 1,265.9 1,243.3 2,347.6 4,856.7 As at 31 December 2016 Within 1 year 12 years 2 years Total m m m m Commodity contracts, net 78.7 25.1 14.2 39.4 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts, net 903.5 870.9 1,696.5 3,470.9 982.2 845.8 1,682.3 3,510.3 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 163 7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED In managing liquidity risk, the Group has access to facilities that enable it to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain of its receivables principally those related to ROC sales and retail power sales.
Each of these facilities is provided on a non-recourse basis and accordingly receivables sold under each facility are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale.
The impact on the Groups cash flows is detailed in note 4.4.
Counterparty risk As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of currency, coal, sustainable compressed wood pellets and other goods and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers.
If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers.
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk prole of the Group.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: As at 31 December 2017 2016 m m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 222.3 228.4 Trade and other receivables 409.2 296.9 Other xed asset investments 1.3 Derivative financial instruments 366.2 891.3 999.0 1,416.6 Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of 28.2 million 2016: 4.0 million.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees.
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral.
In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board-approved policies.
These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity prole.
Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity excluding the hedge reserve, plus net debt.
Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in note4.2.
As at 31 December 2017 2016 m m Borrowings 589.7 321.9 Cash and cash equivalents 222.3 228.4 Net debt 367.4 93.5 Total shareholders equity, excluding hedge reserve 1,594.1 1,739.8 164 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO 2 emissions allowances to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial forward and option contracts principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives to x Sterling cash flows.
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business, including commodity price risk and foreign currency risk see note 7.1.
A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model.
Our policy is to x exposures to commodity price movements andchanges in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above.
This strategy aims to fide-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future.
As at 31 December 2017, due to the strengthening of Sterling against the USDollar, the fair value of our forward derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies principally for the purpose of xing the Sterling cost of sustainable compressed wood pellet purchases, decreased to 160.0 million 2016:527.8 million.
The strengthening in Sterling during 2017 partially reversed the significant mark to market gains posted during 2016 asits value fell following the Brexit vote.
Accounting policy At the balance sheet date all contracts subject to certain exemptions described below must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualies as an effective hedge under IFRS see note 7.4.
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting.
This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO emissions allowances and 2 forward foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39 and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve note 7.4 to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met.
The Group enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges, regardless of whether the specic criteria for hedge accounting are met.
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classied as current assets or liabilities.
Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classied as non-current assets or liabilities.
The location in the consolidated financial statements of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in 2017 is summarised in the table below: Gains losses Gains losses on contracts on contracts Accounting treatment for gains in 2017 in 2016 losses in the consolidated Accounting for derivative contracts m m financial statements Commodity contracts Power 3.8 88.6 Hedge reserve Coal from international sources 0.8 5.6 Income statement Coal from domestic sources n a n a Own-use exemption Biomass n a n a Own-use exemption CO emissions allowances 11.0 2.7 Hedge reserve 2 Gas 0.1 76.5 Income statement Financial contracts Foreign currency exchange contracts 234.6 241.9 Income statement 225.6 384.1 Hedge reserve Financial coal 12.9 13.7 Income statement 1.5 37.3 Hedge reserve Financial oil and other financial products 66.3 19.5 Income statement Total net losses in hedge reserve 209.3 330.1 Total net losses in income statement 156.1 176.8 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 165 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED significant estimation uncertainty The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates.
The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model.
Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements.
The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
Fair value accounting Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO emissions allowances, financial coal, 2 financial oil, gas collectively Commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value as follows: As at 31 December 2017 As at 31 December 2016 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Commodity contracts: Less than one year 60.5 79.3 91.1 164.0 More than one year but not more than two years 8.4 14.4 9.8 51.7 More than two years 0.5 1.1 1.9 7.5 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts: Less than one year 115.0 30.3 313.9 87.0 More than one year but not more than two years 85.5 20.0 185.8 26.0 More than two years 96.3 58.7 288.8 27.3 Total 366.2 203.8 891.3 363.5 Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts 8.9 15.5 11.7 59.2 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 181.8 78.7 474.6 53.3 Total non-current portion 190.7 94.2 486.3 112.5 Current portion 175.5 109.6 405.0 251.0 The total reduction in the fair value of these contracts of 365.4 million 2016: 506.9 million gain is recognised in the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m Unrealised losses gains on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 156.1 176.8 Unrealised losses gains on derivative contracts recognised in the hedge reserve note 7.4 209.3 330.1 Total unrealised losses gains on derivative contracts 365.4 506.9 We maintain a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the Sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in foreign currencies.
The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US Dollars.
As noted on page164, the unrealised losses reflect the strengthening of Sterling against the US Dollar in the year.
166 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IAS 39 and thus the gains on these contracts were recognised in the income statement.
Unrealised losses recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect losses on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Fair value measurement Commodity contracts fair value The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Other financial contracts fair value The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives.
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
We are required by IFRS to categorise our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on which their fair values have been determined: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The fair value of commodity contracts, forward foreign currency exchange contracts and the contingent consideration in the Open Cycle Gas Turbine sites acquisition see note 3.6 are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price: therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
7.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising from our operations.
Accounting policy Cash and cash equivalents note 4.2, trade and other receivables note 3.5, and trade and other payables note 3.6 generally have a short time in which to mature.
For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value.
The Groups borrowings are set out in detail in note 4.3.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 167 7.4 HEDGE RESERVE Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.
As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging: however, not all of these contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39.
The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the denition of an IFRS effective hedge are recognised in the income statement.
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges.
Atthe inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.
Years ended 31 December 2017 2016 m m At 1 January 305.4 34.9 Gains losses recognised: Commodity contracts 1.5 18.3 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 161.9 397.3 Released from equity: Commodity contracts 14.8 35.7 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 73.6 13.2 Related deferred tax, net note 2.6 39.9 59.6 At 31 December 126.1 305.4 The Groups cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts principally commitments to sell power and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end forthe effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract.
Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss.
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.
For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised.
Further information about the Groups accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.
No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the year 2016: 6.4 million.
The expected release prole from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows: As at 31 December 2017 Within 1 year 12 years 2 years Total m m m m Commodity contracts 2.3 1.7 0.6 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 40.0 39.9 45.6 125.5 42.3 38.2 45.6 126.1 As at 31 December 2016 Within 1 year 12 years 2 years Total m m m m Commodity contracts 12.8 0.6 0.1 13.3 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 42.8 69.0 206.9 318.7 30.0 68.4 207.0 305.4 168 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT 7.5 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control.
The amount and timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP The UK Government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males.
This would correspondingly increase the dened benefit pension obligation of the Group note 6.3.
At present, the methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured.
As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of the dened benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.
Guarantees In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group.
As at 31 December 2017, the Groups contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to 35.7 million 2016: 57.9 million.
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to 41.3 million 2016: nil.
7.6 COMMITMENTS We have a number of financial commitments i. e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future that are not recorded in our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery.
Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.
As at 31 December 2017 2016 m m Contracts placed for future capital expenditure not provided in the financial statements 11.6 33.0 Future support contracts not provided in the financial statements 6.5 5.9 Future commitments to purchase fuel under xed and variable priced contracts 5,803.5 5,194.4 The contractual maturities of the future commitments to purchase fuel are as follows: As at 31 December 2017 2016 m m Within one year 1,054.2 873.7 Within two to five years 2,885.5 2,773.0 After five years 1,863.8 1,547.7 5,803.5 5,194.4 Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily for the delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 20182027.
To the extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in our financial statements owing to application of the own-use exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts see note 7.2.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: As at 31 December 2017 2016 m m Within one year 8.9 3.7 Within two to five years 25.5 10.8 After five years 9.1 5.2 43.5 19.7 The lease commitments principally comprise of a number of leases for ofce space.
