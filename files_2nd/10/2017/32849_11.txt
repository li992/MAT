STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPENDICES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group also has a significant interest in the Nezhda joint venture amounting to US$67 million see Note 20 as noted above.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED The completion of the purchase of an additional 7% share in the JV and exercise of the option over the remaining equity are subject to Earnings per share approval by the Russian Federal Governments Commission on Foreign Investments into Companies of Strategic Importance.
The exercise Earnings-per-share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted of the option is also subject to approval by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The Group has taken the judgement that it is likely earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential exercise of dilutive stock that these approvals will be provided, but is also confident that it will be able to enter into revised arrangements or take alternative mitigating options with exercise prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are assumed to be used in purchasing the action if required to ensure that it can complete the acquisition of the Nezhda project.
However, there remains a risk that the Group will Companys common shares at their average market price for the period.

The Group is required to conduct an impairment test where there is an indication of impairment of an asset or a cash-generating unit.
For goodwill, an annual impairment test is required.
Judgement is required in the assessment of whether indicators or impairment Ore reserves or its reversal exist.
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Groups properties.
Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the units-of-production method: Operating and economic assumptions, which could affect the valuation of assets using discounted cash flows, are updated regularly as impairment charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration costs.
Also, for the purpose of part of the Groups planning and forecasting processes.
Significant judgement is required to determine whether any economic or operating impairment review and the assessment of the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration costs, management may take assumptions represent significant changes in the economic value of an asset or CGU.

basis of such assumptions to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.
In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, including In addition, indicators for impairment reversal must be assessed for assets other than goodwill previously impaired.
Any change to quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices, operational plans or assumptions, economic parameters, or the passage of time, could result in an impairment reversal, or further discount rates and exchange rates.
Estimating the quantity and or grade of ore reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies impairment, if an indicator is identified.

This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.
In making the assessment for impairment indicators, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate cash-generating unit.
Management necessarily applies judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent cash inflows to Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course of operations or appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the value-in-use calculation.
