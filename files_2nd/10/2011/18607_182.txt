Grainger plc 120 Notes to the financial statements continued 25 Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments continued There is no effect on equity as a result of a change in house prices as in accordance with IAS 39 AG8 changes to future cash flows are recognised though the income statement.
We have considered the impact of changes to the vacation rate used in the cash flow model.
However, we do not consider this to be a material risk and actual experience to date has been very close to the vacation assumption adopted in the model.
Capital risk management The board manages the groups capital through the regular review of: cash flow projections, the ability of the group to meet contractual commitments, covenant tests, dividend cover and gearing.
The group manages the level of its shareholders funds by means of dividends, share purchases and share issues.
The rights issue completed in December 2009 is an example of how the board manages the groups capital.
The rights issue proceeds were used, inter alia, to improve the balance sheet leverage ratios and to reduce the overall size and cost of the groups debt.
Loans within the group have associated covenant requirements with respect to loan to value and interest cover ratios.
The board regularly reviews all covenants and projected future levels to monitor anticipated compliance and available headroom against key thresholds.
For the group as a whole the board does not have a specific loan to value target but it is reviewed in the context of the boards view of markets, the prospects of and risks relating to the portfolio and the recurring cash flows of the business.
The group monitors its cost of debt and weighted average cost of capital WACC on a regular basis.
Investment and development opportunities are evaluated using a risk adjusted WACC in order to ensure long-term shareholder value is created.
Certain group subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Services Authority and therefore have externally applied capital adequacy requirements, however, these do not have any material impact on the group as a whole.
