A reasonably possible change in assumptions is unlikely to result in a significant change in the fair value of Level 3 instruments.
NOTE 23 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and the availability of funds to meet business needs.
The management of these risks is set out below.
The Group Balance Sheet position at 26 February 2011 is representative of the position throughout the financial year.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles for risk management, as described in the Business Review on pages 51 to 57.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Debt issued at variable rates exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Debt issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value risk.
Our interest rate management policy is explained on page 56.
The Group has Retail Price Index RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI index.
RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt.
The Group also has Limited Price lnflation LPI debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%.
LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.
For interest rate risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors below.

The Group policy on credit risk is described on page 57.
The counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is 1,287m 2010 1,474m.
The Group policy is to transact derivatives only with counterparties rated at least A1 by Moodys.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 10.9bn 2010 11.0bn, being the Groups total financial assets.
For credit risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors below.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed by short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition, the Group has committed facility agreements for 2.8bn 2010 2.6bn, which mature between 2014 and 2015.
The Group has a European Medium Term Note programme of 15.0bn, of which 8.5bn was in issue at 26 February 2011 2010 10.6bn, plus a Euro Commercial Paper programme of 2.0bn, none of which was in issue at 26 February 2011 2010 nil, and a US Commercial Paper programme of $4.0bn, none of which was in issue at 26 February 2011 2010 $nil.

130 TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements NOTE 23 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives.
The potential cash outflow of 17.1bn is considered acceptable as it is offset by financial assets and trade receivables of 13.2bn 2010 15.6bn offset by financial assets and trade receivables of 12.9bn.
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
For index-linked liabilities, inflation is estimated at 4% for the life of the liability.

Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged.
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in note 22.
Net investment exposure, from the value of net investments outside the UK.
The Group hedges a proportion of its investments in its international subsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.
These are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies, which are not formally designated as hedges, as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements NOTE 23 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED The impact on Group financial statements from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.
Sensitivity analysis The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
However, it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from all local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 26February 2011.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to all financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.
It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded directly in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on the Group Income Statement: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income that would result from changes in UK interest rates and in exchange rates: 2011 2010 Income Equity Income Equity gain loss gain loss gain loss gain loss m m m m 1% increase in GBP interest rates 2010 1% 14 38 5% appreciation of the Euro 2010 15% 2 46 13 43 5% appreciation of the South Korean Won 2010 10% 1 1 82 5% appreciation of the US Dollar 2010 25% 835 1 8 10% appreciation of the Thai Baht 2010 25% 1 5% appreciation of the Czech Koruna 2010 10% 6 31 A decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of foreign currencies would have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above.
The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income from changing exchange rates results principally from foreign currency deals used as net investment hedges.
The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets.
For changes in the USD GBP exchange rate, the impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income results principally from forward purchases of US Dollars as cash flow hedges.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while maintaining a strong credit rating and headroom whilst optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them, or issue new shares.
In April 2006 the Group outlined its plan to release cash from its property assets, via a sequence of property joint ventures and other transactions, and return significant value to shareholders, either through enhanced dividends or share buy-backs.
The target for the value of share buy-backs was increased from 1.5bn to 3.0bn over a five-year period from April 2007.
Whilst the Group continued with the policy at the beginning of 2009, it subsequently used the proceeds from property divestment to pay down debt, following the two major acquisitions in 2009 Homever and Tesco Bank.
During 2009 the Group purchased and cancelled 100m ordinary shares.
In the financial years 2010 and 2011 the Group continued to use the proceeds from the sale of property to pay down debt.
The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding.
This policy continued during the current financial year with bonds redeemed of 1,861m 2010 390m and new bonds issued totalling 125m 2010 nil.
The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.
132 TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements NOTE 23 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED Tesco Bank Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Banks banking activities have different repricing dates.
Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.
Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits.
Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates.
Tesco Bank also use value at risk VaR for risk management purposes with a time horizon of one trading day and a confidence interval of 95%.
Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Tesco Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed within Tesco Banks banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
Tesco Banks Board has set a defined liquidity risk policy and contingency funding which is prudent and in excess of the minimum requirements as set out by the FSA.
A diversified portfolio of high-quality liquid and marketable assets is maintained.
Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis.
Tesco Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet all foreseeable outflow requirements as they fall due and its liquidity risk is further mitigated by its well diversified retail deposit base and a pool of surplus cash resources that are invested in a range of marketable assets.
Credit risk Credit risk is the probability of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to Tesco Bank and arises principally from Tesco Banks lending activities, but also from other transactions involving on and off-balance sheet instruments.
Internal reporting and oversight of risk assets is principally differentiated by credit ratings.
Internal ratings are used to assess the credit quality of borrowers.
Customers are assigned credit ratings, based on various credit grading models that reflect the probability of default.
Limits have been established for all counterparties based on their respective credit ratings.
The limits and proposed counterparties are reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee RMC of Tesco Bank.
Expressed as an annual probability of default, the upper and lower boundaries and the midpoint for each of the asset quality grades are as follows: At 26 February 2011 and 27 February 2010 Annual probability of default Minimum Midpoint Maximum S&P Asset quality grade % % % equivalent AQ1 0.00 0.10 0.20 AAA to BBBAQ2 0.21 0.40 0.60 BB to BB AQ3 0.61 1.05 1.50 BBto B AQ4 1.51 3.25 5.00 B to B AQ5 5.01 52.50 100.00 B and below Accruing NonImpairment AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ4 AQ5 past due accrual provision Total At 26 February 2011 m m m m m m m m m Assets: Other investments 1,108 1,108 Loans and advances to customers 599 466 924 1,663 886 73 212 182 4,641 Loans and advances to banks and other financial assets 404 404 Total assets 2,111 466 924 1,663 886 73 212 182 6,153 Commitments note 34 4,254 1,601 645 444 183 7,127 Total off-balance sheet 4,254 1,601 645 444 183 7,127 Accruing NonImpairment AQ1 AQ2 AQ3 AQ4 AQ5 past due accrual provision Total At 27 February 2010 m m m m m m m m m Assets: Other investments 863 863 Loans and advances to customers 501 381 762 1,495 838 76 373 314 4,112 Loans and advances to banks and other financial assets 144 144 Total assets 1,508 381 762 1,495 838 76 373 314 5,119 Commitments note 34 3,926 1,329 573 452 184 6,464 Total off-balance sheet 3,926 1,329 573 452 184 6,464 TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 133
