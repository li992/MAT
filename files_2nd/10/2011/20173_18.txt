Risk The Board is ultimately responsible for the risk management of the Company and has a risk management framework outlined in the table below which provides a structured and consistent process for identifying, assessing and responding to risks in relation to its strategy and business objectives.
Due to the structure of the Company, it is reliant on the risk management framework of the Investment Adviser and other key service providers, as well as on the risk management operations of each portfolio company.
The Company manages these risks through updates from the Investment Adviser and other service providers and, where possible, through representation on portfolio companies boards.
