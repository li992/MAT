29. financial policies for risk management and their objectives credit and concentration of risk the Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
the Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks, without recourse discounts, and other allowances.
a provision for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
in line with local market practice, customers in the mena region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to customers ineurope and the us.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Groups largest three customers in the mena region represented 15.7% ofGroup revenue, 11.1% in saudi arabia, 2.7% in algeria and 1.9% in tunisia.
During the year ended 31 December 2011 and due to revenue growth in the us through the acquisition of msi, three key us wholesalers represented 18.8% of group revenues 2010: 12.1%.
the amount of receivables due from us customers at 31 December 2011 is usD 86,476,000 2010: usD 31,326,000. the Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies, procedures and certain credit insurance agreements.
trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise.
credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer, based on a number of qualitative and quantitative factors related to the credit worthiness of a particular customer.
the Group is exposed to a variety of customers ranging from government backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic risks vary across the Group.
typical credit terms in the us range from 3090 days, in europe 30120 days, and mena 180360 days.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of creditand insurance.
market risk the Groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
the Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
capital risk management the Group manages its capital and monitors its liquidity to have reasonable assurance that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern and deliver its growth strategy objectives whilst reducing its cost of capital and maximising the returns to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity mix.
the Group regularly reviews the capital structure by considering the level of available capital and the short to medium-term strategic plans concerning future capital spend as well as the need to meet dividends, banking covenants and borrowing ratios.
130 Hikma PHarmaceuticals Plc annual report 2011 notes to the consolidated financialstatements Continued 29. financial policies for risk management and their objectives Continued the Group defines capital as equity plus net funds, which include bank overdrafts and loans note 24, obligations under finance leases note 28, long-term financial debts note 27, net of cash and cash equivalents note 23 and collateralised and restricted cash note 22.
During the year, the Group continued its strategy of obtaining debt financing at both the Group level and at the operating entities level.
thisenables the Group to borrow at competitive rates and to build relationships with local and international banks and is therefore deemed to be the most effective means of raising finance, while maintaining the balance between borrowing cost, asset and liability management and balance sheet currency risk management.
in order to monitor the available net funds, management review financial capital reports on a monthly basis in addition to the continuous review by the Group treasury function.
Gearing debt equity increased from 22% to 65%.
acquisitions, a key element of the Groups business strategy, have been funded by debt financing of usD 306,129,000 in the year.
the Directors consider that the Groups current gearing is also appropriate in that it enables the Group to maintain its existing dividend policy and at the same time to accommodate the Group investment policy.
Foreign exchange risk the Group uses the usD as its presentation currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in the euro, algerian Dinar, sudanese Pound, Japanese Yen, egyptian Pound, tunisian Dinar and moroccan Dirham.
consequently, where possible, the Group enters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change, to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Due to the lack of open currency markets, the algerian Dinar and the sudanese Pound cannot be hedged.
Where possible, the Group uses financing facilities denominated in local currencies to mitigate the risks.
the Jordanian Dinar and saudi riyal have no impact on the statement of comprehensive income as those currencies are pegged against the us Dollar.
Interest rate risk the Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk by changing the proportion of debt that is floating by entering into interest rate swap agreements.
using these derivative financial instruments has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position at 31December 2011 orthe Groups results of operations for the year then ended.
