Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Company has gone through significant change in 2011 and as a consequence the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company have changed on a regular basis.
With the completion of both the disposal of a majority shareholding in CIL and the Greenland Drilling Project at the end of 2011, Cairns risk profile has changed considerably in early 2012.
The Company is now entering a new phase during which it will be looking to develop a more balanced portfolio with additional investment opportunities.
As we commence delivering this next phase of investments, the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company in relation to the Groups financial and operational performance and the mitigating actions, are as follows: Risk: Potential Impact: Mitigation: Assessment of timing of Sub optimal extraction of value from the Maintain options for realising value from Cairn India monetising our remaining remaining shareholding in Cairn India shareholding at the appropriate time stake in Cairn India Challenges of accessing Limited or inappropriate investment Source and screen investment opportunities, proceeding the right opportunities at opportunities with the evaluation of those that meet Cairns investment the right price to deliver objectives our growth strategies Incorrect decisions leading to non realisation Rigorous application of Project Delivery Process and of value adding opportunities Investment Procedures, including due diligence processes on new business investment opportunities Ineffective management of Actions by third parties or organisations Maintaining effective Corporate and Asset stakeholder stakeholder relationships including non-governmental organisations management and communications plans NGOs potentially impacting business activities and reputation Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 37 Business Review Principal Risks and uncertainties Continued In our 2010 Annual Report and Accounts we presented the strategic, financial, operational and external risks which we believed could adversely impact our business at the time.
