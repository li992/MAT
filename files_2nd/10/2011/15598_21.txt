The Groups positions with these counterparties and their credit ratings are routinely monitored.
Tesco Bank retail credit risk is managed through the credit risk policy framework, which is agreed through the Tesco Bank Risk Management Committee and defines limits and standards at all stages of the customer lifecycle, including new account sanctioning, customer management and collections and recoveries activity.
Customer credit decisions are managed principally through the deployment of bespoke credit scorecard models and credit policy rules which restrict specific areas of lending, and an affordability assessment which determines a customers ability to repay an outstanding credit amount.
Wholesale counterparty credit risk limits are managed in accordance with a control framework, approved by the Tesco Bank Risk Management Committee, which sets limits based on counterparty creditworthiness and instrument type.
Tesco Bank continues to use Fitch, Moodys and Standard & Poors ratings as part of the credit assessment process.
Insurance We purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only.
The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the business by using our captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland.
ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company Limited covers Combined Liability only.
