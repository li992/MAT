OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGY 01 At Thermal Coals New Vaal colliery, this haul truck is tted with an energy absorbing safety bumper, developed by Technology Solutions.
Technical Solutions recently developed and implemented a haul truck rolling-resistance solution in collaboration with Komatsu and the University of Pretoria in South Africa.
As fuel consumption, cycle times, tyre life and equipment life are affected signicantly by varying road conditions, this system continuously measures haul road conditions and informs mine management as to its road maintenance priorities.
It has been implemented on two continents and is being rolled out globally.
In the safety eld specically, we have developed a haul truck energy-absorbing bumper.
Accidents between heavy and light vehicles are a major risk in the mining industry, and this new type of bumper will reduce the risk of fatal injuries.
The uniqueness of the design is that the bumper can successfully absorb impact energies of up to 30 km h without causing serious injury to the occupants of the light vehicle.
The unit was successfully demonstrated at our 01 Thermal Coal operations and is currently being rolled out on haul trucks with payloads above 150 tonnes.
The benets of having our own Group mineralogical research capabilities have been well proven over many years in our Platinum, Copper and Iron Ore businesses.
Recently, an opportunity was identied to further develop this capability in order to facilitate mineralogical investigations of coal samples, which differ vastly from other mineral deposits.
As a result, Technical Solutions can now assist both our Metallurgical Coal and Thermal Coal operations to better understand their orebodies with regards to ash content, metallurgical beneficiation processes and 02 product marketability.
A novel instrument, which provides rapid and precise results for Metallurgical Coal, in collaboration with per hour and 100 cutting hours per week.
measuring the density of drill cores and plant Joy Mining Machinery, is undertaking a At the same time, safety will be enhanced samples, has now been developed in support Longwall of the future project which is through removing our teams from high of our renewed concentration on density designed to deliver world class levels of energy environments.
In a further values and their effect on mine planning safety, production and operating cost development, in the Brisbane ofce a new and reserve estimation.
By leveraging the know-how integrated value chain control room employs of both organisations, and taking a holisticthe latest technology in order to yield mining system approach, the plan is to maximum efficiencies in coal movements advance to the next level of technology in across Metallurgical Coals six coal mines and terms of automation, built-in design reliability three loading ports.

The effective tax rate before special items and remeasurements, including attributable share of associates tax, for the year ended 31December 2011 was 28.3% 2010: 31.9%.
The decrease was due to a number of non-recurring factors that include the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses and the reassessment of certain withholding tax provisions across the Group.
In future, it is expected that the effective tax rate, including associates tax, will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.
