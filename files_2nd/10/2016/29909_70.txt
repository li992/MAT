For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements above, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis.
In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis.
However, each party to the master netting agreement or similar agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
Note 22 Financial risk factors The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and the availability of funds to meet business needs.
The management of these risks is set out below.
Financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved and delegated by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles forrisk management.
Interest rate risk Debt issued at variable rates as well as cash deposits and short-term investments exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Debt issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value risk.
The Groups policy is to fix interest rates for the year on a minimum of 50% and maximum of 70% of actual and projected debt interest costs of the Group excluding Tesco Bank.
At the year end, the percentage of interest-bearing debt at fixed rates was 88% 2015: 79%.
The remaining balance of debt is in floating rate form.
The average rate of interest paid on an historical cost basis this year, excluding joint ventures and associates, was 3.94% 2015: 4.09%.
A progression towards revised policy levels will proceed with due consideration to optimal execution, costs and interest cover.
Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps, caps and floors may be used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The Group has Retail Price Index RPI linked debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI.
RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt.
The Group also has Limited Price lnflation LPI linked debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of 0%.
LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.
RPI linked debt and LPI linked debt are hedged for the effects of inflation until maturity.

The Group holds positions with an approved list of investment grade rated counterparties and monitors the exposure, credit rating, outlook and credit default swap levels of these counterparties on a regular basis.
The net counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is 1.3bn 2015: 1.4bn.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 18.7bn 2015: 14.7bn being the Groups total financial assets.
For credit risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on pages 126 and 127.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, disposals of assets, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings and leases.
The policy is to smooth the debt maturity profile, to arrange funding ahead of requirements and to maintain sufficient undrawn committed bank facilities and to maintain access to capital markets so that maturing debt may be refinanced as it falls due.
Liquidity risk is managed by short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition, the Group has committed facility agreements for 5.0bn 2015: 5.1bn, consisting of a revolving credit facility and bilateral lines as alternate sources of liquidity, which mature between 2016 and 2019.
The Group has a European Medium Term Note programme of 15.0bn, of which 7.4bn was in issue at 27 February 2016 2015: 7.4bn, plus a Euro Commercial Paper programme of 2.0bn, nil of which was in issue at 27 February 2016 2015: 0.5bn, and a US Commercial Paper programme of $4.0bn, nil ofwhich was in issue at 27 February 2016 2015: 0.7bn.
For liquidity risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on pages 126 and 127.
The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives taking into account contractual terms that provide the counterparty a choice of when the earliest date an amount is repaid by the Group.
The potential cash outflow of 17.1bn is considered acceptable as it is offset by financial assets of 18.7bn 2015: 17.8bn offset by financial assets of 14.7bn.
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
For index-linked liabilities, inflation is estimated at 3% for the life of the liability 2015: 3%.

The above table has been re-presented to provide more clarity on the cash flows from derivatives taking into account contractual terms that provide the counterparty a choice of when the earliest date an amount is repaid by the Group.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk principally via: transactional exposure that arises from the cost of future purchases of goods for resale, where those purchases are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing company.
Transactional currency exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged.
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts or purchased currency options, which are designated as cash flow hedges.
At the year-end, forward foreign currency transactions, designated as cash flow hedges, equivalent to 1.4bn were outstanding 2015: 2.2bn.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in Note 21: net investment exposure arises from changes in the value of net investments denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling.
The Group hedges a part of its investments in its international subsidiaries via foreign currency derivatives and borrowings in matching currencies, which are formally designated as net investment hedges.
During the year, currency movements increased the net value, after the effects of hedging, of the Groups overseas assets by 168m last year increase by 5m.
The Group also ensures that each subsidiary is appropriately hedged in respect of its non-functional currency assets: and loans to non-UK subsidiaries.
These are hedged via foreign currency derivatives and borrowings in matching currencies.
These are not formally designated ashedges as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
The impact on the Group financial statements from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis on the next page.
Sensitivity analysis The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
However, it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 27 February 2016.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.
Itdoes not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt which has been swapped to fixed rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchangerates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates arerecorded directly in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on theGroup Income Statement: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects afull12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 125 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Note 22 Financial risk factors continued Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result, at the balance sheet date, from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates that are reasonably possible for major currencies where there have recently been significant movements: 2016 2015 Income Equity Income Equity gain loss gain loss gain loss gain loss m m m m 1% increase in interest rates 2015: 1% 88 44 57 5% appreciation of the Czech Koruna 2015: 10% 1 4 7 10% appreciation of the Euro 2015: 10% 285 94 31 39 5% appreciation of the Hungarian Forint 2015: 5% 1 1 1 2 5% appreciation of the South Korean Won 2015: 5% 2 10% appreciation of the US Dollar 2015: 10% 1 95 3 96 5% appreciation of the Polish Zloty 2015: 5% 2 1 A decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of foreign currencies would have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above.
The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income from changing exchange rates results from the revaluation of financial liabilities used as net investment hedges.
The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets.
The sensitivity movements in equity excludes 39m 2015: 100m in relation to loans to Group entities that form part of their net investment.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while protecting and strengthening the balance sheet through the appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them, or issue new shares.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profit, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings, disposals of property assets and leases.
The policy for debt is to smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding.
This policy continued during the financial year, with bonds redeemed of nil 2015: 1,493m and new bonds issued of nil 2015: 2,095m.
The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital market instruments and borrowing facilities to meet the Groups business requirements of each local business.
Refer to Note 29 for the value of the Groups net debt of 5.1bn 2015: 8.5bn, and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for the value of the Groups equity of 8.6bn 2015: 7.1bn.
Insurance risk The Group is exposed to the risk of being inadequately protected from liabilities arising from unforeseen events.
The Group purchased assets, earnings and combined liability protection from the open insurance market for higher value losses only.
The risk not transferred to the insurance market is retained within the Group with some cover being provided by the Groups captive insurance companies, ELH Insurance Limited in Guernsey and Valiant Insurance Company DAC formerly Valiant Insurance Company Limited in the Republic of Ireland.
ELH Insurance Limited covers Assets, Earnings and Combined Liability, while Valiant Insurance Company DAC covers Combined Liability only.
Tesco Bank Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises mainly where assets and liabilities in Tesco Banks banking activities have different repricing dates.
Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.
Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long-term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits.
Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12 months to a 1%: -0.5% parallel movement in interest rates.
Tesco Bank also use the Capital at Risk CaR approach which assesses the sensitivity value change of a reduction in the Banks capital to movements in interest rates.
The scenarios considered include both parallel and non-parallel movements of the yield curve and have been designed to ensure that impacts are assessed across a suitable range of severe but plausible movements in interest rates.
This approach has replaced Economic Value of Equity EVE measurement and reporting in the period.
Interest rate risk is primarily managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument.
Liquidity and funding risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Tesco Bank has insufficient liquidity resources to meet its obligations as they fall due or can access these only at excessive cost.
Funding risk is the risk that Tesco Bank does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding.
Tesco Bank operates within a Liquidity Risk Management Policy Framework LRMP to ensure that sufficient funds are available at all times to meet demands from depositors: to fund agreed advances: to meet other commitments as and when they fall due: and to ensure the Boards risk appetite is met.
Liquidity and funding risk is assessed through the Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process ILAAP on at least an annual basis.
Formal limits are set within the LRMP to maintain liquidity risk exposures within the Liquidity Risk Appetite set by the Board and key liquidity measures are monitored on a daily basis.
Tesco Bank maintains a conservative liquidity and funding profile to confirm that it is able to meet its financial obligations under normal, and stressed, market conditions.
126 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Note 22 Financial risk factors continued Credit risk Credit risk is the potential that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms.
Credit risk principally arises from the Banks retail lending activities but also from the placement of surplus funds with other banks and money market funds, investments in transferable securities and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.
In addition, credit risk arises from contractual arrangements with third parties where payments and commissions are due to the Bank for short periods of time.
Retail credit policy is managed through the credit risk policy framework with standards and limits defined at all stages of the customer lifecycle, including new account sanctioning, customer management and collections and recovery activity.
Customer lending decisions are managed principally through the deployment of bespoke credit scorecard models and credit policy rules, which exclude specific areas of lending, and an affordability assessment which determines a customers ability to repay an outstanding credit amount.
Wholesale credit risk is managed using a limit-based framework, with limits determined by counterparty credit worthiness, instrument type and remaining tenor.
A limits framework is also in place for the management of third-party credit exposures.
Ineffective management and controls over the emerging asset quality of the Groups lending portfolios could expose the Group to unacceptable levels of baddebt.
The Groups asset quality is reflected through the level of its impairment by lending type.
Asset quality profiles are regularly monitored and reported to the appropriate senior management team and risk committees.
The table below presents an analysis of credit exposure by impairment status across the different exposure classes.
The table predominantly relates to banking assets: the retail instalment lending applies to credit agreements in the insurance business.

The credit risk exposure from off balance sheet items, mainly undrawn credit card facilities and mortgage offers, was 11.9bn 2015: 11.5bn.
Insurance risk Tesco Bank is indirectly exposed to insurance risks through its ownership of 49.9% of Tesco Underwriting Limited TU, an authorised insurance company.
Since late 2010, the majority of new business policies for home and motor insurance products sold by Tesco Bank have been underwritten by TU.
The key insurance risks within TU relate to underwriting risk and specifically the potential for a major weather event to generate significant claims on home insurance, or on motor insurance the cost of settling bodily injury claims.
Exposure to this risk is actively managed within TU with close monitoring of performance metrics and the use of reinsurance to limit TUs exposure above predetermined limits.
