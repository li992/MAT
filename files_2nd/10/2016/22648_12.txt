RISK MANAGEMENT Computacenter applies a rigorous and multi-layered approach to risk management.
By blending appetite, model and process, we can manage and control our risks while remaining a customer-centric SAFEGUARDING organisation.
We are well known for putting our customers first and empower our lead customer-facing people, to provide the flexibility and speed of OUR FUTURE response our customers want.
Our governance process underscores this empowerment, by ensuring risks are identified and assessed at an appropriate level in the organisation.
It also allows for alignment with our overall risk appetite.
We are often at the cutting edge of technology and services provision, and must balance our many business development opportunities with our ability to deliver and maintain our reputation for customer satisfaction and longevity of customer relationships.
As a result, we have a healthy risk appetite for business development where we have experience of the risks and a lower risk appetite where we have less experience.
Computacenter continuously applies this risk appetite, through both our risk management process and our Risk Governance Model.
The model and process comply fully with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Financial Reporting Council Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
Our model uses the well-defined Three Lines of Defence methodology: The First Line of Defence consists of operational management, who own the risks and apply the internal controls necessary for managing risks day-to-day.
The Second Line of Defence offers guidance, direction and provides appropriate oversight and challenge.
Internal compliance and assurance functions fall into this category.
The Third Line of Defence, provided by Group Internal Audit, gives an independent view of the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control processes.
It reports to the Identifying and assessing risk at the Audit Committee to ensure independence from management.

The Board and Executive Committee consider the principal risks which are the barriers to achieving the Boards strategic objectives.
The Group Risk Committee, consisting of the Executive Directors, members of the Group Executive Committee and senior managers from across the Group, challenges the effectiveness Chris Webb of mitigations of the principal risks.
Group Chief Operating Officer The Group Risk Committees deliberations, along with the current status of each principal risk, are reported to the Audit Committee and the Board.
The Group Risk Committee considers each principal risk in-depth at least once a year, by receiving reports from the risk owner and challenging the mitigation approach.
The principal risk list is reviewed once a year and leverages an annual operational risk review, where operational management identify their everyday risks.
The Group Compliance Steering Committee, which was added to the governance model during 2016, assesses observance with laws and regulations, and reports to the Group Risk Committee.
The bid governance process reviews bids or major changes to existing contracts, which aligns with our risk appetite and risk management process.
