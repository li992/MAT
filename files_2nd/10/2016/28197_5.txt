As at 31 December 2016, the Group held US$ 48 million of cash and had net debt of US$ 1,330 million.
It has undrawn facilities of US$ 998 million, of which US$ 873 million are considered committed.
The Board is satisfied that the Groups forecasts and projections, having taken account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report without material uncertainty and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
While assessing the Groups longer-term viability, the Board confirms that taking into account the Groups current position and based upon the robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and stress-testing based assessment of Groups prospects, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2019.
Basis of presentation The Groups annual condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Polymetal International plc 31 The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value as of end of the reporting period and share-based payments which are recognised at fair value as of measurement date.
The following accounting policies have been applied in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Amended accounting standards adopted by the entity The following new accounting pronouncements which became effective in the current reporting period: Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations.
The amendments to IFRS 11 provide guidance on how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation in which the activities constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combination and state that the relevant principles on accounting for business combinations in IFRS 3 and other standards should be applied.
The same requirements should be applied to the formation of a joint operation if and only if an existing business is contributed to the joint operation by one of the parties that participate in the joint venture.
A joint operator is also required to disclose the relevant information required by IFRS 3 and other standards for business combinations.
Entities should apply the amendments prospectively to acquisitions of interest in joint operations occurring from the beginning of annual periods beginning on no after 1 January 2016.
The Group has determined that amendments to IFRS 11 do not impact its consolidated financial statements as it does not have any arrangements considered joint operations.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure.
Initiative provides guidance on the use of judgement in presenting financial statement information, including: the application of materiality: order of notes: use of subtotals: accounting policy referencing and disaggregation of financial and non-financial information.
Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
The Group has determined that amendments to IAS 1 do not impact its consolidated financial statements.
New accounting standards issued but not yet effective IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15, which covers principles that an entity shall apply to report information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer.
Application of the standard is mandatory for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with earlier application permitted.
The Group is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 15 on its consolidated financial statements with the primary focus being understanding those sales contracts where the timing and amount of revenue recognised could differ under IFRS 15, which may occur for example if contracts with customers incorporate performance obligations not currently recognised separately, or where such contracts incorporate variable consideration.
As the Groups revenue is predominantly derived from arrangements in which the transfer of risks and rewards coincides with the fulfilment of performance obligations, the timing and amount of revenue recognised is unlikely to be materially affected for the majority of sales.
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and permits early adoption.
IFRS 9 provides a revised model for recognition, measurement and impairment of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 also includes a substantially reformed approach to hedge accounting.
The Group is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 9 on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and permits early adoption.
IFRS 16 replaces the following standards and interpretations: IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.
IFRS 16 applies to all leases including subleases and requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value.
Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance.
The Group is in the process of determining the impact of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture remove an inconsistency between the two standards on the accounting treatment for gains and losses arising on the sale or contribution of assets by an investor to its associate or joint venture.
Following the amendment, such gains and losses may only be recognised to the extent of the unrelated investors interest, except where the transaction involves assets that constitute a business.
The Group doesnt expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 2 Share based payment: Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment transactions.
On 20 June 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB published final amendments to IFRS 2 that clarify the classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions.
IASB has now added Polymetal International plc 32 guidance on accounting for cash-settled share-based payment transactions that include a performance condition, classification of share-based payment transactions with net settlement features and accounting for modifications of share-based payment transactions from cash-settled to equity-settled.
Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The Group is in the process of determining the impact of amendments to IFRS 2 on its consolidated financial statements.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS a Year ended 31 December 2016 Kapan In March 2016 Polymetal entered into binding agreements with Dundee Precious Metals Inc Dundee.
for the acquisition of CJSC Dundee Precious Metals Kapan DPMK, the holding company for the Kapan Gold Mine Kapan in the Republic of Armenia.
The asset comprises a fully mechanised underground mine with a current capacity of approximately 400 ktpa, a conventional 750 ktpa flotation concentrator and various infrastructure facilities.
The mine produces gold, copper, silver and zinc concentrates sold to international markets.
On 28 April 2016 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the shares of DPMK.
Kapan meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 and thus it was accounted for at fair value using the acquisition method.
Consideration transferred The total consideration for the shares at completion comprised US$ 38 million consisting of US$ 14 million payable in cash including post-closing working capital adjustment amounting to US$ 5 million and US$ 15 million paid through the issue of 1,481,785 new ordinary shares of the Company.
In addition, Dundee will receive a 2% NSR Net Smelter Return royalty on the future production from the Kapan Gold Mine capped at US$ 25 million.
The fair value of the 1,481,785 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Kapan was determined based on spot price as of acquisition date, being US$ 10.28, and amounts to US$ 15 million.
The net smelter return royalty described above meets the definition of contingent consideration.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the life-of-mine model of the Kapan mine by discounting projected cash flows to the acquisition date.
The following metal price assumptions, consistent with the assumptions adopted for the long-term planning at the time of acquisition, were used for the fair value calculation: Au US$ 1,250 oz, Ag US$ 17 oz, Cu US$ 4,500 tonne, Zinc US$ 1,800 tonne, real post-tax discount rate of 9.04%.
At the acquisition date, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration amounted to US$ 9 million.
As of 31 December 2016 contingent consideration approximates to US$ 9 million Note 22.
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition As of date of finalisation of the interim consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2016 the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition was provisionally accounted for, as well as the amount of the post-closing working capital adjustment.
A post-closing working capital adjustment of US$ 5 million is outstanding as of 31 December 2016 and is included in account payable.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and its reconciliation to the provisionally accounting are set out in the table below: Provisional Fair value Final accounting accounting adjustments US$m US$m US$m Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition Cash and cash equivalents 1 - 1 Mineral rights 17 17 - Property, plant and equipment 4 17 21 Inventories 11 5 16 Account receivable 12 - 12 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 8 - 8 Taxes payable 12 - 12 Environmental obligations 1 - 1 Deferred taxes 9 - 9 Net assets acquired 33 5 38 Consideration transferred Cash 9 5 14 Polymetal International plc 33 Fair value of shares issued 15 - 15 Contingent consideration 9 - 9 Total consideration 33 5 38 Net cash outflow on acquisition 8 - 8 Cash consideration payable as of 31 December 2016 - - 5 No significant financial assets were acquired in business combination.
The fair value of the accounts receivable approximates to its carrying value.
Impact of the acquisition on the result of the Group Kapan contributed US$ 2 million to the Groups profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the reporting date.
Revenue for the period amounts to US$ 29 million.
If the Kapan acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the revenue of the Group would have been US$ 1,588 million, and the profit for the period would have been US$ 391 million.
Komarovskoye On 4 April 2016 Polymetal entered into a binding agreement with Kazzinc LTD, a subsidiary of Glencore International plc, for the acquisition of Orion Minerals LL, the holding company for the Komarovskoye Gold Deposit Komarovskoye in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The asset comprises an active open pit mine and a 500 ktpa heap leach facility with grid power available on site.
Polymetal aims to mine, deliver by rail and process at Varvara up to 1 Mtpa of ore with potential to increase Varvaras annual production by approximately 70 Koz at lower cash costs.
The acquisition of the Komarovskoye was completed on 1 August 2016, following receipt of all required regulatory approvals.
Management considers that the control over the Komarovskoye was obtained on the date of the deal completion.
Komarovskoye meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 thus it was accounted for at fair value using the acquisition method.
The total consideration for Komarovskoye is US$ 100 million payable in cash.
In addition, a deferred consideration contingent upon future production levels and gold price performance, will be paid to Kazzinc LTD.
The royalty is calculated on a quarterly basis, based on ontained gold in ore mined per relevant quarter and is payable at gold prices above US$ 1,250 per ounce.
The royalty is capped at a total consideration of US$ 80 million.
Consideration transferred Deferred consideration described above meets definition of the contingent consideration.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the life-of-mine model of the Komarovskoye mine and calculated using Monte Carlo modelling.
Projected cash flows were discounted to the acquisition date at a discount rate of 9.04%.
Gold price volatility was assessed at 18.08%, average gold price for one quarter to the valuation date was US$ 1,291 per ounce.
As at acquisition date the estimated contingent consideration amounts to US$ 20 million.
As of 31 December 2016 contingent consideration approximates to US$ 18 million Note 22.
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition At the date of finalisation of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the calculation of environmental obligations and the calculation of deferred taxes had not been finalised and they have therefore only been provisionally determined based on the directors' best estimate.
The management believes that this business acquisition does not give rise to goodwill and excess of consideration over identifiable net asset assets of the acquiree should be fully attributed the mineral rights.
The amount recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below: US$m Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition Cash and cash equivalents 1 Property, plant & equipment 140 Inventories 7 Accounts receivable 1 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 2 Environmental obligations 1 Deferred income taxes 25 Other liablities 1 Net assets acquired 120 Polymetal International plc 34 Consideration transferred Cash 100 Contingent consideration 20 Total consideration 120 Net cash out flow on acquisition 99 No significant financial assets were acquired in business combination.
Impact of the acquisition on the result of group No significant acquisition-related costs were incurred.
Komarovskoye contributed US$ 1 million to the Groups profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
Revenue for the period amounts to US$ 1 million, which excludes revenue from ore sales to JSC Varvariskoye amouting to US$ 10 million since the acquision date and US$ 17 million for the year ended 31 December 2016.
If Komarovskoye acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the revenue of the Group would have been US$ 1,583 million, and the profit for the period would have been US$ 395 million.
Saum Mining Company LLC On 2 December 2016 Polymetal International plc acquired an 80% stake in Saum Mining Company LLC, a licence holder for the Saum polymetallic deposit Saum.
Polymetal has issued 1,120,690 new Company shares Consideration shares, representing 0.26% of Polymetals total increased share capital in connection with the acquisition of an 80% stake in Saum from an unrelated party.
The total transaction value is approximately US$ 10.7 million.
The Saum licence covers an area of 34.2 km2 in Russias Sverdlovsk region in the Ural Mountains and is located and approximately 240 km from Polymetals Voro processing plant.
Polymetal plans to prepare an Ore Reserves estimate in Q4 2017.
Further drilling is planned on the property in 2017 and 2018.
Saum does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3, as it represents acquisition of mining license through a non-operating corporate entity, and thus it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets.
The Group purchased mineral rights of US$ 10 million and other current assets of US$ 1 million.
b Year ended 31 December 2015 Business combinations and asset acquisitions Kyzyl purchase price allocation On 4 September 2014 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Altynalmas Gold Ltd AAG, the holding company for the Kyzyl gold project in Kazakhstan.
The adjusted fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Kyzyl as at the date of acquisition are presented in the following table: Provisional amount previously reported Adjustments Adjusted amounts US$m US$m US$m Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition Cash and cash equivalents 4 - 4 Mineral rights 854 56 798 Property, plant and equipment 6 - 6 Other assets 2 1 1 Environmental obligations 16 9 7 Contigent liablities 6 - 6 Deferred tax liability 166 48 118 Other liablities 2 - 2 Net assets acquired 676 - 676 Settlement of the Kyzyl put option In accordance with Kyzyl acquisition terms, the Seller Sumeru Gold B. V. was entitled to a put option giving it a right to require Polymetal to acquire or procure acquirers for the consideration shares, described below, by notice to Polymetal during the one month period immediately following the first anniversary of completion at a price per consideration share equal to US$ 9.57027.
On completion Polymetal recognised the repurchase obligation at the net present value of maximum repayment of US$ 300 million, which approximated to US$ 273 million, with a Polymetal International plc 35 corresponding decrease in equity.
At the same time the Group recognised the seller put option fair value in amount of US$ 55 million within consideration transferred with corresponding increase in equity.
The put option had an exercise period from 4 September to 4 October 2015.
In September 2015 the Group agreed to the following settlement mechanism for the put option: Polymetal settled the full contractual put option liability to the Seller and delivered a cash payment in the amount of US$ 300 million: Simultaneously, Polymetal transferred the right to receive consideration shares to Otkritie Investments Cyprus Limited in exchange for a cash consideration of US$ 232 million.
The cash consideration payable by Otkritie to Polymetal represented the average closing price of the Polymetal shares for the agreed quotation period being one month ended five business days before the date of signing the assignment agreement, which was US$ 7.41 per share, multiplied by the number of Consideration Shares.
As a result the net amount of US$ 68 million was paid by Polymetal and the consideration shares remained in issue.
On the put option being exercised, both the liability of US$ 300 million and the corresponding balance in equity of US$ 219 million were derecognised.
After the cash payment has been taken into account, the balancing figure of US$ 14 million was recognised within retained earnings.
Primorskoye In July 2015 Polymetal purchased a 100% interest in Primorskoye LLC, the company holding the licence for the Primorskoye silver-gold property located in the Magadan region of Russia from Decamor Investments Limited.
The consideration for the acquisition comprised the initial consideration of US$ 4 million payable by issuing 533,301 new Polymetal International plc shares and the deferred conditional cash consideration payable in February 2017.
The deferred consideration will be determined as the higher of US$ 13,333 per tonne of contained silver equivalent translating into US$ 0.415 per silver equivalent ounce based on the audited reserves estimate of the deposit, and US$ 8 million.
Primorskoye did not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3, as it represents acquisition of mining license though a non-operating corporate entity, and thus it was accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets.
The Group purchased mineral rights of US$ 11 million.
LV Gold Mining In April 2015 the Group purchased a 25% stake in CJSC LV Gold Mining, the company owning the Lichkvaz exploration licence in Armenia including related shareholder loans.
The consideration comprised 429,260 shares equal to US$ 4 million.
Polymetal has also entered into an earn-in agreement for financing of exploration, technical research and a JORC feasibility study in exchange for a right to increase its share in the project up to 50% after the completion of these tasks.
The arrangements constituted a joint venture and the investment was accounted for using the equity method at cost of US$ 4 million as of 30 June 2015.
On 11 November 2015, Polymetal signed an agreement to purchase the remaining 75% of LV Gold mining shares.
The purchase price comprised 1,047,756 Polymetal International plc shares and a deferred consideration in an amount equal to 2% of value of precious metals in the ore extracted from the Lichkvaz deposit in the future during the life of mine.
Under the contract the seller has also assigned to Polymetal an intercompany loan receivable of US$ 0.3 million in exchange for additional 37,097 Polymetal International plc shares.
Total consideration payable in shares was valued at US$ 9 million and the contingent consideration was valued at US$ 5 million.
LV Gold Mining did not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3, as it represents acquisition of mining license though a non-operating corporate entity, thus it was accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets.
The acquisition was achieved in stages and accounted for at cost which was the total of the cost of the original 25% interest and of the additional 75% interest.
The Group purchased mineral rights of US$ 20 million.
Polymetal International plc 36 Disposal of subsidiary Khakandjinskoye LLC On 26 October 2015 the Group sold its subsidiary Khakandjinskoye LLC, which held the Khakanja licence, for the cash consideration of US$ 0.5 million to an unrelated party.
Total net assets disposed of amounted to US$ 0.7 million, resulting in a gain on disposal of subsidiary amounting to US$ 1.2 million.
"SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group has nine reportable segments: Voro CJSC Gold of Northern Urals : Okhotsk operations LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company: Svetloye LLC : Dukat JSC Magadan Silver : Omolon Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC : Varvara JSC Varvarinskoye: JSC Komarovskoye Mining Company : Amursk-Albazino Albazino Resources Ltd, Amur Hydrometallurgical Plant LLC : Mayskoye Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC : Kyzyl Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLP, Inter Gold Capital LLP : and Armenia ""Kapan MPC"" CJSC, ""LV Gold Mining"" CJSC."
Reportable segments are determined based on the Groups internal management reports and are separated based on the Groups geographical structure.
Minor companies and activities management, exploration, purchasing and other companies which do not meet the reportable segment criteria are disclosed within corporate and other segment.
Each segment is engaged in gold, silver or copper mining and related activities, including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation.
The Groups segments are based in the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and Armenia.
The measure which management and the Chief Operating Decision Maker the CODM use to evaluate the performance of the Group is segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortization, write-downs and reversals of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, bad debt allowance, gains or losses arising on acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, income tax expenses and tax exposure accrued within other operating expenses.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with those of the Groups accounting policies under IFRS.
Revenue shown as corporate and other comprises, principally, intersegment revenue relating to the supply of inventories, spare parts and fixed assets, and rendering management services to the Groups production entities.
Intersegment revenue is recognised based on costs incurred plus a fixed margin basis.
External revenue shown within corporate and other represents revenue from services provided to third parties by the Groups non-mining subsidiaries.
Business segment current assets and liabilities, other than current inventory, are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore are not disclosed in these condensed consolidated financial statements.

Mining tax in Russian Federation and Kazakhstan is calculated based on the value of the precious metals extracted in the period.
This value is usually determined based on the realised selling price of precious metals or, in case if there were no sales during the period, cost of production of metals extracted Russian Federation or the average market price Kazakhstan during the period.
Royalty payable in Armenia is calculated as a percentage of actual sales during the reporting period.
Polymetal International plc 40 News release Mining tax in respect of the metal inventories produced or sold during the year is recognised within cost of sales, while the additional mining tax accruals in respect of various disputes with tax authorities are recognised within other expenses see Note 10.
Idle capacities and abnormal production costs were expensed as incurred and relate to Mayskoye where the processing plant was stopped from November 2015 to February 2016 while underground mining was ramping up due to the redevelopment of underground workings using a new mining method and idle capacities when processing plants are stopped for general maintenance.

These deductions include share-based payment expenses, social related expenditures and other non-production costs, certain general and administrative expenses, financing expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.
Polymetal International plc 43 News release As from 1 January 2016 Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC and JSC Magadan Silver are entitled to the decreased statutory income tax rate of 18% for the operations held in the Special Economic zone of the Russian Far East Note 10, the rate of 18% was used in calculation of income tax provision and deferred tax positions for those entities.
For several entities, the tax calculation is prepared in local currencies that differ from the functional currency of the entity.
In the year ended 31 December 2015 this resulted in exchange gains and losses excluded from tax computations in the local currency that gave rise to significant permanent differences.
During the year ended 31 December 2016 no such exchange gains and losses were incurred due to reduced exchange rate fluctuations.
Effect of dissolution of subsidiary represents accumulated tax losses written off in a subsidiary, which was dissolved during the year ended 31 December 2016.
In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.
Of the large operating companies of the Group, the tax authorities have audited LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company CJSC up to 2014, Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC up to 2013, CJSC Gold of Northern Urals and CJSC Magadan Silver up to 2012, Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC up to 2010, and JSC Varvarinskoye for the period up to 2010.
According to Russian, Kazakhstan and Armenian tax legislation, previously completed audits do not fully preclude subsequent claims relating to the audited period.
Tax exposures recognised in income tax During the year ended 31 December 2016 and the year ended 31 December 2015 no individual significant exposures were indentified as probable and provided for.
Management has identified a total exposure covering taxes and related interest and penalties of approximately US$ 4 million in respect of uncertain tax positions 31 December 2015: US$ 16 million which relate to income tax.

The following analysis shows deferred tax balances presented for financial reporting purposes: Year ended 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 US$m US$m Deferred tax liabilities 78 50 Deferred tax assets 38 57 40 7 Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by ZK Mayskoye LLC, JSC Varvarinskoye, Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLP and CJSC Kapan MPC during the period up to 2026.
Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes.
The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group.
The Group believes that recoverability of the recognised deferred tax asset DTA of US$ 105 million at 31 December 2016 is more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2016.
The Group has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable income in the carry-forward period.
The Groups estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be economically developed.
The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufficient supporting evidence that the Group will generate taxable earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios.
The amount of the DTA considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced due to delays in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve estimates, increases in environmental obligations, or reductions in precious metal prices.
Effective from 1 January 2017 there are changes introduced to the Russian Federation tax law regarding loss carryforwards.
Loss carryforwards will be limited to 50% of taxable profit in tax years 2017 through 2020.

Laws and regulations affecting businesses in Russia continue to change rapidly, tax and regulatory frameworks are subject to varying interpretations.
The future economic direction of Russia and Kazakhstan is heavily influenced by the fiscal and monetary policies adopted by the government, together with developments in the legal, regulatory, and political environment.
Because Russia and Kazakhstan produce and export large volumes of oil and gas, their economies are particularly sensitive to the price of oil and gas on the global market.
During 2014-2015 and then in the first quarter of 2016, the oil price decreased significantly, which led to substantial decrease of the Russian Ruble exchange rate.
On 20 August 2015, the Government and the National Bank of Kazakhstan announced a transition to a new monetary policy based on free floating Tenge exchange rate, and cancelled the currency corridor.
In 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 Tenge depreciated significantly against major foreign currencies.

The above mentioned events have led to reduced access of the Russian businesses to international capital markets, increased inflation, economic recession and other negative economic consequences.
The impact of these economic developments on future operations and financial position of the Group has not been material.

Managements interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transaction and activity of the companies of the Group may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities and as a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed.
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
During 2016 and 2015 the Group has been involved in a number of litigations in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia.
