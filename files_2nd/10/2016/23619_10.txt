1 2 VIABILITY STATEMENT In accordance with provision C. 2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Corporate Governance Code, the directors have assessed the viability of the group and have selected a period of three years for the assessment.
The group operates in volatile sectors and geographical markets but has more than half of its revenues based on annual subscriptions with strong renewal rates, has no outstanding debt and few long-term financial obligations.
The group uses a three-year strategic planning cycle and the directors have determined that three years is also an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement.
The assessment conducted considered the groups operating profit, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, cash ows, dividend cover and other key financial ratios over the three-year period.
These metrics were subject to severe downside stress and sensitivity analysis over the assessment period, taking account of the groups current position, the groups experience of managing adverse conditions in the past and the impact of a number of severe yet plausible scenarios, based on the principal risks set out in the Strategic Report.
The stress testing considered the principal risks assessed to have the highest probability of occurrence or the severest impact, crystallising both individually and in combination.
The assessment modelled a significant downturn in the world economy affecting all three years of the assessment period and a number of successive product and business failures, including the failure of a new acquisition.
In making the assessment, the directors have considered the groups robust capital position, the cash-generative nature of the business, the ability of the group to cut costs quickly, the access to available credit, the absence of significant pension and M&A liabilities and the groups ability to restrict dividends.
Based on the results of this analysis, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.
