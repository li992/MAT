Probability of Default refers to the probability of a customer or counterparty defaulting within the next 12 months which is typically taken as three payments past due.
A default probability model predicts this probability by using credit scores along with financial, behavioural and qualitative inputs.
Key components of the Loss Given Default are the propensity to cure, that is the likelihood propensity for a defaulting account to be restored to a performing status, and the level of security held in relation to the credit 117 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Impaired loan analysis Individually impaired balances are further analysed as follows: SME Commercial Residential 1 Asset Finance Invoice Finance Mortgages Buy-to-Let Mortgages Total 2016 m m m m m m Impaired but not past due 1.0 2.4 0.5 0.1 4.0 Past due less than 3 months 2.5 0.6 0.2 1.5 0.6 5.4 Past due 3-6 months 3.1 0.1 2.8 3.8 9.8 Past due 6-12 months 2.0 1.0 1.2 3.2 1.4 8.8 Past due over 12 months 0.7 1.9 4.0 0.7 0.3 7.6 9.3 3.6 7.8 8.7 6.2 35.6 Of which: Possessions 0.7 0.6 5.5 0.2 7.0 SME Commercial Residential 1 Asset Finance Invoice Finance Mortgages Buy-to-Let Mortgages Total 2015 m m m m m m Impaired but not past due 1.4 0.9 1.3 3.6 Past due less than 3 months 1.2 0.1 0.1 1.4 Past due 3-6 months 1.2 0.2 3.4 2.8 3.3 10.9 Past due 6-12 months 1.3 0.5 1.6 0.5 3.9 Past due over 12 months 1.6 2.1 3.6 0.7 0.2 8.2 6.7 2.9 7.9 6.4 4.1 28.0 Of which: Possessions 0.8 0.4 1.2 1 The above analysis includes Property Development.

The analysis excludes Property Development.
Property Development We use loan to gross development value as an indicator of the quality of credit security of performing loans for the Property Development portfolio.
Loan to gross development value is a measure used to monitor the loan balance drawn compared against the expected gross development value once the development is complete.
Average loan to gross development value at origination for Property Development loans at 31 December 2016 was 58.05% 31 December 2015: 56.97%.
This reduces the Groups risk exposure.
As at 31 December 2016, 96.15% of the exposures with Loan to Value in excess of 85% relate to the Help to Buy Scheme 31 December 2015: 89.16%.
The Help to Buy guarantee portfolio, which makes up the majority of the Help to Buy book, had an average indexed Loan to Value of 87.47% 31 December 2015: 90.68%.
As at 31 December 2016, the average indexed Loan to Value of the non-Help to Buy owner occupied book is 61.65% 31 December 2015: 64.14%.

As at 31 December 2016, the average advance rate against the fair value of sales ledger balances which have been assigned to the Group, net of amounts considered to be irrecoverable, is 62.30% 31 December 2015: 64.99%.
In addition to the value of the underlying sales ledger balances, we will wherever possible, obtain additional collateral before offering invoice finance facilities to a client.
These may include limited personal guarantees from major shareholders, charges over personal and other business property, cross guarantees from associated companies and unlimited warranties in the case of frauds or certain other breaches.
These additional forms of security are impractical to value given their nature.
Asset Finance In respect of Asset Finance, collateral is provided by our rights and or title to the underlying assets, which we are able to repossess in the event of default.
Where appropriate, we will also obtain additional security, such as parent company or personal guarantees.
Asset Finance also undertakes a small volume of unsecured lending where we have obtained an understanding of the ability of the borrowers business to generate cash flows to service and repay the facilities provided.
As at 31 December 2016, the total amount of such unsecured lending was 40.7m 31 December 2015: 30.3m.

125 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Management Cash placements Credit risk of Group and treasury counterparties is controlled through the treasury credit risk policy which limits the maximum exposure by entity with which the Group can place cash deposits.
All institutions need to be rated at investment grade at the time of placement.
High quality liquid assets included in the liquidity buffer As part of the liquidity buffer, we hold certain debt securities which qualify as high quality liquid assets included in the liquidity buffer.
These instruments are AAA to AA rated.
The portfolio includes UK Gilts, supranational bonds, sovereign risk bonds issued by European governments and agencies and corporate bonds.
Asset-backed securities ABS We have a portfolio of ABS.
The majority of these investments are in AAA or AA to AArated bonds secured on UK originated assets.
All investments are in Sterling: no foreign currency bonds were bought.
The portfolio has credit enhancement, providing principal protection against losses.
Derivatives Credit risk on derivatives is controlled through a policy of only entering into contracts with a small number of UK credit institutions, with an investment grade credit rating.
Most derivative contracts are collateralised through the receipt payment of daily cash margin calls to cover the mark to market value of the asset liability.
Offsetting financial assets and liabilities It is our policy to enter into master netting and margining agreements with all derivative counterparties.
In general, under master netting agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty that are due on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency under the agreement are aggregated into a single net amount being payable by one party to the other.
In certain circumstances, for example when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated.
Under the margining agreements where we have a net asset position with a counterparty valued at current market values, in respect of derivatives, then that counterparty will place collateral, usually cash, with us in order to cover the position.
Similarly, we will place collateral, usually cash, with the counterparty where it has a net liability position.
As our derivatives are under master netting and margining agreements as described, they do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position.
The following tables detail amounts of financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar arrangements including the Funding for Lending Scheme, and the Term Funding Scheme as detailed in Notes 22.
