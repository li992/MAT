Risk Management Investment in emerging markets equities inevitably involves risk in a volatile asset class, and portfolios constructed from the bottom up may be exposed to risks that become evident when viewed from the top down.
Franklin Templeton Investments uses a comprehensive approach to managing risks within our portfolio.

This philosophy is integrated into each step of the investmentprocess: Risk management is led first and foremost by experienced portfolio managers.
It is integrated within each step of the Managers fundamental, research-driven process, and includes regular interaction with their independent Performance Analysis and Investment Risk PAIR team.
