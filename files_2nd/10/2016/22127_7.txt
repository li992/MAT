Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2019.
In making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group, taking account of its current position, the risk appetite, the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.
The business plan considers the Groups cash flow, capital commitments, financial resources, debt covenants and other key financial risks.
A sensitivity analysis was carried out which involved flexing a number of the main assumptions to consider alternative macro-economic conditions, both positive and negative.
This analysis was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of the Groups principal risks actually occurring.
The Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its principal risks successfully.
The Group also considered the impact of significant economic downturn leading to asset value and rental income decline, as well as rising interest rates.
This assessment has considered the potential impacts of these risks on the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.
The Directors have determined that the three-year period to December 2019 is an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement.
In making their assessment, the Directors have taken account of the Groups robust and flexible balance sheet position with a debt to asset ratio well below the 40 per cent limit set, substantial cash and available facilities, the Groups ability to raise new finance and the flexibility of future development expenditure.
