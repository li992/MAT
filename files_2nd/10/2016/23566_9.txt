The Companys existing risk management structure is set out below.
COM STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS Failure to address the decline in Health & Personal Care Packaging The deterioration in the performance of the Health & Personal Care Packaging business during FY 2016 significantly impacted the overall financial results of the Company.
The failure to successfully mitigate the risks associated with the integration of certain acquired Clondalkin SPD sites has seen the loss of certain customers and the reduction of volumes from certain other customers.
In addition, margin erosion impacted the profitability of remaining business.
Failure of the Company to successfully address the continuing decline in Health & Personal Care Packaging could lead to further significant deterioration in the overall financial performance of the Company.
Impact Mitigation Failure to address the deterioration in Health & Personal Care In seeking to redress the decline in the performance of the Health Packaging could lead to: & Personal Care Packaging business, Essentra will seek to: Loss of customers Deliver operational improvements and efficiencies Loss of revenue Secure quality and service improvements Margin erosion Restore customer confidence and trust Quality and service failings Successfully manage customer relationships Potential further impairment Secure new business Loss of reputation People and experience The success of Essentra will be dependent on and will reflect its ability to retain, attract and motivate employees.
This ability is necessary in order to sustain, develop and grow its businesses and deliver Essentras strategic objectives.
There can be no assurance that these employees will remain with the Company.
2016 saw a number of employees leave Essentra in response to challenges within the business, and further departures could potentially impact the Companys ability to fulfil its objectives in 2017 and beyond.
It is important that the Company successfully engages with current employees to ensure their continued commitment to the further strategic development of Essentra and attracts further talent to drive future growth opportunities.
Impact Mitigation If Essentra fails to retain, attract or motivate the required calibre In order to manage the risk of personnel change, Essentra: of employees, its operational performance and financial condition may be materially impacted by a lack of: Regularly reviews personal development and succession planning Implements management development schemes and other Experience training programmes Expertise Sets effective remuneration programmes Commercial relationships Provides long-term share-based incentive plans Market insight Uses a talent management system Product innovation Continues to recruit graduates on its development programme Conducts regular reviews of employee engagement 32 STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.
COM Customer profile and retention In some of Essentras businesses the customer base is relatively concentrated.
Should Essentras customers decide to satisfy their requirements internally or from other suppliers, and if Essentra were unable to secure new revenue streams, this could result in a significant loss of business.
Essentra must serve an increasingly complex profile of customers, who will be heavily reliant on the Company in some cases.
There is now an increased expectation from these customers, and Essentra risks losing business should it fail to adequately measure customer satisfaction and manage relationships.
Essentra recognises that the failure to successfully mitigate the risks identified with the integration of the Health & Personal Care Packaging business to ensure the delivery of the level of quality and service expected, has led to the loss of customers and reduced volumes from certain remaining customers.
Impact Mitigation The loss of certain of Essentras key customers may expose To counteract the Companys exposure to its customer the Company to: profile, Essentra: Reduced revenue Invests in innovative, high-quality, value-added products and services Restructuring costs Develops long-term relationships and loyalty with customers Profit decline at all levels through Key Account Management techniques Deterioration in financial condition Seeks new markets and growth opportunities to expand its Reputational damage customer base Disruption to infrastructure A catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of any of Essentras manufacturing or distribution facilities due to accident, labour issues, fire, terrorist attack, natural disaster, information technology failure, political unrest or otherwise which, whether shortor long-term, could adversely affect the Companys ability to meet the demands of its customers.
Some of the assets maintained by the Company, such as tooling and IT systems, are critical to the manufacture and delivery of particular products.
An independent assessment of the nature and extent of the Companys existing business continuity plans conducted in the second half of 2016 recommended a number of improvements to better facilitate Essentras ability to respond to this area of risk, and the Company will be implementing various new protocols during 2017 and beyond.
Impact Mitigation A material disruption to operational facilities or the loss of Essentra seeks to manage the risk of potential disruption critical assets may negatively affect the Companys: of the supply of its customers by: Production capability and asset base Operating within a flexible global infrastructure Supply chain management Installing fire and other risk prevention systems Customer relationships Implementing disaster recovery and business continuity plans Reputation Assessing operational risks Revenue Maintaining a comprehensive insurance programme Profit Aligning Group information technology resources Financial condition 33 ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.
COM STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS Tobacco industry market dynamics A substantial part of Essentras business relates to the supply of filter products and packaging solutions to manufacturers in the tobacco industry.
Future performance may be affected by market dynamics within the industry, including commercial pressures from customers, global consumption shift from western to eastern markets, overall declining market growth, customer self-manufacture, next-generation product development such as e-cigarettes and evolving legislation.
Essentra cannot be competitive unless it manages and adapts its operational capacity in line with these trends.
Tobacco-related litigation could also adversely affect Essentra, although there is no history of the Company being involved in such claims.
Impact Mitigation Tobacco industry market dynamics may lead to: In seeking to minimise the potential impact of the exposure to the tobacco industry, Essentra: Reduced revenue Invests in the research and development of innovative Restructuring costs and new value-added products and services Profit decline Targets growth opportunities outside the manufacture Reputational damage of filter products Deterioration in financial condition Focuses on low-cost filter production Litigation risk Takes internal and external legal advice to manage litigation risk Seeks to add value with a range of low-cost and innovative packaging solutions Emerging technologies and new competition pressures Essentra faces pressure from direct competitors, as well as new competition from alternative technologies.
Some of the Companys competitors may derive advantage from greater financial resources, economies of scale or additional purchasing power or a lower cost base, and Essentra may face aggressive pricing practices.
Impact Mitigation Demand for competitors products and the development of Essentra seeks to mitigate the risk of competitive competing technologies may result in: pressure by: Loss of market positions Exploiting innovation and manufacturing capabilities in new technologies, products and services Erosion of margins Developing long-term relationships with customers at Intellectual property challenges a senior level Decline in revenue Protecting its intellectual property rights Decline in profitability Expanding its international distribution, sales and Deterioration in financial condition marketing expertise Investing in both organic and acquisition growth opportunities 34 STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.
COM Key raw materials supply Some of Essentras businesses are dependent on the availability of specialist raw materials or components which are incorporated into the Companys products.
Key raw materials may be subject to price fluctuations from supply shortages.
If rapid increases occur in the price of such raw materials, including energy costs, the Companys revenue and profitability may be materially and adversely affected.
Impact Mitigation If Essentra is exposed to raw materials price increases or supply To counteract the Companys exposure to increases in raw shortages, the Company may suffer: materials costs or supply shortages, Essentra seeks to: Disruption to supply Adopt appropriate procurement practices Increased costs Secure longer-term supply agreements Profit decline Implement cost recovery programmes Reduced revenue Investigate the availability of alternative supply options Use consignment stock Information Technology systems and cyber security The current diversity and functionality limitations of existing Information Technology systems within Essentra could inhibit the Companys ability to perform and meet its strategic objectives.
A number of Essentra business processes are reliant on information technology systems, and failure to address current limitations could significantly impact on the operation and reporting of business activities.
In addition, Essentra holds sensitive information relating to its customers, suppliers and employees, as well as intellectual property and financial data that needs to be held securely.
Should security be breached, Essentra risks loss of customers and suppliers, information breach fines, disruption of normal operations and reputational damage.
Impact Mitigation Failure to have adequate measures in place may lead to: To counteract the limitations in the Companys existing Information Technology systems and reduce the Companys Reduced revenue and profit exposure to cyber security breaches, Essentra: Disruption of normal operations Invests in industry best practice security software Litigation Maintains a Security Operations Centre and acts upon Reputational damage external expert advice Undertakes internal cyber security development initiatives Reviews options to secure alignment on information technology resources across the Company Makes targeted investment to drive information technology systems improvements 35 ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.
COM STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS Compliance risk Risk related to regulatory and legislative changes involves the possible failure of the Company to comply with current, changing or new legislation or regulation.
Many of Essentras current business activities are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement activity by relevant authorities.
As the Company moves into new markets and territories in pursuit of its strategic priorities, Essentra is exposed to new and additional compliance risk.
The Company recognises the fundamental importance of ensuring the appropriate ethical culture in the management of this risk, and 2017 will also see a review of the Companys governance and compliance activities to further drive the right behaviours.
Impact Mitigation Failure by the Company or its employees or others acting on its In order to manage compliance risk Essentra: behalf to abide by the laws and regulations could result in: Seeks to establishes a clear compliance culture Administrative, civil or criminal liability Conducts risk assessments and ongoing compliance reviews Significant fines and penalties Implements relevant policies and procedures Suspense or debarment of the Company from trading Provides behavioural guidance and training to all employees Reputational damage Monitors compliance through internal audit review and other Loss of commercial relationships verification procedures Engages local advisers as appropriate Innovation Essentras development and growth has benefited from the success of start-up operations and the continued growth of already established businesses.
The rate of success of any development may in part be dependent on the Groups innovation pipeline and the ability of the Company to be innovative with its operations in order to create efficiencies.
There can be no assurance that the Company will anticipate market demand, develop, complete and commercialise current and suitable new products, or be successfully innovative in its operations.
Impact Mitigation If Essentra fails to meet the challenges of innovation, Essentra seeks to address the challenges of the Company may experience: international business development with: Lower growth rates Experienced and skilled management Delay in the achievement of strategic objectives Detailed due diligence and planning Reduced profitability Continuous improvement programmes Innovation programmes with targeted investment support 36 STRATEGIC REPORT | MANAGEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS ANNUAL REPORT 2016 | WWW.
COM Mergers and acquisitions Essentras future development and growth may be derived from value-adding acquisitions.
The rate of any future acquisition integration may in part be dependent on the success of identifying the correct acquisitions and having sufficient resources available to successfully deliver cost savings, synergies or to otherwise add value.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in completing and integrating suitable acquisitions.
The failure to manage and integrate projects successfully may lead to customer loss, revenue decline and margin erosion.
Essentra recognises that the failure to successfully mitigate the risks identified in the integration of the Health & Personal Care Packaging business led to subsequent deterioration in the performance of the business.
Impact Mitigation If Essentra fails to meet the challenges of business development In future, Essentra will seek to address the challenges of mergers arising from acquisitions, the Company may experience: and acquisitions and any subsequent integration activities with: Lower growth rates Experienced and skilled management Delay in the achievement of strategic objectives Detailed due diligence and planning Increased costs Project risk reviews Reduced profitability External expert advice Customer loss Targeted investment to manage change within acquired businesses 37
