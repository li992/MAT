Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Internal controls and risk management The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its responsibility for, the Groups systems of internal control and risk management and receives regular reports on such matters.
The Boards policy is to have systems in place which optimise the Groups ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner.
The Board has delegated to the Executive Committee detailed responsibility for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding how these are to be managed.
In addition to formal reviews of risk management by the Executive Committee, members are expected to report to the Executive Committee as necessary the occurrence of any material internal control issues, serious accidents or events that have had a major commercial impact, or any significant new risks which have been identified.
Such matters are reported to the next Board meeting and or Audit Committee meeting as appropriate.
The Group also has in place systems and procedures for exercising control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated accounts which are monitored by the Audit Committee on the Boards behalf and reviewed annually by the Board.
These include: the formulation and deployment of Group accounting policies and procedures: Group policies governing the maintenance of accounting records, transaction reporting and key financial control procedures: monthly operational review meetings which include, as necessary, reviews of internal financial reporting issues and financial control monitoring: and ongoing training and development of financial reporting personnel.
The Groups systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects of the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
They are not designed to eliminate such risk, recognising that any system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board formally reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Groups system of internal controls on an annual basis.
The latest review covered the financial year to 25 March 2016.
No significant failings or weaknesses were identified from this review.
The Board has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group and the resources that our business devotes to them.
This process is continual and has been in place for the year under review up to the date of this report, and is regularly reviewed by the Board in accordance with relevant guidance.
There is an established framework of internal controls, which is set out in procedures approved by the Board and which include financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
These procedures are readily accessible to staff, who follow their guidance.
The most important elements of this framework are described below: Management structure The Board has overall responsibility for the Company and the Executive Committee has responsibility for specific aspects of the Groups affairs.
The Board and each of its committees operate under a schedule of matters or terms of reference and the Board determines how the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee may operate within a framework of delegated authorities and reserved powers which seek to ensure that certain transactions which are significant in terms of their size or type, are undertaken only after Board review.
The Executive Committee is chaired by Charles Wilson Chief Executive and comprises Jonathan Prentis Group Finance Director, Guy Farrant Chief Operating Officer, Mark Chilton Company Secretary and General Counsel and other senior executives representing the operational functions within the Group.
It meets every two weeks to discuss operational matters, compliance, health and safety and trading performance.
Corporate accounting and procedures Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of the corporate communication procedure.
Accounting, delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures, together with the general ethos of the Group are included in these communications, and standardised accounting policies are in place reflecting this policy.
These procedures are subject to review to ensure that improvements to enhance controls can be made.
Quality and integrity of personnel The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training.
Quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment and the ethical standards expected are communicated through senior members of staff.
Three year business plan Each year the Group produces a three year business plan which covers development of profits and cash flow generation over the period.
Budgetary process Each year the Board approves the annual budget, which includes an assessment of key risk areas.
Performance is monitored and relevant action taken throughout the year by regular reporting to the Board of updated forecasts together with information on key risk areas.

16 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Assessment of the Groups prospects Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least twelve months from the date of this report.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups and Companys financial statements.
Further information in relation to the Directors assessment of going concern is contained in note 1f to the financial statements.
Viability Statement In accordance with provision C. 2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 'the Code', the Directors have assessed the Groups viability over a three year period to March 2019.
This period has been considered for the following reasons: The Groups strategic planning cycle covers a three year period: For major investment projects three years is considered by the Board to be a reasonable time horizon for an assessment of the outcome: and, The business model can be evolved for significant changes in market structure or government policy over the three year period.
The Group produces a forecast three year business plan which incorporates projections for income and cash flow.
An analysis has been completed to evaluate the financial impact including on sales, profitability and liquidity of the Group's principal risks, set out on pages 15 to 16, occurring whether individually or in unison over the period, including in a number of severe but plausible scenarios.
The analysis also assesses the potential impact on the Group's available sources of funding and the range of mitigating actions that would be available to offset the effect of those risks, should they arise.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment.
Strategic report approval The Strategic Report, outlined on pages 1 to 17, including the assessment of the Group's prospects as set out above incorporates the Highlights, the Business Profile and Key Performance Indicators, the Chairmans Statement, the Chief Executives Review, the Group Finance Directors Report, the Corporate Social Responsibility Report and the Management of Risks and Uncertainties sections of this document.
