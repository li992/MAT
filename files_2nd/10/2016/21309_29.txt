barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information The Groups approach to management and representation of credit quality Asset credit quality All loans and advances are categorised as either neither past due nor impaired, past due but not impaired, or past due and impaired, which includes restructured loans.
For the purposes of the disclosures in the balance sheet credit quality section below and the analysis of loans and advances and impairment section page 186 : loans neither past due nor impaired consist predominantly of wholesale and retail loans that are performing.
These loans, although unimpaired may carry an unidentified impairment a loan is considered past due and classified as Higher risk when the borrower has failed to make a payment when due under the terms of the loan contract loans on forbearance programmes, as defined on page 182, are categorised as Higher risk.
the impairment allowance includes allowances against financial assets that have been individually impaired and those subject to collective impairment.
The Group uses the following internal measures to determine credit quality for loans that are performing: Wholesale lending Probability of Credit Quality Default Grade default Description 1-3 0.0-0.05% Strong 4-5 0.05-0.15% 6-8 0.15-0.30% 9-11 0.30-0.60% 12-14 0.60-2.15% Satisfactory 15-19 2.15-11.35% 20 - 21 11.35% Higher risk For retail clients, a range of analytical tools is used to derive the probability of default of clients at inception and on an ongoing basis.
For loans that are performing, these descriptions can be summarised as follows: Strong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.
Satisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Group, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to retail facilities, such as credit card balances and unsecured loans, which have been classified as satisfactory, regardless of the fact that the output of internal grading models may have indicated a strong or high classification.
At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, home loans with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.
Higher risk: there is concern over the obligors ability to make payments when due.
However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency.
There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided.
However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.
Loans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Groups impairment policies.
These loans are all considered Higher risk for the purpose of this analysis of credit quality.
Debt securities For assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer.
Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies.
The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poors, Fitch or Moodys.
Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.
Balance sheet credit quality The following tables present the credit quality of Group assets exposed to credit risk.
Overview As at 31 December 2016, the ratio of the Groups assets classified as strong remained broadly stable at 86% 2015: 85% of total assets exposed to credit risk.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Analysis of the concentration of credit risk A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.
The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged.
Further detail on the Groups policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented on page 136 of Barclays PLC 2016 Pillar 3 Report.
Geographic concentrations As at 31 December 2016, the geographic concentration of the Groups assets remained broadly consistent with 2015.
The decrease of 58bn in Africa and the Middle East is due to the reclassification of BAGL balances now held for sale.

Basis of preparation The Group presents the direct balance sheet exposure to credit and market risk by country, with the totals reflecting allowance for impairment, netting and cash collateral held where appropriate.
The net on-balance sheet exposure includes: Loans and advances held at amortised cost, net of impairment.
Settlement balances and cash collateral are excluded from this analysis Trading assets and liabilities are presented by issuer type on a net basis.
Where liability positions exceed asset positions by issuer type, exposures are presented as nil Derivative assets and liabilities are presented by counterparty type on a net basis.
Cash collateral held is then added to give a net credit exposure.
Where liability positions and collateral held exceed asset positions by counterparty type, exposures are presented as nil Financial investments debt securities principally relating to investments in government bonds and other debt securities Other assets held for sale.
Businesses held for sale with European exposures are included within the Financial institutions category The analysis excludes financial assets not subject to credit risk: Equity securities held for trading, as financial investments or designated at fair value, and traded commodities Reverse repurchase agreements measured at amortised cost and at fair value which are materially fully collateralised Gross exposure reflects total exposures before the effects of economic hedging by way of trading portfolio liabilities, derivative liabilities and cash collateral, but after taking into account impairment allowances and IFRS netting.
The Italian home loans of 9.7bn 2015: 9.5bn are secured on residential property with average balance weighted marked to market LTVs of 61.8% 2015: 60.6% and CRL coverage of 36% 2015: 31%.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Industry concentrations The concentration of the Groups assets by industry remained broadly consistent year on year.
As at 31 December 2016, total assets concentrated towards banks and other financial institutions was 43% 2015: 42%, predominantly within derivative financial instruments.
The proportion of the overall balance concentrated towards governments and central banks remained stable at 14% 2015: 12% and home loans at 11% 2015: 12%.
Net on-balance sheet exposure to the oil and gas sector was 4.2bn 2015: 4.4bn, with contingent liabilities and commitments to this sector of 16.0bn 2015: 13.8bn.
The ratio of the Groups net total exposures classified as strong or satisfactory was 93% 2015: 97% of the total net exposure to credit risk to this sector.
This was offset by lending of 20bn driven by volume growth and foreign currency movements due to the appreciation of average US Dollar and Euro against Sterling.
There was also a net 9bn increase in settlement and cash collateral balances.
Credit risk loans CRLs and the ratio of CRLs to gross loans and advances excluding BAGL balances now held for sale remained stable at 6.5bn 2015: 6.4bn and 1.5% 2015: 1.6% respectively.
Loan impairment charges increased 0.6bn to 2.4bn primarily due to increased charges following the management review of impairment modelling for UK and US cards portfolios and the impairment of a number of single name exposures.
Overall, this resulted in an 11bps increase in the loan loss rate to 53bps.

Annualised gross charge-off rates increased due to accelerated asset sales in the latter half of the year and accelerated charge-off of informal arrangements stock.
The recovery book impairment coverage ratio increased, reflecting the impact of increased flow into charge-off.
UK personal loans: 30 day arrears increased to 2.1% 2015: 1.9% and 90 day arrears increased to 0.9% 2015: 0.8% driven by portfolio growth and an increased level of operational delinquency from new customer acquisitions.
The recovery book proportion of outstanding balances reduced to 4.7% 2015: 7.5% due to an asset sale that also resulted in an increase in the recovery book impairment coverage ratio to 77.2% 2015: 73.9%.
US cards: Gross loans and advances increased 43% to 23.9bn due to portfolio growth, new acquisitions and appreciation of USD against GBP.
Increased arrears and charge-off rates were driven by a change in portfolio mix, volume growth and the appreciation of average USD against GBP.
Barclays Partner Finance: Portfolio arrears and charge-off rates remained broadly steady during 2016.
Germany cards: Loans and advances were 28% higher, mainly due to a combination of the appreciation of EUR against GBP and portfolio growth.
90 day arrears and charge off rates remained stable, while the recovery book coverage ratio reduced slightly reflecting favourable recovery expectations.

The table includes an age analysis for loans and advances collectively assessed as impaired.
Loans that are collectively assessed as impaired consist predominantly of retail loans that are one day or more past due for which a collective allowance is raised.
Wholesale loans that are past due, individually assessed as unimpaired, but which carry an unidentified impairment provision, are excluded from this category.
Loans that are individually assessed as impaired consist predominantly of wholesale loans that are past due and for which an individual allowance has been raised.
Home loans, unsecured loans and credit card receivables that are subject to forbearance in the retail portfolios are included within the collectively assessed for impairment category.
Where wholesale loans under forbearance have been impaired, these form part of individually assessed impaired loans.
180 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Potential credit risk loans PCRLs and coverage ratios The Group reports potentially and actually impaired loans as PCRLs.
PCRLs comprise two categories of loans: credit risk loans CRLs and potential problem loans PPLs.
CRLs comprise three classes of loans: impaired loans: comprises loans where an individually identified impairment allowance has been raised.
This category also includes all retail loans that have been transferred to a recovery book.
See page 182 for further analysis of impaired loans accruing past due 90 days or more: comprises loans that are 90 days or more past due with respect to principal or interest impaired and restructured loans: comprises loans not included above where, for economic or legal reasons related to the debtors financial difficulties, a concession has been granted to the debtor that would not otherwise be considered.
For information on restructured loans refer to disclosures on forbearance on pages 182 to 185.
PPLs are loans that are currently complying with repayment terms but where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to continue to comply with such terms in the near future.
If the credit quality of a wholesale loan on a watchlist deteriorates to the highest category, or a retail loan deteriorates to delinquency cycle 2 typically when past due 60 to 90 days, consideration is given to including it within the PPL category.
The CRL coverage ratio for retail portfolios increased to 82% 2015: 72% primarily due to increased impairment allowances following the management review of the UK and US cards portfolio impairment modelling.
PPLs increased to 2.2bn 2015: 1.7bn primarily within Barclays International wholesale portfolios.
The increase was driven by exposures within the Corporate and Investment bank across a number of industries.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 181 Risk review Risk performance Credit risk Impaired loans The following table represents an analysis of impaired loans in line with the disclosure recommended by the Enhanced Disclosure Taskforce.
Impaired loans are a subcomponent of CRLs defined on page 181 and comprise loans where an individually identified impairment allowance has been raised.
For the majority of products, transfer to a recovery book occurs for loans that are past due over 6 months unless a forbearance agreement is agreed.
Earlier transfer points may occur depending on specific circumstances.
Impaired loans may include loans that are still performing, fully collateralised loans or where indebtedness has already been written down to the expected realisable value.

Retail balances on forbearance programmes reduced 6% to 1.4bn and reflected a decrease in Barclays UK and Barclays Non-Core offset by an increase in Barclays International portfolios.
Barclays UK: The reduction was driven by UK cards portfolio, where balances on forbearance plans are lower due to the application of an updated entry criteria, as well as asset sales.
Barclays International: The increase in US cards forbearance was in line with portfolio growth and appreciation of the US Dollar against Sterling.
Wholesale balances on forbearance increased by 32% to 2.9bn due to an increase in the Barclays Core portfolio where forbearance programmes increased mainly in performing segments of the corporate portfolio due to a change in methodology, extending the previously narrow scope of forbearance in relation to adjustment on non-enforcement of convenants.
This change has been applied consistently across the corporate portfolio with the increase primarily at the higher end of the corporate portfolio where there is a greater tendency for exposure to be under covenants.
Notes a Exchange and other adjustments for 2016 includes the reclassification of 1,015m related to BAGL balances now held for sale offset by currency movements due to the appreciation of average US Dollar and Euro against Sterling.

UK cards: Balances on forbearance plans have reduced due to an updated entry criteria, as well as asset sales.
The forbearance impairment coverage ratio has increased due to implementation of updated impairment methodology.
UK personal loans: Increased forbearance coverage ratio reflects the changes in methodology to align with the impairment policy.
US cards: Balances are higher in line with portfolio growth while the balances in arrears remain stable.
Past-due balances as a proportion of total balances have reduced, which reflects in the lower forbearance impairment coverage ratio.

Overview of market risk This section contains key statistics describing the market risk profile of the Group, such as Value at Risk VaR and Annual Earnings at risk AEaR measures.
A distinction is made between regulatory and management measures within the section.
The market risk management sections on pages 138 to 145 and 150 to 157 of the Barclays PLC 2016 Pillar 3 Report provide descriptions of these metrics: page 192 provides a view of market risk in the context of the Groups balance sheet pages 193 to 194 cover the management of traded market risk.

Measures of market risk in the Group and accounting measures Traded market risk measures such as VaR and balance sheet exposure measures have fundamental differences: balance sheet measures show accruals-based balances or marked to market values as at the reporting date VaR measures also take account of current marked to market values, but in addition hedging effects between positions are considered market risk measures are expressed in terms of changes in value or volatilities as opposed to static values.
For these reasons, it is not possible to present direct reconciliations of traded market risk and accounting measures.

Average Basis VaR increased by 2m to 5m 2015: 3m primarily due to a combination of structural changes in the cross currency markets that led to higher volatility and higher client activity in G10 cross currency basis.
Average Equity VaR decreased by 1m to 7m 2015: 8m reflecting reduced cash portfolio activities and a more conservative risk profile maintained in the derivatives portfolio.
Average Foreign Exchange Risk VaR was stable as a result of maintaining a conservative risk profile in the derivatives portfolio.
a Group Management VaR m 60 40 20 0 Jan Jan 31 Dec 2015 2016 2016 The daily VaR chart illustrates an average increasing trend in 2016.
Intermittent VaR increases were due to increased client flow in periods of heightened volatility in specific markets and subsequent risk management of the position.
b Diversification effects recognise that forecast losses from different assets or businesses are unlikely to occur concurrently, hence the expected aggregate loss is lower than the sum of the expected losses from each area.
Historic correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments.
The high and low VaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole.
Consequently a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 193 Risk review Risk performance Market risk Business Scenario Stresses As part of the Groups risk management framework the performance of the trading business in hypothetical scenarios characterised by severe macroeconomic conditions is modelled.
Up to seven global scenarios are modelled on a regular basis, for example, a sharp deterioration in liquidity, a slowdown in the global economy, terrorist attacks, global recession, and a sharp increase in economic growth.
In 2016, the scenario analyses showed that the largest market risk related impacts would be due to a severe deterioration in market liquidity and global recession.
Review of regulatory measures The following disclosures provide details on regulatory measures of Market risk.
See pages 141 to 143 of the Barclays PLC 2016 Pillar 3 Report for more detail on regulatory measures and the differences when compared to management measures.
The Groups market risk capital requirement comprises two elements: the market risk of trading book positions booked to legal entities that are measured under a PRA approved internal models approach, including Regulatory VaR, Stressed Value at Risk SVaR, Incremental Risk Charge IRC, and Comprehensive Risk Measure as required trading book positions that do not meet the conditions for inclusion within the approved internal models approach.
The capital requirement for these positions is calculated using standardised rules.
The table below summarises the regulatory market risk measures, under the internal models approach.
See Table 65 Market risk own funds requirements on page 85 of the Barclays PLC 2016 Pillar 3 Report for a breakdown of capital requirements by approach.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Non-traded market risk Overview The non-traded market risk framework covers exposures in the banking book, mostly consisting of exposures relating to accrual accounted and available for sale instruments.
The potential volatility of the net interest income of the bank is measured by an Annual Earnings at Risk AEaR metric that is monitored regularly and reported to Senior Management and the Board Risk Committee as part of the limit monitoring framework.
Net interest income sensitivity The table below shows a sensitivity analysis on pre-tax net interest income for non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities, including the effect of any hedging.
The sensitivity has been measured using the Annual Earnings at Risk AEaR methodology as described in the Barclays PLC 2016 Pillar 3 Report.
Note that this metric assumes an instantaneous parallel change to interest rate forward curves.
The model floors shocked market rates at zero: changes in net interest income sensitivity are only observed where forward rates are greater than zero.
The main model assumptions are: i one year time horizon: ii balance sheet is held constant: iii balances are adjusted for assumed behavioural profiles i. e. considers that customers may remortgage before the contractual maturity : and iv behavioural assumptions are kept unchanged in all rate scenarios.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 195 Risk review Risk performance Market risk Economic Capital by business unit Barclays measures some non-traded market risks using an economic capital EC methodology.
EC is predominantly calculated using a daily VaR model scaled to a 99% confidence interval.
A 99.98% confidence interval, as previously reported, is considered to be a very extreme shock i. e. a 1 in 5,000 event.
A 99% confidence interval is considered more appropriate and also aligns to other regulatory submissions.
For more information on definitions of prepayment, recruitment and residual risk, and on how EC is used to manage market risk, see the treasury and capital risk management section on page 138 of the Barclays PLC 2016 Pillar 3 Report.

Analysis of equity sensitivity The equity sensitivity table below measures the overall impact of a - 25bps movement in interest rates on retained earnings, available for sale and cash flow hedge reserves.
This data is captured using a DV01 metric which is an indicator of the shift in value for a 1 basis point movement in the yield curve.

The change in available for sale reserve sensitivities was driven by a reduction in interest rate risk in the liquidity pool during the year.
Movements in the available for sale reserve would impact CRD IV fully loaded CET1 capital, however the movement in the cash flow hedge reserve would not impact CET1 capital.
Notes a Residual risk for Barclays International includes Barclays Bank Delaware products to align with the NII disclosure.

196 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Volatility of the available for sale portfolio in the liquidity pool Changes in value of available for sale exposures flow directly through capital via the available for sale reserve.
The volatility of the value of the available for sale investments in the liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i. e. the Non-traded market risk VaR.
Although the underlying methodology to calculate the non-traded VaR is identical to the one used in traded management VaR, the two measures are not directly comparable.
The non-traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the available for sale exposures.
These exposures are in the banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.

The sharp reduction in available for sale VaR at the end of September was driven by a reduction in outright interest rate risk taken in the liquidity pool, which was re-established in early October.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to two sources of foreign exchange risk.
a Transactional foreign currency exposure Transactional foreign exchange exposures represent exposure on banking assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity.
The Groups risk management policies prevent the holding of significant open positions in foreign currencies outside the trading portfolio managed by Barclays International which is monitored through VaR.
Banking book transactional foreign exchange risk outside of Barclays International is monitored on a daily basis by the Market Risk function and minimised by the businesses.
b Translational foreign exchange exposure The Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies, principally USD, EUR and ZAR.
Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.
The Groups strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements by using the CET1 capital movements to broadly match the revaluation of the Groups foreign currency RWA exposures.
The economic hedges primarily represent the USD and EUR preference shares and Additional Tier 1 AT1 instruments that are held as equity, accounted for at historic cost under IFRS and do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes.
The decrease was broadly driven by an increase in ZAR hedges following Barclays announcement to reduce the Groups interest in BAGL.
Foreign currency net investments increased by 5.3bn to 38.5bn 2015: 33.2bn driven predominantly by the appreciation of US Dollar against Sterling.
The hedges associated with these investments increased by 5.0bn to 17.5bn 2015: 12.4bn.
Pension risk review The UK Retirement Fund UKRF represents approximately 96% 2015: 92% of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations globally.
As such, this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF.
The UKRF is closed to new entrants, and there is no new final salary benefit being accrued.
Existing active members accrue a combination of a cash balance benefit and a defined contribution element.
Pension risk arises as the estimated market value of the pension fund assets may decline, investment returns may reduce or the estimated value of the pension liabilities may increase.
See page 155 of the Barclays PLC 2016 Pillar 3 Report for more information on how pension risk is managed.
Assets The Trustee Board of the UKRF defines its overall long-term investment strategy with investments across a broad range of asset classes.
This ensures an appropriate mix of return seeking assets as well as liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations.
The main market risks within the asset portfolio are against interest rates and equities.
The split of scheme assets is shown within Note 35.
The fair value of the UKRF assets was 31.8bn as at 31 December 2016.
198 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 home.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Liabilities The UKRF retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration.
On an IAS 19 basis these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term price inflation rate RPI and the discount rate AA corporate bond yield curve : An increase in long-term expected inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities A decrease in the discount rate corresponds to an increase in liabilities.
Pension risk is generated through the Groups defined benefit schemes and this risk is set to reduce over time as our main defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants.
The chart below outlines the shape of the UKRFs liability cash flow profile as at 31 December 2016 that takes account of future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries, with the majority of the cash flows approximately 83% falling between 0 and 40 years, peaking within the 11 to 20 year band and reducing thereafter.
The shape may vary depending on changes in inflation expectation and mortality.
For more detail on the UKRFs financial and demographic assumptions see Note 35 Pensions and post retirement benefits.
The volatility shown by the fluctuation in the net IAS 19 pension position is reflective of the movements observed in the market.
In Q2 2016, the UKRF IAS 19 position deteriorated as the AA discount rate moved lower, driven by both a decrease in long-dated government bond yields as well as tightening in credit spreads.
During H2 2016, this trend continued driven by the outcome of the EU Referendum in June as well as the Bank of Englands announcement on quantitative easing in August.
These events drove significant market moves adversely affecting the UKRF AA discount rate.
For example, the market index IBOXXCorp AA yield was 53bps lower between June and September.
Gilt yields reverted higher in the months following September which was also reflected in higher AA discount rate.
As a result, the net IAS 19 position reverted close to zero as at 31 December 2016.
Please see Note 35 for the sensitivity of the UKRF to change in key assumptions.
Risk measurement In line with Barclays risk management framework, the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility of the pension positions on a total portfolio level.
This ensures that the risks, diversification and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations and investments are adequately captured.
VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis.
Risks are reviewed and reported regularly at forums including Market Risk Committee, Group Risk Committee, Pensions Management Group and Pension Executive Board.
The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities based on an IAS 19 basis see Note 35.
The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.
The pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are also reviewed regularly.
See Note 35 for more details.
In addition, the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of stress testing process.
Stress testing is performed internally on at least an annual basis.
The UKRF exposure is included as part of the regulatory stress tests.
Barclays defined benefit pension schemes affects capital in two ways: An IAS 19 deficit is treated as a liability on the Groups balance sheet.
Movement in a deficit due to remeasurements, including actuarial losses, are recognised immediately through Other Comprehensive Income and as such reduces shareholders equity and CET1 capital.
An IAS 19 surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders equity, however is deducted for the purposes of determining CET1 capital.
In the Groups statutory balance sheet, an IAS 19 surplus or deficit is partially offset by a deferred tax liability or asset respectively.
These may or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of the Group at the particular time.
Pension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually.
The Pillar 2A requirement forms part of the Groups overall regulatory minimum requirement for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital.
More detail on minimum regulatory requirements can be found in the Funding Risk Capital section on page 200. home.

The increase in CET1 capital was largely driven by profits of 2.1bn generated in the period, after absorbing the impact of notable items.
Other favourable movements included the currency translation reserve as a result of the appreciation of all major currencies against Sterling.
The increase in RWAs was principally due to the appreciation of South African Rand, US Dollar and Euro against Sterling and business growth, which more than offset RWA reductions in Non-Core.

Other significant movements in the year were: a 3.0bn increase in other qualifying reserves including a 3.7bn increase in the currency translation reserves as US Dollar, Euro and South African Rand strengthened against Sterling: partially offset by a 0.4bn decrease as a result of preference share redemptions and a 0.4bn decrease in available for sale reserves: a 0.3bn decrease, net of tax, as a result of movements relating to pensions.
There was a 1.0bn decrease in the retirement benefit reserve largely due to the UKRF, which is the Groups main pension scheme, moving from a 0.8bn surplus in December 2015 to a 27m deficit in December 2016.
The decrease in reserves was partially offset by the removal of a 0.7bn capital deduction for the UKRF asset in December 2015: a 0.9bn increase in minority interests following the sale of 12.2% of BAGLs issued share capital was partially offset by 0.3bn higher capital deductions.
Transitional AT1 capital remained largely flat in the period as redemptions and repurchases of 1.3bn of CRD IV end point non qualifying preference shares, tier one notes and reserve capital instruments were offset by the issuance of $1.5bn of end point qualifying AT1 capital instruments.

Summary of performance in the period The Group continued to maintain surpluses to its internal and regulatory requirements.
The liquidity pool increased to 165bn 2015: 145bn, primarily driven by the depreciation of GBP against other major currencies and net increase in retail and commercial deposits and wholesale funding to support business growth.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR was 131% December 2015: 133%, equivalent to a surplus of 39bn December 2015: 37bn.
Wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 158bn December 2015: 142bn.
The increase was driven by the prudent management of the liquidity position, holding company issuance and depreciation of GBP against other major currencies.
The Group issued 12.1bn equivalent of capital and senior unsecured debt from the holding company of which 8.6bn equivalent and 0.7bn equivalent in public and private senior unsecured debt respectively, and 2.8bn of capital instruments.
In the same period 7.4bn of Barclays Bank PLC capital and senior unsecured debt was bought back or called.

The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a banks liquidity risk profile by ensuring that it holds sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days.
The NSFR has a time horizon of 12 months and has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
The CRD IV LCR became effective on 1 October 2015, with a minimum ratio requirement in the UK of 80% as at 31 December 2016: this will increase to 90% on 1 January 2017 and then to 100% on 1 January 2018.
As of 31 December 2016, the Group reported a CRD IV LCR of 131% 2015: 133%.
In October 2014, the BCBS published a final standard for the NSFR with the minimum requirement to be introduced in January 2018 at 100% on an ongoing basis.
On 23 November 2016 the European Commission published draft amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation CRR including its proposed implementation of NSFR in the EU.
This proposal makes a number of changes from Basel NSFR, particularly in the treatment of derivative and secured financing transactions.
Barclays is in the process of assessing the impact of these changes on its NSFR ratio, and notes that NSFR is not proposed to be a binding regulation in the EU until two years after the European legislation is finalised.
We remain above 100% well ahead of implementation timelines, based on a conservative interpretation of the Basel rule.
Comparing internal and regulatory liquidity stress tests The LRA stress scenarios and the CRD IV LCR are all broadly comparable short-term stress scenarios in which the adequacy of defined liquidity resources is assessed against contractual and contingent stress outflows.
The CRD IV LCR stress tests provide an independent assessment of the Groups liquidity risk profile.

The continuous reassessment of these risks may lead to appropriate actions being taken with respect to sizing of the liquidity pool.
Liquidity pool The Group liquidity pool as at 31 December 2016 was 165bn 2015: 145bn.
During 2016, the month-end liquidity pool ranged from 132bn to 175bn 2015: 142bn to 168bn, and the month-end average balance was 153bn 2015: 155bn.
The liquidity pool is held unencumbered and is not used to support payment or clearing requirements.
Such requirements are treated as part of our regular business funding.
The liquidity pool is intended to offset stress outflows, and comprises the following cash and unencumbered assets.

In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type.
Given the incremental returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.
The Group manages the liquidity pool on a centralised basis.
As at 31 December 2016, 91% of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC 2015: 94% and was available to meet liquidity needs across the Group.
The residual liquidity pool is held predominantly within Barclays Capital Inc. BCI.
The portion of the liquidity pool outside of Barclays Bank PLC is held against entity-specific stressed outflows and regulatory requirements.
To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group.
Notes a Of the three stress scenarios monitored as part of the LRA, the 30-day Barclays-specific scenario results in the lowest ratio at 120% December 2015: 131%.
This compares to 134% December 2015: 144% under the 90-day market-wide scenario, and 144% December 2015: 133% under the 30-day combined scenario.
c Of which over 98% 2015: over 97% was placed with the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 211 Risk review Risk performance Funding risk liquidity Contingent liquidity In addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
In either a Barclays-specific or market-wide liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted.
In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at heavily discounted prices, the Group could generate liquidity via central bank facilities.
The Group maintains a significant amount of collateral pre-positioned at central banks and available to raise funding.
For more detail on the Groups other unencumbered assets see page 215.
Funding structure and funding relationships The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a solid funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due.
The Groups overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base geographically, by type and by counterparty and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.
Within this, the Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding.
As such, retail and commercial customer loans and advances are largely funded by customer deposits, with the surplus funding the liquidity pool.
Other assets, together with other loans and advances and unencumbered assets, are funded by long-term wholesale debt and equity.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements.
The liquidity pool is predominantly funded through wholesale markets.
These funding relationships are summarised below: 2016 2015 2016 2015 Assets bn bn Liabilities bn bn a a Loans and advances to customers 326 336 Customer accounts 374 374 Group liquidity pool 165 145 1 Year wholesale funding 70 54 1 Year wholesale funding 88 88 Other assets 185 135 Equity and other liabilities 151 104 Reverse repurchase agreements and other Repurchase agreements and other similar b b similar secured lending 190 178 secured borrowing 190 178 b b Derivative financial instruments 347 326 Derivative financial instruments 340 322 Total assets 1,213 1,120 Total liabilities 1,213 1,120 Deposit funding Deposit funding audited 2016 2015 Loans and advances to Customer Loan to Loan to Funding of loans and advances to customers customers deposits deposit ratio deposit ratio As at 31 December 2016 bn bn % % Barclays UK 167 189 Barclays International 98 152 Non-Core 19 c Total Barclays UK, Barclays International and Non-Core 284 341 83% 86% d Barclays International, Head Office and Non-Core 109 82 Total 393 423 93% 95% c Total Barclays UK, Barclays International and Non-Core are largely funded by customer deposits.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Although, contractually, current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice, the Groups broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances.
Such accounts form a stable funding base for the Groups operations and liquidity needs.
The Group assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer assets and liabilities to identify structural balance sheet funding gaps.
Customer behaviour is determined by quantitative modelling combined with qualitative assessment taking into account for historical experience, current customer composition, and macroeconomic projections.
These behavioural profiles represent our forward looking expectation of the run-off profile.
The relatively low cash outflow within one year demonstrates that customer funding remains broadly matched with customer assets from a behavioural perspective.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 213 Risk review Risk performance Funding risk liquidity a Composition of wholesale funding The Group maintains access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, money markets, and repo markets.
The Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and long-term investors through its clients worldwide, and is an active participant in money markets.
As a result, wholesale funding is well diversified by product, maturity, geography and major currency.
As at 31 December 2016, the Groups total wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 158bn December 2015: b 142bn.
70bn December 2015: 54bn of wholesale funding matures in less than one year, of which 22bn December 2015: 14bn relates to term funding.
As at 31 December 2016, outstanding wholesale funding comprised 26bn December 2015: 25bn of secured funding and 132bn December 2015: 117bn of unsecured funding.
As the Group progresses to a Single Point of Entry resolution model, Barclays continues to issue debt capital and term senior unsecured funding from Barclays PLC, the holding company, replacing maturing debt in Barclays Bank PLC.
These notes are issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.
Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by 95bn December 2015: 91bn.
Notes a The composition of wholesale funds comprises the balance sheet reported deposits from banks, financial liabilities at fair value, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities, excluding cash collateral and settlement balances and collateral swaps.
Included within deposits from banks are 4.5bn of liabilities drawn in the European Central Banks facilities.
b Term funding maturities comprise public benchmark and privately placed senior unsecured notes, covered bonds asset-backed securities ABS and subordinated debt where the original maturity of the instrument was more than 1 year.
c Includes structured notes of 30.8bn, 7.7bn of which matures within one year.

The Group has 21.2bn of term funding maturing in 2017 and 13.2bn in 2018.
The Group expect to continue issuing public wholesale debt in 2017 from Barclays PLC, in order to ensure compliance with new prospective loss absorbency requirements and to maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and distribution channel.
Encumbrance Asset encumbrance arises from collateral pledged against secured funding and other collateralised obligations.
Barclays funds a portion of trading portfolio assets and other securities via repurchase agreements and other similar borrowing, and pledges a portion of customer loans and advances as collateral in securitisation, covered bond and other similar secured structures.
Barclays monitors the mix of secured and unsecured funding sources within the Groups funding plan and seeks to efficiently utilise available collateral to raise secured funding and meet other collateral requirements.
Encumbered assets have been defined consistently with the Groups reporting requirements under Article 100 of the Capital Requirements Regulation CRR.
Securities and commodities assets are considered encumbered when they have been pledged or used to secure, collateralise or credit enhance a transaction which impacts their transferability and free use.
This includes external repurchase or other similar agreements with market counterparts.
Excluding assets positioned at central banks, as at 31 December 2016, 168bn December 2015: 157bn of the Groups assets were encumbered, primarily due to cash collateral posted, firm financing of trading portfolio assets and other securities and funding secured against loans and advances to customers.
Assets may also be encumbered under secured funding arrangements with central banks.
In advance of such encumbrance, assets are often positioned with central banks to facilitate efficient future draw down.
63bn December 2015: 88bn of on-balance sheet assets were positioned at the central banks, consisting of encumbered assets and collateral pre-positioned and available for use in secured financing transactions.
277bn December 2015: 212bn of on and off-balance sheet assets not positioned at the central bank were identified as readily available and available for use in secured financing transactions.
Additionally, they include cash and securities held in the Group liquidity pool as well as unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these additional assets are not relied upon in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
Loans and advances to customers are only classified as readily available if they are already in a form, such that, they can be used to raise funding without further management actions.
This includes excess collateral already in secured funding vehicles.
231bn December 2015: 208bn of assets not positioned at the central bank were identified as available as collateral.
These assets are not subject to any restrictions on their ability to secure funding, to be offered as collateral, or to be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, but are not immediately available in the normal course of business in their current form.
They primarily consist of loans and advances which would be suitable for use in secured funding structures but are conservatively classified as not readily available because they are not in transferable form.
Not available as collateral consists of assets that cannot be pledged or used as security for funding due to restrictions that prevent their pledge or use as security for funding in the normal course of business.
Derivatives and reverse repo assets relate specifically to derivatives, reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending.
These are shown separately as these on-balance sheet assets cannot be pledged.
However, these assets can give rise to the receipt of non-cash assets which are held off-balance sheet, and can be used to raise secured funding or meet additional funding requirements.
In addition, 406bn December 2015: 265bn of the total 466bn December 2015: 306bn securities accepted as collateral, and held off-balance sheet, were on-pledged, the significant majority of which related to matched-book activity where reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder relates primarily to reverse repurchases used to settle trading portfolio liabilities as well as collateral posted against derivatives margin requirements.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2016 217 Risk review Risk performance Funding risk liquidity Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements Barclays enters into repurchase and other similar secured borrowing agreements to finance its trading portfolio assets.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by offsetting repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder are used to settle trading portfolio liabilities.
Due to the high quality of collateral provided against secured financing transactions, the liquidity risk associated with this activity is significantly lower than unsecured financing transactions.
Nonetheless, Barclays manages to gross and net secured mismatch limits to limit refinancing risk under a severe stress scenario and a portion of the Groups liquidity pool is held against stress outflows on these positions.
The Group secured mismatch limits are calibrated based on market capacity, liquidity characteristics of the collateral and risk appetite.
The cash value of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions will typically differ from the market value of the collateral against which these transactions are secured by an amount referred to as a haircut or .
Typical haircut levels vary depending on the quality of the collateral that underlies these transactions.
For transactions secured against extremely liquid fixed income collateral, lenders demand relatively small haircuts typically ranging from 0-2%.
For transactions secured against less liquid collateral, haircuts vary by asset class typically ranging from 5-10% for corporate bonds and other less liquid collateral.

The rating actions were part of a wider set of actions which saw the two agencies place several UK banks on negative outlooks whilst affirming the ratings.
The ratings continue to carry a stable outlook with Fitch.
In December 2016, Moodys upgraded senior long-term ratings for both Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays PLC by one notch reflecting the continued build-up of loss absorbing capacity at Barclays PLC which would provide additional protection for Barclays Bank PLCs depositors and senior unsecured creditors, and Barclays PLCs senior unsecured creditors in a failure scenario.
The negative outlooks assigned in June remained in place as the rating agencys assessment of Barclays stand-alone credit strength was unaffected by the rating action.
S&P and Fitch affirmed Barclays ratings in July and December 2016 respectively as part of their periodic reviews.

Derivatives other than those designated in a hedging relationship and trading portfolio assets and liabilities are included in the on demand column at their fair value.
Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity since they are not held for settlement according to such maturity and will frequently be settled before contractual maturity at fair value.
Derivatives designated in a hedging relationship are included according to their contractual maturity.
Financial assets designated at fair value in respect of linked liabilities to customers under investment contracts have been included in other assets and other liabilities as the Group is not exposed to liquidity risk arising from them: any request for funds from creditors would be met by simultaneously liquidating or transferring the related investment.
