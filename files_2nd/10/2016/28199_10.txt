Entities are required to conduct impairment tests where there is an indication of impairment of an asset or a cash-generating unit, If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates of the fair values where an asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets.

Judgement is required to determine whether any economic or operating assumptions represent significant changes in the service potential of an asset or CGU.
Discounted cash flow models are prepared on the basis of such ORE RESERVES assumptions to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Groups properties.
Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the units-of-production method: In addition, indicators for impairment reversal must be assessed for assets other than goodwill previously impaired.
