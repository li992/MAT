B6.4 Risk Management Framework Introduction The Groups risk management framework is designed to enable management to identify and focus attention on the risks most significant to its objectives and to provide an early warning of events that put those objectives at risk.
The framework includes: The Board Risk and Compliance Committee and its sub-committees as described in B6.2 Dedicated teams within the Risk and Compliance function covering particular risk areas, described below A suite of risk policies, which include policies addressing: - Conduct risk - Complaint handling - Forbearance - Vulnerable customers - Operational risk - Credit risk - Financial crime A Compliance Handbook to advise business areas on regulatory matters supported by an active programme of Compliance surgeries Risk Champions appointed within all business areas to support the embedding of an effective risk culture across the Group A well-established and experienced Internal Audit function, supported by ongoing co-source arrangements with external providers when specific specialist skills are required The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 145 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Three lines of defence model The committee structures outlined above form the cornerstone for the governance of risk in a management framework organised within a Three Lines of Defence model as follows: The first line of defence, comprising executive directors, managers and employees, holds primary responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring risk management and control processes The second line of defence is provided by the Risk and Compliance function together with oversight provided by the Risk and Compliance Committee and supporting sub-committees The third line of defence is provided by the Internal Audit function and the Audit Committee which are responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defence In addition, there are further external levels of control that complement the three internal layers, provided by the external audit process and the monitoring activities of regulatory bodies.
The way in which this three lines of defence model aligns with the wider governance framework is illustrated below: BOARD Risk and Executive Audit Commitee Compliance Committee Operational Risk Credit ALCO and Compliance Committee Committee Business Risk Risk Function Internal Audit Management Oversight Independent Assurance First Line Second Line Third Line PAGE 146 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The risk management framework is intended to provide a structured and disciplined approach to the management of risk within an agreed appetite.

It provides a consistent basis for risk assessment and the development of policy, risk appetite and appropriate risk management structures.

Accordingly, the following common risk categorisations are used: Business Risk Credit Risk Conduct Risk Operational Risk Liquidity and Capital Risk Market Risk Pension Obligation Risk The principal risks identified under each of these headings are discussed in detail overleaf.
