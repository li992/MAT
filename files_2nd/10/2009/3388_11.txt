Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 27 Principal risks and uncertainties As described on page 50 and 51, the Board is responsible for the Groups systems of internal control and its risk management systems.
The Board has constituted a Risk Management Committee, which meets quarterly, to review the key risks associated with the achievement of the annual budget and the five year plan for each business: the top five health and safety risks identified at each site: and the risk control procedures implemented.
The Committee reports biannually to the Audit Committee and the Board and, through this process, the Board has identified the following principal risks currently facing the Group.
The mitigation actions taken by the Group management to address these risks are also set out below.
The Group mitigates its risk exposure through an insurance programme that covers property and liability risks, where it is appropriate and cost effective to do so.
Risk Mitigation actions Health and safety risks Health and safety is included on the agenda at every Board meeting and is discussed at The nature of the Groups operations, the monthly Group Executive Committee meeting.
The Board believes that responsibility involving energetic materials, is such that for the delivery of world class safety standards is an integral part of the operational the Board considers health and safety to management accountability, and managers are therefore expected to embrace a be a key area of focus in managing risk.
positive safety culture and to demonstrate leadership and commitment in the workplace.
All employees are encouraged to report potential hazards, and to raise any health and safety concerns through the appropriate channels.
Our stated aim is to achieve zero injuries and to reduce health and safety risks, where they cannot be eliminated altogether, to a level which is as low as reasonably practicable.
All businesses are expected to proactively manage their own risks but in addition, the top five site risks at each business and their associated mitigation programmes are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Group Executive Committee and quarterly by the Risk Management Committee.
Technology and automation roadmaps support the Groups strategy for risk reduction through increased automation and remote operations, and this strategy is reflected in the Groups five year plan.
Further details on the Groups approach to health and safety are set out in the Corporate Responsibility Review.
