Risk and governance Risk management Traded market risk management Audited Traded market risk description Traded market risk is a measure of potential change in the value of a portfolio of instruments as a result of changes in the financial environment resulting in changes in underlying market risk factors such as interest rates, equity markets, bond markets, commodity markets, exchange rates and volatilities between now and a future point in time.
The Market Risk Management team identi es, quanti es and manages the effects of these potential changes in accordance with Basel ll and policies determined by the board.
Within our trading activities, we act as principal with clients or the market.
Market risk, therefore, exists where we have taken on principal positions, resulting from proprietary trading, market making, arbitrage, underwriting and investments in the commodity, foreign exchange, equity, capital and money markets.
The focus of these businesses is primarily on supporting client activity.
Our strategic intent is that proprietary trading should be limited and that trading should be conducted largely to facilitate clients in deal execution.
Audited Traded market risk governance structure To manage, measure and mitigate market risk, we have independent market risk management teams in each geography where we assume market risk.
Local limits have been set to keep potential losses within acceptable risk tolerance levels.
A Global Market Risk Forum mandated by the various boards of directors manages the market risks in accordance with pre-approved principles and policies.
Risk limits are reviewed and set at the Global Market Risk Forum and rati ed at the ERRF.
Limits are reviewed either annually, in the event of a signi cant market event e. g. 11 September 2001, or at the discretion of senior management.
Management and measurement of traded market risk Market risk management teams review the market risks on our books.
Detailed risk reports are produced daily for each trading desk.
These reports are distributed to management and the traders on the desk.
Any unauthorised excesses are recorded and require a satisfactory explanation from the desk for the excess.
The production of risk reports allows for the monitoring of every instrument traded against prescribed limits.
Trading is also limited to the most liquid instruments and each traded instrument undergoes various stresses to assess potential losses.
Each trading desk is monitored on an overall basis as an additional control.
Trading limits are generally tiered with the most liquid and least risky instruments being assigned the largest limits.
The market risk teams perform a pro t attribution, where our daily traded income is attributed to the various underlying risk factors on a day-to-day basis.
An understanding of the sources of pro t and loss is essential to understanding the risks of the business.
Measurement techniques used to quantify market risk arising from our trading activities include sensitivity analysis, Value at Risk VaR and Expected Tail Loss ETL.
Stress testing and scenario analysis are also used to simulate extreme conditions to supplement these core measures.
VaR numbers are monitored at the 95%, 99% and 100% maximum loss con dence intervals.
ETLs are monitored at the 95% and 99% levels.
Scenario analysis considers the impact of a signi cant market event on our current trading portfolios.
We consider the impact for the 10 days after the event, not merely the instantaneous shock to the markets.
Included in our scenario analysis are for example the following: October 1987 Black Monday, 11 September 2001 and the December Rand crisis in 2001.
All VaR models, while forward-looking, are based on past events and depend on the quality of available market data.
The accuracy of the VaR model as a predictor of potential loss is continuously monitored through back testing.
This involves comparing the actual trading revenues arising from the previous days closing positions with the one-day VaR calculated for the previous day on these same positions.
If the revenue is negative and exceeds the one-day VaR, a back testing breach is considered to have occurred.
In South Africa, we use our internal models for market risk measurement which in effect puts us at the level of the advanced approach for Basel II.
In terms of this model, trading capital is calculated as a function of the 99% 10-day VaR.
Backtesting results and a detailed stress testing pack are submitted to the regulator on a monthly basis.
In the UK, all desks are currently on Capital Adequacy CAD 1 level, while we are in the process of applying for CAD1 model extensions for the Structured Equity desk.

This arises from the correlation offset between various asset classes The graphs below show total daily VaR and pro t and loss gures for our trading activities over the reporting period.
The values are for the 99% one-day VaR, i. e. 99% of the time, the total trading activities will not lose more than the values depicted below.
Based on these graphs, we can gauge the accuracy of the VaR gures.
This exceeds the exceptions at the 99% level.
Most of these exceptions were marginal and arose due to signi cant volatility on the Fixed Income desk.
The largest variance was due to an extreme rise in the implied volatility in Euribor rates at the beginning of October 2008.
These exceptions were mainly due to the sudden increased volatility in the interest rate and foreign exchange markets in the middle of 2008.
Both exceptions were marginal and in line with the 99% con dence interval expectations.
The largest exceptions arose in the beginning of October 2008.
The breach on 3 October 2008 was caused by a combination of a large parallel decrease in AUD interest rates, a large parallel increase in gold lease rates and a depreciation in the AUD exchange rate.
The breach on 7 October 2008 was caused by a large parallel decrease in AUD interest rates and a depreciation in the AUD exchange rate.

The risk management software runs independently from source trading systems and values all trades separately.
The values from the two systems are compared daily.
The values from the risk system are also used for pro t attribution, another risk management tool.
Risk limits are set according to guidelines set out in our risk appetite policy and are calculated on a statistical and non-statistical basis.
Statistical limits include VaR and ETL analyses at various con dence intervals.
Historical VaR is used over 500 days of unweighted data, where every risk factor is exposed to daily moves over the past two years.
With the equity markets for example, every share and index is considered independently as opposed to techniques where proxies are used.
Non-statistical limits include product limits, tenor, notional, liquidity, buckets and option sensitivities greeks.
When setting and reviewing these limits, current market conditions are taken into account.
Bucket limits are set on time buckets, generally at three month intervals out to two years and then, on a less granular basis, out to 30 years.
Traded market risk year in review The past year has been masked by extreme market movements, both in direction and volatility.
Investecs South African model of basing trades on client ow has once again proved to be successful as all trading desks have, to a varying degree, been pro table.
In the UK the Structured Equity desk has experienced strong growth in their retail product sales and they continue to expand their product range.
The Fixed Income and Forex desks have also performed well bene ting from both the increased volatility and ows.
Australian trading activity remains modest, with the focus being mainly commodity hedging.
The majority of revenue earned from our trading activities within the Capital Markets division is related to client ow activity.
