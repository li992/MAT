Financial statements Provident Financial plc continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Financial and capital risk management Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which can be categorised as credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.
The objective of the groups risk management framework is to identify and assess the risks facing the group and to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the groups financial performance.
These risks are monitored and managed through a centralised treasury function on a group basis.
Accordingly, it would not be relevant to disclose the impact of these risks on an individual statutory entity basis.
Financial risk management is overseen by the risk advisory committee.
Further details of the groups risk management framework are described on pages 85 to 91. a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the group will suffer loss in the event of a default by a customer or a bank counterparty.
A default occurs when the customer or bank fails to honour repayments as they fall due.
i Amounts receivable from customers The groups maximum exposure to credit risk on amounts receivable from customers as at 31 December 2013 is the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers of 1,606.6m 2012: 1,513.8m.
Vanquis Bank Credit risk within Vanquis Bank is managed by the Vanquis Bank credit committee which meets at least quarterly and is responsible for ensuring that the approach to lending is within sound risk and financial parameters and that key metrics are reviewed to ensure compliance with policy.
A customers risk profile and credit line is evaluated at the point of application and at various times during the agreement.
Internally generated scorecards based on historic payment patterns of customers are used to assess the applicants potential default risk and their ability to manage a specific credit line.
For new customers, the scorecards incorporate data from the applicant, such as income and employment and data from an external credit bureau.
Each potential new customer receives a welcome call from contact centre staff to verify details and complete the underwriting process.
Initial credit limits are low, typically 250.
For existing customers, the scorecards also incorporate data on actual payment performance and product utilisation and take data from an external credit bureau each month to refresh customers payment performance position with other lenders data.
Credit lines can go up as well as down according to this point-in-time risk assessment.
Arrears management is a combination of central letters, inbound and outbound telephony, SMS, email and outsourced debt collection agency activities.
Contact is made with the customer to discuss the reasons for non-payment and specific strategies are employed to support the customer in returning to a good standing or appropriate forbearance arrangements are put in place.
CCD Credit risk within CCD is managed by the CCD credit committee which meets at least every two months and is responsible for approving credit control policy and decisioning strategy.
Credit risk is managed using a combination of lending policy criteria, credit scoring including behavioural scoring, policy rules, individual lending approval limits, central underwriting, and a home visit to make a decision on applications for credit.
The loans offered by the weekly home credit business are short-term, typically a contractual period of around a year, with an average value of approximately 500.
The loans are underwritten in the home by an agent with emphasis placed on any previous lending experience with the customer and the agents assessment of the credit risk based on a completed application form and the home visit.
Once a loan has been made, the agent visits the customer weekly, or in some cases monthly, to collect payment.
The agent is well placed to identify signs of strain on a customers income and can moderate lending accordingly.
Equally, the regular contact and professional relationship that the agent has with the customer allows them to manage customers repayments effectively even when the household budget is tight.
This can be in the form of taking part-payments, allowing missed payments or occasionally restructuring the debt in order to maximise cash collections.
Agents are primarily paid commission for what they collect and not for what they lend, so their main focus is on ensuring loans are affordable at the point of issue and then on collecting cash.
Affordability is reassessed by the agent each time an existing customer is re-served, or not as the case may be.
This normally takes place within 12 months of the previous loan because of the short-term nature of the product.
Arrears management within the home credit business is a combination of central letters, central telephony, and field activity undertaken by field management.
This will often involve a home visit to discuss the customers reasons for non-payment and to agree a suitable resolution.
146 Strategic report Governance Remuneration Financial statements Shareholder information Provident Financial plc Financial statements Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 continued a Credit risk continued ii Bank counterparties The groups maximum exposure to credit risk on bank counterparties as at 31 December 2013 was 21.1m 2012: 15.4m.
Counterparty credit risk arises as a result of cash deposits placed with banks and the use of derivative financial instruments with banks and other financial institutions which are used to hedge interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.
Counterparty credit risk is managed by the groups treasury committee and is governed by a board-approved counterparty policy which ensures that the groups cash deposits and derivative financial instruments are only made with high-quality counterparties with the level of permitted exposure to a counterparty firmly linked to the strength of its credit rating.
In addition, there is a maximum exposure limit for all institutions, regardless of credit rating.
This is linked to the groups regulatory capital base in line with the groups regulatory reporting requirements on large exposures to the PRA.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will have insufficient liquid resources available to fulfil its operational plans and or to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by the groups centralised treasury department through daily monitoring of expected cash flows in accordance with a board-approved group funding and liquidity policy.
This process is monitored regularly by the treasury committee.
The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The group therefore maintains headroom on its committed borrowing facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months, after assuming that Vanquis Bank will fund 90% of its receivables book through retail deposits.
As at 31 December 2013, the groups committed borrowing facilities had a weighted average maturity of 3.2 years 2012: 3.7 years and the headroom on these committed facilities amounted to 235.2m 2012: 191.9m.
The group is less exposed than other mainstream lenders to liquidity risk as the loans issued by the home credit business are of short-term duration typically around one year, whereas the groups borrowings extend over a number of years.
As a PRA-regulated institution, Vanquis Bank is required to maintain a liquid assets buffer, and other liquid resources, in order to ensure that it has sufficient liquid resources to fulfil its operational plans and meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
As at 31 December 2013, the liquid assets buffer, including other liquidity resources, held by Vanquis Bank amounted to 86.3m 2012: 52.3m.
A maturity analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows of the groups bank and other borrowings, including derivative financial instruments settled on a net and gross basis, is shown below.
The table below shows the future cash payable under current drawings.
This reflects both the interest payable and the repayment of the borrowing on maturity.
Due to the seasonal nature of the home credit business, drawings under the groups revolving bank facilities are typically drawn for only three months at any time despite having the ability to draw the borrowings for much longer under the committed borrowing facility.
In the table below, the cash flows of borrowings made under the groups syndicated revolving bank facility are required to be shown as being due within one year, despite the group having the ability to redraw these amounts until the contractual maturity of the underlying facility in May 2015 note - the syndicated revolving bank facility was renewed on 31 January 2014 and now has a maturity date of May 2017.

The groups exposure to movements in interest rates is managed by the treasury committee and is governed by a board-approved interest rate hedging policy which forms part of the groups treasury policies.
The group seeks to limit the net exposure to changes in interest rates.
This is achieved through a combination of issuing fixed-rate debt and by the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
A 2% movement in the interest rate applied to borrowings during 2013 and 2012 would not have had a material impact on the groups profit before taxation or equity as the groups interest rate risk was substantially hedged.
148 Strategic report Governance Remuneration Financial statements Shareholder information Provident Financial plc Financial statements Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 continued d Foreign exchange rate risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk of a change in foreign currency exchange rates leading to a reduction in profits or equity.
The groups exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates is monitored monthly by the treasury committee and is governed by a board-approved foreign exchange rate risk management policy which forms part of the groups treasury policies.
The groups exposures to foreign exchange rate risk arise solely from: i the issuance of US dollar private placement loan notes, which are fully hedged into sterling through the use of cross-currency swaps: and ii the home credit operations in the Republic of Ireland and the Vanquis Bank operations in Poland, which are hedged by matching euro zloty-denominated net assets with euro zloty-denominated borrowings or forward contracts as closely as practicable.
As at 31 December 2013, a 2% movement in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate would have led to a nil 2012: 0.9m movement in external borrowings with an opposite movement of nil 2012: 0.9m in the hedging reserve within equity.
Due to the hedging arrangements in place, there would have been no impact on reported profits 2012: nil.
As at 31 December 2013, a 2% movement in the sterling to euro exchange rate would have led to a 1.1m 2012: 1.1m movement in customer receivables with an opposite movement of 1.1m 2012: 1.1m in external borrowings.
Due to the natural hedging of matching euro-denominated assets with euro-denominated liabilities, there would have been a nil impact on reported profits and equity 2012: nil.
As at 31 December 2013, a 2% movement in the sterling to zloty exchange rate would have led to a nil 2012: nil movement in customer receivables with an opposite movement of nil 2012: nil in the valuation of forward contracts.
Due to the net investment hedge in place, there would have been no impact on reported profits or equity 2012: nil.
e Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse market movements caused by active trading positions taken in interest rates, foreign exchange markets, bonds and equities.
The groups corporate policies do not permit it to undertake position taking or trading books of this type and therefore it does not do so.
Capital risk management The groups objective in respect of capital risk management is to maintain an efficient capital structure whilst satisfying the requirements of the groups banking covenants and the regulatory capital requirements set by the PRA.
The group primarily manages its capital base against two measures as described below: a Gearing In order to maintain an efficient capital structure, the group has a maximum target gearing ratio of 3.5 times.
This provides a comfortable level of headroom against the groups banking covenant of 5.0 times and regulatory capital requirements.
The maximum target gearing ratio of 3.5 times is fully aligned with the groups target of distributing 80% of post-tax earnings by way of dividends whilst retaining sufficient capital to support receivables growth consistent with managements medium-term growth plans for the group.
As at 31 December 2013, the gearing ratio stood at 3.0 times 2012: 3.2 times, calculated as follows: 2013 2012 Group Note m m Borrowings 21 1,284.6 1,201.4 Exchange rate adjustment 21 5.2 5.8 Arrangement fees 21 7.2 9.8 Liquid assets buffer, including other liquid resources 20 86.3 52.3 Borrowings for gearing purposes 1,200.3 1,153.1 Shareholders equity 416.8 375.4 Pension asset 18 29.2 23.0 Deferred tax on pension asset 19 5.8 5.3 Hedging reserve 25 5.1 7.0 Equity for gearing purposes 398.5 364.7 Gearing times 3.0 3.2 The gearing ratio is lower than the maximum target of 3.5 times due to the strong capital generation of the group and the contraction in CCDs receivables book during 2013.
149 Financial statements Provident Financial plc continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Financial and capital risk management continued Capital risk management continued b Regulatory capital The group is the subject of consolidated supervision by the PRA.
As part of this supervision, it is required to maintain a certain level of regulatory capital known as its Individual Capital Guidance ICG in order to mitigate against unexpected losses.
The ICG remains confidential between the PRA and the relevant institution and should not be publicly disclosed.
Regulatory capital differs from the groups shareholders equity included in the balance sheet as it excludes intangible assets, the groups pension asset and the fair value of derivative financial instruments, both net of deferred tax, but includes the groups subordinated loan notes.
A reconciliation of the groups equity to regulatory capital is set out below: 2013 2012 Group Note m m Shareholders equity 416.8 375.4 Intangible assets 11 8.1 9.5 Pension asset 18 29.2 23.0 Deferred tax on pension asset 19 5.8 5.3 Hedging reserve 25 5.1 7.0 Tier 1 capital 390.4 355.2 Tier 2 capital subordinated loan notes 2.4 3.6 Total regulatory capital held 392.8 358.8 When tier 2 subordinated loan notes have less than five years until maturity, the amount eligible for inclusion within regulatory capital reduces by 20% per annum for each year.
Accordingly, the amount of the subordinated loan notes eligible for regulatory capital purposes as at 31 December 2013 amounts to 40% of the balance outstanding 2012: 60%.
The treasury committee is responsible for monitoring the level of regulatory capital.
The level of surplus regulatory capital against the ICG is reported to the board on a monthly basis in the groups management accounts.
The group regularly forecasts regulatory capital requirements as part of the budgeting and strategic planning process.
The group is required to report twice annually to the PRA on the level of regulatory capital it holds.
As at 31 December 2013, the groups total regulatory capital of 392.8m 2012: 358.8m was comfortably in excess of the ICG set by the PRA.
