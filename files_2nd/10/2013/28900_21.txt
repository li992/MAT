116 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION RISK MANAGEMENT As an insurance company, the Group is in the business of actively seeking risk with a view to adding value by managing it.
This section summarises the key risks to the Group and the steps taken to manage them.
As set out in the corporate governance report, the Groups Board of Directors the Board defines the risk appetite of the organisation.
The Group employs a comprehensive Risk Management System that includes a full range of risk policies, procedures, measurement, reporting and monitoring techniques and a series of stress tests and scenario analyses to ensure that the risk exposures that arise from operating the Groups business are managed appropriately.
For the purposes of managing risks, the Group classifies risks into the following categories: Insurance Credit Market Liquidity Operational Reputational Strategic INSURANCE RISK Underwriting and claims risks The Group manages these risks through its underwriting strategy, adequate reinsurance arrangements and proactive claims handling.
The underwriting strategy aims to ensure that the underwritten risks are well diversified in terms of type and amount of risk, industry and geography.
Pricing for the Groups products is generally based upon historical claims frequencies and claims severity averages, adjusted for inflation and modelled catastrophes trended forward to recognise anticipated changes in claims patterns.
While claims remain the Groups principal cost, the Group also makes allowance in the pricing procedures for acquisition expenses, administration expenses, investment income, the cost of reinsurance and for a profit loading that adequately covers the cost of the capital.
Underwriting limits are in place to enforce appropriate risk selection criteria.
The Group generally has the right not to renew individual policies, it can impose deductibles and it has the right to reject the payment of a fraudulent claim.
In certain territories, legislation imposes a minimum amount for which employers can be liable for claims for compensation from employees injured at work.
These liabilities are usually insured under an employers liability or similar insurance policy.
All policies issued by the Group comply with minimum statutory requirements.
All of the Groups underwriters have specific licences that set clear parameters for the business they can underwrite, based on the experience of the individual underwriter.
Additionally, the Group has a centrally managed forum looking at Group underwriting issues, reviewing and agreeing underwriting direction and setting policy and directives where appropriate.
The Group has a quarterly portfolio management process across all its business units, which provides a consistent assessment of each portfolio performance against a set of key performance indicators.
Under the portfolio management system, key risk indicators are tracked to monitor emerging trends, opportunities and risks and, on an annual basis, a review forum of business and underwriting leaders undertake a detailed review of each portfolio utilising data from the quarterly reviews.
The Group has developed enhanced methods of recording exposures and concentrations of risk.
This means there is greater control of exposures in high risk areas and enables a prompt response to claims from policyholders should there be a catastrophic event such as an earthquake.
Reinsurance arrangements in place include proportional, excess of loss, stop loss and catastrophe coverage.
The effect of such reinsurance arrangements is that the Group should not suffer total net insurance losses beyond the Groups risk appetite in any one year.
Reserve risk The Group establishes loss reserves to account for the anticipated ultimate costs of all losses and related loss adjustment expenses LAE on losses that have already occurred.
The Group establishes reserves for reported losses and LAE, as well as for incurred but not yet reported IBNR losses and unallocated loss adjustment expenses ULAE.
Loss reserve estimates are based on known facts and on interpretation of circumstances including the Groups experience with similar cases and historical claims payment trends.
The Group also considers the development of loss payment trends, levels of unpaid claims, judicial decisions and economic conditions.
The Group has a Group Reserving Committee consisting of the Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Underwriting and Claims Director, Group Chief Actuary and Group Chief Risk Officer.
A similar committee has been established in each of the Groups major operating segments.
The Group Reserving Committee monitors the decisions and judgements made by the business units as to the level of reserves recommended and makes the final decision on the reserves to be included within the consolidated financial statements.
In forming its collective judgement, the Committee considers the following information: RSA ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 117 An actuarial indication of ultimate losses together with an assessment of risks and possible favourable or adverse developments that may not have been fully reflected in calculating these indications.
At the end of 2013 these risks and developments include: the possibility of future legislative change having retrospective effect on open claims: changes in claims settlement procedures potentially leading to future claims payment patterns differing from historical experience: the possibility of new types of claim, such as disease claims, emerging from business written several years ago: general uncertainty in the claims environment: the emergence of latent exposures such as asbestos: the outcome of litigation on claims received: failure to recover reinsurance and unanticipated changes in claims inflation The views of internal peer reviewers of the reserves and of other parties including actuaries, legal counsel, risk directors, underwriters and claims managers How previous actuarial indications have developed.
USE OF REINSURANCE The Group is exposed to both multiple insured losses and losses arising out of a single occurrence, for example a natural peril event such as a hurricane, flood or earthquake.
All of the Groups operations are required to purchase reinsurance within agreed local reinsurance appetite parameters.
The Group Corporate Centre authorises the operations proposed treaty purchases to check that they at least meet the Groups appetite, for example the 1 in 200 year standard for catastrophe risk.
Group Corporate Centre also checks to see that total Group exposures are within the limits set out above and also are consistent with the required risk based capital.
In addition, local facultative arrangements may be purchased where deemed appropriate.
The Group remains primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured, although the reinsurer is liable to the Group to the extent of the insurance risk ceded.
CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of loss of value of the financial assets due to counterparties failing to meet all or part of their obligations.
The Board Risk Committee BRC is responsible for ensuring that the Board approved Group credit risk appetite is not exceeded.
This is done through the setting and imposition of Group policies, procedures and limits.
In defining its appetite for credit risk the Group looks at exposures at both an aggregate and business unit level distinguishing between credit risks incurred as a result of offsetting insurance risks or operating in the insurance market e. g. reinsurance credit risks and risks to receiving premiums due from policyholders and intermediaries and credit risks incurred for the purposes of generating a return e. g. invested assets credit risk.
Limits are set at both a portfolio and counterparty level based on likelihood of default, derived from the rating of the counterparty, to ensure that the Groups overall credit profile and specific concentrations are managed and controlled within risk appetite.
Financial assets are graded according to company standards.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
For invested assets, restrictions are placed on each of the Groups investment managers as to the level of exposure to various rating categories including unrated securities.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure for financial assets of the Group as at 31 December 2013: Total of financial assets that are Credit rating relating to financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired neither past due AAA AA A BBB BBB Not rated nor impaired m m m m m m m Debt securities 5,448 2,323 2,401 856 99 124 11,251 Loans and receivables 27 44 2 73 146 Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities 538 1,235 202 44 1 2,020 Insurance and reinsurance debtors 236 38 631 140 113 2,289 3,447 Derivative assets 28 30 58 Other debtors 313 313 Cash and cash equivalents 184 321 374 106 23 154 1,162 Notes: 1.
The insurance and reinsurance debtors classified as not rated comprise personal policyholders and small corporate customers that do not have individual credit ratings.
The overall credit risk to the Group is deemed to be low as the cover could be cancelled if payment were not received on a timely basis.
118 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED As at 31 December 2012 Total of financial assets that are Credit rating relating to financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired neither past due AAA AA A BBB BBB Not rated nor impaired m m m m m m m Debt securities 5,985 2,079 2,585 835 81 159 11,724 Loans and receivables 18 21 3 3 41 86 Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities 35 533 1,040 218 50 55 1,931 Insurance and reinsurance debtors 121 23 695 136 104 2,336 3,415 Derivative assets 12 31 3 46 Other debtors 323 323 Cash and cash equivalents 276 452 412 97 33 59 1,329 With the exception of AAA rated government debt securities, the largest aggregate credit exposure does not exceed 3% of the Groups total financial assets.
Holdings of government bonds in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal are 119m at 31 December 2013 and comprise around 1% 2012: around 1% of the total bond portfolio.
In addition to this the Group holds 189m of senior and subordinated bank debt and 103m of other corporate holdings in these countries.
The Group is exposed to credit and concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers, due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The reinsurance strategy is to purchase reinsurance in the most effective manner from reinsurers who meet the Groups security standards.
Reinsurance counterparties are subject to a rigorous internal assessment process on an ongoing basis to ensure that their creditworthiness continues to be satisfactory and the potential impact from reinsurer default is measured regularly and managed accordingly.
The Group Reinsurance Credit Committee oversees the management of these risks.
Group standards are set such that reinsurers that have a financial strength rating of less than Awith Standard & Poors, or a comparable rating, are removed from the Groups authorised list of approved reinsurers unless the Groups internal review discovers exceptional circumstances in favour of the reinsurer.
Collateral is taken to mitigate exposures, where appropriate, to acceptable levels.
At 31 December 2013 the Group held collateral against 165m 2012: 143m of reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities.
The Group regularly monitors its aggregate exposures by reinsurer group against predetermined reinsurer group limits, in accordance with the methodology agreed by the BRC.
The Groups largest reinsurance exposures to active reinsurance groups are Swiss Re, Munich Re, and HDI-Gerling.
At 31 December 2013 the reinsurance asset recoverable from these groups does not exceed 3% of the Groups total financial assets.
Stress tests are performed by reinsurer counterparty and the limits are set such that in a catastrophic event, the exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 3% of the Groups total financial assets.
Certain of the Groups subsidiaries are members of government mandated pools in various parts of the world.
As of 31 December 2013 the largest pool by premium volume is Pool Re operated by the UK Government to provide terrorism cover.
There are no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
RSA ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 119 The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets that have been impaired and the ageing of financial assets that are past due but not impaired as at 31 December 2013: Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Carrying value in the Impairment Neither Financial assets statement losses charged past due nor Up to three Three to six Six months to Greater than that have been of financial to the income impaired months months one year one year impaired position statement m m m m m m m m Debt securities 11,251 11,251 Loans and receivables 146 146 6 Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities 2,020 6 2,026 4 Insurance and reinsurance debtors 3,447 97 20 15 13 1 3,593 7 Derivative assets 58 58 Other debtors 313 8 2 11 8 342 Cash and cash equivalents 1,162 1,162 As at 31 December 2012 Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Carrying value Impairment Neither Financial assets in the statement losses charged past due nor Up to three Three to six Six months to Greater than that have been of financial to the income impaired months months one year one year impaired position statement m m m m m m m m Debt securities 11,724 11,724 Loans and receivables 86 11 97 7 Reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities 1,931 18 1,949 1 Insurance and reinsurance debtors 3,415 107 35 11 24 3,592 1 Derivative assets 46 46 Other debtors 323 5 18 3 8 357 Cash and cash equivalents 1,329 1,329 Local operations are responsible for assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of their counterparties e. g. brokers and policyholders.
Local credit committees are responsible for ensuring these exposures are within the risk appetite of the local operations.
Exposure monitoring and reporting is embedded throughout the organisation with aggregate credit positions reported and monitored at Group level.
The Groups investments comprise a broad range of financial investments issued principally in the UK, Canada and Scandinavia.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had pledged 871m 2012: 895m of financial assets as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities and had accepted 463m 2012: 827m in collateral.
The nature of the assets pledged as collateral comprises government securities of 801m 2012: 831m, cash and cash equivalents of 37m 2012: 32m and non government debt securities of 33m 2012: 32m.
The terms and conditions of the collateral pledged are market standard in relation to letter of credit facilities.
The Group is permitted to sell or repledge collateral held in the event of default by the owner, the fair value of which has been noted above at 463m.
The terms and conditions of the collateral held are market standard.
The assets held as collateral are readily convertible into cash.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had entered into short-term sale and repurchase agreements for UK government securities.
The Group continues to recognise the debt securities in the statement of financial position as the Group remains exposed to the risks and rewards of ownership.
The carrying value of these debt securities recognised in the statement of financial position is 300m 2012: 295m and the carrying value of the associated liabilities is 300m 2012: 295m.
The Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA master netting arrangements.
In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one counterparty to the other.
In certain circumstances, such as a credit default, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
120 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position.
This is because the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events.
The following table sets out the carrying amounts of recognised financial instruments that are subject to the above agreements: At 31 December 2013 Amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements Effect of offsetting in statement of financial position Related items not offset As reported in Gross Amounts Net amounts Financial Financial Net statement of amounts offset reported instruments collateral amount financial position m m m m m m m Derivative financial assets 52 52 7 5 40 52 Total assets 52 52 7 5 40 52 Derivative financial liabilities 22 22 6 36 20 22 Repurchase arrangements and other similar secured borrowing 300 300 300 300 Total liabilities 322 322 306 36 20 322 At 31 December 2012 Amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements Effect of offsetting in statement of financial As reported in position Related items not offset statement of Gross Amounts Net amounts Financial Financial Net financial amounts offset reported instruments collateral amount position m m m m m m m Derivative financial assets 13 13 1 5 7 13 Total assets 13 13 1 5 7 13 Derivative financial liabilities 41 41 33 26 18 41 Repurchase arrangements and other similar secured borrowing 295 295 295 295 Total liabilities 336 336 328 26 18 336 Notes: 1.
The Groups equity derivatives are exchange traded instruments and as such the Group treats the intermediary as a single counterparty in the above table.
MARKET RISK The Group is exposed to the risk of potential losses from adverse movements in market prices including those of interest rates, equities, property, exchange rates and derivatives.
Exposures are controlled by the setting of investment limits and managing asset-liability matching in line with the Groups risk appetite.
The Group Investment Committee GIC, on behalf of the Group Board, is responsible for reviewing and approving the investment strategy for the Groups investment portfolios.
It provides approval for all major changes of the Groups investment strategy and, in particular, approves any substantive changes to the balance of the Groups funds between the major asset classes.
Importantly, the GIC also approves the terms of reference of the Groups main operational investment committee, the Group Asset Management Committee GAMC.
The BRC issues GAMC with investment risk limits.
RSA ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 121 Interest rate risk The fair value of the Groups portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates.
Thus if interest rates fall, the fair value of the portfolio would tend to rise and vice versa as set out in the sensitivity analysis on page 122.
Equity price risk The Groups portfolio of equity securities is subject to equity risk arising from changes in market price.
Thus if the value of equities rise, so will the fair value of its portfolio and vice versa as set out in the sensitivity analysis on page 122.
The Group sets appropriate risk limits to ensure that no significant concentrations in individual companies arise.
The Group takes a long-term view in selecting shares and looks to build value over a sustained period of time rather than utilising high level of purchase and sales in order to generate short-term gains from its equity holdings.
The Group makes use of derivative products as appropriate to manage equity exposure and to protect the portfolio from losses outside of its risk appetite.
Property price risk The Groups portfolio of properties is subject to property price risk arising from changes in the market value of properties.
Further information on the valuation approach is included in note 13.
Thus if the value of property falls so will the fair value of the portfolio as set out in the sensitivity analysis on page 122.
A number of the Groups property holdings are Group occupied and therefore are reported within property and equipment.
The Groups investment in investment property is recorded as such and these investments are held as part of an efficient portfolio management strategy.
Currency risk The Group operates in 32 countries.
Accordingly, its net assets are subject to foreign exchange rate movements.
The Groups primary foreign currency exposures are to the Danish Krone, Euro, Canadian Dollar and the Swedish Krona.
If the value of Sterling strengthens then the value of non Sterling net assets will decline when translated into Sterling and consolidated.
The Group incurs exposure to currency risk in two ways: Operational currency risk by underwriting liabilities in currencies other than the currency of the primary environment in which the business units operate non functional currencies Structural currency risk by investing in overseas subsidiaries and operating an international insurance group.
Operational currency risk is managed within the Groups individual operations by broadly matching assets and liabilities by currency.
Structural currency risk is managed at a Group level through currency forward and foreign exchange option contracts within the limits that have been set.
In managing structural currency risk, the needs of the Groups subsidiaries to maintain net assets in local currencies to satisfy local regulatory solvency and internal risk based capital requirements are taken into account.
These assets should prove adequate to support local insurance activities irrespective of exchange rate movements.
Consequently, this may affect the value of the consolidated shareholders equity expressed in Sterling.
At 31 December 2013, the Groups total shareholders equity analysed by currency is: Pounds Danish Canadian Swedish Sterling Krone Euro Dollar Krona Other Total m m m m m m Shareholders equity at 31 December 2013 482 610 494 393 914 2,893 Shareholders equity at 31 December 2012 1,057 629 572 558 934 3,750 The analysis aggregates the Danish Krone exposure and the Euro exposure as the Danish Krone continues to be pegged closely to the Euro.
The Group considers the aggregate exposures when reviewing its hedging strategy.
122 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Shareholders equity is stated after taking account of the effect of currency forward contracts and foreign exchange options.
On this basis, a 10% change in Sterling against Danish Krone Euro, Canadian Dollar or Swedish Krona would have the following impact on shareholders equity: 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% 10% strengthening in weakening in strengthening in weakening in strengthening in weakening in Pounds Sterling Pounds Sterling Pounds Sterling Pounds Sterling Pounds Sterling Pounds Sterling against Danish against Danish against Canadian against Canadian against Swedish against Swedish Krone Euro Krone Euro Dollar Dollar Krona Krona m m m m m m Movement in shareholders equity at 31 December 2013 55 67 45 55 36 44 Movement in shareholders equity at 31 December 2012 57 70 52 64 51 62 Apart from the impact on derivative financial instruments covered below, the changes arise from retranslation of foreign subsidiaries net asset positions from their functional currencies into Pounds Sterling, with movements being taken through the translation reserve.
These movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.
Derivatives The Group may use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and long-term inflation.
The Group does not use derivatives to leverage its exposure to markets and does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Forward contracts and foreign exchange options are used to reduce the risk of adverse currency movements on certain forecast future cash transactions and for structural hedging.
The policy on use of derivatives is approved by the BRC.

These provide limited protection against declines in market levels whilst also capping participation in any appreciation of the market.
In total, this strategy covers an underlying equity value up to approximately 379m 2012: 348m.
If UK, Canadian, European and US equity markets decreased by 15%, the impact of these derivatives as at 31 December 2013, would be to decrease the impact of the decline by 28m 2012: 26m.
The Group is party to a series of swap contracts which collectively provide limited cover against a sharp increase in long-term claims inflation.
In total the swap contracts provide inflation cover over a nominal value of 180m 2012: 180m and are split over different contract terms.
At 31 December 2013 the Group holds currency forward contracts and foreign exchange options that are designated as hedging instruments to reduce structural foreign exchange risk.
The derivatives are included in the table above.
Further information on designated hedges can be found in note 29.
Sensitivity analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity or stress-test based risk management tools to understand the impact of the above risks on earnings and capital in both normal and stressed conditions.
These stress tests combine deterministic shocks, analysis of historical scenarios and stochastic modelling using the internal capital model to inform the Groups decision making and planning process and also for identification and management of risks within the business units.
RSA ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 123 The following table provides an indication of some of the single factor changes adopted within the Group.
Changes in the income statement and other comprehensive income: Increase decrease Decrease in other in income statement comprehensive income 2013 2012 2013 2012 m m m m 2 Interest rate markets: 3 Impact on fixed interest securities of increase in interest rates of 100bps 427 446 4 Decrease of equity markets: Direct impact on equities of a 15% fall in equity markets 6 25 87 84 Mitigating impact arising from derivatives held 28 26 4 Property markets: Decrease of property markets of 15% 50 51 10 23 Notes: 1.
This analysis assumes that there is no correlation between equity price, interest rate and property market rate risks.
It also assumes that all other assets and liabilities remain unchanged and that no management action is taken.
This analysis does not represent managements view of future market change, but reflects managements view of key sensitivities 2.
The sensitivity of the fixed interest securities of the Group has been modelled by reference to a reasonable approximation of the average interest rate sensitivity of the investments held within each of the portfolios.
The effect of movement in interest rates is reflected as a one time rise of 100bps on 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2013 3.
The impact on the fair value of the loan capital for a 100bps rise in interest rates is a decrease of 42m 2012: 55m 4.
The effect of movements in equity and property markets is reflected as a one time decrease of worldwide equity and property markets on 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2013 which results in a 15% decline in the value of the Groups assets in these investment categories 5.
This analysis has not considered the impact of the above market changes on the valuation of the Groups insurance contract liabilities or retirement benefit obligations 6.
This analysis is presented gross of the corresponding tax credits charges 7.
The equity price risk sensitivity analysis is indicative and is based on the Groups equity portfolio as at 31 December 2013.
Since 31 December 2013 the Group has significantly reduced its equity portfolio and as a result the equity price risk has substantially reduced such that a 15% fall in equity markets would result in a 6m decrease to total comprehensive income LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to pay obligations when due as a result of assets not being available in a form that can immediately be converted into cash.
The investment risk limits set by the BRC ensure that a large part of the Groups portfolio is kept in highly liquid marketable securities sufficient to meet its liabilities as they fall due based on actuarial assessment and allowing for contingencies.
The limits are monitored at a Group level as part of the Group Risk exposure monitoring and BRC reporting process.
In addition the Group has committed credit facilities available as set out in note 23.
Maturity periods or contractual repricing The following table summarises the contractual repricing or maturity dates whichever is earlier for financial liabilities that are subject to fixed and variable interest rates.
Insurance contract liabilities are also presented and are analysed by remaining estimated duration until settlement.

The carrying values in the statement of financial position are discounted where appropriate in accordance with Group accounting policy.
The capital and interest payable on the bonds and notes have been included until the dates on which the Group has the option to call the instruments and the interest rates are reset.
For further information on the terms of the bonds and notes see note 20 to the financial statements.
Undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest as detailed in note 20.
Year end exchange rates have been used for interest projections on loans in foreign currencies.
OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect losses resulting from human factors, external events and inadequate or failed internal processes and systems.
Operational risks are inherent in the Groups operations and are typical of any large enterprise.
Major sources of operational risk can include operational process reliability, information security, outsourcing of operations, dependence on key suppliers, implementation of strategic and operational change, integration of acquisitions, fraud, human error, customer service quality, inadequacy of business continuity arrangements, recruitment, training and retention of staff, and social and environmental impacts.
The Group manages operational risk using a range of techniques and tools to identify, monitor and mitigate its operational risk in accordance with the Groups risk appetite.
These tools include Risk and Control Self Assessments, Key Risk Indicators e. g. fraud and service indicators, Scenario Analyses and Loss Reporting.
In addition, the Group has developed a number of contingency plans including Incident Management and Business Continuity Plans.
Quantitative analysis of operational risk exposures material to the Group is used to inform decisions on the overall amount of capital held and the adequacy of contingency arrangements.
REPUTATIONAL RISK Reputational risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse perception of the image of the Group on the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors or regulators.
The External Communications team keeps under constant review the threats to the Groups reputation, both internal and external, and the Risk function works with them to promote a culture of responsibility from the front line businesses to the Board.
The tools used include a reputational risk register, clear and simple processes, training, external threat and perception monitoring and crisis management plans.
STRATEGIC RISK Strategic risk is the current and prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions, or lack of responsiveness to industry changes.
This risk is a function of the compatibility of an organisations strategic goals, the business strategies developed to achieve those goals, the resources deployed against these goals, and the quality of implementation.
The strategic risk profile is kept under continuous review by the Group Executive Committee and forms a key element of quarterly Board Risk Committee meetings.
The strategic risk profile is set out on page 33.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ORSA The Solvency II directive introduces a requirement for undertakings to conduct an ORSA.
In anticipation of this requirement, the Group has updated its risk and capital management processes.
The Group defines its ORSA as a series of inter-related activities by which it establishes: The quantity and quality of the risks which it seeks to assume The level of capital required to support those risks The actions it will take to achieve and maintain the desired levels of risk and capital.
The assessments of how much risk to assume and how much capital to hold are inextricably linked.
In some situations, it may be desirable to increase the amount of risk assumed or retained in order to make the most efficient use of capital available or else to return excess capital to capital providers.
In other situations, where the risks assumed give rise to a capital requirement that is greater than the capital immediately available to support those risks, it will be necessary either to reduce the risk assumed or to obtain additional capital.
The assessment of risk and solvency needs is in principle carried out continuously.
In practice, the assessment consists of a range of specific activities and decisions carried out at different times of the year as part of an annual cycle, supplemented as necessary by ad hoc assessments of the impact of external events and developments and of internal business proposals.
Papers are presented to the Board throughout the year dealing with individual elements that make up the ORSA.
The information contained in those papers and the associated decisions taken are summarised in an annual ORSA report.
126 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Capital appetite The Groups objective is to maintain sufficient capital, which comprises shareholders equity and subordinated loan capital, to meet its plan and objectives.
This represents sufficient surpluses for both regulatory and economic capital, as well as sufficient capital to support the Groups aim of maintaining single A ratings.
To assist in managing its capital position, the Group has set internal target coverage ratios for each of the principal capital measures.
Further discussion of capital risks and how they are monitored and managed is included in the Risk Management section of the Strategic Report.
The Groups regulated entities aim to hold appropriate levels of capital to satisfy applicable local regulations.
In certain instances this could restrict the subsidiaries ability to transfer funds to the UK parent where retained earnings form part of the local required regulatory capital.
Additionally, regulation in certain countries in which the Groups subsidiaries operate may also impose other limitations such as foreign exchange control restrictions.
Economic capital unaudited Economic capital is the Groups preferred measure of capital sufficiency.
It is the Groups own assessment of the amount of capital it needs to hold to meet its obligations given the Groups risk appetite.
The economic capital analysis compares available capital with the economic capital assessment ECA.
Available capital is the capital over and above the IFRS insurance liabilities that is available to absorb losses.
It includes subordinated debt, but excludes items such as goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred tax items and pension scheme surpluses and deficits.
ECA is the capital required to meet liabilities at a confidence level equivalent to Standard & Poors long-term A rated bond default curve.
2013 2012 bn bn Available capital 3.1 3.8 ECA 2.4 3.1 ECA surplus 0.7 0.7 The overall position remains unchanged as losses due to issues identified in Ireland and adverse weather have been offset by profitability elsewhere in the Group.
The economic capital model is used to support, inform and improve the Groups decision making across the Group.
It is used to determine the Groups optimum capital structure, its investment strategy, its reinsurance programme and to determine the pricing and target returns for each portfolio.
The economic capital model is also used for the Groups Individual Capital Assessment ICA.
The only adjustment made is to use the PRAs required calibration.
Regulatory solvency position The Group remains fully compliant with both the PRAs risk based ICA methodology and Solvency I, which is used to calculate the Insurance Groups Directive IGD requirement.
For the Groups senior regulated insurance company, Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance plc, the capital position continues to be reported under Solvency I.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group has an IGD surplus of 0.2bn unaudited 2012: 1.2bn.
The IGD surplus has been impacted by adverse movements in investment markets with significant reductions in bond values, retained losses and an increase in requirements resulting from higher business volumes.
The coverage ratio stood at 1.1 times unaudited at 31 December 2013 2012: 1.9 times.
The Group received its latest Individual Capital Guidance based on its ICA submission from the PRA in February 2014 and at the request of the PRA remains confidential.
The ICA is a forward looking, economic assessment of the capital requirements of the Group based on its assessment of the risks to which it is exposed.
The models used to determine the ICA have been integrated into the Groups business processes and are used to enhance the management of the Group.
