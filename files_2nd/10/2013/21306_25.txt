The Core Tier 1 ratio increased to 13.2% 2012: 10.8% reflecting an increase in Core Tier 1 capital of 5.1bn to 46.8bn.
Barclays generated 1.3bn Core Tier 1 capital from earnings after absorbing the impact of provisions for PPI and interest rate hedging product redress.
After deducting 1.7bn of dividends paid during 2013, retained regulatory capital generated from earnings decreased Core Tier 1 capital by 0.4bn.
Other material movements in Core Tier 1 capital were: 5.8bn increase in share capital and share premium due to the rights issue: 0.8bn increase in share capital and share premium due to warrants exercised: 1.8bn decrease due to foreign currency movements, primarily due to the strengthening of GBP against USD and ZAR: and 0.5bn decrease in securitisation deductions due to rundown of exit quadrant assets.
Total Capital Resources increased overall by 4.8bn to 70.7bn.
The increases in Core Tier 1 capital were partially reduced by decreases in Tier 2 capital as a result of 1.4bn of redemptions of dated subordinated liabilities offset by 0.7bn of new issuances and a further 0.5bn decrease in securitisation deductions at a total capital level.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information CRD IV as implemented by the Prudential Regulation Authority The new Capital Requirements Regulation and amended Capital Requirements Directive have implemented Basel 3 within the EU collectively known as CRD IV with effect from 1 January 2014.
However, certain aspects of CRD IV are dependent on final technical standards to be issued by the European Banking Authority EBA and adopted by the European Commission as well as UK implementation of the rules.
Barclays has calculated RWAs, Capital and Leverage ratios reflecting our interpretation of the current rules and guidance.
Further changes to the impact of CRD IV may emerge as the requirements are finalised and implemented within Barclays.
Capital ratios Barclays continues to be in excess of minimum CRD IV capital ratios on both a transitional and fully loaded basis.
As at 31 December 2013 Barclays exceeded the PRA target fully loaded CET1 ratio of 7%.
On a transitional basis the PRA has implemented a minimum requirement CET1 ratio of 4%, Tier 1 ratio of 5.5% in 2014 and Total Capital ratio of 8%.
Barclays current regulatory target is to meet a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 9% by 2019, plus a Pillar 2A add-on.
The 9% comprises the required 4.5% minimum CET1 ratio and, phased in from 2016, a Combined Buffer Requirement made up of a Capital Conservation Buffer CCB of 2.5% and an expected Globally Systemically Important Institution G-SII buffer of 2%.
a Under current PRA guidance, the Pillar 2A add-on will need to be met with 56% CET1 from 2015, which would equate to approximately 1.4% of RWAs if the requirement were to be applied today.
The Pillar 2A add-on would be expected to vary over time according to the PRAs individual capital guidance.
In addition, a Counter-Cyclical Capital Buffer CCCB and or additional Sectoral Capital Requirements SCR may be required by the Bank of England to protect against perceived threats to financial stability.
CRD IV also includes the potential for a Systemic Risk Buffer SRB.
These buffers could be applied at the Group level or at a legal entity, sub-consolidated or portfolio level.
No CCCB, SCR or SRB has currently been set by the Bank of England.
Capital resources The PRA has announced the acceleration of transitional provisions relating to CET1 deductions and filters so the fully loaded requirements are applicable from 1 January 2014, with the exception of unrealised gains on available for sale debt and equity.
As a result, transitional capital ratios are now closely aligned to fully loaded ratios.
Following the issuance of the EBAs final draft technical standard on own funds, a deduction has been recognised for foreseeable dividends.
As at 31 December 2013, this represents an accrual for the final dividend for 2013, calculated at 3.5p per share, and the coupons on other equity accounted instruments.
Grandfathering limits on capital instruments, previously qualifying as Tier 1 and Tier 2, are unchanged under the PRA transitional rules.
The Prudential Valuation Adjustment PVA is shown as fully deducted from CET1 upon adoption of CRD IV.
PVA is subject to a technical standard being drafted by the EBA and the impact is currently based on methodology agreed with the PRA.
The PVA deduction as at 31 December 2013 was 2.5bn.
Barclays continues to recognise minority interests in eligible subsidiaries within African operations as CET1 subject to regulatory haircuts prescribed in CRD IV in accordance with our application of regulatory requirements on own funds.
As a result of the application of the EBAs final draft technical standard, PRA guidance and management actions taken during 2013, net long non-significant holdings in financial entities amount to 3.5bn and are below the 10% CET1 threshold that would require a capital deduction.
RWAs The PRA has confirmed Barclays model approvals under CRD IV, with certain provisions reflecting relevant changes to the rules and guidance: the impact of which has been reflected in our CRD IV disclosures where applicable.
Barclays models are subject to continuous monitoring, update and regulatory review, which may result in future changes to CRD IV capital requirements.
It is assumed that corporates, pension funds and sovereigns that meet the eligibility conditions are exempt from CVA volatility charges.
Under CRD IV rules, all Central Clearing Counterparties CCPs are deemed to be Qualifying on a transitional basis.
The final determination of Qualifying status will be made by the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA.
RWAs include 1250% risk weighting of securitisation positions that were previously deducted from Core Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
The RWA increases are reflected in Credit Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk and Market Risk.
Securitisation RWAs include the impact of CRD IV on applying either standardised or advanced methods for securitisation exposures dependent on the character of the underlying assets.
Note a Based on a point in time assessment made by the PRA, at least annually.
The PRA is developing proposals to reform its Pillar 2 framework and, as noted in PS7 13 PRA policy statement PS7 13 on strengthening capital standards published in December 2013, it expects to consult on those proposals during the course of 2014.
The EBA is also developing guidelines on the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process SREP and on Pillar 2 capital, which are likely to affect how the PRA approaches Pillar 2. barclays.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Leverage ratio requirements CRD IV introduces a non-risk based leverage ratio that is intended to act as a supplementary back-stop to the risk-based capital measures.
The CRD IV leverage ratio is calculated as CRD IV Tier 1 capital divided by CRD IV leverage exposure.
Under CRD IV, banks are required to report their leverage ratio for supervisory review purposes from 2014 and from 2015 banks are required to publish their leverage ratios in Pillar 3 disclosures, with the expectation that a binding Pillar I requirement will be introduced across the EU from 2018.
The EBA is tasked with monitoring banks submissions with regard to the leverage ratio by the end of 2016 which may result in further changes to the leverage ratio.
The PRA has communicated its expectation that Barclays meets a 3% estimated PRA leverage ratio by June 2014.
The estimated PRA leverage a ratio is calculated on the fully loaded CRD IV Tier 1 capital base adjusted for certain PRA defined deductions, and a PRA adjusted CRD IV leverage exposure measure.
Barclays expects to meet the leverage expectation of 3% communicated by the PRA.
Barclays has disclosed an estimated leverage ratio based on our understanding of the requirements and guidance of CRD IV as currently published and is subject to further change as the rules are fully implemented.
The estimated ratio does not take account of the finalisation of the Basel 3 leverage ratio framework issued by the Basel Committee on 12 January 2014.
CRD IV leverage ratio calculation In calculating the CRD IV leverage ratio the IFRS balance sheet is taken as a starting point and the following key adjustments to total assets have been applied: Derivatives netting adjustment: regulatory netting applied across asset and liability mark-to-market derivative positions pursuant to legally enforceable bilateral netting agreements and meeting the requirements of CRD IV: Potential Future Exposure PFE on derivatives: regulatory add-on for potential future credit exposures, calculated in accordance with the CRD IV mark-to-market method by assigning standardised percentages to the notional values on derivative contracts: Securities Financing Transactions SFTs adjustments: under CRD IV, the IFRS measure of SFTs is replaced with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method FCCM measure, calculated as an add-on equal to exposure less collateral, taking into account master netting agreements and adjusting for volatility haircuts: Undrawn Commitments: regulatory add-ons relating to off balance sheet undrawn commitments are based on a standardised credit conversion factor of 10% for unconditionally cancellable commitments and 100% for all other commitments.
The rules specify relief to be applied to trade finance related undrawn commitments which are deemed to be medium low risk 20% and medium risk 50% : Regulatory deductions: items comprising goodwill and intangibles, deferred tax asset permanent losses, own paper, cash flow hedge reserve, pension assets and PVA that are deducted from the capital measure are also deducted from total leverage exposure to ensure consistency between the numerator and denominator: Other adjustments: includes adjustments required to change from an IFRS scope of consolidation to a regulatory scope of consolidation, adjustments for significant investments in financial sector entities that are consolidated for accounting purposes but not for regulatory purposes, and the removal of IFRS reduction in assets for the recognition of Credit Risk Mitigation and the netting of loans with deposits: and b In addition, in accordance with SS3 13 the estimated PRA adjusted leverage exposure allows for further adjustments that reduce leverage exposure by 14bn.
These adjustments: Exclude potential future exposure on the qualifying central clearing counterparties QCCPs legs of client clearing transactions where Barclays does not guarantee the performance of the QCCP to the client Allow for the netting of assets with cash collateral received for variation margin in relation to derivatives trades to facilitate customer central clearing as well as cash collateral received and posted on Barclays own derivative transactions with QCCPs.
Basel Committee leverage ratio On 12 January 2014, the Basel Committee announced the finalisation of its revised rules for calculating the Basel 3 leverage ratio.
These included a number of elements that would require amendments to CRD IV if adopted in the EU, although implementation timeframes within the EU are not yet clear.
Compared to the current CRD IV implementation, the revised rules contain elements that will increase leverage exposure: including capturing a calculation for net written credit derivatives based upon their notional value and the inclusion of netted cash legs of SFTs.
The revised rules also include elements that will reduce leverage exposure including, the removal of volatility haircuts in relation to the SFTs add-on, the ability to net down derivative MTM exposures with eligible cash collateral this element includes the impact of the PRA rule changes, and expands upon them, and more favourable credit conversion factors for undrawn commitments.
Based on an initial high level impact analysis we have estimated the changes would decrease the CRD IV leverage ratio by approximately 20 basis points prior to management actions.

Excluding the impact of movements in foreign currency, leverage exposure reduced approximately 140bn driven by reductions in loans and advances, trading portfolio assets and potential future exposure on derivatives.
Applying the Basel 3 2010 text for the calculation of leverage would result in an estimated leverage exposure of 1,521bn June 2013: 1,665bn, reflecting an increase of 144bn in the SFT exposure calculation from the CRD IV exposure.
The estimated fully loaded leverage ratio would be 2.8% June 2013: 2.3% on this basis.
Note a The PRA adjustment to CET1 capital as at 30 June 2013 included incremental expected loss charges on specific portfolios deemed vulnerable by the PRA and a deduction relating to the calculation of PVA.
No adjustment for PVA was applied as at 31 December 2013 as the underlying calculation of CET1 capital has been updated to reflect the agreed change in methodology.

com annualreport The Strategic Report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Economic capital EC and its use as part of the ICAAP assessment Pillar 2 RWAs, as provided in previous pages, are measured based on generic regulatory capital rules that assume all financial institutions have a well diversified portfolio.
An alternative approach to measure Capital risk is to use an Economic Capital calculation approach that takes into consideration firm specific concentrations e. g. sector, geography, single name, risk exposures and portfolio correlations.
Economic capital is an internal measure of the risk profile of the bank expressed as the estimated stress loss at a 99.98% confidence level.
Barclays assesses capital requirements by measuring the Groups risk profile using internally developed models.
The Group assigns economic capital primarily within the following risk categories: credit risk, market risk, operational risk, fixed asset risk mainly property and pension risk.
The Group regularly reviews its economic capital methodology and benchmarks outputs to external reference points.
The framework uses default probabilities during average credit conditions, rather than those prevailing at the balance sheet date, thus seeking to remove cyclicality from the economic capital calculation.
The economic capital framework takes into consideration time horizon, correlation of risks and risk concentrations.
Economic capital is allocated on a consistent basis across all of Barclays businesses and risk activities.
UK firms, as part of Pillar 2 framework, are required to update annually the firms Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The information provided by Barclays within the ICAAP is used by the PRA BoE to support the regulator capital solvency review.
Requirements for local ICAAPs also exist in a number of jurisdictions in which Barclays operates e. g. South Africa.
The Group ICAAP is used to assesses Group-wide capital adequacy to cover for all risks to which the Group is exposed.
As part of the Group ICAAP, and in line with PRA BoE rules, the internal measure of Capital EC is used to support the Groups assessment of the appropriateness of capital allocated to each risk type.
Economic Capital is also used to assess capital adequacy of a number of Barclays subsidiaries as part of Local ICAAPs.
Key risks considered as part of the Group and Local ICAAPs are: Pillar 1 risks i. e. Credit, Market and Operational risk for which capital requirements are primarily based on the Regulatory Capital framework IRB and Standardised approaches and calculated in line with PRA rules set out in GENPRU BIPRU.
Regulatory Capital requirements are then benchmarked against our Economic Capital calculations as part of our ICAAP assessment.
Non-Pillar 1 risks for which we have bespoke approaches that are mainly included in the EC framework.
Main non-Pillar 1 risks: Pension risk Barclays does not have ownership of the investments within the pension fund but rather works with the Trustees dedicate investment team to ensure that the risk profile is appropriate and within risk appetite: Concentration risk e. g. single name, industry, geography managed and monitored as part of BAU, mainly through Group risk appetite framework, policy setting, monitoring, stress testing and EC framework.
For EC purposes concentration risk is accounted for within each relevant risk type mainly as part of the Wholesale Credit Risk EC calculation : and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book IRRBB, also called non-traded interest rate risk included as part of Market Risk in graphics below Barclays objective is to minimise non-traded interest rate risk and this is achieved by transferring IRRBB from the business to Barclays Treasury, which in turn hedges the net exposure via Barclays Investment Bank with the external market.
