Financial instruments and risk management The group issues or holds financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and trade payables, arise directly from the groups operations.
Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
Treasury operations The group has a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity, funding, investments and counterparty credit risk arising from transactions with financial institutions.
This treasury operation also manages the groups market exposures, including risks from volatility in currency and interest rates.
The treasury operation acts as a central bank to group entities providing central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services.
Funding and deposit taking is usually provided in the functional currency of the relevant entity.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage financial risk at optimum cost.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the BT Group plc Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of the borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated its authority to operate these polices to a series of panels that are responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Group Finance Director of the BT Group plc Board.
The management of exposures arising from trading related financial instruments, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, is through a series of policies and procedures set at a group and line of business level.
Line of business management apply and review these policies and procedures to assess and manage the financial risks arising from these financial instruments.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2013 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
Interest rate risk management Management policy The group has interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities which may expose the group to either cash ow or fair value volatility.
The groups policy, as set by the BT Group plc Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs consolidated net debt is at xed rates.
Shortterm interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer BT Group who have been delegated such authority from the BT Group plc Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage the groups interest rate mix prole, the group has entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings have been, and are, subject to xed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
Sensitivities Interest rates The group is exposed to volatility in the income statement and shareholders equity arising from changes in interest rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies is a reasonable benchmark for performing a sensitivity analysis.
After the impact of hedging, the groups main exposure to interest rate volatility in the income statement arises from fair value movements on derivatives not in hedging relationships, oating rate borrowings, investments and cash equivalents which are largely inuenced by Sterling interest rates.
With all other factors remaining constant at 31 March 2013, a 1% increase in Sterling interest rates would decrease the groups annual net finance expense by approximately 193m 2011 12: 194m.
78 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2013 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 24.
Financial instruments and risk management continued The groups main exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders equity arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The derivatives have an underlying interest exposure to Sterling, Euro and US Dollar rates.
With all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of derivatives included in the cash ow reserve at the balance sheet date, a 1% increase in interest rates in each of the currencies would impact equity, before tax, as detailed below: 2013 2012 m m Increase Increase At 31 March Reduce Reduce Sterling interest rates 418 435 US Dollar interest rates 420 406 Euro interest rates 36 66 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
Credit ratings The groups 2016 and 2030 bonds contain covenants which have required the group to pay higher rates of interest once the group ceased to be rated at least A3 in the case of Moodys or at least A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 2.5bn at 31 March 2013, the groups finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 12m a year if BT Group plcs credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies from the current ratings.
The groups 600m 2014 bond attracts an additional 1.25% for a downgrade by one credit rating below Baa3 BBB by either or both Moodys and S&P, respectively.
This would result in an additional finance expense of approximately 6m per year.
BT Group plcs credit ratings are detailed below: 2013 2012 At 31 March Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Rating Agency Standard & Poors BBB Stable BBB Stable Moodys Baa2 Positive Baa2 Stable The group is targeting a BBB Baa1 credit rating over the medium term.
Foreign exchange risk management Management policy The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that eventual future net inflows and net outflows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
The BT Group plc Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the type of transactions which should normally be covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for the different types of transactions.
Short-term foreign exchange management is delegated to the treasury operation whilst long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc Group Finance Director, Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management or the Treasurer BT Group who have been delegated such authority by the BT Group plc Board.
The policy delegates authority to the Director Treasury, Tax and Risk Management to take positions of up to 100m and for the Group Finance Director to take positions of up to 1bn.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of the groups external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
The groups non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
Foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups operations have been predominantly swapped into Sterling using cross-currency swaps.
Foreign currency borrowings comprised: 2013 2012 At 31 March m m Euro 2,690 3,341 US Dollar 3,996 3,543 Other 1 6,686 6,885 The currency prole of these borrowings after the impact of hedging is disclosed in note 22.
The group also enters into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency investments, interest expense, capital purchases and purchase and sale commitments on a selective basis.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacic region currencies.
As a result, the groups exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on its non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading ows.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements British Telecommunications plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2013 79 24.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Sensitivities Foreign exchange rates After hedging, with all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the groups exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement from a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies would result in a charge credit respectively of approximately 2m 2011 12: credit charge approximately 8m.
The groups main exposure to foreign exchange volatility within shareholders equity excluding translation exposures arises from fair value movements on derivatives held in the cash ow reserve.
The majority of foreign exchange uctuations in the cash ow reserve are recycled immediately to the income statement to match the hedged item and therefore the groups exposure to foreign exchange uctuations in equity was insignicant in both 2012 13 and 2011 12.
Liquidity risk management Management policy The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by entering into short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements.
The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the maximum long-term funding of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the treasury operation within the parameters of the policies set by the BT Group plc Board.
Renancing risk is managed by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage renancing needs as they arise.
The maturity prole of the groups loans and borrowings at 31 March 2013 is disclosed in note 22.
The group has term debt maturities of 0.3bn in 2013 14.
During 2012 13 and 2011 12 the group issued commercial paper and held cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2013 the group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 1.5bn 2011 12: 1.5bn maturing in March 2016.

b Foreign currency-related cash flows were translated at closing rates as at the relevant reporting date.
Credit risk management Management policy The groups exposure to credit risk arises from financial instruments transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from its trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the BT Group plc Boards dened policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as dened by Moodys and S&P and by dening the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties are A3 A for longterm and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty up to the maximum allowable limit set by the BT Group plc Board.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single counterparty, or group of related counterparties, the group may enter into netting arrangements to reduce the groups exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
The group also seeks collateral or other security where it is considered necessary.
The treasury operation regularly reviews the credit limits applied when investing with counterparties in response to market conditions, continues to monitor their credit quality and actively manages any exposures which arise.
Operational management policy The BT Group plc Boards credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied by the group and managed by each of the lines of business to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
The group will also enhance credit protection, when appropriate, taking into consideration the groups exposure to the customer, by applying processes which include netting and offsetting, and requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
The group takes proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of relationship banks to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading related financial assets.

The related net cash inow, including foreign exchange of 2m 2011 12: 20m is 33m 2011 12: 258m.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within cash and cash equivalents, and loans and other borrowings, respectively.
The group also has credit exposure arising on amounts owed by its parent and ultimate parent companies, with the majority of this balance being owed by the parent company.
The related party disclosures detailed in note 27 provide details of how this loan has arisen.
The loan owed by the parent company is primarily supported by the parent companys investment in British Telecommunications plc.
