132 DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Financial statements of the group: Risk management and capital structure This section sets out the policies and procedures applied to manage Risk the groups capital structure and the financial risks the group is exposed to.
Diageo considers the following components of its balance sheet management to be capital: borrowings and equity.
Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency, provide flexibility to invest and capital through the economic cycle and give efficient access to debt markets structure at attractive cost levels.
Financial instruments and risk management Accounting policies Financial assets and liabilities are initially recorded at fair value including, where permitted by IFRS 9, any directly attributable transaction costs.
For those financial assets that are not subsequently held at fair value, the group assesses whether there is evidence of impairment at each balance sheet date.
The group classifies its financial assets and liabilities into the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost, financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.
The accounting policies for other investments and loans are described in note 12, for trade and other receivables and payables in note 14 and for cash and cash equivalents in note 16.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include derivative assets and liabilities.
Where financial assets or liabilities are eligible to be carried at either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income the group does not apply the fair value option.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value using a discounted cash flow model based on market data applied consistently for similar types of instruments.
Gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are taken to the income statement as they arise.
Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost unless they are part of a fair value hedge relationship.
The difference between the initial carrying amount of the financial liabilities and their redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the contractual terms using the effective interest rate method.
Hedge accounting The group designates and documents certain derivatives as hedging instruments against changes in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities fair value hedges, highly probable forecast transactions or the cash flow risk from a change in exchange or interest rates cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
The designated portion of the hedging instruments is included in other financial assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
The effectiveness of such hedges is assessed at inception and at least on a quarterly basis, using prospective testing.
Methods used for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms, regression analysis and hypothetical models.
Fair value hedges are used to manage the currency and or interest rate risks to which the fair value of certain assets and liabilities are exposed.
Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.
If such a hedge relationship no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, fair value movements on the derivative continue to be taken to the income statement while any fair value adjustments made to the underlying hedged item to that date are amortised through the income statement over its remaining life using the effective interest rate method.
Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable future foreign currency cash flows, as well as the cash flow risk from changes in exchange or interest rates.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income, while any ineffective part is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are recycled to the income statement in the same period in which the underlying foreign currency or interest exposure affects the income statement.
Net investment hedges take the form of either foreign currency borrowings or derivatives.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of net investments are recorded in other comprehensive income and included in the exchange reserve.
Liabilities used as hedging instruments are revalued at closing exchange rates and the resulting gains or losses are also recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that they are effective, with any ineffectiveness taken to the income statement.
Foreign exchange contracts hedging net investments are carried at fair value.
Effective fair value movements are recognised in other comprehensive income, with any ineffectiveness taken to the income statement.

134 DIAGEO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Financial statements of the group: Risk management and capital structure d Market risk sensitivity analysis The group uses a sensitivity analysis that estimates the impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 0.5% in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017, for each class of financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post employment benefit liabilities and assets, and corporate tax payable.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis estimates the impact of changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
All hedges are expected to be highly effective for this analysis and it considers the impact of all financial instruments including financial derivatives, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.
The results of the sensitivity analysis should not be considered as projections of likely future events, gains or losses as actual results in the future may differ materially due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below.

ii The impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income includes the impact on the income statement.
e Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group.
Credit risk arises on cash balances including bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding loans, trade and other receivables, financial guarantees and committed transactions.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the groups exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date as disclosed in section i, excluding the impact of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.
A financial asset is in default when the counterparty fails to pay its contractual obligations.
Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
Credit risk is managed separately for financial and business related credit exposures.
Financial credit risk Diageo aims to minimise its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the Board.
Counterparties are predominantly limited to major banks and financial institutions, primarily with a long term credit rating within the A band or better, and the policy restricts the exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits taking into account the credit quality of the counterparty.
The groups policy is designed to ensure that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Board also defines the types of financial instruments which may be transacted.
The credit risk arising through the use of financial instruments for currency and interest rate risk management is estimated with reference to the fair value of contracts with a positive value, rather than the notional amount of the instruments themselves.
Diageo annually reviews the credit limits applied and regularly monitors the counterparties credit quality reflecting market credit conditions.
When derivative transactions are undertaken with bank counterparties, the group may, where appropriate, enter into certain agreements with such bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefit of the other if the net valuations of the derivatives are above a predetermined threshold.
At 30 June 2018, the collateral held under these agreements amounted to $71 million 54 million 2017 $96 million 74 million.
Business related credit risk Loan, trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and active risk management is applied, focusing on country risk, credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and monitoring procedures.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to loans, trade and other receivables as the group has a large number of customers which are internationally dispersed.
f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Diageo may encounter difficulties in meeting its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets.
The group uses short term commercial paper to finance its day-to-day operations.
The groups policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of borrowings is to limit the amount of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, the groups policy is to maintain backstop facilities with relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
The following tables provide an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash flows including interest payable for the groups financial liabilities and derivative instruments on an undiscounted basis.
Where interest payments are calculated at a floating rate, rates of each cash flow until maturity of the instruments are calculated based on the forward yield curve prevailing at the respective year ends.
The gross cash flows of cross currency swaps are presented for the purposes of this table.
All other derivative contracts are presented on a net basis.
Financial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the consolidated balance sheet, although in practice, the group uses netting arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.

Strengths of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is analysed on an ongoing basis.
Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result of timing, cash flows or value except when the critical terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item are closely aligned.
The change in the credit risk of the hedging instruments or the hedged items is not expected to be the primary factor in the economic relationship.
The notional amounts, contractual maturities and rates of the hedging instruments designated in hedging relationships as of 30 June 2018 by the main risk categories are as follows: Notional amounts million Maturity Range of hedged rates 2018 Net investment hedges Derivatives in net investment hedges of foreign operations 1,068 July 2018 US dollar 1.32 Cash flow hedges Derivatives in cash flow hedge foreign currency debt 1,553 April 2023April 2043 US dollar 1.221.88 Derivatives in cash flow hedge foreign exchange risk 1,197 September 2018December US dollar 1.241.47, euro 1.061.18 2019 Derivatives in cash flow hedge commodity price risk 30 July 2018March 2020 Corn 152.76 164.17 USD t Aluminium 2058.752204 USD MT Fair value hedges Derivatives in fair value hedge interest rate risk 3,597 July 2018May 2028 0.26 -3.09% 2017 Net investment hedges Derivatives in net investment hedges of foreign operations 1,919 July 2017 US dollar 1.261.30, euro 1.14 Cash flow hedges Derivatives in cash flow hedge foreign currency debt 1,577 April 2023April 2043 US dollar 1.221.88 Derivatives in cash flow hedge foreign exchange risk 893 July 2017Dec 2018 US dollar 1.231.51, euro 1.091.31 Derivatives in cash flow hedge commodity price risk 8 July 2017June 2018 Corn 141.73 USD t Aluminium 19121931 USD MT Fair value hedges Derivatives in fair value hedge interest rate risk 3,305 October 2017April 2023 0.932.12% For hedges of the cash flow risk from a change in forward exchange rates using cross currency interest rate swaps, the retranslation of the related bond principal to closing exchange rates and recognition of interest on the related bonds will affect the income statement in each year until the related bonds mature in 2023, 2036 and 2043.
Exchange retranslation and the interest on the hedged bonds in the income statement are expected to offset those on the cross currency swaps in each of the years.
In respect of cash flow hedging instruments, a loss of 57 million 2017 29 million loss: 2016 31 million gain has been recognised in other comprehensive income due to changes in fair value.
A gain of 7 million has been transferred out of other comprehensive income to other operating expenses and a loss of 6 million to other finance charges, respectively 2017 a loss of 143 million and a gain of 42 million: 2016 a loss of 66 million and a gain of 211 million to offset the foreign exchange impact on the underlying transactions.
For cash flow hedges of forecast transactions at 30 June 2018, based on year end interest and exchange rates, there is expected to be a loss to the income statement of 7 million in the year ending 30 June 2019 and a loss of 9 million in the year ending 30 June 2020.
