Financial instruments and risk management Risk management is performed by BT Group plc, the ultimate parent company of the group.
We issue or hold financial instruments mainly to finance our operations: to finance corporate transactions such as dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage currency and interest rate risks.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and payables arise directly from operations.
How do we manage financial risk?
Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Treasury operation We have a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as our exposure to associated financial and market risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.
Treasury policy Treasury policy is set by the BT Group plc Board.
Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations.
Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the chairman, the chief executive or the chief financial officer BT Group plc.
There has been no change in the nature of our risk profile between 31 March 2018 and the date of approval of these financial statements.
How do we manage interest rate risk?
Management policy Interest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings.
Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.
Our policy, as set by the BT Group plc Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of BT Group plcs ongoing net debt is at fixed rates.
Shortterm interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the BT Group plc group chief financial officer, group director tax, treasury and insurance or the group treasurer who each have been delegated such authority from the BT Group plc Board.
Hedging strategy In order to manage our interest rate profile, we have entered into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed.
The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments.
The majority of the groups long-term borrowings are subject to fixed Sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.
How do we manage foreign exchange risk?
Management policy Foreign currency hedging activities protect the group from the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect future net cash flows.
The BT Group plc Boards policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions typically covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for each type of transaction.
The BT Group plc Board has delegated short-term foreign exchange management to the treasury operation and long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the BT Group plc group chief financial officer, group director tax, treasury and insurance or the group treasurer.
Hedging strategy A significant proportion of our external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in Sterling.
Our non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.
British Telecommunications plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2018 157 156 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report & Form 20-F 2018 THE STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued We enter into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments.
The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific region currencies.
As a result, our exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.
We use cross-currency swaps to swap foreign currency borrowings into Sterling.
The table below reflects the currency and interest rate profile of our loans and borrowings after the impact of hedging.

Sensitivity analysis The income statement and shareholders equity are exposed to volatility arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
To demonstrate this volatility, management have concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis: For interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across Sterling, US Dollar and Euro currencies.
For foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening weakening in Sterling against other currencies.
The impact on equity, before tax, of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% strengthening in Sterling against other currencies is as detailed below: 2018 2017 2016 m m m Increase Increase Increase At 31 March reduce reduce reduce Sterling interest rates 628 554 626 US Dollar interest rates 267 348 374 Euro interest rates 401 229 263 Sterling strengthening 236 269 98 A 1% decrease in interest rates and 10% weakening in Sterling against other currencies would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.
The impact on the groups annual net finance expense of a 1% change in interest rates would have been a decrease of 143m 2016 17: 108m, 2015 16: 123m.
Our exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, excluding translation exposures would not have been material in 2017 18, 2016 17 and 2015 16. Credit ratings BT Group plc continues to target a BBB Baa1 credit rating over the cycle.
We regularly review the liquidity of the group and our funding strategy takes account of medium-term requirements.
These include the pension deficit and shareholder distributions.
Our December 2030 bond contains covenants which require us to pay higher rates of interest since our credit ratings fell below A3 in the case of Moodys or A in the case of Standard & Poors S&P.
Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade.
Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of 1.9bn at 31 March 2018, our finance expense would increase decrease by approximately 10m a year if the groups credit rating were to be downgraded upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies.

Management policy We maintain liquidity by entering into short and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements, determined using short and long-term cash forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period.
On at least an annual basis the BT Group plc Board reviews and approves the long-term funding requirements of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters.
We manage refinancing risk by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise.
The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings at 31 March 2018 is disclosed in note 23.
We have term debt maturities of 1.6bn in 2018 19.
Our treasury operation reviews and manages our short-term requirements within the parameters of the policies set by the BT Group plc Board.
We hold cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements.
At 31 March 2018 we had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 2.1bn 2016 17: 2.1bn, 2015 16: 1.5bn maturing in September 2021.
The group has no material debt factoring arrangements in place.
In the UK, the group has arranged for a funder to offer a supplier financing scheme to the groups suppliers.
This enables suppliers who sign up to the arrangement to sell their invoices to the funder and to be paid earlier than the invoice due date.
The group assesses the arrangement against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the requirement to be disclosed as trade payables or should be classified as borrowings.
At 31 March 2018 the payables met the criteria of trade payables.

How do we manage credit risk?
Management policy Our exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents and from trading-related receivables.
For treasury-related balances, the BT Group plc Boards defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moodys and S&P.
The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3 A for long-term and P1 A1 for short-term investments.
If counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria we will take action where appropriate.
The treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the BT Group plc Board.
Operational management policy Our credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the customer-facing units to ensure compliance.
The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis.
Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards.
Where appropriate, we may minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit.
We take proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of counterparties to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.
Exposures The maximum credit risk exposure of the groups financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 At 31 March Notes m m m Derivative financial assets 1,509 2,246 1,639 Investments 21 16,578 13,346 15,236 c Trade and other receivables 16 2,533 2,754 2,884 Cash and cash equivalents 22 521 526 989 21,141 18,872 20,748 c The carrying amount excludes 317m 2016 17: 360m, 2015 16: 218m of non-current trade and other receivables which relate to non-financial assets, and 1,496m 2016 17: 1,106m, 2015 16: 1,103m of prepayments and other receivables.

Where the opinion of Moodys and S&P differ, the lower rating is used.
The concentration of credit risk for our trading balances is provided in note 16, which analyses outstanding balances by customerfacing unit.
Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association ISDA documentation.
We have also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, the fair value position on notional 3,162m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.
The related net cash outflow during the year was 220m 2016 17: inflow 100m, 2015 16: inflow 79m.
The collateral paid and received is recognised within current asset investments and loans and other borrowings, respectively.

The energy derivative was renegotiated during 2016 17 and has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
On initial recognition of this contract a loss of 8m was deferred.
The fair value of the energy derivative at 31 March 2018 was a liability of 1m 2016 17: liability of 8m, 2015 16: nil.
It has been valued using assumptions on volumes, inflation and energy prices.
Hedging activities Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges Instruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging Euroand US Dollardenominated borrowings.
Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step-up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to the groups 2030 US Dollar bond.
The hedged cash flows will affect the groups income statement as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings see note 23.
We hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US Dollar, Euro and Asia Pacific currencies 12 months forward with certain specific transactions hedged further forward.
The related cash flows are recognised in the income statement over this period.
All cash flow hedges were effective in the period.
See note 26 for details of the movements in the cash flow reserve.
Other derivatives Our policy is not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and held at fair value through profit or loss under IAS 39.
