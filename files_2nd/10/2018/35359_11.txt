Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Board confirms that it has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Boards assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and the mitigation in place is set out below.
In February 2017, the Board decided that Failure to integrate the Worldstores business successfully was an additional principal risk which should be added to the register.
As the integration is now largely complete this has been revised to cover Failure to deliver maximum value from our online business.
We have also included this year a separate section on Brexit to highlight the risks and mitigating actions.
Last year we included these in the competition, markets and customers section, the business efficiency section, and the finance and treasury sections.
