RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 5 Risk and capital management Insurance risk The Group is exposed to risks arising from insurance contracts as set out below: A Underwriting risk B Reserving risk A Underwriting risk Underwriting risk refers to the risk that claims arising are higher or lower than assumed in pricing due to bad experience including catastrophes, weakness in controls over underwriting or portfolio management, or claims management issues.
The majority of underwriting risk to which the Group is exposed is of a short-term nature, and generally does not exceed 12 months.
The Groups underwriting strategy aims to ensure that the underwritten risks are well diversi ed in terms of the type, amount of risk, and geography in order to ensure that the Group minimises the volatility of its insurance result.
Underwriting limits are in place to enforce appropriate risk selection criteria and pricing with all of the Groups underwriters having speci c licences that set clear parameters for the business they can underwrite, based on their expertise.
The Group has developed enhanced methods of recording exposures and concentrations of risk and has a centrally managed forum looking at Group underwriting issues, reviewing and agreeing underwriting direction and setting policy and directives where appropriate.
The Group has a monthly portfolio management process across all its business units where key risk indicators are tracked to monitor emerging trends, opportunities and risks.
This provides greater control of exposures in high risk areas as well as enabling a prompt response to adverse claims development.
Pricing for the Groups products is generally based upon historical claims frequencies and claims severity averages, adjusted for in ation and modelled catastrophes, trended forward to recognise anticipated changes in claims patterns after making allowance for other costs incurred by the Group, conditions in the insurance market and a pro t loading that adequately covers the cost of capital.
Passing elements of our insurance risk to reinsurers is another key strategy employed in managing the Groups exposure to insurance risk.
The Group Board determines a maximum level of risk to be retained by the Group as a whole.
The net retained risk is distributed across the Group in accordance with Group and local risk appetite.
The Group remains primarily liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured, although the reinsurer is liable to the Group to the extent of the insurance risk it has contractually accepted responsibility for.
B Reserving risk Reserving risk refers to the risk that the Groups estimates of future claims payments will be insuf cient.
The Group establishes a provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the anticipated costs of all losses that have already occurred but have not yet been paid.
Such estimates are made for losses already reported to the Group as well as for the losses that have already occurred but are not yet reported together with a provision for the future costs of handling and settling the outstanding claims.
There is a risk to the Group from the inherent uncertainty in estimating provisions at the end of the reporting period for the eventual outcome of outstanding noti ed claims as well as estimating the number and value of claims that are still to be noti ed.
There is also uncertainty in the level of future costs of handling and settling the outstanding claims.
The Group seeks to reduce its reserving risk through the use of experienced regional actuaries who estimate the actuarial indication of the required reserves based on claims experience, business volume, anticipated change in the claims environment and claims cost.
This information is used by local reserving committees to recommend to the Group Reserving Committee the appropriate level of reserves for each region.
This will include adding a margin onto the actuarial indication as a provision for unforeseen developments such as future claims patterns differing from historical experience, future legislative changes and the emergence of latent exposures.
The Group Reserving Committee review these local submissions and recommend the final level of reserves to be held by the Group.
The Group Reserving Committee is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Of cer and includes the Group Chief Executive, Group Underwriting Director, Group Chief Actuary and Group Chief Risk Of cer.
A similar committee has been established in each of the Groups primary operating segments.
The Group Reserving Committee monitors the decisions and judgements made by the business units as to the level of reserves to be held.
It then recommends to the Group Board via the Group Audit Committee the final decision on the level of reserves to be included within the consolidated financial statements.
In forming its collective judgement, the Committee considers the following information: 118 RSA Annual Report and Accounts 2018 rsagroup.
com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 5 Risk and capital management continued The actuarial indication of ultimate losses together with an assessment of risks and possible favourable or adverse developments that may not have been fully re ected in calculating these indications.
At the end of 2018, these risks and developments include: the possibility of future legislative change having retrospective effect on open claims: changes in claims settlement procedures potentially leading to future claims payment patterns differing from historical experience: the possibility of new types of claim, such as disease claims, emerging from historical business: general uncertainty in the claims environment: the emergence of latent exposures: the outcome of litigation on claims received: failure to recover reinsurance and unanticipated changes in claims in ation: The views of internal peer reviewers of the reserves and of other parties including actuaries, legal counsel, risk directors, underwriters and claims managers: The outcome from independent assurance reviews performed by the Group actuarial function to assess the reasonableness of regional actuarial indication estimates: How previous actuarial indications have developed.
Financial risk Financial risk refers to the risk of financial loss predominantly arising from investment transactions entered into by the Group, and also to a lesser extent arising from insurance contracts, and includes the following risks: C redit risk: Market risk including price, interest rate and currency rate risks: Liquidity risk.
The Group undertakes a number of strategies to manage these risks including the use of derivative financial instruments for the purpose of reducing its exposure to adverse uctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and long term in ation.
The Group does not use derivatives to leverage its exposure to markets and does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The policy on use of derivatives is approved by the Board Risk Committee BRC.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a counterparty to honour its financial or contractual obligations to the Group.
The Groups credit risk exposure is largely concentrated in its xed income investment portfolio and to a lesser extent, its premium receivables, and reinsurance assets.
Credit risk is managed at both a Group level and at a local level.
Local operations are responsible for assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of their counterparties e. g. brokers and policyholders.
Local credit committees are responsible for ensuring these exposures are within the risk appetite of the local operations.
Exposure monitoring and reporting for xed income investments and premium receivables is embedded throughout the organisation with aggregate credit positions reported and monitored at Group level.
The Groups credit risk strategy appetite and credit risk policy are developed by the BRC and are reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis.
This is done through the setting of Group policies, procedures and limits.
In fide ning its appetite for credit risk the Group looks at exposures at both an aggregate and business unit level, distinguishing between credit risks incurred as a result of offsetting insurance risks or operating in the insurance market e. g. reinsurance credit risks and risks to receiving premiums due from policyholders and intermediaries and credit risks incurred for the purposes of generating a return e. g. invested assets credit risk.
Limits are set at both a portfolio and counterparty level based on likelihood of default, derived from the rating of the counterparty, to ensure that the Groups overall credit pro le and speci c concentrations are managed and controlled within risk appetite.
The Groups investment management strategy primarily focuses on debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and seeks to limit the overall credit exposure with respect to any one issuer by ensuring limits have been based upon credit quality.
Restrictions are placed on each of the Groups investment managers as to the level of exposure to various rating categories including unrated securities.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk from the use of reinsurance in the event that a reinsurer fails to settle its liability to the Group.
The Group Reinsurance Credit Committee oversees the management of credit risk arising from the reinsurer failing to settle its liability to the Group.
Group standards are set such that reinsurers that have a financial strength rating of less than Awith Standard & Poors, or a comparable rating, are removed from the Groups authorised list of approved reinsurers unless the Groups internal review discovers exceptional circumstances in favour of the reinsurer.
Collateral is taken, where appropriate, to mitigate exposures to acceptable levels.
At 31 December 2018 the extent of collateral held by the Group against reinsurers share of insurance contract liabilities was 577m 2017: 585m, which in the event of a default would be called and recognised on the balance sheet.
119 RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 5 Risk and capital management continued The Groups use of reinsurance is suf ciently diversi ed that it is not concentrated on a single reinsurer, or any single reinsurance contract.
The Group regularly monitors its aggregate exposures by reinsurer group against predetermined reinsurer group limits, in accordance with the methodology agreed by the BRC.
The Groups largest reinsurance exposures to active reinsurance groups, excluding Enstar which is fully collateralised see note 6, are Berkshire Hathaway, Lloyds of London and Talanx.
At 31 December 2018 the reinsurance asset recoverable from these groups does not exceed 3.9% 2017: 3.9% of the Groups total financial assets.
Stress tests are performed by reinsurer counterparty and the limits are set such that in a catastrophic event, the exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 6.5% 2017: 6.4% of the Groups total financial assets.
The credit pro le of the Groups assets exposed to credit risk is shown below.

Market risk arises in the Groups operations due to the possibility that uctuations in the value of liabilities are not offset by uctuations in the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses through foreign currency risk.
Market risk is subject to the Board Risk Committees risk management framework, which is subject to review and approval by the Board.
Market risk can be broken down into three key components: i.
Equity and property risk The Group classi es its investment portfolio in debt securities and equity securities in accordance with the accounting fide nitions under IFRS.
At 31 December 2018 the Group held investments classi ed as equity securities of 739m 2017: 764m.
These include interests in structured entities as disclosed in note 27 and other investments where the price risk arises from interest rate risk rather than from equity market price risk.
The Group considers that within equity securities, investments with a fair value of 203m 2017: 242m may be more affected by equity index market price risk than by interest rate risk.
On this basis a 15% fall in the value of equity index prices would result in the recognition of losses of 30m 2017: 36m in other comprehensive income.
In addition the Group holds investments in properties and in group occupied properties which are subject to property price risk.
A decrease of 15% in property prices would result in the recognition of losses of 47m 2017: 46m in the income statement and 3m 2017: 5m in other comprehensive income.
This analysis assumes that there is no correlation between interest rate and property market rate risks.
It also assumes that all other assets and liabilities remain unchanged and that no management action is taken.
This analysis does not represent managements view of future market change, but re ects managements view of key sensitivities.
This analysis is presented gross of the corresponding tax credits charges.
121 RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 5 Risk and capital management continued ii.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and xed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on insurance liabilities.
This impacts both the fair value and amount of variable returns on existing assets as well as the cost of acquiring new xed maturity investments.
Given the composition of the Groups investments as at 31 December 2018, the table below illustrates the impact to the income statement and other comprehensive income of a hypothetical 100bps change in interest rates on xed income securities and cash that are subject to interest rate risk.
Changes in the income statement and other comprehensive income OCI : Increase in income Decrease in other statement comprehensive income 2018 2017 2018 2017 m m m m Increase in interest rate markets: Impact on xed income securities and cash of an increase in interest rates of 100bps 20 18 380 412 The Group principally manages interest rate risk by holding investment assets predominantly xed income that generate cash ows which broadly match the duration of expected claim settlements and other associated costs.
The sensitivity of the xed interest securities of the Group has been modelled by reference to a reasonable approximation of the average interest rate sensitivity of the investments held within each of the portfolios.
The effect of movement in interest rates is re ected as a one time rise of 100bps on 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2018 on the following years income statement and other comprehensive income.
The impact of an increase in interest rates on the fair value of xed income securities that would be initially recognised in OCI will reduce over time as the maturity date approaches.
Currency risk The Group incurs exposure to currency risk in two ways: Operational currency risk by holding investments and other assets and by underwriting and incurring liabilities in currencies other than the currency of the primary environment in which the business units operate, the Group is exposed to uctuations in foreign exchange rates that can impact both its pro tability and the reported value of such assets and liabilities: Structural currency risk by investing in overseas subsidiaries the Group is exposed to the risk that uctuations in foreign exchange rates impact the reported pro tability of foreign operations to the Group, and the value of its net investment in foreign operations.
Operational currency risk is principally managed within the Groups individual operations by broadly matching assets and liabilities by currency and liquidity.
Operational currency risk is not signi cant.
Structural currency risk is managed at a Group level through currency forward contracts and foreign exchange options within predetermined limits set by the Group Investment Committee.
In managing structural currency risk the needs of the Groups subsidiaries to maintain net assets in local currencies to satisfy local regulatory solvency and internal risk based capital requirements are taken into account.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups total shareholders equity deployed by currency was: Pounds Danish Canadian Swedish Sterling Krone Euro Dollar Krona Other Total m m m m m m Shareholders equity at 31 December 2018 2,437 401 658 226 387 4,109 Shareholders equity at 31 December 2017 2,607 414 506 201 222 3,950 Shareholders equity is stated after taking account of the effect of currency forward contracts and foreign exchange options.
The analysis aggregates the Danish Krone exposure and the Euro exposure as the Danish Krone continues to be pegged closely to the Euro.
The Group considers this aggregate exposure when reviewing its hedging strategy.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the risk of loss to the Group as a result of assets not being available in a form that can immediately be converted into cash, and therefore the consequence of not being able to pay its obligations when due.
To help mitigate this risk, the BRC sets limits on assets held by the Group designed to match the maturities of its assets to that of its liabilities.
A large proportion of investments are maintained in short-term less than one year highly liquid securities, which are used to manage the Groups operational requirements based on actuarial assessment and allowing for contingencies.

The capital and interest payable on the bonds and notes have been included until the earliest dates on which the Group has the option to call the instruments and the interest rates are reset.
For further information on terms of the bonds and notes, see note 35.
Pension risk The Group is exposed to risks through its obligation to fund a number of schemes.
These risks include market risk assets not performing as well as expected, in ation risk and mortality risk over the lives of the members.
The Group and trustees of the schemes work together to reduce these risks through agreement of investment policy including the use of interest rate, in ation rate and mortality swaps.
Further information on the Groups management of pension risk is included within note 38.
Capital management It is a key regulatory requirement that the Group maintains suf cient capital to support its exposure to risk.
Accordingly, the Groups capital management strategy is closely linked to its monitoring and management of risk.
The Groups capital objectives consist of striking the right balance between the need to support claims liabilities and ensure the con dence of policyholders, exposure to other risks, support competitive pricing strategies, meet regulatory capital requirements, and providing adequate returns for its shareholders.
The Groups overall capital position is primarily comprised of shareholders equity, Tier 1 Notes, and subordinated loan capital and aims to maximise shareholder value, while maintaining financial strength and maintaining adequate regulatory capital.
In addition the Group also aims to hold suf cient capital so as to maintain its single A credit rating.
The Group operates in many countries, and its regulated entities hold appropriate levels of capital to satisfy applicable local regulations.
Compliance with local regulatory requirements is embedded within the BRC mandate, for the protection of the Groups policyholders and the continuation of the Groups ability to underwrite.

com STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 5 Risk and capital management continued Regulatory solvency position during 2018 The Groups Solvency II Internal Model was approved by the PRA in December 2015 and forms the basis of the primary Solvency II solvency capital ratio SCR measure.
The Internal Model is used to support, inform and improve the Groups decision making across the Group.
It is used to determine the Groups optimum capital structure, its investment and hedging strategy, its reinsurance programme and to determine the pricing and target returns for each portfolio.
At 31 December 2018, the estimated SCR and corresponding eligible own funds were as follows: Unaudited 2018 2017 bn bn Eligible own funds 3.0 2.9 SCR 1.8 1.8 Coverage unrounded 170% 163% The impact on the Solvency II coverage ratio of a range of sensitivities is set out below: Unaudited 2018 Including Excluding 1 Solvency II Sensitivities change in coverage ratio : pensions pensions 2 Interest rates: 1% non-parallel shift 6% 6% 2 Interest rates: -1% non-parallel shift -8% -7% Equities: -15% -6% -2% Property: -10% -3% -2% Foreign exchange: GBP 10% vs all currencies -5% -5% Cat loss of 75m net -4% -4% 3 Credit spreads: 0.25% parallel shift -2% -2% Credit spreads: -0.25% parallel shift -9% 2% 1 The impact of pensions depends signi cantly on the opening position of the schemes and market conditions.
As such the sensitivities shown are point in time estimates that will vary and should not be extrapolated.
2 The interest rate sensitivity assumes a non-parallel shift in the yield curve to re ect that the long end of the yield curve is typically more stable than the short end.
3 The asymmetry in credit spread sensitivities re ects the fact that upside pension sensitivities are restricted to the surplus cap.
The above sensitivities have been considered in isolation.
The impact of a combination of sensitivities may be different to the individual outcomes stated above.
Where an IFRS valuation of a pension scheme surplus is restricted under Solvency II, downside pension sensitivities may be dampened relative to those shown.

125 RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 5 Risk and capital management continued Own risk and solvency assessment ORSA The Solvency II directive introduced a requirement for undertakings to conduct an ORSA.
The Group fide fines its ORSA as a series of inter-related activities by which it establishes: The quantity and quality of the risks which it seeks to assume or to which it is exposed: The level of capital required to support those risks: The actions it will take to achieve and maintain the desired levels of risk and capital.
The assessment considers both the current position and the positions that may arise during the planning horizon of the Group typically the next three years.
It looks at both the expected outcome and the outcome arising when the plan assumptions do not materialise as expected.
The assessments of how much risk to assume and how much capital to hold are inextricably linked.
In some situations, it may be desirable to increase the amount of risk assumed or retained in order to make the most ef cient use of capital available or else to return excess capital to capital providers.
In other situations, where the risks assumed give rise to a capital requirement that is greater than the capital immediately available to support those risks, it will be necessary either to reduce the risk assumed or to obtain additional capital.
The assessment of risk and solvency needs is in principle carried out continuously.
In practice, the assessment consists of a range of speci c activities and decisions carried out at different times of the year as part of an annual cycle, supplemented as necessary by ad hoc assessments of the impact of external events and developments and of internal business proposals.
Papers are presented to the Board throughout the year dealing with individual elements that make up the ORSA.
The information contained in those papers and the associated decisions taken are summarised in an annual ORSA report, which is submitted to the Groups regulators as part of the normal supervisory process.
The ORSA is approved by the BRC.
