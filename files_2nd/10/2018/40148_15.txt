FINANCIAL REVIEW Rob Hudson Chief Financial Officer Overview Our financial performance for the year was solid.
Despite the FINANCIAL significant portfolio rotation, NAV per share increased 4.3% to 470.4 pence 2017: 450.9 pence and EPRA NAV per share increased 2.7% to 484.1 pence 2017: 471.2 pence.
Adjusted EPRA earnings increased 7.8% to 31.7m 2017: 29.4m, despite our substantial STABILITY fide-leveraging via disposals, which reduced see-through net borrowings by 151.3m and see-through loan-to-value by 7.3ppt to 16.9% 2017: 24.2%, as the associated reduction in rental income GIVES US was more than offset by a fall in interest costs.
As a result, adjusted EPRA EPS grew 7.5% to 14.3 pence 2017: 13.3 pence and including the dividends paid during the year, our total accounting return was A ROBUST stable at 6.0% 2017: 6.0%.
Our dividend policy is aligned to cash profitability and we intend to pay a dividend equivalent to c. 50% of adjusted EPRA EPS per year, PLATFORM with the aim of providing a sustainable, progressive dividend for our shareholders.
Reflecting this, we will pay a final dividend of 4.0 pence per share, to be paid on 4 April 2019 to shareholders on the FOR GROWTH register as at 8 March 2019.
This brings the total dividend for 2018 to 7.1 pence per share, marking an increase of 13.1% compared to last year 2017: 6.28 pence.

In December 2017, we refinanced 488m of secured bilateral debt facilities expiring in 2019 2021 with a new 475m unsecured club facility with an initial maturity of five years and two one-year extension options.
We recently agreed the first one-year extension of this facility.
In November, we announced we had signed a 75m facility from the Homes England Home Building Fund, with an initial maturity of seven years and an option to extend this to ten years.
We also redeemed our 80m retail bond which was scheduled to mature in November 2019, which means other than the refinancing of our small KPI JV facility, which is almost complete, the only debt maturing before December 2023 is our 100m convertible bond.
With 236.9m see-through net borrowings compared to 680m facilities we have ample financial headroom, so with the shares currently trading below the conversion price, we intend to repay this bond upon its maturity in March 2019.
As a result of our financing activities, our average debt maturity increased to 4.5 years at the end of 2018 2017: 2.7 years.
Pro-forma for the refinancing of the KPI facility, drawdown of the Homes England facility and the planned convertible bond repayment, our average debt maturity would be 5.2 years.

We continue to liaise with suppliers to understand their Brexit plans, strategies and seek assurances: reviewing our commitments by project over the period up to and after any political agreement in the UK and acceptance of a deal with the European Union: reviewing all discretionary spend e. g. advisor expenditure, events and headcount, as well as contractors, to ensure we manage costs over this period: and drawing up action plans for scenarios in which sales growth could be impacted.
Integral to our overall approach to risk is understanding the cause of risk, with Brexit being one such cause.
As a result, the majority of the Groups responses to Brexit-related risks are also encompassed in the ongoing mitigating actions in addressing risks such as product and service delivery, customer and supply chain management, and management of the portfolio and future pipeline.
Also, in line with our business plan and in reviewing and approving the budget, the Board has considered downside scenarios relating to Brexit.
This has enabled the Board to assess the impact on revenues, valuation of land and the Groups portfolio, cash flow and borrowings.
The Board have satisfied themselves that the Group has and can continue to take the necessary actions to mitigate the risks associated with Brexit as currently assessed.
