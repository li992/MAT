The Groups exposure to movements in interest rates is managed by the Treasury Committee and is governed by a Board-approved interest rate hedging policy which forms part of the Groups treasury policies.
The Group seeks to limit the net exposure to changes in interest rates.
This is achieved through a combination of issuing fixed-rate debt and by the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
A 2% movement in the interest rate applied to borrowings during 2018 and 2017 would not have had a material impact on the Groups profit before taxation or equity as the Groups interest rate risk was substantially hedged given that the Groups receivables can be re-priced over arelatively short timeframe.
d Foreign exchange rate risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk of a change in foreign currency exchange rates leading to a reduction in profits or equity.
The Groups exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates during 2018 arose from the home credit operations in the Republic of Ireland which are generally hedged by matching euro-denominated net assets with euro-denominated borrowings or forward contracts as closely as practicable.
As at 31 December 2018, a 2% movement in the sterling to euro exchange rate would have led to a 0.8m 2017: 0.9m movement in customer receivables with an opposite movement of 0.8m 2017: 0.9m in external borrowings.
Due to the natural hedging of matching euro-denominated assets with euro-denominated liabilities, there would have been a minimal impact on reported profits and equity.
As at 31 December 2018, a 2% movement in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate would have led to a 0.2m 2017: 0.2m movement intheinvestment held at fair value through other comprehensive income and a 0.2m impact on equity.
e Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse market movements caused by active trading positions taken in interest rates, foreign exchange markets, bonds and equities.
The Groups corporate policies do not permit it to undertake position taking or trading books of this type and therefore it does not do so.
f Brexit The UKs EU referendum on 23 June 2016 resulted in a decision to leave the EU Brexit.
The Government has so far been unable to negotiate a withdrawal deal with the UK to the satisfaction of the UK Parliament and therefore the UK may leave the EU without a withdrawal agreement on 29 March 2019.
Brexit has led to a significant amount of instability in the UK economy and capital markets over the last 30 months, albeit unemployment levels have remained stable and there has not been any significant impact on the Groups businesses to date.
Despite any potential second order risks of Brexit, the Group has proven resilient during previous economic downturns due to the specialist business models deployed by its divisions which are tailored to serving non-standard customers.
In addition, all four of the Groups businesses Vanquis Bank, Moneybarn, Provident home credit and Satsuma have tightened underwriting over the last two years in advance of a potential weakening in the UK economy.
The Groups only direct exposure to the EU is the home credit operation in the Republic of Ireland.
This represents c. 15% of the home credit business and is, therefore, relatively immaterial to the Group as a whole.
The foreign exchange exposure to the Republic of Ireland operation is hedged through a net investment hedge.
The Group has current committed facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities until May 2020, when the current syndicated bank facility is due to mature, assuming ongoing access to retail deposits to fully fund Vanquis Bank.
No effect is anticipated on Vanquis Banks ability to access retail deposits, although it maintains a minimum operational buffer over its liquid requirements stipulated by the PRA to withstand any short term disruption.
In line with the Groups treasury policy, the Group is in discussions with its lending banks with a view torefinancing the current syndicated revolving bank facility 12 months in advance of its maturity.
The Groups lending banks are predominantly UK based, have supported the Group for many years and have broader relationships through ancillary business such as transactional banking.
In the event of a pro-longed period of market disruption and the closure of debt capital markets, then the Group hasthe ability to manage receivables growth and or dividend flows.
The Group maintains regulatory capital headroom in excess of 50m, in line with the Boards risk appetite.
Despite the need to absorb the continued transitional arrangements of IFRS 9, this headroom, together with the regulatory prescribed buffers, should be sufficient towithstand a potential downturn in economic conditions caused by Brexit.
183 Provident Financial plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2018 Financial statements Capital risk management To support the delivery of the Groups purpose, the Group operates a financial model that is founded on investing in customer-centric businesses offering attractive returns which aligns an appropriate capital structure with the Groups dividend policy and future growth plans.
The minimum amount of regulatory capital held by the Group and Vanquis Bank represents the higher of the PRA imposed requirement, being their respective Total Capital Requirement TCR together with the CRD IV stipulated buffers, and their respective internal assessments of minimum capital requirements based upon an assessment of risks facing the Group.
The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP considers all risks facing the business, including credit, operational, counterparty, conduct, pension and market risks, and assesses the capital requirement for such risks in the event of downside stresses.
The Group and Vanquis Bank continually monitor and assess the internal assessment of minimum regulatory capital requirements.
The minimum regulatory capital requirements of each of the Group and Vanquis Bank reflects the TCR, together with a fixed add-on for the Group in respect of pension risk, and are 25.5% and 24.9% of total risk weighted assets, respectively.
These assessments include: i fully loaded CRD IV buffers of 3.5% of total risk weighted assets comprising the capital conservation buffer 2.5% and counter cyclical buffer 1.0% effective from 1 January 2019: ii the minimum Pillar 1 prescribed requirement of 8.0% of risk weighted assets: and, iii Pillar 2a regulatory capital requirements of 14.0% and 13.4% of total risk weighted assets for the Group and Vanquis Bank, respectively.
The Board expects to maintain a suitable level of headroom in excess of 50m against this requirement to provide mitigation against the ongoing recovery of the Group, the regulatory backdrop and to support ongoing access to funding from the bank and debt capital markets.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments was effective from 1 January 2018 resulting in a reduction in receivables of 238.1m at 31 December 2017, which net of deferred tax, resulted in a reduction in net assets of 184.0m.
The regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9 will be phased in on a transitional basis over five years, as follows: 5% was taken at the start of 2018 9m, 15% taken on 1 January 2019 18m, 30% in 2020 28m, 50% in 2021 37m, 75% in 2022 46m and 100% from the start of 2023 46m.
The Groups future capital generation, together with the minimum dividend cover ofat least 1.4 times as the home credit business recovers and moves into profitability, will be managed to absorb the transitional impact of IFRS 9.
