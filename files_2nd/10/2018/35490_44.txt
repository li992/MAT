Risk management The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are i market risk comprising interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk, ii liquidity risk and iii credit risk.
Market risk The fair value of or future cash flows from a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.
The Company is exposed to gearing risk which has the effect of exacerbating market falls and gains.
Short term gearing is represented by a 50 million Revolving Credit Facility which is due to terminate on 31 January 2019.
At 31 August 2018 25,500,000 had been drawn down at a rate of 1.4116% and matured on 11 September 2018.
At the date of this Report, 25,500,000 has been rolled over at an interest rate of 1.521% until maturity on 12 November 2018.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions.
Interest risk profile The interest rate risk profile of the portfolio of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, excluding equity holdings which are all non-interest bearing, at the reporting date was as follows: Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate At 31 August 2018 Years % 000 000 Assets Hong Kong Dollar 153 Sterling 4,159 Taiwanese Dollar 3 Vietnamese Dollar 4,460 Total assets n a n a 8,775 Liabilities Bank loan 0.42 1.41 25,500 56 Annual Report 2018 Weighted average Weighted period for which average Fixed Floating rate is fixed interest rate rate rate At 31 August 2017 Years % 000 000 Assets Chinese Yuan 2 Indian Rupee 3,261 Singapore Dollar 485 Sterling 0.10 5,321 Taiwanese Dollar 3 Vietnamese Dollar 215 Total assets n a n a 9,287 Liabilities 3.5% Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 2018 0.42 3.50 44,415 The weighted average interest rate is based on the current yield of each asset, weighted by its market value.
The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The Companys equity portfolio and short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above tables.
Interest rate sensitivity Movements in interest rates would not significantly affect net assets attributable to the Companys shareholders and total profit.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Companys investment portfolio is invested in overseas securities and the Statement of Financial Position, therefore, can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
Management of the risk It is not the Companys policy to hedge this risk on a continuing basis but the Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investments with foreign currency borrowings.
The Statement of Comprehensive Income is subject to currency fluctuation arising on dividends paid in foreign currencies.
The Company does not hedge this currency risk.
Other price risk Other price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted investments.
Management of the risk It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular country or sector.
Both the allocation of assets and the stock selection process, as detailed on page 64, act to reduce market risk.
The Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to review investment strategy.
The investments held by the Company are listed on various stock exchanges worldwide.
Other price risk sensitivity If market prices at the reporting date had been 10% higher or lower while all other variables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 August 2018 would have increased decreased by 80,576,000 2017 increased decreased by 83,975,000 and equity reserves would have increased decreased by the same amount.
Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding requirements 58 Annual Report 2018 if necessary.
In order to monitor the concentration of Dragons investee companies with Aberdeen, the total percentage holdings of those securities owned by Aberdeen-managed funds is reviewed by the Board.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions, and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Board has imposed a maximum gearing level, measured on the most stringent basis of calculation after netting off cash equivalents, of 20%.
Short-term flexibility can be achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities.
Liquidity risk exposure At 31 August 2018, the Company had drawn down 25,500,000 2017 n a from a 50 million Revolving Facility Agreement with Scotiabank Ireland Designated Activity Company, which matured on 11 September 2018 with interest payable at maturity and was subsequently rolled over details of which are disclosed in note 12 on page 53.

Credit risk This is the risk of failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standing is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: the risk of counterparty, including the Depositary, exposure due to failed trades causing a loss to the Company is mitigated by the review of failed trade reports on a daily basis.
In addition, the third party administrators carries out a stock reconciliation to the Depositarys records on a daily basis to ensure discrepancies are picked up on a timely basis.
