Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.
7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is overseen by the risk management committees as explained in principal risks and uncertainties page 44 which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with the Groups trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, gas, the price of coal, sustainable wood fibre and pellets, other fuels and the price of CO emissions allowances.
Price variations and market cycles have 2 historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO emissions allowances when profitable to do so and 2 in line with specified limits under approved policies.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities principally from a number of international sources.
The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges.
The Group applies the own use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 as set out in the accounting policies in notes 7.2 and 7.4.
Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially-settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of power price fluctuations.
The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of its B2B Energy Supply customers and, looking forward following the acquisition of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine CCGT assets at the end of 2018, as a fuel for its gas-fired generation portfolio.
The Group purchases CO emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic 2 and international sources.
All commitments to purchase CO emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash 2 flow hedges as they reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO emissions allowances.
2 Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance sheet date.
The analysis is based on the Groups commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, in the Groups Total Results: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase decrease by 6.6 million 2017: loss after tax would increase decrease by 1.5 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to oil derivatives: and the hedge reserve would increase decrease by 18.9 million 2017: increase decrease by 5.6 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulting from committed and forecast transactions in foreign currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Power Generation business.
These purchases are typically denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euros.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in US dollars see note 4.3.
The Group utilises derivative contracts to manage exchange risk on foreign currency debt.
It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction.
The Group enters into derivative contracts, including forwards and options, to manage its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period.
The Group also has a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc. Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 163 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Foreign currency sensitivity If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, in the Groups Total Results: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2018 would increase decrease by 112.3 million 124.7 million 2017: loss after tax would decrease increase by 351.1 million 285.5 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts: and other equity reserves would decrease increase by 160.6 million 183.6 million 2017: decrease increase by 111.1 million 122.8 million as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to cash and cash equivalents and floating rate debt instruments.
At December 2018 the Group had no floating rate debt instruments drawn.
The Group has taken out a fixed to fixed cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated with the USD $300 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows.
The return generated on the Groups cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility, are also exposed to movements in short-term interest rates.
The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining liquidity.
Information about the Groups instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided in note 4.3.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit after tax and net assets for the year ended 31 December 2018 would decrease increase by 1.0 million 2017: loss after tax would decrease increase by 2.2 million as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period.
Liquidity risk The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items principally those related to ROC sales and B2B Energy Supply power sales.
In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis and accordingly the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale.
As discussed in the financial review on page 34, the Group also utilises standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers on time.
The impact on the Groups cash flows is described in note 4.4.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on the Groups borrowings was 4.56% 2017: 4.38%.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked to market, based on the undiscounted cash flows.
Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date.

If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers.
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 165 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued Credit risk The Groups gross exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: As at 31 December 2018 2017 m m Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 289.0 222.3 Trade and other receivables 413.3 409.3 Other fixed asset investments 2.4 1.3 Derivative financial instruments 510.6 366.2 1,215.3 999.1 Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of 44.0 million 2017: 28.2 million and exclude non-financial receivables such as prepayments.
Of the Groups three operating segments, two are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting the number, size and nature of their respective customers.
The Pellet Production segment only trades intra-group.
The highest risk is in the B2B Energy Supply segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets.
In particular, Opus Energy carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised largely of smaller retail and commercial entities.
In the B2B Energy Supply segment, credit risk is managed by checking a companys creditworthiness and financial strength both before commencing trade and during the business relationship.
Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector.
In addition the B2B Energy Supply segment extended its trade credit insurance programme to increase its mitigation to credit risk.
For the Power Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as sale of byproducts from generation activities.
Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved limits.
The Group uses master netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist.
In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral and letters of credit.
The majority of the Generation businesss credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions.
In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value of those funds within Board-approved policies.
These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves, plus net debt.
Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in note 4.2.
As at 31 December 2017 2018 Restated m m Borrowings 608.1 589.7 Cash and cash equivalents 289.0 222.3 Net debt 319.1 367.4 Total shareholders equity, excluding hedge and cost of hedging reserves 1,580.0 1,634.7 166 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO emissions allowances to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial forward 2 and option contracts principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives to fix sterling cash flows.
We hold these contracts to manage key risks facing the business, including commodity price risk and foreign currency risk see note 7.1.
A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to the Groups business model.
Our policy is to fix exposures to commodity price movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above.
This strategy aims to fide-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future.
As at 31 December 2018, the fair value of our forward derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies principally for the purpose of fixing the sterling cost of sustainable biomass purchases, increased to 359.0 million 2017: 160.0 million.
Accounting policy At the balance sheet date all contracts subject to certain exemptions described below must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS see note 7.4.
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting.
This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO emissions allowances 2 and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve note 7.4 to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met.
The Group enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges, regardless of whether the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met.
To ensure these derivatives are not reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are excluded from the Adjusted Results in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.
The location in the consolidated financial statements of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in the current and previous year is summarised in the table below: Gains losses Gains losses on contracts on contracts Accounting treatment in 2017 for gains losses in the in 2018 Restated consolidated financial Accounting for derivative contracts m m statements Commodity contracts Power 16.3 3.8 Hedge reserve Coal from international sources 0.4 0.8 Income statement Coal from domestic sources n a n a Own-use exemption Biomass n a n a Own-use exemption CO emissions allowances 6.9 11.0 Hedge reserve 2 Gas 10.0 0.1 Income statement Financial contracts Foreign currency exchange contracts 35.0 255.4 Income statement 39.3 20.8 Cost of hedging 79.7 225.6 Hedge reserve Financial coal 1.5 12.9 Income statement 16.5 1.5 Hedge reserve Financial oil and other financial products 12.3 66.3 Income statement Cross currency interest rate swap 5.1 Hedge reserve Total net gains losses in hedge reserve 91.5 209.3 Total net gain in cost of hedging 39.3 20.8 Total net gains losses in income statement 38.4 176.9 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 167 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Significant estimation uncertainty The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates.
The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model.
Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions about volatility based on historical movements.
The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
Fair value accounting Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO emissions allowances, financial 2 coal, financial oil, gas collectively Commodity contracts and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value as follows: As at 31 December 2018 As at 31 December 2017 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Commodity contracts: Less than one year 66.8 72.7 60.5 79.3 More than one year but not more than two years 24.2 30.5 8.4 14.4 More than two years 2.5 2.5 0.5 1.1 Financial contracts: Less than one year 148.6 16.7 115.0 30.3 More than one year but not more than two years 138.6 9.2 85.5 20.0 More than two years 101.9 19.8 96.3 58.7 Cross currency interest rate swap 27.9 Total 510.6 151.4 366.2 203.8 Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts 26.8 33.0 8.9 15.5 Financial contracts 240.5 29.0 181.8 78.7 Cross currency interest rate swap 27.9 Total non-current portion 295.2 62.0 190.7 94.2 Current portion 215.4 89.4 175.5 109.6 The total increase in the fair value of these contracts of 196.8 million 2017: 365.4 million reduction is recognised in the income statement, cost of hedging or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are met, as follows: Years ended 31 December 2018 2017 m m Total net gains losses income statement note 7.2 38.4 176.9 Total net gain in cost of hedging reserve note 7.5 39.3 20.8 Total net gains losses in hedge reserve note 7.4 91.5 209.3 Other movements on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at total operating profit note 7.4 27.6 Total gains losses on derivative contracts 196.8 365.4 The Group maintains a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in foreign currencies.
The vast majority of fuel purchases, and therefore currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US dollars.
The unrealised gains reflect the weakening of sterling against the US dollar in the year.
A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IFRS 9 and thus the gains on these contracts were recognised in the income statement.
Unrealised gains or losses recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains or losses on the portion of forward currency exchange contracts that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9.
168 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Fair value measurement Commodity contracts fair value The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Other financial contracts fair value The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives.
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
IFRS requires categorisation of our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on which their fair values have been determined: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price: therefore, these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
7.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising from operations.
Fair value Cash and cash equivalents note 4.2, trade and other receivables note 3.5 and trade and other payables note 3.7 generally have a short time to maturity.
For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value.
The Groups borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield loan notes and amounts drawn against term loans, see note 4.3.
The financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost.
The terms of the instruments have been reviewed for the existence of embedded derivatives.
The 2022 fixed rate loan notes and the 2025 USD loan notes both contain an early repayment option that meets the definition of an embedded derivative.
However, in both cases, these have not been separated as they are deemed to be closely related to the host contract.
At 31 December 2018, the fair value of the loan notes was 4.6 million and in excess of the carrying value of 574.3 million based on quoted market prices.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 169 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.4 HEDGE RESERVE The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.
Hedge reserve 2017 2018 Restated m m At 1 January 126.1 305.4 Gains losses recognised: Commodity contracts 8.4 1.5 Financial contracts 149.8 161.9 Cross currency interest rate swap 27.9 Released from equity: Commodity contracts 1.9 14.8 Financial contracts 69.9 73.6 Cross currency interest rate swap 22.8 Related deferred tax, net note 2.6 17.7 39.9 At 31 December 199.9 126.1 Commodity contracts and financial contracts are released from equity to revenue or cost of sales in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the cross currency interest rate swap are released to interest costs.
The Groups cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts principally commitments to sell power and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract.
Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss.
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.
For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised.
Further information about the Groups accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.
Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released to the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs.
No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the year 2017: Nil.
Due to the nature of the hedge relationships, the movement in value for the hedged items and hedging instruments are comparable.
The expected release profile from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows: As at 31 December 2018 Within 1 year 12 years 2 years Total m m m m Commodity contracts 2.7 3.6 0.5 6.8 Financial contracts 67.0 91.2 56.7 214.9 Cross currency interest rate swap 21.8 21.8 69.7 94.8 35.4 199.9 As at 31 December 2017 Within 1 year 12 years 2 years Total m m m m Commodity contracts 2.3 1.7 0.6 Financial contracts 40.0 39.9 45.6 125.5 42.3 38.2 45.6 126.1 170 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information 7.5 COST OF HEDGING RESERVE On transition to IFRS 9, the Group has elected to allocate unrealised gains and losses on the forward rate of foreign currency derivative contracts to a new cost of hedging reserve.
The prior year amounts have been restated and a reconciliation is provided in note 8.3.
A large proportion of the derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and swaps.
Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Groups cash flow hedge relationships.
As part of the transition to IFRS 9, an election was made to designate the cost of hedging being the change in fair value associated with forward points including currency basis to equity.
This change in policy has been applied retrospectively.
As a result, the Groups loss on initial application has decreased and the corresponding increase was taken through equity to a new cost of hedging reserve.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated currency.
Cost of hedging 2017 2018 Restated m m At 1 January 40.7 57.5 Gains losses recognised: Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 24.8 19.8 Released from equity: Forward foreign currency exchange contracts 14.5 1.0 Related deferred tax, net note 2.6 7.5 4.0 At 31 December 8.9 40.7 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are released to cost of sales in the income statement.
The expected release profile from equity of post-tax cost of hedging gains and losses is as follows: As at 31 December 2018 Within 1 year 12 years 2 years Total m m m m Financial contracts 3.0 11.9 6.0 8.9 7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control of the Group.
The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Capacity market suspension On 15 November 2018 the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union found in favour of a claim against the European Commission, annulling the Commissions State aid approval of the UK Capacity Market.
This ruling imposed a standstill period on the Capacity Market, with payments under existing contracts and future capacity auctions suspended indefinitely until re-approval.
Following this ruling, the Group ceased to accrue capacity market income in Power Generation.
Any revenue up to 30 September was received, but from this date no amounts have been recognised.
The Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills BEIS has indicated its intent, in a consultation document dated 19 December 2018, to work with the European Commission to achieve a reinstatement of the Capacity Market as soon as possible.
Furthermore, BEIS has indicated that, upon reinstatement, it expects to make back payments to Generators who have complied with their capacity agreements during the standstill period.
At the date of signing these accounts the Group has complied with its capacity obligations in full.
However, reinstatement remains conditional upon EU State aid re-approval and accordingly at the date of these accounts remains uncertain.
If the capacity market is reinstated and payments are backdated, the Group will receive income of 7 million in respect of payments due to the Power Generation business which would become payable in respect of the year ended 31 December 2018.
As disclosed in note 5.1, should 100% of the contracted Capacity Market payments for the Acquired Generation Business not be received in respect of the period 1 January to 30 September 2019, a risk sharing mechanism may result in further payments being made either to or from the Group in respect of the acquisition.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2018 171 SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT continued 7.6 CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES continued Guarantees In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group.
As at 31 December 2018, the Groups contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to 31.8 million 2017: 35.7 million.
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to 63.7 million 2017: 41.3 million.
Guaranteed Minimum Pension The Group has previously disclosed a contingent liability in respect of the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP.
