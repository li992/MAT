Compulsory Purchase Orders VIABILITY STATEMENT The Directors have considered the prospects of the Group over a three-year period to December 2021.
The Directors have determined that the three-year period to December 2021 is an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement as it is the period covered by the latest business plan which takes into account the Groups current position, individual asset performance forecasts and the potential impact of the principal risks disclosed on pages 17-19.
In making their assessment, the Directors have taken account of the Groups robust and flexible balance sheet position with a loan to value ratio well below the 40 per cent limit set, substantial cash and available facilities, the Groups ability to raise new finance and the flexibility of future development expenditure.
The business plan considers the Groups cash flow, capital commitments, financial resources, debt covenants and other key financial risks.
All of the Groups risks could have an impact on viability.
The Directors consider the key principal risks that could impact the viability of the Group to be economic conditions, funding and leasing.
A sensitivity analysis was carried out which involved flexing anumber of the main assumptions to consider alternative macro-economic conditions, both positive and negative.
In particular the Group considered an economic downturn scenario with conditions equivalent to that of the 2007-2009 financial crisis leading to asset value and rental income decline, as well as rising interest rates.
Additional scenarios were reviewed including stress testing the Groups financing covenants, for instance based on the parameters set out in the Bank of England Financial Stability Report issued in November 2018, and increasing the Groups exposure to development activity.
This analysis was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of the Groups principal risks actually occurring and based on the results the Directors believe that the Group iswell-placed to manage its principal risks successfully.
This assessment has considered the potential impacts of these risks on the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company will be able to continue in operation and meet their liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2021.
In making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group, taking account of its current position, the risk appetite, the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.
