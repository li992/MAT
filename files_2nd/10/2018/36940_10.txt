Failure to continuously maintain operational processes and systems as well as to recruit and or retain qualified personnel could adversely impact products availability and patient health, and ultimately the Groups operational financial performance.
Additionally, an ever-evolving regulatory, political and technological landscape requires that we have the right priorities, capabilities and structures in place to execute successfully on our business strategy and adapt to this changing environment.
Anexample of this evolving landscape is Brexit decision for the UK to leave the EU, which creates uncertainties andimpacts various areas of the Group, including Operations, Regulatory, Supply Chain, and Quality.
