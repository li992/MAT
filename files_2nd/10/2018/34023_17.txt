Descriptions of terminology can be found in the glossary, available at home.
Summary of performance in the period Credit impairment charges decreased 37% to 1,468m primarily driven by single name recoveries, updates to consensus-based macroeconomic forecasts in the UK and US during the year, the non-recurrence of single name charges in 2017, portfolio adjustments as IFRS 9 has continued to embed and the impact of repositioning the US cards portfolio towards a lower risk mix.
This decrease was partially offset by a 150m specific charge for the impact of anticipated economic uncertainty in the UK.

Maximum exposure and effects of netting, collateral and risk transfer Basis of preparation The following tables present a reconciliation between the maximum exposure and the net exposure to credit risk, reflecting the financial effects of risk mitigation reducing the exposure.
For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, maximum exposure to credit risk represents the balance sheet carrying value after allowance for impairment.
For offbalance sheet guarantees, the maximum exposure is the maximum amount that the Barclays Group would have to pay if the guarantees were to be called upon.
For loan and other credit related commitments, the maximum exposure is the full amount of the committed facilities.

The Barclays Group mitigates the credit risk to which it is exposed through netting and set-off, collateral and risk transfer.
Further detail on the Barclays Groups policies to each of these forms of credit enhancement is presented on pages 160 to 162 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2018 unaudited.
Overview As at 31 December 2018, the Barclays Groups net exposure to credit risk, after taking into account credit risk mitigation, increased 2% to 807.4bn.
Overall, the extent to which the Barclays Group holds mitigation against its total exposure remains unchanged at 43% 2017: 43%.
Of the unmitigated on balance sheet exposure, a significant portion relates to cash held at central banks, cash collateral and settlement balances, and debt securities issued by governments all of which are considered to be lower risk.
Increases in trading portfolio assets and financial assets at fair value through the income statement have driven the increase in the Barclays Groups net exposure to credit risk.
Trading portfolio liability positions, which to a significant extent economically hedge trading portfolio assets but which are not held specifically for risk management purposes, are excluded from the analysis.
The credit quality of counterparties to derivatives, financial investments and wholesale loan assets are predominantly investment grade and there are no significant changes from prior year.
Further analysis on the credit quality of assets is presented on pages 166 to 169.
Where collateral has been obtained in the event of default, the Barclays Group does not, ordinarily, use such assets for its own operations and they are usually sold on a timely basis.

b Impairment release of 125m on loan commitments and financial guarantees represents a reduction in impairment allowance of 149m partially offset by exchange and other adjustments of 24m.
Gross exposure on loans and advances at amortised cost has increased by 8.9bn in 2018 driven by Stage 1 increases due to: Growth in Barclays UK Home Loans portfolio of 4.6bn Increased lending in Portfolio Management, Equity derivatives and Equity financing in Barclays International of 6.6bn Balance sheet growth and currency exchange movements in US Cards of 2.5bn New securities for the liquidity asset buffer in the UK Service Company of 2.3bn and 1.0bn in Barclays International, offset by the disposal of a long dated liquidity buffer portfolio of UK gilts totalling 5.1bn, reduction in Corporate lending of 2.5bn and continued repayments on Italian Mortgages of 1.0bn.
Net transfers between stages represents the movements of positions from, for example, Stage 1 to Stage 2 following a Significant Increase in Credit Risk SICR or to Stage 3 as positions move into default.
Equally, improvement in credit quality will result in positions moving to lower stages.
These are the primary driver for the changes in impairment allowance and the income statement charge.
The improvement in PDs and macroeconomic variables during 2018 resulted in net exposures moving from Stage 2 into Stage 1.
The transfers into Stage 3 was from defaulted assets moving mainly from Stage 2.
Disposals includes the sale of a long dated liqudity buffer portfolio of UK gilts and debt sale activity.
Write-offs represent the gross asset write down during the period.
The impairment allowance decreased by 332m in the period.
This is due to a net reduction in Barclays International predominantly from write-offs and a positive impact of macroeconomic variables changes during the year, offset by a 150m charge in UK Cards and UK Corporate loans from anticipated economic uncertainty in the UK.
Credit quality across wholesale portfolios and underlying arrears rates in the retail portfolio have been relatively stable over the period.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis The measurement of ECL involves increased complexity and judgement, including estimation of probabilities of default PD, loss given default LGD, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation of exposures at default EAD and assessing significant increases in credit risk.
Impairment charges will tend to be more volatile than under IAS 39 and will be recognised earlier.
Unsecured products with longer expected lives, such as revolving credit cards, are the most impacted.
Barclays Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL.
An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury, Bloomberg and the Urban Land Institute, which forms the baseline scenario.
In addition, two adverse scenarios Downside 1 and Downside 2 and two favourable scenarios Upside 1 and Upside 2 are derived, with associated probability weightings.
The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a similar severity to internal stress tests, whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity.
Downside 2 is benchmarked to the Bank of Englands annual cyclical scenarios and to the most severe scenario from Moodys inventory, but is not designed to be the same.
The favourable scenarios are calibrated to be symmetric to the adverse scenarios, subject to a ceiling calibrated to relevant recent favourable benchmark scenarios.
The scenarios include six economic core variables, GDP, unemployment and House Price Index HPI in both the UK and US markets, and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations.
All five scenarios converge to a steady state after eight years.
Scenario weights audited The methodology for estimating probability weights for each of the scenarios involves a comparison of the distribution of key historic UK and US macroeconomic variables against the forecast paths of the five scenarios.
The methodology works such that the baseline reflecting current consensus outlook has the highest weight and the weights of adverse and favourable scenarios depend on the deviation from the baseline: the further from the baseline, the smaller the weight.
The probability weights of the scenarios as of 31 December 2018 are shown below.
A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are normalised to equate to 100%.
The same scenarios and weights that are used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used for Barclays internal planning purposes.
The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices and base rates, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment.
The table below shows the core macroeconomic variables for each scenario and the respective scenario weights.

c 5-year cumulative growth in Upside scenarios: 5-year average in Baseline: cumulative fall peak-to-trough in Downside scenarios.
Over the year, the macroeconomic baseline variables improved in the US economic outlook, notably HPI.
The UK macroeconomic baseline variables improved slightly overall.
ECL under 100% weighted scenarios for key principal portfolios audited The table on the next page shows the ECL for key principal portfolios assuming scenarios have been 100% weighted.
Gross exposures are allocated to a stage based on the individual scenario rather than through a probability-weighted approach as is required for Barclays reported impairment allowances.
As a result, it is not possible to back solve the weighted ECL from the individual scenarios as a balance may be assigned to a different stage dependent on the scenario.
Material post-model adjustments have been excluded from the below analysis so that the scenario specific results are comparable.
Management adjustments of greater than 10m can be found on page 158.
The key principal portfolios included in the product split below account for circa 80% of total loans and advances at amortised cost and circa 80% of total impairment allowance including off-balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.
Portfolios excluded are those where the risk resides outside of the UK or the US: certain less material portfolios: and exposures where ECL estimation methods are based on benchmark approaches or assigned proxy coverage ratios.
Balances allocated to Stage 3 do not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on observable evidence of default as at 31 December 2018 and not on macroeconomic scenarios.
The Downside 2 scenario represents a severe global recession with substantial falls in both UK and US GDP.
Unemployment in both markets rises towards 9% and there are substantial falls in asset prices including housing.
Under the Downside 2 scenario, balances move between stages as the economic environment weakens.
This can be seen in the movement of 19.0bn of gross exposure into Stage 2 between the Weighted and Downside 2 scenario.
ECL increases in Stage 2 predominantly due to unsecured portfolios as economic conditions deteriorate.

As a result, only the Baseline scenario is shown together with the weighted estimate which reflects alternative recovery paths.
For portfolios in scope, the total weighted ECL represents a 2% uplift from the Baseline ECL, largely driven by credit card losses which have more linear loss profiles than home loans and corporate loan positions.
Home loans: Total ECL and coverage ratios remain steady across the Upside scenarios, Baseline and Downside 1 scenario.
However, total ECL increases significantly in the Downside 2 scenario to 208m, driven by a significant fall in HPI 32.1% reflecting the non-linearity of the portfolio.
The average LTV of the home loans portfolio remains low and as such can withstand a Downside 1 scenario 0.5% fall in HPI without a significant increase in ECL.
Total weighted ECL excludes a 54m model adjustment that is held to maintain appropriate level of ECL.
Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending: Total weighted ECL of 4,568m represents a 1% increase over the Baseline ECL 4,519m reflecting the range of economic scenarios used.
Total ECL increases to 7,051m under Downside 2 scenario, mainly driven by Stage 2, where coverage rates increase by 800bps to 26.4% from a weighted scenario approach 18.4% and a 5,610m increase in gross exposure that meets the SICR criteria and transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
Total weighted ECL excludes model adjustments, including the 100m adjustment for the anticipated economic uncertainty in the UK.
Corporate loans: Total weighted ECL of 831m represents a 6% increase over the Baseline ECL 787m reflecting the range of economic scenarios used, with exposures in the Investment Bank particularly sensitive to Downside 2 scenario.
Cases in Stage 3 are assessed on an individual basis and cases where the Baseline ECL is greater than 10m are also assessed against a less favourable and a more favourable scenario, based on alternative recovery outcomes in addition to macroeconomic scenarios.
Total weighted ECL excludes model adjustments, including the 50m adjustment for the anticipated economic uncertainty in the UK.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Staging sensitivity audited An increase of 1% 3,332m of total gross exposure into Stage 2 from Stage 1, would result in an increase in ECL impairment allowance of 200m based on applying the difference in Stage 2 and Stage 1 average impairment coverage ratios to the movement in gross exposure refer to Loans and advances at amortised cost by product on page 155.
ECL sensitivity analysis The tables on pages 162 and 163 show the estimated ECL impact on key principal portfolios in the event that the UK US consensus was instead for i positive growth Upward scenario : and ii a mild downturn Downward scenario.
These scenarios assume a moderate upturn and downturn for the UK and the US respectively but with no contagion or headwinds in other economies.
The gross exposures in scope are aligned to those presented in the ECL under 100% weighted scenarios sensitivity analysis but based on portfolio positions as at 30 September 2018 due to operational complexity in scenario regeneration.
The portfolios included in the scenario remained broadly stable during Q4 2018 and therefore the scenario results are considered representative of the year end position.
Material post-model adjustments have been excluded from the below analysis to allow the scenario specific results to be comparable.
Further detail on management adjustments to impairment allowances can be found on page 158.
Gross exposures allocated to Stage 3 do not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on observable evidence of default and not on macroeconomic scenarios.
For individual cases with ECL greater than 10m, three scenarios are assessed taking into account the macroeconomic scenarios and alternative recovery strategies.
For these specific cases, the less favourable scenario is assumed to occur in the UK US Downward scenario and the more favourable scenario is assumed to occur in the UK US Upward scenario which is a conservative upper estimate as certain recovery strategies are idiosyncratic in nature and independent of the macroeconomic economy.
Changes to coverage ratios are expressed against the exposures in scope of the sensitivity analysis and not the entire portfolio.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 161 Risk review Risk performance Credit risk ECL sensitivity analysis to UK economic forecasts for key principal portfolios The table below shows the estimated ECL impact on key principal portfolios for both a positive growth Upward scenario and a downturn Downward scenario of UK consensus macroeconomic variables.
The inputs for the Downward scenario have been modelled by replacing the Baseline macroeconomic variables with the Downside 1 variables with no changes to US and other non-UK macroeconomic variables, as highlighted below.
Similarly, the Upward scenario uses Upside 1 UK macroeconomic variables for the Baseline scenario.
The Downside 2, Downside 1, Upside 1 and Upside 2 macroeconomic variables are held constant but the probability weights have been re-calibrated.
Barclays impairment as at 31 December 2018 includes an adjustment of 150m representing a charge for the estimated impact of anticipated economic uncertainty in the UK.
This adjustment was estimated broadly on the output of the UK Downward scenario below.

This represents a greater likelihood of the UK economy entering into a severe downturn than under the current consensus.
Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending: Total ECL decreases by 121m in the Upward scenario driven by 294m of balance migration as assets transition from Stage 2 to Stage 1 and lower coverage on Stage 2 assets driven by the more favourable consensus forecast.
Total ECL increases by 123m in the Downward scenario, mainly driven by the UK cards portfolio.
Corporate loans: Total ECL decreases by 49m in the Upward scenario predominately driven by more favourable recovery outcomes for large single names in Stage 3.
The Downward scenario results in total ECL impact of 48m, driven by higher coverage in Stage 2 and less favourable recovery outcomes for large single names in Stage 3.

Total ECL impact of 157m in Downward scenario, greater than the Upward scenario, driven by non-linearity effects and the relative severity of the Downward scenario.
Corporate loans: Total ECL increases by 98m in the Downward scenario driven by a less favourable recovery outcome for one large single name in Stage 3, where Barclays estimated additional losses of 39m in addition to the loss estimated under the Baseline scenario, and higher coverage in Stage 2 assets driven by the less favourable consensus forecast.
There is a greater impact on coverage ratios Stage 2 in particular than the UK scenarios driven largely by the underlying portfolio quality, with the US portfolio possessing a higher proportion of unsecured leveraged lending.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 163 Risk review Risk performance Credit risk Analysis of the concentration of credit risk A concentration of credit risk exists when a number of counterparties are located in a common geographical region or are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
Barclays Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.
The analyses of credit risk concentrations presented below are based on the location of the counterparty or customer or the industry in which they are engaged.
Geographic concentrations As at 31 December 2018, the geographic concentration of Barclays Groups assets remained broadly consistent with 2017.
barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Industry concentrations The concentration of Barclays Groups assets by industry remained broadly consistent year on year.
As at 31 December 2018, total assets concentrated in banks and other financial institutions was 36% 2017: 36%, predominantly within derivative financial instruments.
The proportion of the overall balance concentrated in governments and central banks was 20% 2017: 20%, cards, unsecured loans and other personal lending was 13% 2017: 13% and in home loans remained stable at 11% 2017: 11%.
Comparatives are based on the regulatory capital point in time probability of default PD.
The following internal measures are used to determine credit quality for loans: Retail and Wholesale lending Credit Quality Default Grade Probability of default Description 1-3 0.0 to 0.05% Strong 4-5 0.05 to 0.15% 6-8 0.15 to 0.30% 9-11 0.30 to 0.60% 12-14 0.60 to 2.15% Satisfactory 15-19 2.15 to 11.35% 20-21 11.35 to 100% Higher Risk 22 100% Credit Impaired For retail clients, a range of analytical tools is used to derive the probability of default of clients at inception and on an ongoing basis.
These credit quality descriptions can be summarised as follows: Strong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.
Satisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, of no cause for concern to the Barclays Group, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to unsecured retail facilities.
At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, mortgages with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.
Higher risk: there is concern over the obligors ability to make payments when due.
However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency.
There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided.
However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.

Stage 1 higher risk assets, presented gross of associated collateral held, are of weaker credit quality but have not significantly deteriorated since origination.
Examples would include leveraged corporate loans or non-prime credit cards.
IFRS 9 Stage 1 and Stage 2 classification is not dependent solely on the absolute probability of default but on elements that determine a Significant Increase in Credit Risk see Note 7 on page 273, including relative movement in probability of default since initial recognition.
There is therefore no direct relationship between credit quality and IFRS 9 stage classification.
Analysis of specific portfolios and asset types This section provides an analysis of principal portfolios and businesses, in particular, home loans, credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending.
Secured home loans The UK home loans portfolio comprises first lien home loans and accounts for 91% 2017: 90% of Barclays Groups total home loan balances.

However, delinquencies remain very low and stable and recovery stock has reduced.
Recovery book coverage rate reduced to 7.1% 2017: 11.2% reflecting the new impairment methodology following the transition to IFRS 9.
Within the UK home loans portfolio: Owner-occupied interest-only home loans comprised 26% 2017: 28% of total balances.
The average balance weighted LTV on these loans decreased to 38.8% 2017: 39.7%.
The 90-day arrears rate excluding recovery book remained steady at 0.3% 2017: 0.3% Buy to Let BTL home loans comprised 12% 2017: 11% of total balances.
The average balance weighted LTV increased to 55.4% 2017: 53.7% driven by the volume of new business written.
Whilst the average balance weighted LTV of new business remained stable during 2018, it is higher than for the existing book and increased the total book average figure as a result.
This increase was partially offset by increases in house prices applied during the second half of the year with positive movements in HPI reported.
The BTL 90-day arrears rate excluding recovery book remained steady at 0.1% 2017: 0.1%.

The Liquidity Framework is delivered via a combination of policy formation, review and governance, analysis, stress testing, limit Liquidity Coverage Ratio setting and monitoring.
This section provides an analysis of the 169% Barclays Groups: i summary of performance, ii liquidity risk stress testing, iii liquidity pool, iv funding structure and funding relationships, v encumbrance, vi credit ratings, and vii contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
For further detail on liquidity risk governance and framework refer to page 176 to 178 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2018 unaudited.
Summary of performance The liquidity pool increased to 227bn December 2017: 220bn driven largely by net deposit growth across businesses.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR increased to 169% December 2017: 154%, equivalent to a surplus of 90bn December 2017: 75bn to 100% regulatory requirement.
The Barclays Group also continued to maintain surpluses to its internal liquidity requirements.
The strong liquidity position reflects the Barclays Groups prudent approach given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty.
During the year, the Barclays Group issued 12.2bn of minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities MREL instruments in a range of tenor and currencies.
Barclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and Barclays Bank UK PLC issued in the shorter term and secured markets, helping to maintain their stable and diversified funding bases.
The overall funding structure has improved further.
Barclays Group has continued to reduce its reliance on short-term wholesale funding, where the proportion maturing in less than one year fell to 30% December 2017: 31%.
Liquidity risk stress testing Under the Liquidity Framework, the Barclays Group has established a liquidity risk appetite LRA together with the appropriate limits for the management of the liquidity risk.
This is the level of liquidity risk the Barclays Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations.
The Barclays Group sets its internal liquidity risk appetite LRA based on internal liquidity risk assessments and, external regulatory requirements namely the CRD IV Delegated Act Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 183 Risk review Risk performance Treasury and capital risk Liquidity Risk Appetite The liquidity risk assessment measures the potential contractual and contingent stress outflows under a range of stress scenarios, which are then used to determine the size of the liquidity pool that is immediately available to meet anticipated outflows if a stress occurs.
As part of the LRA, the Barclays Group runs three short-term liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the PRAs prescribed stresses: 90-day market-wide stress event 30-day Barclays-specific stress event combined 30-day market-wide and Barclays-specific stress event Key LRA assumptions For the year ended 31 December 2018 Drivers of Liquidity risk LRA Combined stress key assumptions Wholesale Secured and Unsecured Zero rollover of maturing wholesale unsecured funding Funding Risk Loss of repo capacity on non-extremely liquid repos at contractual maturity date Roll of repo for extremely liquid repo at wider haircut at contractual maturity date Withdrawal of contractual buy-back obligations, excess client futures margin, Prime Brokerage PB client cash and overlifts Haircuts applied to the market value of marketable assets held in the liquidity buffer Retail and Corporate Funding Risk Retail and Corporate deposit outflows as counterparties seek to diversify their deposit balances Intraday Liquidity Risk Liquidity held against intraday requirements for the settlement of cash and securities under a stress Intra-Group Liquidity Risk Liquidity support for material subsidiaries.

The Barclays Group also runs a long-term liquidity stress test, which measures the anticipated outflows over a 12-month market-wide scenario.
As at 31 December 2018, the Barclays Group remained compliant to this internal metric.
Liquidity regulation The Barclays Group monitors its position against the CRD IV Delegated Act Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR.
The LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a banks liquidity risk profile, by holding sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days.
The NSFR has a time horizon of 12 months and has been developed to promote a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
In October 2014, the BCBS published a standard defining the minimum requirements for the Net Stable Funding Ration NSFR.
The EU is implementing the NSFR regulations as part of the Risk Reduction Measures package, on which political agreement was reached in December 2018.
The regulations are expected to enter into force two years after they are published, which is likely to be around Q2 2021.
Barclays continues to assess the impact of these measures on its NSFR ratio, which remains above the 100% requirement, based on a conservative interpretation of the regulations.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Liquidity coverage ratio The external LCR requirement is prescribed by the regulator taking into account the relative stability of different sources of funding and potential incremental funding requirements in a stress.

The Barclays Group plans to maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory stress requirements at an efficient level, while considering risks to market funding conditions and its liquidity position.
The continuous reassessment of these risks may lead to management actions to resize the liquidity pool.
Liquidity pool The Group liquidity pool as at 31 December 2018 was 227bn 2017: 220bn.
During 2018, the month-end liquidity pool ranged from 207bn to 243bn 2017: 165bn to 232bn, and the month-end average balance was 225bn 2017: 202bn.
The liquidity pool is held unencumbered and is not used to support payment or clearing requirements.
Such requirements are treated as part of our regular business funding.
The liquidity pool is intended to offset stress outflows, and comprises the following cash and unencumbered assets.

In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type.
Given the incremental returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.
As at 31 December 2018, 90% 2017: 93% of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC.
The residual portion of the liquidity pool is held outside of these entities, predominantly in the US subsidiaries, to meet entity-specific stress outflows and regulatory requirements.
To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Barclays Group in calculating the LCR.
barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 185 Risk review Risk performance Treasury and capital risk Contingent liquidity In addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Barclays Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these are not relied on in the Groups LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
In a Barclays-specific, market-wide or combined liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted.
In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at heavily discounted prices, the Barclays Group could generate liquidity via central bank facilities.
The Barclays Group maintains a significant amount of collateral positioned at central banks and available to raise funding.
For more detail on the Barclays Groups other unencumbered assets, see pages 188 to 190.
Funding structure and funding relationships The basis for sound liquidity risk management is a solid funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due.
The Barclays Groups overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base geographically, by type and by counterparty and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.
Within this, the Barclays Group aims to align the sources and uses of funding.
As such, retail and corporate loans and advances are largely funded by customer deposits in the relevant entities, with the surplus primarily funding the liquidity pool.
Other assets, together with other loans and advances, are funded by wholesale debt and equity.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements.
Derivative liabilities and assets are largely matched.
A substantial proportion of balance sheet derivative positions qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset once netted against cash collateral received and paid.
These funding relationships are summarised below: b b 2018 2017 2018 2017 Assets bn bn Liabilities bn bn Loans and advances at amortised cost 327 324 Deposits at amortised cost 395 399 Group liquidity pool 227 220 1 Year wholesale funding 47 45 1 Year wholesale funding 107 99 a Other assets 53 47 Equity and other liabilities 102 79 Reverse repurchase agreements, trading Repurchase agreements, trading portfolio portfolio assets, cash collateral and liabilities, cash collateral and settlement settlement balances 303 304 balances 262 273 Derivative financial instruments 223 238 Derivative financial instruments 220 238 Total assets 1,133 1,133 Total liabilities 1,133 1,133 Notes a Other assets include fair value assets that are not part of reverse repurchase agreements or trading portfolio assets, and other asset categories.

Comparatives have been updated based on this approach.
As at 31 December 2018, 172bn 2017: 175bn of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS and other similar schemes.
In addition to these customer deposits 5bn 2017: 4bn of other liabilities are insured by other governments.
Contractually current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice.
In practise, their observed maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity.
Similarly, repayment profiles of certain types of assets e. g. mortgages, overdrafts and credit card lending, differ from their contractual profiles.
The Barclays Group therefore assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer assets and liabilities to identify structural balance sheet funding gaps.
In doing so, it applies quantitative modelling and qualitative assessments which take into account historical experience, current customer composition, and macroeconomic projections.
The Barclays Groups broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances and hence provide a stable funding base for the Barclays Groups operations and liquidity needs.

barclays annualreport Strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Wholesale funding Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group maintain access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, short-term funding markets and repo markets.
Barclays Bank Group has direct access to US, European and Asian capital markets through its global investment banking operations and to long-term investors through its clients worldwide.
Key sources of wholesale funding include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, medium-term issuances including structured notes and securitisations.
Key sources of wholesale funding for Barclays Bank UK Group include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, covered bonds and other securitisations.
Barclays Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt from Barclays PLC the Parent company, in order to maintain compliance with indicative MREL requirements and maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and market.
As at 31 December 2018, Barclays Groups total wholesale funding outstanding excluding repurchase agreements was 154.0bn 2017: 143.7bn, of which 22.5bn 2017: 20.3bn was secured funding and 131.5bn 2017: 123.4bn unsecured funding.
Unsecured funding includes 47.3bn 2017: 44.8bn of privately placed senior unsecured notes issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.
During the year, Barclays Group issued 12.2bn of minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities MREL instruments from Barclays PLC the Parent company in a range of different currencies and tenors.
As at 31 December 2018, wholesale funding of 46.7bn 2017: 44.9bn matures in less than one year, of which 19.1bn 2017: 13.8bn relates to term funding.
Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded the wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by 180bn 2017: 163bn.
Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group also support various central bank monetary initiatives including participation in the Bank of Englands Term Funding Scheme.
These are reported under repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing on the balance sheet.
b Term funding comprises public benchmark and privately placed senior unsecured notes, covered bonds, asset backed securities ABS and subordinated debt where the original maturity of the instrument was more than one year.
c Includes structured notes of 35.7bn, 6.2bn of which matures within one year.

Encumbrance Asset encumbrance arises from collateral pledged against secured funding and other collateralised obligations.
Barclays funds a portion of trading portfolio assets and other securities via repurchase agreements and other similar borrowing, and pledges a portion of loans and advances as collateral in securitisation, covered bond and other similar secured structures.
Barclays monitors the mix of secured and unsecured funding sources and seeks to efficiently utilise available collateral to raise secured funding and meet other collateral requirements.
Encumbered assets have been defined consistently with the Barclays Groups reporting requirements under Article 100 of the CRR.
Securities and commodities assets are considered encumbered when they have been pledged or used to secure, collateralise or credit enhance a transaction which impacts their transferability and free use.
This includes external repurchase or other similar agreements with market counterparties.
Excluding assets positioned at central banks, as at 31 December 2018, 165.9bn 2017: 193.2bn of the Barclays Groups assets were encumbered, primarily due to firm financing of trading portfolio assets, posting of cash collateral, funding secured against loans and advances, and other assets at fair value.
Assets may also be encumbered under secured funding arrangements with central banks.
In advance of such encumbrance, assets are often positioned with central banks to facilitate efficient future draw down.
78.6bn 2017: 70.0bn of on-balance sheet assets were positioned at the central banks, consisting of encumbered assets and collateral available for use in secured financing transactions.
350.6bn 2017: 341.9bn of onand off-balance sheet assets not positioned at the central banks were identified as readily available assets for use in secured financing transactions.
Additionally, they include cash and securities held in the Barclays Groups liquidity pool as well as unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity.
While these additional assets are not relied upon in the Barclays Groups liquidity pool, a portion of these assets may be monetised to generate liquidity through use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.
Loans and advances to customers are only classified as readily available if they are already in a form, such that, they can be used to raise funding without further management actions.
This includes excess collateral already in secured funding vehicles.
216.3bn 2017: 198.0bn of assets not positioned at the central banks were identified as available as collateral.
These assets are not subject to any restrictions on their ability to secure funding, to be offered as collateral, or to be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, but are not immediately available in the normal course of business in their current form.
They primarily consist of loans and advances which would be suitable for use in secured funding structures but are conservatively classified as not readily available because they are not in a transferable form.
Not available as collateral consists of assets that cannot be pledged or used as security for funding due to restrictions that prevent their pledge or use as security for funding in the normal course of business.
Derivatives and reverse repos are shown separately as these on-balance sheet assets cannot be pledged.
However, these assets can give rise to the receipt of non-cash assets which are held off-balance sheet, and can be used to raise secured funding or meet additional funding requirements.
In addition, 529.0bn 2017: 547.6bn of the total 598.3bn 2017: 608.4bn securities accepted as collateral, and held off-balance sheet, were on-pledged, the significant majority of which related to matched-book activity where reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder relates primarily to reverse repurchase agreements used to settle trading portfolio liabilities as well as collateral posted against derivatives margin requirements.

Assets within this category that have been encumbered are disclosed as assets pledged in Note 38 to the financial statements on page 342.
Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements Barclays enters into repurchase and other similar secured borrowing agreements to finance its trading portfolio assets.
The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by offsetting repurchase agreements entered into to facilitate client activity.
The remainder are used to settle trading portfolio liabilities.
Due to the high quality of collateral provided against secured financing transactions, the liquidity risk associated with this activity is significantly lower than unsecured financing transactions.
Nonetheless, Barclays manages to gross and net secured mismatch limits to limit refinancing risk under a severe stress scenario and a portion of the Barclays Groups liquidity pool is held against stress outflows on these positions.
The Barclays Group secured mismatch limits are calibrated based on market capacity, liquidity characteristics of the collateral and risk appetite of the Barclays Group.
The cash value of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions will typically differ from the market value of the collateral against which these transactions are secured by an amount referred to as a haircut or .
Typical haircut levels vary depending on the quality of the collateral that underlies these transactions.
For transactions secured against extremely liquid fixed income collateral, lenders demand relatively small haircuts typically ranging from 0-2%.
For transactions secured against less liquid collateral, haircuts vary by asset class typically ranging from 5-10% for corporate bonds and other less liquid collateral.
As at 31 December 2018, the significant majority of repurchase activity related to matched-book activity.
The Barclays Group may face refinancing risk on the net maturity mismatch for matched-book activity.

In December 2018, both entities were upgraded by one notch to A due to the sufficient amount of junior debt both entities hold, referred to as qualifying junior debt QJD.
Barclays PLC continues to be rated A on stable outlook.
Barclays also solicits issuer ratings from R&I and the ratings of Afor Barclays PLC and A for Barclays Bank PLC were affirmed in July 2018 with stable outlooks.
A credit rating downgrade could result in outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts.
Outflows related to credit rating downgrades are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk.
Credit ratings downgrades could also result in reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs.
The contractual collateral requirement following oneand two-notch long-term and associated short-term downgrades across all credit rating agencies, would result in outflows of 5bn and 6bn respectively, and are fully reserved for in the liquidity pool.
These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements.
These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity.
However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.

Average UK leverage ratio 4.5% Summary of performance in the period Barclays continues to be in excess of minimum transitional and fully loaded capital requirements, and regulatory minimum leverage requirements.
The CET1 ratio ended the year at 13.2% December 2017: 13.3%, at our end state target of c. 13%.
CET1 capital decreased 0.5bn to 41.1bn , was more than offset by 2.1bn of litigation and conduct charges as the Barclays Group resolved legacy matters, 1.7bn for ordinary dividends and Additional Tier 1 coupons paid and foreseen, 1.0bn from the redemption of capital instruments and 0.5bn of pensions contributions.
RWAs remained broadly stable at 311.9bn December 2017: 313.0bn.
The Barclays Group continued to actively manage capital allocation to businesses during the year, including the redeployment of RWAs within CIB to higher returning businesses and clients, while targeting growth in selected consumer businesses in Barclays UK and Consumer, Cards and Payments.
Within Barclays UK, the increase in RWAs included the impact of a change in the regulatory methodology for the Education, Social Housing and Local Authority ESHLA portfolio which was partly offset by a  deconsolidation of Barclays Africa Group Limited BAGL.

barclays annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2018 197 Risk review Risk performance Treasury and capital risk Regulatory minimum capital requirements Barclays fully loaded CET1 regulatory requirement is 11.7% comprising a 4.5% Pillar 1 minimum, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer CCB, a 1.5% Global Systemically Important Institution G-SII buffer, a 2.7% Pillar 2A requirement applicable from 1 January 2019, and a 0.5% Countercyclical Capital Buffer CCyB.
The CCB and the G-SII buffer, determined by the PRA in line with guidance from the Financial Stability Board FSB, are subject to phased implementation at 25% per annum from 2016 with full effect from 2019.
The CCB has been set at 2.5% with 1.9% applicable for 2018.
The Barclays CCyB is based on the buffer rate applicable for each jurisdiction in which Barclays has exposures.
On 28 November 2018, the Financial Policy Committee FPC increased the CCyB rate for UK exposures from 0.5% to 1%.
The buffer rates set by other national authorities for our non-UK exposures are not currently material.
Overall, this results in a 0.5% CCyB for Barclays for Q418.

Regulatory minimum leverage requirements Barclays is subject to a leverage ratio requirement that is implemented on a phased basis, with a transitional requirement of 3.8% as at 31 December 2018: this comprised the 3.25% minimum requirement, a transitional G-SII additional leverage ratio buffer G-SII ALRB of 0.39% and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer CCLB of 0.2%.
Although the leverage ratio is expressed in terms of T1 capital, 75% of the minimum requirement, equating to 2.4375%, needs to be met with CET1 capital.
In addition, the G-SII ALRB and CCLB must be covered solely with CET1 capital.
The CET1 capital held against the 0.39% transitional G-SII ALRB was 4.4bn and the 0.2% CCLB was 2.2bn.
The fully loaded UK leverage requirement is expected to be 4.0%.

c The T1 capital is calculated in line with the PRA Handbook, which excludes grandfathered AT1 instruments allowed under the CRR.
d The average UK leverage exposure as at 31 December 2017 was calculated based on the last day of each month in the quarter.
The leverage exposure movements included: loans and advances and other assets increased 12bn to 741bn primarily driven by growth in the UK mortgage portfolio  financingbusiness regulatory consolidation adjustments decreased 10bn primarily driven by the regulatory deconsolidation of BAGL.
The average UK leverage ratio decreased to 4.5% December 2017: 4.9% partially driven by the change to the daily exposure measure.
Average UK leverage exposures increased due to higher trading activity in SFTs and trading portfolio assets, as well as a decrease in average Tier 1 capital.
The difference between the average UK leverage ratio and the UK leverage ratio was primarily driven by lower trading portfolio assets, settlement exposures and SFT exposures at quarter end.
Barclays is required to disclose a CRR leverage ratio.

Banking book transactional foreign exchange risk outside of Barclays International is monitored on a daily basis by the market risk function and minimised by the businesses.
b Translational foreign exchange exposure The Barclays Groups investments in overseas subsidiaries and branches create capital resources denominated in foreign currencies, principally USD and EUR.
Changes in the GBP value of the net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital.
The Barclays Groups strategy is to minimise the volatility of the capital ratios caused by foreign exchange movements, by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the Barclays Groups foreign currency RWA exposures.

During 2017 and 2018 the net improvement in the IAS 19 position was largely driven by bank contributions and credit spreads widening.
Changes from other market levels, in particular equity prices and interest rates, were offset by updates to demographic assumptions.

Risk measurement In line with Barclays risk management framework the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility .
Thisenablestherisks,  and investments to be adequately captured.
VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis.
Risks are reviewed and reported regularly at forums including the Board Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee, the Pensions Management Group and the Pension Executive Board.
The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities on an IAS 19 basis see Note 33.
The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.
The pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are reviewed regularly.
See Note 33 for more details.
In addition, the impact of pension risk to Barclays Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process.
Stress testing is performed internally on at least an annual basis.
The UKRF exposure is also included as part of regulatory stress tests.

An IAS 19 surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders equity: however, it is deducted for the purposes of determining CET1 capital .
These may or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of Barclays Group at the particular time.
Pension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually.
The Pillar 2A requirement forms part of Barclays Groups overall regulatory minimum requirement for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital.

The MREL requirements will be phased in from 1 January 2019 and will be fully implemented by 1 January 2022, at which time G-SIBs with resolution entities incorporated in the UK, including Barclays, will be required to meet an MREL equivalent to the higher of either: i two times the sum of its Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements or: ii the higher of two times its leverage ratio requirement or 6.75% of leverage exposures.
However, the PRA will review the MREL calibration by the end of 2020, including assessing the proposal for Pillar 2A recapitalisation which may drive a different 1 January 2022 MREL requirement than currently proposed.
In addition, it is proposed that CET1 capital cannot be counted towards both MREL and the combined buffer requirement CBR, meaning that the CBR will effectively be applied above both the Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements relating to own funds and MREL.

Movements in the FVOCI reserve would impact CET1 capital, however the movement in the cash flow hedge reserve would not impact CET1 capital.
Volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool Changes in value of FVOCI exposures flow directly through capital via the FVOCI reserve.
The volatility of the value of the FVOCI investments in the liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i. e. the non-traded market risk VaR.
Although the underlying methodology to calculate the non-traded VaR is identical to the one used in traded management VaR, the two measures are not directly comparable.
The non-traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the FVOCI exposures.
These exposures are in the banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.
