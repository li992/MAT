The Groups on-balance sheet maximum exposure to credit risk increased by $27 billion to $667 billion 1 January 2018: $640 billion.
This was driven by a $10 billion increase in investment securities as the Group further strengthened its portfolio of high-quality liquid assets, as well as a $9 billion increase in reverse repos held at fair value through profit or loss primarily in the UK.
Investment securities held at fair value through profit or loss increased by $1.8 billion as a result of deployment of funds in better quality assets.
Further, other assets increased by $2.8 billion mainly driven by cash collateral and unsettled trades due to settlement timing differences.

The proportion of financial instruments held within stage 1 increased to 92 per cent, compared with 90 per cent at 1 January 2018.
This increase was primarily within Corporate & Institutional Banking loans and advances where the proportion of stage 1 loans rated as Strong has increased from 58 per cent to 62 per cent.
The proportion of stage 2 financial instruments decreased to 7 per cent from 8 per cent at 1 January 2018, primarily from reductions in loans and advances and undrawn commitments.
This was largely due to an improvement in the credit quality of the Corporate & Institutional Banking portfolio.
Loans held on non-purely precautionary early alert in the Corporate & Institutional Banking and Commercial Banking portfolios declined by $3.9 billion as accounts repaid or regularised.
Loans classed as Higher risk increased by 4 per cent primarily within the Commercial Banking segment.
The stage 2 cover ratio declined to 2.4 per cent from 2.8 per cent at 1 January 2018 primarily due to improved credit quality together with more high-quality collateral.
The proportion of instruments classied as stage 3 declined by $1.6 billion.
This was driven by a combination of repayments, debt sales, write-offs and upgrades within loans and advances to customers.
The stage 3 cover ratio excluding collateral declined from 60 per cent to 59 per cent over the same period but remained stable including collateral.

All loans are assigned a CG, which is reviewed periodically and amended in light of changes in the borrowers circumstances or behaviour.
CGs 1 to 12 are assigned to stage 1 and stage 2 performing clients or accounts, while CGs 13 and 14 are assigned to stage 3 non-performing or defaulted clients.
The mapping of credit quality is as follows.

Gross stage 3 loans in the ongoing business decreased to $5.6 billion 1 January 2018: $6.5 billion, driven by repayments, debt sales, write-offs and transfers to stage 2 in Corporate & Institutional Banking.
The inows of stage 3 loans in Corporate & Institutional Banking were also signicantly lower, at around 35 per cent of the level seen in 2017 2018: $0.8 billion: 2017: $2.3 billion, reecting the continued improvement in the Corporate & Institutional Banking portfolio.
Stage 3 inows in Commercial Banking were higher 2018: $0.6 billion: 2017: $0.4 billion, driven by exposures in Greater China & North Asia and Africa & Middle East.
Stage 3 loans in Retail Banking were broadly stable 31 December 2018: $0.8 billion: 1 January 2018: $0.8 billion.
Stage 3 cover ratio The stage 3 cover ratio measures the proportion of stage 3 impairment provisions to gross stage 3 loans, and is a metric commonly used in considering impairment trends.
This metric does not allow for variations in the composition of stage 3 loans and should be used in conjunction with other credit risk information provided, including the level of collateral cover.
The cover ratio before collateral for Corporate & Institutional Banking reduced from 59 per cent to 57 per cent due to debt sales and write-offs on clients who had a high level of provisions.
The cover ratio for Retail Banking remained stable at 48 per cent and cover ratio including collateral improved to 87 per cent 1 January 2018: 74 per cent.
The Private Banking segment remains fully covered taking into account the collateral held.
The balance of stage 3 loans not covered by stage 3 impairment provisions represents the adjusted value of collateral held and the net outcome of any workout or recovery strategies.
Collateral provides risk mitigation to some degree in all client segments and supports the credit quality and cover ratio assessments post impairment provisions.
Further information on collateral is provided in the credit risk mitigation section.
The table below presents the balance of the gross stage 3 loans to banks and customers, together with the provisions held, for all segments and the respective cover ratios.

IFRS 9 methodology Approach for determining expected credit losses Credit loss terminology Component Denition Probability of default PD The probability that a counterparty will default, over the next 12 months from the reporting date stage 1 or over the lifetime of the product stage 2 and incorporating the impact of forward-looking economic assumptions that have an effect on credit risk, such as interest rates, unemployment rates and GDP forecasts.
The PD estimates will uctuate in line with the economic cycle.
The lifetime or term structure PDs are based on statistical models, calibrated using historical data and adjusted to incorporate forward-looking economic assumptions.
Loss given default LGD The loss that is expected to arise on default, incorporating the impact of forward-looking economic assumptions where relevant, which represents the difference between the contractual cash ows due and those that the bank expects to receive.
The Group estimates LGD based on the history of recovery rates and considers the recovery of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset, taking into account forward-looking economic assumptions where relevant.
Exposure at default EAD The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, taking into account the expected change in exposure over the lifetime of the exposure.
This incorporates the impact of drawdowns of committed facilities, repayments of principal and interest, amortisation and prepayments, together with the impact of forward-looking economic assumptions where relevant.
To determine the expected credit loss, these components are multiplied together PD for the reference period up to 12 months or lifetime x LGD at the beginning of the period x EAD at the beginning of the period and discounted to the balance sheet date using the effective interest rate as the discount rate.
Although the IFRS 9 models leverage the existing Basel advanced IRB risk components, several significant adjustments are required to ensure the resulting outcome is in line with the IFRS 9 requirements.

The reduction in the total average VaR was driven by the non-trading book, where the duration of the portfolio in the first half of 2018 was reduced.
However, during the fourth quarter of 2018 the non-trading VaR increased, driven by both an increase in the bond inventory size in high-quality assets from Treasury Markets and reduced portfolio diversication.
For the trading book, the average level of VaR in 2018 was lower than in 2017 by 19 per cent.

The other material market risk not reected in VaR was associated with basis risks where historical market price data for VaR is sometimes more limited, and therefore proxied, generating a potential basis risk.
Additional capital is set aside to cover such risks not in VaR.

Backtesting unaudited Regulatory backtesting is applied at both Group and Solo levels.
In 2018, there have been two negative exceptions at Group level and three at Solo level in 2017, there was one exception at Group level and one exception at Solo level.
Group and Solo exceptions occurred on 16 August 2018 driven by RMB which appreciated sharply due to PBoC intervention following a period of decline.
Additionally, Group and Solo exceptions occurred on 2 November 2018 driven by TWD and RMB exposures when Asian currencies strengthened on talk of a draft trade deal between the US and China.
On 15 November 2018 a Solo exception was driven by GBP and USD.
GBP depreciated as the draft Brexit agreement ran into difficulties, and US treasury yields fell as a result of safe haven purchases.

Standard Chartered 188 Annual Report 2018 Strategic report Directors report RISK REVIEW AND CAPITAL REVIEW Financial statements Supplementary information Liquidity analysis of the Groups balance sheet Contractual maturity of assets and liabilities The following table presents assets and liabilities by maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date as at the balance sheet date on a discounted basis.
Contractual maturities do not necessarily reect actual repayments or cashows.
Within the tables below, cash and balances with central banks, interbank placements and investment securities that are fair value through other comprehensive income are used by the Group principally for liquidity management purposes.
As at the reporting date, assets remain predominantly short-dated, with 61 per cent maturing in under one year.

Key changes to our principal uncertainties The following item has been removed as a principal uncertainty: Korean peninsula geopolitical tensions Due to the denuclearisation discussions relating to the Korean peninsula, we believe this risk has decreased: however, we continue to conduct regular stress tests and assess contagion risks arising from risk levels and associated contingency plans The following items have been amended or added as new principal uncertainties: Extended trade tensions driven by geopolitics and trade imbalance This risk was previously known as Increase in trade protectionism driven by nationalist agenda and has been renamed to cover increasing concerns on potential trade tensions and the adoption of protectionist policies China slowdown and impact on regional economies with close ties to China This risk was previously known as Moderation of growth in key footprint markets led by China and has been renamed to monitor and assess the impact from slowdown in China and associated regional economies Emerging Markets upcoming elections, interest rate rises and foreign exchange FX risks This risk was previously known as Sharp interest rate rises and asset price corrections and has been broadened to cover Emerging Market EM risks New technologies and digitisation This risk has been split into two to adequately capture the opportunity or business disruption and obsolescence risk from new technologies and increased data privacy and security risks respectively which could impact many elements of banking Based on our current knowledge and assumptions, our list of principal uncertainties is set out below, with our subjective assessment of their impact, likelihood and velocity of change.
This reects the latest internal assessment of material risks that the Group faces as identied by senior management.
This list is not designed to be exhaustive and there may be additional risks which could materialise or have an adverse effect on the Group.
Our mitigation approach for these risks may not be successful in completely eliminating them, but rather shows the Groups attempt to reduce or manage the risk.
As certain risks develop and materialise over time, management will take appropriate incremental steps based on the materiality of the impact of the risk to the operations of the Group.
