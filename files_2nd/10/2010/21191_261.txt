298 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2010 57 Risk management continued Our businesses are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks in line with minimum standards of control set out in our policies.
Each operational risk is assessed by considering the potential impact and the probability of the event occurring.
Impact assessments are considered against financial, operational and reputation criteria.
Business management teams must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk appetite are being mitigated, monitored and reported to an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high potential impact level are monitored centrally on a regular basis.
Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment.
They also identify and capture loss events: taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning from these occurrences.
The Operational Risk Committee ORC oversees the Groups aggregate operational risk exposure on behalf of the Group Executive Committee.
It makes recommendations on the risk appetite that the Group can work within for operational risk, assesses and monitors overall operational risk exposures, identifying any concentrations of operational risk across the Group, and in particular verifies that mitigating action plans are implemented.
The ORC operates a number of sub-committees which focus on specific areas of operational risk including customer, brand, business protection, IT, people, legal and regulatory compliance.
g Brand and reputation risk We are dependent on the strength of our brands, the brands of our partners and our reputation with customers and agents in the sale of our products and services.
Our success and results are, to a certain extent, dependent on the strength of our global Aviva brand and reputation.
While we as a group are well recognised, we are vulnerable to adverse market and customer perception.
We operate in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence are paramount.
We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, media speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, amongst others, whether or not founded, could impact our brands or reputation.
Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us or any of our intermediaries do not perform as expected whether or not the expectations are founded or the customers expectations for the product change.
One of the FSAs strategic objectives is to help customers get a fair deal through its treating customers fairly principle.
Examples of treating customers fairly include: products and services targeted to meet customers needs and which perform in line with what customers have been led to expect: clear information and advice where relevant : good service: and making sure there are no unfair barriers that prevent customers from getting access to their money, changing products or making a successful insurance claim.
The FSA regularly checks that we are meeting the requirement to treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints.
Failure to meet these requirements could also impact our brands or reputation.
If we do not manage successfully the perception of our brands and reputation, it could cause existing customers or agents to withdraw from our business and potential customers or agents to be reluctant or elect not to do business with us.
This would adversely impact our business and results of operations.
h Risk and capital management Sensitivity test analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity test-based risk management tools to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently.
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on all of the Groups financial performance measurements to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks to which each of its business units, and the Group as a whole, are exposed.
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of MCEV performance indicators to changes in both economic and non-economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
More information on MCEV sensitivities can be found in the presentation of results on an MCEV basis in the supplementary section of this report.
Life insurance and investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under MCEV methodology.
General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.

The comparative 2008 economic sensitivities for insurance non-participating business have been restated to reflect modelling enhancements in Delta Lloyd.

The sensitivities to economic movements relate mainly to business in the UK, US and the Netherlands.
In general a fall in market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business and shareholders funds, due to the increase in market value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities: similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative impact.
In the US most debt securities are classified as available-for-sale, which limits the overall sensitivity of IFRS profit to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity to movements in equity and property market values relates mainly to holdings in the Netherlands, although the impact on IFRS profit is moderated by the classification of equities as available for sale.
Changes in sensitivities between 2009 and 2010 reflect movements in market interest rates, portfolio growth, changes to asset mix and the relative durations of assets and liabilities and asset liability management actions.
Investment variances of 791 million in 2010 include 1,010 million relating to Delta Lloyd.
Of this, around 800 million is due to differing movements in asset and liability yield curves while the remainder primarily relates to gains on interest rate derivatives.
Liabilities in Delta Lloyd are discounted using a yield curve based on a fully collateralised AAA bond portfolio.
The discount rate increased in 2010 as an increase of around 80bps in credit spreads on collateralised bonds was only partly offset by lower risk-free yields.
As a result, whilst lower interest rates increased the market value of assets, this has not been offset by a corresponding movement in liabilities.
The AAA collateralised bond spread movement in the year reflected the perceived risk regarding the curves components which include bonds issued by Spanish savings banks and a range of other European organisations.
If spreads were to reduce, this would increase the insurance liabilities and this increase may not be offset by a corresponding increase in asset values.
Changes to the Delta Lloyd curve, which can generate gains or losses, can therefore significantly impact profit before tax and shareholders equity and the magnitude of this sensitivity is illustrated by the 800 million profit before tax and increase in shareholders equity experiences in 2010.
The mortality sensitivities relate primarily to the UK.
The impact on the Groups results from sensitivity to these assumptions can also be found in the MCEV sensitivities included in the alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the statement of financial position will be affected.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty: and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
