In particular, it is very difficult to predict the quantum and timing of returns on the Groups long-term investment portfolio.
As already mentioned, it is important to note that the maturity analysis in respect of financial assets at fair value i. e. the investment portfolio is highly subjective and is not a forecast of the expected cash flows.
For the purposes of the maturity analysis it has been simply assumed that all financial assets will be realised at their year-end carrying value.
The amounts receivable within three months are based on actual cash flows.
The residual balance has been allocated 70:30 between less than and more than five years.
This is considered to be a reasonable and prudent estimate, but is no more than that.
The Groups undrawn loan facility amounted to 259.2 million at 31 December 2010, and is subject to financial covenants as discussed in note 20.
Uncalled fund commitments At 31 December 2010, the Group had uncalled fund commitments of 209.8 million, which are expected to be drawn over a number of years.
It should be noted that when these commitments are funded they will typically be used to make investments and therefore create an asset that would be expected to be realised for cash over the longer term.
The Groups uncalled commitments are more than covered by the available loan facility.
Uncalled commitments were reduced by 11.3 million in January 2011 following the disposal of CVC V at its carrying value of 9.1 million.
