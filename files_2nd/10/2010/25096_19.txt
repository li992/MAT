PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The Board considers that the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Company fall into the following main categories.
i Market risks Price movements of the Companys investments are highly correlated to performance of global equities in general and small and mid cap equities in particular.
Consequently falls in stock markets are likely to negatively affect the performance of the Companys investments.
The Company invests in companies with small market capitalisations, which are likely to be subject to higher valuation uncertainties and liquidity risks than larger capitalisation securities.
The Company also invests in unquoted securities which generally have higher valuation uncertainties and liquidity risks than securities listed or traded on a regulated market.
The Company invests in securities which are not denominated or quoted in sterling.
Movements of exchange rates between sterling and other currencies in which the Companys investments are denominated may have an unfavourable effect on the return in the investments made by the Company.
There are inherent risks involved in stock selection.
The Investment Manager is experienced and employs its expertise in selecting the stocks in which the Company invests.
The Manager spreads the investment risk over a wide portfolio of investments in three main sectors and at the year end the Company held investments in 84 companies.
The Company will not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but the Manager takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
Further detail on the financial implications of market risk is provided in note 14 to the accounts.
ii Environmental Markets The Company invests in companies in Environmental Markets.
Such companies carry risks that government liberalisation may not occur as expected, costs of technology may not fall, capital spending by their customers is reduced or deferred and their products or services are not adopted.
iii Corporate governance and internal control risks The main risk areas are poor allocation of the Companys assets by the Investment Manager, poor governance by the Board and poor compliance or administration including the loss of investment trust status.
These factors could potentially result in unacceptable returns for shareholders.
