90 Financial and capital risk management Financial risk management The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which can be categorised as credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.
The objective of the groups risk management framework is to identify and assess the risks facing the group and to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is overseen by the risk advisory committee and further detail on the groups risk management framework is described on page 59. a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the group will suffer loss in the event of a default by a customer or a bank counterparty.
A default occurs when the customer or bank fails to honour repayments as they fall due.
i Amounts receivable from customers The groups maximum exposure to credit risk on amounts receivable from customers as at 31 December 2010 is the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers of 1,219.3m 2009: 1,139.3m.
CONSUMER CREDIT DIVISION CCD Credit risk within CCD is managed by the CCD credit committee which meets at least every two months and is responsible for approving product criteria and pricing.
Credit risk is managed using a combination of lending policy criteria, credit scoring including behavioural scoring, policy rules, individual lending approval limits, central underwriting, and a home visit to make a decision on applications for credit.
The loans offered by the weekly Home Credit business are short-term, typically a contractual period of around a year, with an average value of around 400.
The loans are underwritten in the home by an agent with emphasis placed on any previous lending experience with the customer and the Home Credit agents assessment of the credit risk based on a completed application form and the home visit.
Once a loan has been made, the agent visits the customer weekly to collect the weekly payment.
The agent is well placed to identify signs of strain on a customers income and can moderate lending accordingly.
Equally, the regular contact and professional relationship that the agent has with the customer allows them to manage customers repayments effectively even when the household budget is tight.
This can be in the form of taking part-payments, allowing missed payments or occasionally restructuring the debt in order to maximise cash collections.
Agents are paid commission for what they collect and not for what they lend, so their primary focus is on ensuring loans are affordable at the point of issue and then on collecting cash.
Affordability is reassessed by the agent each time an existing customer is re-served, or not as the case may be.
This normally takes place within 12 months of the previous loan because of the short-term nature of the product.
Underwriting of monthly unsecured direct repayment loans is performed in the home.
The emphasis is placed on employment and residential history, credit bureau reports, bank statements, salary slips, disposable income calculations and the home visit.
Average loans sizes are typically 1,800 repayable monthly via direct debit over a two-year period.
Arrears management for both Home Credit loans and monthly unsecured direct repayment loans is a combination of central letters, central telephony, and field activity undertaken by field management.
This will often involve a home visit to discuss the customers reasons for non-payment and to agree a resolution.
VANqUIS BANK Credit risk within Vanquis Bank is managed by the Vanquis Bank credit committee which meets at least quarterly and is responsible for ensuring that the approach to lending is within sound risk and financial parameters and that key metrics are reviewed to ensure compliance to policy.
A customers risk profile and credit line is evaluated at the point of application and at various times during the agreement.
Internally generated scorecards based on historic payment patterns of customers are used to assess the applicants potential default risk and their ability to manage a specific credit line.
For new customers, the scorecards incorporate data from the applicant, such as income and employment, and data from external credit bureau.
Initial credit limits are low, typically 250.
For existing customers, the scorecards also incorporate data on actual payment performance and product utilisation and take data from an external credit bureau each month to refresh customers payment performance position with other lenders.
Credit lines can go up as well as down according to this point-in-time risk assessment.
Arrears management is a combination of central letters, inbound and outbound telephony and outsourced debt collection agency activities.
Contact is made with the customer to discuss the reasons for non-payment and specific strategies are employed to support the customer in recovering to a good standing.

Counterparty credit risk arises as a result of cash deposits placed with banks and the use of derivative financial instruments with banks and other financial institutions which are used to hedge interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.
Counterparty credit risk is managed by the groups treasury committee and is governed by a board approved counterparty policy which ensures that the groups cash deposits and derivative financial instruments are only made with high quality counterparties with the level of permitted exposure to a counterparty firmly linked to the strength of its credit rating.
In addition, there is a maximum exposure limit for all institutions, regardless of credit rating.
This is linked to the groups regulatory capital base in line with the groups regulatory reporting requirements on large exposures to the Financial Services Authority FSA.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will have insufficient liquid resources available to fulfil its operational plans and or to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by the groups centralised treasury department through daily monitoring of expected cashflows in accordance with a board approved group funding and liquidity policy.
This process is monitored regularly by the treasury committee.
The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business through its existing borrowing facilities.
The group therefore maintains committed borrowing facilities in excess of expected borrowing requirements to ensure a significant and continuing headroom above forecast requirements at all times for at least the following 12 months.
As at 31 December 2010, the groups committed borrowing facilities had a weighted average maturity of 3.5 years 2009: 3.5 years and the headroom on these committed facilities amounted to 184.7m 2009: 331.0m.
The group is less exposed than other mainstream lenders to liquidity risk as the loans issued by the Home Credit business, the groups largest business, are of short-term duration typically around one year whereas the groups borrowings extend over a number of years.
A maturity analysis of the undiscounted contractual cashflows of the groups bank and other borrowings, including derivative financial instruments settled on a net and gross basis, is shown below.
It should be noted that borrowings drawn under the groups revolving bank facilities are shown below as being repaid in less than one year.
The group may then redraw these amounts until the contractual maturity of the underlying facility.

The groups exposure to movements in interest rates is managed by the treasury committee and is governed by a board approved interest rate hedging policy which forms part of the groups treasury policies.
The group seeks to limit the net exposure to changes in sterling interest rates.
This is achieved through a combination of issuing fixedrate debt and by the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
A 2% movement in the interest rate applied to borrowings during 2010 and 2009 would not have had a material impact on the groups profit before taxation or equity as the groups interest rate risk was substantially hedged.
d Foreign exchange rate risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk of a change in foreign currency exchange rates leading to a reduction in profits or equity.
The groups exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates is monitored monthly by the treasury committee and is governed by a board approved foreign exchange rate risk management policy which forms part of the groups treasury policies.
The groups exposures to foreign exchange rate risk arise solely from i the issuance of US dollar private placement loan notes, which are fully hedged into sterling through the use of cross-currency swaps, and ii the Home Credit operations in the Republic of Ireland, which are hedged by matching euro-denominated net assets with euro-denominated borrowings as closely as practicable.
As at 31 December 2010, a 2% movement in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate would have led to a 2.6m 2009: 8.9m movement in external borrowings with an opposite movement of 2.6m 2009: 8.9m in the hedging reserve within equity.
Due to the hedging arrangements in place, there would have been no impact on reported profits.
As at 31 December 2010, a 2% movement in the sterling to euro exchange rate would have led to a 0.2m 2009: 1.0m movement in customer receivables with an opposite movement of 0.2m 2009: 1.0m in external borrowings.
Due to the natural hedging of matching euro-denominated assets with euro-denominated liabilities, there would have been no impact on reported profits or equity.
e Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse market movements caused by active trading positions taken in interest rates, foreign exchange markets, bonds and equities.
The groups policies do not permit it to undertake position taking or trading books of this type and therefore it does not do so.
Provident Financial plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2010 Company number 668987 Financial statements Financial and capital risk management continued 93 Capital risk management The groups objective in respect of capital risk management is to maintain an efficient capital structure whilst satisfying the requirements of the groups banking covenants and the regulatory capital requirements set by the FSA.
The group manages its capital base against two measures as described below: a Gearing In order to maintain an efficient capital structure, the group has a target gearing ratio of 3.5 times.
This provides a comfortable level of headroom against the groups banking covenants, particularly the gearing covenant of 5.0 times, and regulatory capital requirements.
The target gearing ratio of 3.5 times is fully aligned with the groups target of distributing 80% of post-tax earnings by way of dividends whilst retaining sufficient capital to support receivables growth consistent with managements medium-term growth plans for the group.
Gearing is calculated as the ratio of the groups borrowings to adjusted equity after excluding the pension scheme asset and the fair value of derivative financial instruments, both stated net of deferred tax.
Borrowings are stated using the hedged exchange rate used to translate the groups US private placement loan notes, rather than the year end rate disclosed in the group financial statements and exclude any deferred arrangement fees.
As at 31 December 2010, the gearing ratio stood at 3.3 times 2009: 3.3 times as follows: 2010 2009 Note m m Borrowings 21 964.9 890.3 Exchange rate adjustment 13.2 6.9 Arrangement fees 7.3 Borrowings for gearing purposes 959.0 883.4 Shareholders equity 309.4 268.4 Pension asset 18 41.0 19.9 Deferred tax on pension asset 11.1 5.6 Hedging reserve, net of deferred tax 26 7.2 12.6 Equity for gearing purposes 286.7 266.7 Gearing times 3.3 3.3 The level of gearing provides a comfortable level of headroom compared with the relevant borrowings covenant of 5.0 times.
The gearing ratio is lower than the target of 3.5 times due to the planned moderation in receivables growth in the Consumer Credit Division during 2010. b Regulatory capital The group is the subject of consolidated supervision by the FSA.
As part of this supervision, the group is required to maintain a certain level of regulatory capital called Individual Capital Guidance ICG to mitigate against unexpected losses.
Regulatory capital differs from the groups equity base included in the balance sheet as it excludes items such as intangible assets and the groups pension asset, but includes the groups subordinated loan notes.
Risk-weighted assets principally comprise receivables and other assets of the group but exclude the groups pension asset and intangible assets.
The treasury committee monitors the level of regulatory capital, and capital adequacy is reported to the board on a monthly basis in the groups management accounts.
The group regularly forecasts regulatory capital requirements as part of the budgeting and strategic planning process.
The group is required to report twice annually to the FSA on the level of regulatory capital it holds.
Under the BASEL II framework, the group is required to report its regulatory capital as a percentage of its Pillar I minimum capital requirement which is determined based on pre-determined formulas for calculating credit risk and operational risk.
As at 31 December 2010, the regulatory capital held by the group as a percentage of the Pillar I minimum capital requirement was 300% 2009: 293% as set out below: 2010 2009 m m Pillar I minimum capital requirement 90.6 85.6 Tier 1 capital 267.1 245.1 Tier 2 capital subordinated loan notes 4.8 6.0 Total regulatory capital 271.9 251.1 Total regulatory capital as a percentage of Pillar I minimum capital requirement 300% 293% When tier 2 subordinated loan notes have less than five years until maturity, the amount eligible for regulatory capital reduces by 20% per annum for each year below five years.
Accordingly, the amount of the subordinated loan notes eligible for regulatory capital purposes as at 31 December 2010 amounts to 80% 2009: 100% of the balance outstanding.
The groups total regulatory capital as a percentage of the Pillar I minimum capital requirement was comfortably in excess of the ICG set by the FSA.
