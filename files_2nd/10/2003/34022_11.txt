Barclays operates in a highly regulated industry and is engaged in responding to significant changes in the regulatory environment, for example, from the implementation of Basel II, International Financial Reporting Standards and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
These changes, which directly affect risk management, necessitate considerable resources to amend or re-design our systems and reporting processes.
Under Basel II, Barclays aims to achieve advanced status in all risk categories.

Economic capital is Market 4% assigned primarily within the six risk categories summarised below: Unallocated Capital at Group Centre 9% Credit Risk The Group estimates the losses expected from its credit portfolio and sets aside appropriate provisions.
Capital is required in the event that losses substantially exceed the expected level.
The amount is estimated by statistical analysis of the historical loan loss volatility in the various product categories.
Within wholesale and retail businesses, capital allocation is differentiated by segment and customer grade.
Off-balance sheet exposures are converted to loan equivalent amounts based on their probability of being drawn, before applying capital factors.
See page 41 for further information on credit risk measurement.
Market Risk The required economic capital is primarily based on Daily Value at Risk DVaR measurements.
Where risks are not measured using DVaR, the capital requirement is based on stress test analysis.
Market risk measurement is further discussed on page 60. Business and Operational Risk A combined economic capital allocation for operational risk and business risk is derived through an equation including variables such as cost base, historic profit volatility and comparable external benchmarks.
These risks are discussed on page 70.

The management appears on page 50. models estimate the expected loss arising from loan defaults over the forthcoming 12 months from the current performing loan portfolio, taking into account its current composition, size and risk characteristics.
The actual credit provisions can vary signicantly around this value, due to changes in the economic environment or the business conditions in specic sectors or countries during the year and from unpredictable or unexpected events.
This applies especially in wholesale portfolios where the default of a small number of large exposures can have a significant impact on the outcome.
In addition to enhancing the understanding of the average credit quality of the portfolio, Risk Tendency is one of the measures used by the Group to inform a wider range of decisions, such as establishing the desired aggregate exposure levels to individual sectors and determining pricing policy.
The models used in the Risk Tendency calculation reect the diversity of the portfolio.
They are being improved constantly as the Group collects more data and deploys more sophisticated techniques.
The Group believes that each change will have a minor impact on the total result but should lead to better estimates over time.
As shown in the table below, Risk Tendency was 1,390m based upon the composition of the lending portfolio as at 31st December 2003 31st December 2002: 1,375m.
It fell in Personal Financial Services by 8% as a result of enhanced risk and fraud management strategies.
Barclaycard Risk Tendency increased by 21%, commensurate with growth in the portfolio and the impact of the acquisition of Clydesdale Financial Services.
Risk Tendency increased in Barclays Private Clients by 44% following the acquisition of Banco Zaragozano.
It fell in Barclays Capital by 38% following the recovery in wholesale credit markets and improvement in the quality and reduction in the size of the loan portfolio.

The credit risk exists in that the customers may not meet their commitments when they arise.
Commitments to lend see also Note 44 on page 153 are contractual undertakings to lend to customers during a specified period or at a future date or they may be ongoing facilities subject to periodic review.
These facilities are available to be used by customers, usually at their discretion, and may therefore become loans.
Balances arising from off balance sheet financial instruments represent the positive mark to market or otherwise assessed fair values of derivatives.
See Note 45 page 154, for a comprehensive disclosure of derivatives.
The management of the market risk inherent in derivatives is described on page 65 along with a description of derivatives used.
The credit risk in these instruments exists in that the counterparty may be unable to settle when settlement is due in Barclays favour.

For regulatory DVaR, the methodology maps interest rate risk into one category interest rate swaps, rather than the eight categories described above.
Model recognition was first given in 1999.
Barclays recognises the importance of assessing the effectiveness of its DVaR model.
The main approach employed is the technique known as back-testing, which counts the number of days when trading related losses are bigger than the estimated DVaR gure.
The regulatory standard for back-testing is to measure DVaR assuming a one-day holding period with a 99% level of confidence.
For Barclays Capitals regulatory trading book, there were no instances in 2003 of a daily trading revenue loss exceeding the corresponding back-testing DVaR.
In 2002, there were two instances.
62 Risk Management Disclosures about Certain Trading Activities including Non-exchange Traded Contracts The US Securities and Exchange Commission requires disclosures relating to certain trading activities, particularly energy trading and commodity trading through non-exchange traded contracts.
The Group delivers a fully integrated service to clients for base metals, precious metals, energy products covering US natural gas, oil and oilrelated products and European power and gas through Barclays Capital.
The base and precious metals business enters into outright metal purchase and sales transactions as well as the associated over the counter OTC and exchange traded derivatives.
The energy business deals in commodity derivative contracts but does not maintain any physical exposures.
Structured products are also developed and offered in respect of energy, base and precious metal and power and gas commodities.
The European power and gas business trades both physical forwards and derivative contracts.
The Groups commodity business continues to expand, as market conditions allow, both through the addition of new products and markets in European power and gas, and the continuing growth in the existing metals and energy trading volumes.
The Groups principal commodity related derivative contracts are swaps, options, forwards and futures, which are similar in nature to such noncommodity related contracts.
Commodity derivatives contracts include commodity specication and delivery location as well as forward date and notional values.
The fair values of commodity physical and derivative positions are determined through a combination of recognised market observable prices, exchange prices and established inter-commodity relationships.
In common with all derivatives, the fair value of OTC commodity derivative contracts is either determined using a quoted market price or by using valuation models.
Where a valuation model is used, the fair value is determined based on the expected cash ows under the terms of each specic contract, discounted back to present value.
The expected cash ows for each contract are either determined using market parameters such as commodity price curves, commodity volatilities, interest rate yield curves and foreign exchange rates, or derived from historical or other market prices.
Fair values generated by models are independently validated with reference to market price quotes, or price sharing with other institutions.
However, where no observable market parameter is available then instrument fair value will include a provision for the uncertainty in that parameter based on sale price or subsequent traded levels.
Discounting of expected cash ows back to present value is achieved by constructing discount curves from the market price of observable interest rate products, such as deposits, interest rate futures and swaps.
In addition, the Group maintains fair value adjustments reecting the cost of credit risk where this is not embedded in the fair value, future administration costs associated with ongoing operational support of products, the cost of exiting illiquid or significant positions, as well as the cost of trading out of a position all positions are marked to midmarket and hence the bid offer cost would be incurred.
The tables on page 64 analyse the overall fair value of the commodity derivative contracts by movement over time and source of fair value.
Additionally, the positive fair value, adjusted for the impact of netting, of such contracts is analysed by counterparty credit risk rating.

movements in the level or volatility of market rates and prices.
The risk embedded within retail contracts is managed by a specialist Retail Market Risk Unit.
It is measured using behavioural models and then converted into wholesale swap and option exposure, which is transferred to Group Treasury at an appropriate market rate transfer price.
This leaves residual risk within the business to the extent that wholesale contracts do not replicate the market or customer behaviour.
This risk is controlled by limits set by Group Market Risk.
International banking operations also incur market interest rate risk.
Policies for managing this risk are agreed between Group Treasury and Group Market Risk and are applied through Asset and Liability Committees ALCOs.
Guidance on the scope and constitution of ALCOs is provided by Group Market Risk, which maintains regular contact with the businesses on treasury issues.
Compliance with the policy is controlled via a comprehensive financial risk reporting framework including interest rate gap limits or value at risk limits issued by Group Market Risk.
These limits allow banking books to be managed by local treasury operations in an orderly fashion, either through Barclays Capital or, where necessary, through local markets.

Foreign exchange risk management Corporate and retail banking businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers.
The part of this risk that arises in UK operations is transferred directly to and managed by Barclays Capital as reported in the previous section.
Group Market Risk allocates modest foreign exchange open position limits to international operations to facilitate the management of customer originated ows.
Exposures are reported daily to Group Market Risk.
Throughout 2002 and 2003, aggregate DVaR of these businesses for foreign exchange rate risk was immaterial.
Management of foreign currency investments Non-trading positions in foreign currencies arise from the currency investments that the Group makes in its overseas businesses.
Group Treasury manages the funding and nancing of these investments so as to limit the effect of exchange rate movements on the Groups risk asset ratios.
The principal structural currency exposures of the Group are set out on page 155.
These positions, together with the currency composition of tiers 2 and 3 capital and minority interests in tier 1 and tier 2 capital, ensure that movements in exchange rates have little impact on the Groups risk asset ratios.
However, exchange rate movements do have an impact on reserves see Consolidated statement of changes in reserves on page 124.
With the positions in place at 31st December 2003, a hypothetical increase of 10% in the value of sterling against all currencies would have led to a fall of some 79m in reserves 2002: 36m.
