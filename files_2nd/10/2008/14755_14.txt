There are risks and uncertainties connected to the Groups businesses.

uncertainties Risk management is an important element of the system of internal control.
This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute assurance against material loss.
The risk management process involves making all managers within the Group responsible for risk management and for ensuring that a full assessment of risks, both financial and non-financial has been completed.
This is achieved by a bottom-up and top-down review of risks throughout the Group, from which, a Group Risk Matrix has been developed.
This process has embedded risk management within the operational and executive management throughout the Group.
The Group Risk Matrix is reviewed twice a year.
Overall responsibility for the risk management process lies with the Global Operating Committee GOC which comprises the Executive Directors, the Executive Committee and certain other senior managers.
