Barclays has continued to maintain a capital buffer over the FSAs minimum regulatory capital requirements.
The Core Tier 1 ratio decreased to 10.9% 2011: 11.0% reflecting a reduction in Core Tier 1 capital of 0.9bn to 42.1bn, partially offset by a 1% reduction in risk weighted assets to 386.9bn.
Barclays generated 1.8bn Core Tier 1 capital from earnings after absorbing the impact of dividends paid and provisions for PPI and interest rate hedging product redress.
The increase from earnings was more than offset by other movements in Core Tier 1 capital, principally: 1.2bn increase in the adjustment for defined benefit pensions, driven by an additional contribution made to the UK Retirement Fund in April 2012 and deducting expected future deficit contributions over the next five years: 1.6bn reduction due to foreign currency movements, primarily due to depreciation of the US Dollar, Euro and South African Rand against Sterling which was broadly offset by foreign currency movements in risk weighted assets: and Total capital resources increased by 2.1bn reflecting lower deductions for material holdings principally as a result of the sale of the stake in BlackRock, Inc.
Within Tier 2 capital, the redemption of 2.7bn dated subordinated liabilities was partially offset by the issuance of $3bn of contingent capital notes CCNs.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 165 Risk review Funding risk Capital continued RWAs reduced by 1% to 386.9bn driven by: Methodology and model changes: the 38.7bn increase is primarily driven by: 18.4bn increase in operational risk driven by a recalibration of risk scenarios taking into account risk events impacting Barclays and the banking industry: 12.0bn increase in market risk within Investment Bank, principally relating to VaR model scope and the sovereign incremental risk charge: 4.7bn increase due to the introduction of minimum loss given default parameters for sovereign exposures: and 2.8bn increase in credit risk as a result of changes to the treatment of real estate exposures.
Business risk reduction: the 28.4bn decrease is primarily driven by: 24.6bn decrease as a result of Investment Bank risk reduction primarily in market risk and derivative counterparty credit risk, including a 4.2bn decrease as a result of the sell down of legacy assets in addition to 1.0bn lower capital deductions related to legacy business : 6.9bn credit risk decrease within Corporate Banking, reflecting business risk reduction and the exit from non-core international portfolios: Offset by 2.2bn increase within UKRBB predominantly driven by mortgage balance growth.
Foreign exchange: the 11.3bn decrease is primarily due to the depreciation of the US Dollar, Euro and South African Rand against Sterling: and Change in risk parameters: the 3.1bn decrease is primarily driven by improvements in underlying risk profiles and market conditions.
Impact of Basel 3 The new capital requirements regulation and capital requirements directive that implement Basel 3 proposals within the EU collectively known as CRD IV are still under consideration.
The requirements are expected to be finalised during 2013, however the implementation date is uncertain.
CRD IV includes the requirement for a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 6% and a minimum total capital ratio of 8%.
There is an additional requirement for a Capital Conservation Buffer CCB of 2.5% and Counter-Cyclical Capital Buffer CCCB of up to 2.5% to be applied when macroeconomic conditions indicate areas of the economy are over-heating.
Our working assumption is that the CCCB would be zero if implemented today: In addition globally systemically important banks are expected to hold a buffer of up to 2.5%.
For Barclays, this was confirmed in November 2012 by the Financial Stability Board FSB to be 2.0% resulting in an expected regulatory target CET1 ratio of 9.0%.
This regulatory target capital requirement will phase in between adoption of CRD IV and 2019: The proposed changes to the definition of CET1 also include transitional provisions relating to capital deductions and grandfathering of ineligible capital instruments that are in line with the FSAs statement on CRD IV transitional provisions in October 2012: Given the phasing of both capital requirements and target levels, in advance of needing to comply with the fully loaded end state requirements Barclays will have the opportunity to continue to generate additional capital from earnings and take management actions to mitigate the impact of CRD IV.
Our expectation is that ineligible Additional Tier 1 capital, which qualifies for grandfathering under the transitional relief, will be replaced with eligible capital over time: To provide an indication of the potential impact on Barclays, we have estimated our pro forma RWAs and CET1 ratio on both a transitional and fully loaded basis, reflecting our current interpretation of the rules and assuming they were applied as at 1 January 2013.
As at that date Barclays pro forma RWAs on a CRD IV basis would have been estimated at approximately 468bn, with a resultant transitional CET1 ratio of approximately 10.6% and a fully loaded CET1 ratio of approximately 8.2%.
Further analysis of the impacts are set out on page 167: Based on our estimated proforma capital ratios, identified actions and retained earnings, we expect to be in excess of the minimum capital requirements as they are expected to apply over the transitional period and through to the end state position: The Basel 3 guidelines include a proposed leverage metric to be implemented by national supervisors initially under a parallel run for disclosure purposes only, and migrating to a mandatory limit over a period of five years.
Based on our interpretation of the current proposals, the Groups CRD IV leverage ratio as at 31 December 2012 would be within the proposed limit of 33x, allowing for transitional relief to Tier 1 capital.
Further analysis of the impacts are set out on page 167: The actual impact of CRD IV on capital ratios may be materially different as the requirements and related technical standards have not yet been finalised, for example provisions relating to the scope of application of the CVA volatility charge and restrictions on short hedges relating to insignificant financial holdings.
The actual impact will also be dependent on required regulatory approvals and the extent to which further management action is taken prior to implementation.

They assume that all items in the Internal Model Method application to the FSA are approved, and existing FSA waivers, where such discretion is available under CRD IV, will continue.
Capital resources Proforma capital numbers at 1 January 2013 are based on 31 December 2012 actuals with an adjustment for IFRS 10 impact as a result of consolidating some entities that were not previously consolidated and deconsolidating some entities that were previously consolidated : Transitional CET1 capital is based on application of the CRD IV transitional provisions and FSA guidance dated 26 October 2012 setting out the minimum pace of transitions with certain exceptions set out in the guidance.
In line with this guidance, deferred tax assets deduction is assumed to transition in at 10% in 2013.
Other deductions including goodwill and intangibles, expected losses over impairment and DVA transition in at 0% in 2013, 20% in 2014, 40% in 2015 and so on: PVA was previously assumed to be subject to transitional treatment.
Following FSA guidance, the impact of PVA is now factored into CET1 on inception in full.
PVA is subject to final rules to be agreed by the EBA and the impact is currently based on methodology agreed with the FSA: The draft July 2011 CRD IV rules include the implementation of a capital deduction for financial holdings greater than 10% of CET1 capital, which under Basel 2.5 are subject to equity market risk capital requirements.
Under current regulatory rules, the Groups financial holdings net down to 3.3bn exposure after allowing for permitted economic hedging.
The current draft of the CRD IV rules applies a further restriction, where the maturity of the hedging instrument is less than one year, which would result in a higher net position of approximately 10.1bn.
This would be in excess of 10% of our CET1 and would result in a capital deduction on a fully loaded basis of approximately 4.6bn at CET1 level and a further deduction of approximately 1.4bn at total capital level.
However, we have identified management actions that would be taken in the event that the CRD IV draft requirements remain unchanged, and as a result we are highly confident that no capital deduction would be required: and Excess minority interest has been calculated on a CRD IV basis and included in our full impact capital base on the assumption that supervisory regimes outside the EU that are implementing Basel 3, and are currently considered equivalent supervisory and regulatory regimes, will continue to be considered equivalent regimes under CRD IV.

The adjusted gross leverage reduced to 19x as at 31 December 2012 2011: 20x principally as a result of an increase in qualifying Tier 1 capital to 51.6bn 2011: 50.5bn, offset by a reduction in adjusted total tangible assets by 2.6% to 975bn.
At month ends during 2012 the ratio moved in a range from 19x to 23x 2011: 20x to 23x, with fluctuations arising primarily within collateralised reverse repurchase lending and high quality trading portfolio assets.
Significant monthly fluctuations included: an increase to 23x in April 2012 driven by an increase in reverse repurchase agreements and holdings of trading portfolio assets and a decrease in Tier 1 capital: a fall in June 2012 to 20x driven by an increase in Tier 1 capital, and decreases in holdings of trading portfolio assets and reverse repurchase agreements: and a decrease to 19x in December 2012 resulting from decreases in reverse repurchase agreements, holdings of trading portfolio assets and cash and balances at central banks.

Significant drivers of fluctuations other than those noted above comprised: an increase to 26x in April 2012 due to increases in settlement balances and trading portfolio assets offset by decreases in gross derivative balances: a further increase to 28x in May 2012 arising from increases in gross derivatives balances and trading portfolio assets: and decreases to 26x in August 2012 and 24x in December 2012 as a result of decreases in gross derivative balances, trading portfolio assets and in settlement balances.
Group Treasury agrees adjusted tangible asset targets at a segment level to manage the Barclays balance sheet and leverage ratio.
The Investment Banks adjusted tangible assets are managed and reviewed monthly by the Corporate and Investment Banking Treasury Committee which includes members of Treasury, Finance and the businesses.
The Committee agrees limits with each business across the Investment Bank and monitors balance sheet usage against those limits.
Businesses were required to manage the balance sheet to defined limits and were not permitted to exceed them without prior approval by nominated Committee members.
Barclays continues to operate within limits and targets for balance sheet usage as part of its balance sheet management activities.
Implementation of Basel 3 leverage impacts Barclays already measures and reports adjusted gross leverage as an internal measure of balance sheet leverage based on adjusted tangible assets divided by qualifying regulatory Tier 1 capital.
The business operates within limits and targets for balance sheet usage at a Group and business unit level as part of its balance sheet management activities.
As at 31 December 2012, the Groups adjusted gross leverage was 19x.
CRD IV introduces a non-risk based leverage ratio that is intended to act as a supplementary buffer to the risk based capital requirements.
By 1 January 2018 banks will be required to be above the proposed limit of 3% leverage equivalent to 33x.
Prior to that date there are no regulatory requirements to exceed this threshold, but banks will be required to publish their leverage ratio annually in the Pillar 3 disclosures once the rules come into force.
The CRD IV leverage ratios are higher than the adjusted gross leverage ratio, primarily due to the CRD IV ratio excluding netting of settlement balances and cash collateral against derivatives and including off-balance sheet potential future exposures and undrawn commitments, which the adjusted gross leverage ratio consistent with many other banks treatment does not.
The key adjustments to total assets under the CRD IV leverage ratio are as follows: Netting adjustments: netting permitted for regulatory purposes in relation to derivative and secured financing transaction SFT assets against corresponding liabilities: Regulatory deductions: items comprising goodwill and intangibles, deferred tax asset losses, own paper, cash flow hedge reserve, and pension assets deducted from the capital measure are also deducted from total assets to ensure consistency between the numerator and denominator of the ratio: Other adjustments: includes adjustments required to change from an IFRS scope of consolidation to a regulatory scope of consolidation.
The final rules with regards to scope of consolidation for leverage purposes are uncertain: Potential Future Exposure on derivatives: add-on calculated by assigning standardised percentages to underlying values on derivative contracts in accordance with the CRD IV mark-to-market method, which is aimed at creating an assessment of the potential future credit exposure: and Undrawn Commitments: regulatory add-on relating to off-balance sheet undrawn commitments based on a credit conversion factor of 10% for unconditionally cancellable commitments and 100% for other commitments.

This is the measure of Tier 1 capital that will apply for capital ratio requirements.
Leverage ratio requirements will not be mandatory until 2018.
CRD IV adjusted full end point measure is based on Tier 1 capital, not allowing for transitional treatment of deductions from CET1 but adding back ineligible Tier 1 instruments.
CRD IV full end point measure is based on the fully loaded definition of Tier 1 capital, not allowing for either transitional treatment of deductions from CET1 or transitional relief for grandfathered ineligible Tier 1 instruments.
In practice, our expectation is that ineligible Additional Tier 1 capital, which qualifies for grandfathering under the transitional relief, will be replaced with eligible capital over time.
In the event that the July 2011 CRD IV rules relating to maturity restrictions on hedging remain unchanged, the fully loaded Tier 1 capital position would reduce by approximately 4.8bn to 35.2bn, increasing CRD IV leverage to 32x on an adjusted full end point basis and to 40x on a full end point basis.
However, we have identified management actions that would be taken in the event that the CRD IV draft requirements remain unchanged, and as a result we are highly confident that no capital reduction would be required.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Economic capital Economic capital is an internal measure of the risk profile of the bank expressed as the estimated stress loss at a 99.98% confidence level.
Barclays assesses capital requirements by measuring the Groups risk profile using internally developed models.
The Group assigns economic capital primarily within the following risk categories: credit risk, market risk, operational risk, fixed asset risk property and equipment and pension risk.
The Group regularly reviews its economic capital methodology and benchmarks outputs to external reference points.
The framework uses default probabilities during average credit conditions, rather than those prevailing at the balance sheet date, thus seeking to remove cyclicality from the economic capital calculation.
The economic capital framework takes into consideration time horizon, correlation of risks and risk concentrations.
Economic capital is allocated on a consistent basis across all of Barclays businesses and risk activities.
Economic capital is used as part of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP and for assessing the Groups Financial Volatility within the Risk Appetite framework.
