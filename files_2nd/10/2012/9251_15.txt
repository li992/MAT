Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information TERMINATE THREAT TRANSFER TOLERATE Principal risks and uncertainties The management and control of risks within Laird are embedded within basic operating procedures.
These procedures comprise a range of measures including Group policies, Laird Operating Rules, monthly reporting, internal and external audits and other management control assurance reviews e. g. EHS, quality and standards including ISO.
Laird operates globally in broad markets.
Risk is impacted by changing environments and is continually monitored and rated.
The risks and uncertainties outlined below, which are not presented in any order of priority, are those Laird believes to be the principal risks and uncertainties that are or may be faced.
In addition, information on the Laird Risk Management Framework is given on pages 53 and 54.
We review and monitor risks at both inherent and residual levels, i. e. before and after the assessed impact of controls, and assess forward trends.
A risk framework looks at likelihoods and consequences and is plotted in the form illustrated.
