Principal risks and uncertainties Effective management of risks is critical to our business in order to deliver long-term shareholder value and protect our people, assets and reputation.
Like any business, we face risk and uncertainties in all of our activities.
Our challenge is to identify risks and develop effective management strategies and processes in order for us to embrace value adding opportunities in an informed and riskcalculated manner.
