Any cash flows based on a floating rate are calculated using interest rates as set at the date of the last rate reset.
Where this is not possible, floating rates are based on interest rates prevailing at 31 December in the relevant year.
All derivative amounts are shown gross, although the Group net settles these amounts wherever possible.
Any amounts drawn under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper are assumed to mature at the maturity date of the relevant facility, with interest calculated as payable in each calendar year up to and including the date of maturity of the facility.
Financial counterparty risk management Counterparty credit limits, which take published credit rating and other factors into account, are set to cover our total aggregate exposure to a single financial institution.
The limits applicable to published credit ratings bands are approved by the chief financial officer within guidelines approved by the board.
Exposures and limits applicable to each financial institution are reviewed on a regular basis.
