The directors review performance using these non-statutory measures as well as segmental and underlying profit, as they consider these to be more meaningful measures of performance.
These performance measures are defined in note 1 g of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Board does not use non-financial key performance indicators to assess the Group as a whole, although parts of the Group do use non-financial key performance indicators from time to time.
Consistent with its size and complexity, the Group has a large number of contractual relationships with clients and suppliers.
