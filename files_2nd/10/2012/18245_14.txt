Risks The risks which we face fall into two categories: Sectoral risks These are the risks common to all companies operating in the investment property sector.
Economic slowdown increases the risk of failure amongst tenants with an increase in bad debts, a loss of rental income and increased vacancies.
This risk is current in the UK where the economy is again in recession: but this is less of an issue in the USA where the outlook is more positive.
The continuing availability of finance is essential to fund acquisitions, developments and major schemes of refurbishment.
Regulatory or financial pressures on lenders resulting in a reduction in the supply of finance on acceptable terms could constrain our ability to grow.
Company risks These are the risks specific to the Company which arise from the way we undertake our business.
With over 20% by value of the Groups property portfolio located in the USA, movements in the sterling dollar exchange rate will produce accounting adjustments in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The overall impact in the current year is not significant but this may not always be the case.
