| Greggs plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 36 Principal risks and uncertainties continued Risk Management The risks to which the Company is exposed are regularly reviewed as well as the operation and effectiveness of the systems of internal control.
This process is on-going and involves the identification, evaluation and management of the significant risks faced by the Company.
Key elements of the internal control system, which have been in place during the whole of 2012 and up to the date of approval of this annual report and accounts, are: Board of Directors The Board views risk management as a vital constituent of its role and takes a proactive approach to the management of all forms of risk.
At each Board meeting, the effectiveness of the controls relating to the most significant risks i. e. those which may restrict the Companys ability to meet our objectives are monitored and reviewed and consideration is given as to whether any new material risks have emerged.
Furthermore for some key risks where it is felt necessary specialist advice is sought from external agencies and professional advisers.
The Board also reviews, at least annually, the major risks facing the business and the level and scope of insurance cover maintained within the business.
Management delivers reports to the Board on significant changes in the business and external environment which might affect the risk profile.
Moreover, a system of regular hierarchical reporting is in place which provides for relevant details and assurances on the assessment and control of risks to be given to the Board.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, conducts a formal review of risk management procedures and reports its findings to the Board with remedial action determined where appropriate.
Operating Board The Operating Board, answerable directly to the Chief Executive is made up of functional Directors for: Finance, Retail, Trading and Marketing, Supply Chain Operations, Supply Chain Development, People, Corporate Affairs and Business Planning and Change.
The Chief Executive, supported by the Operating Board is responsible for implementing the decisions of the Board and providing protection against the major risks by various techniques, including strategic planning, monitoring, supervision and training.
The Operating Board meets monthly to review financial and other business performance, as well as to develop, monitor and implement the strategies as set by the Board.
Although the Operating Board is not a formal committee of the Board, it does have its own terms of reference which are reviewed by the Board from time to time.
Risk Committee The Risk Committee is a management committee, chaired by the Company Secretary and General Counsel.
The Committee consists of the Chief Executive, all members of the Operating Board as well as appropriate heads of certain management functions within the business.
It has responsibility for analysing, assessing, measuring and understanding the Companys risk environment and devising a sound risk management strategy for review and approval by the Board.
Findings and important changes are reported to the Board from the Risk Committee through personal presentation, narrative reports and key performance indicators internal and external to the organisation and through the Audit Committee.
Risks are assessed on a regular basis across all functional areas but in particular the areas of food safety, health and safety, the competitive environment, information flow, asset protection and regulatory requirements.
Whistle-blowing The Company has whistle-blowing procedures in place, which enable employees to bring matters to the attention of the senior management and ensure the confidential, proportionate and independent consideration and follow-up of any matters raised.
These whistle-blowing procedures are reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee and the Chair of the Audit Committee is the first line recipient of any matters raised through this policy.
There were three matters reported through the policy during 2012, all of which were promptly and satisfactorily dealt with.
Internal Audit The Internal Audit function continues to review the performance of shops, bakeries and central functions across a range of financial and non-financial requirements and reports its findings to senior management and directly to the Audit Committee.
The Internal Audit Manager reports to the Company Secretary and General Counsel to improve functional independence and has a standing invitation to attend all Audit Committee meetings, not just during the time relating to the presentation of relevant audit reports.
The Internal Audit team has authority to access all areas of the business, senior management, and the Chair of the Audit Committee as is seen fit.
Business Social Corporate Financial Overview Review Responsibility Governance Statements | Greggs plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 37 Directors remuneration report During 2012 the Remuneration Committee was chaired by Iain Ferguson.
The members of the Committee consisted of Julie Baddeley, Ian Durant and Roger Whiteside who, upon appointment as Chief Executive, stepped down from the Committee on 3 February 2013.
Bob Bennett was a member of the Committee up to 16 May 2012.
Iain Ferguson Members: Iain Ferguson, Julie Baddeley, Ian Durant, Allison Kirkby Introduction I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report of Greggs plc for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2012.
Shareholders will be invited to approve the report at the Companys Annual General Meeting the AGM on 15 May 2013.
Being mindful of the proposed legislative requirements in respect of executive remuneration reporting, this year we have amended the structure of our report in order to make it easier to understand and to try and eliminate duplication of information.
Fairness and appreciation Both retrospectively and looking to the future the Companys remuneration policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages that will attract, retain and motivate the best individuals with appropriate skills and experience with the incentive to add sustainable long-term growth and value that will best serve the interests of the Company, its shareholders, its employees and customers.
Our policy Our policy is such that Executive Directors are fairly rewarded but are not overpaid and in return they are expected to demonstrate enthusiasm, commitment and strong leadership.
Base salaries and total packages are set to reflect the UK market and are regularly benchmarked by external consultants against the median level payments made to executives in similar roles in companies of comparative size, sector and complexity.
We have a basic level of stability within our remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
However, following the resignation of Kennedy McMeikan as Chief Executive in December 2012 and as part of our recruitment process for our new Chief Executive, Roger Whiteside, we have reviewed the bonus incentive plan and PSP element of the remuneration package of the role.
From 2013 the maximum earning potential for the Chief Executive under the bonus incentive plan will be 125% of base salary with the other Executive Directors remaining at the current level of 90% of base salary.
With regards to the share-based incentive the Performance Share Plan or PSP, the Chief Executive will receive 120% of his annual base salary in year one with no change to the other Executive Directors PSP award.
The Remuneration Committee were comfortable that this level of reward still sits at the median level within the market.
We plan to conduct a full review of our PSP scheme for all the Executive and Operating Board Directors in 2013.
We are committed to ensuring that rewards for executives are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders and we believe that our remuneration policy continues to be aligned with our strategic goal of delivering shareholder value.

2012 Bonus The Committee seeks to structure annual bonus arrangements so as to encourage sustainable growth in the Companys profits.
The Committee is satisfied that the structure will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently encouraging irresponsible behaviour.
The Committees policy is that all bonus payments to Executive Directors should be non-pensionable.

The Committee introduced a claw-back clause in the Bonus Scheme rules in 2011 as follows: The Committee reserves the right to claw-back any portion of the bonus payment that has been paid in error should it come to light, at a future date, that there was a material misstatement of the operating profit resulting in a significant over-payment.
Each Executive Director is entitled to participate in the Companys profit sharing scheme available to all employees.
The value of this is then deducted from their annual bonus.
| Greggs plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 46 Directors remuneration report continued PSP In 2009 shareholder approval was obtained for the introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP.
Awards under the PSP were first made in 2010.
Awards are restricted for three years and vesting in full or part is subject to the achievement of a combination of EPS growth and TSR targets.
This has provided a greater focus on achieving key long-term business goals and increased shareholder value.
The comparator group used in connection with the PSP was established following a comprehensive review which included taking advice from PwC, and for 2012 consisted of 26 companies who are General Retailers, Food Producers Manufacturers or Leisure Companies and who were considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the most appropriate from the FTSE 250.
Northern Foods and Robert Wiseman Dairies were removed from the list following their delisting.
The remaining 26 companies are: Brown N Group Inchcape Carpetright Kesa Electricals now known as Darty Cranswick Marstons Dairy Crest Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Debenhams Mitchells & Butlers Dignity Mothercare Dominos Pizza Premier Foods DSG International Rank Group Dunelm Group Restaurant Group Game Group bought by private equity firm April 2012 Sports Direct Intl.
Greene King Tate & Lyle Halfords Group Wetherspoon JD HMV Group in administration as of 15 January 2013 WH Smith For the 2013 PSP scheme the comparator group has been revised by the Committee after taking advice from PwC.
The comparator group now consists of 16 companies who continue to be General Retailers, Food Producers Manufacturers or Leisure Companies and who were considered by the Remuneration Committee to be the most appropriate from the FTSE 250.
Although the number of comparable companies has been reduced, this was based on the following rationale: t Two companies have been delisted Game Group, HMV Group : t Four companies have left the FTSE 250 on the grounds of their size Kesa Electricals, Mothercare, Premier Foods, Tate & Lyle : t Four companies have been removed as they are not suitable comparators and are not all affected by the current pressures in the retail environment Brown N Group, Cranswick, Dairy Crest, Dignity.
The 16 companies are: Booker JD Sports Carpetright Marstons Debenhams Mitchells & Butlers Dominos Pizza Ocado Dunelm Group Restaurant Group Greene King Sports Direct Intl.
Halfords Group Wetherspoon JD Home Retail Group W H Smith The options granted in 2010 are due to vest in April 2013 when the performance conditions will be measured.
Performance against these conditions has been monitored regularly and it is anticipated currently that the conditions will not be met.
