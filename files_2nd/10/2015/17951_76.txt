24 Financial instruments and risk management Management of financial risks One of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Specifically Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework set by the Groups Main Board and Corporate Finance Committee CFC, the Groups exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks.
The Groups treasury position is monitored by the CFC which meets regularly throughout the year and is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
The approach is one of risk reduction within an overall framework of delivering total shareholder return.
The Group defines capital as net debt see note 21 and equity see note 20.
The only externally imposed capital requirement for the Group is interest cover as described under interest rate risk below.
The Group assesses its financial capacity by reference to cash flow, net debt and interest cover.
Group policies include a set of financing principles and key performance indicators including the monitoring of credit ratings, interest cover and liquidity.
These provide a framework within which the Groups capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends as a percentage of long-term sustainable earnings and share buy-back are decided.
The key objective of the financing principles is to appropriately balance the interests of equity and debt holders in driving an efficient financing mix for the Group.
The Groups average cost of debt is 3.1% in 2015.
The Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet and related notes.
British American Tobacco Annual Report 2015 179 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes on the Accounts continued 24 Financial instruments and risk management continued The Groups management of specific risks is dealt with as follows: Liquidity risk It is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of providers.

This facility is drawable in Chilean peso and was drawn to the value of US$225 million at 31 December 2015 2014: US$225 million.
The Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to inter-company loans and borrowings to mobilise cash efficiently within the Group.
The key objectives of Treasury in respect of cash and cash equivalents are to protect their principal value, to concentrate cash at the centre to minimise the required long-term debt issuance and to optimise the yield earned.
The amount of debt issued by the Group is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash.
The Group continues to target investment-grade credit ratings: as at 31 December 2015 the ratings from Moodys and S&P were A3 stable outlook Astable outlook 2014: A3 A-.
The Moodys rating was upgraded from Baa1 to A3 on 12 March 2013.
The strength of the ratings has underpinned debt issuance in 2015 and 2014 and, despite the impact of the turbulence in financial markets, the Group is confident of its ability to successfully access the debt capital markets, as demonstrated by the issue of bonds in the Swiss franc, euro, US dollar and sterling markets in 2015 and 2014.
180 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 24 Financial instruments and risk management continued As part of its short-term cash management, the Group invests in a range of cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, which are regarded as highly liquid and are not exposed to significant changes in fair value.
These are kept under continuous review as described in the credit risk section below.
At 31 December 2015, cash and cash equivalents include 334 million invested in money market funds 2014: nil.
Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none of them are expected to inhibit the Groups operations or funding plans.
Currency risk The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling.
The Groups primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the US dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Danish krone, Swiss franc, South African rand, Russian rouble, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Malaysian ringgit and Singaporean dollar.
These exposures are kept under continuous review.
The Groups policy on borrowings is to broadly match the currency of these borrowings with the currency of cash flows arising from the Groups underlying operations.
Within this overall policy, the Group aims to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost-effective to do so through matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
The main objective of these policies is to protect shareholder value by increasing certainty and minimising volatility in earnings per share.
At 31 December 2015, the currency profile of the Groups gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 32% 2014: 19% US dollar, 30% 2014: 40% euro, 1% 2014: 2% Canadian dollar, 30% 2014: 26% sterling, and 7% 2014: 13% other currencies.
The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates and joint arrangements: these exposures are not normally hedged.
Exposures also arise from: i foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries.
These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast sales and purchases, which are offset wherever possible.
The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward foreign exchange contracts and options, which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identified future transactions: and ii forecast dividend flows from subsidiaries to the centre.
To ensure cash flow certainty, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts which are designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the Income Statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of exchange rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities held across the Group.
All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
Financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of the Groups subsidiaries, as well as non-financial assets and liabilities and translation risk, are not included in the analysis.
The Group considers a 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change.
The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year-end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.
A 10% strengthening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 3 million lower 2014: 2 million higher and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being 326 million higher 2014: 49 million higher.
A 10% weakening of functional currencies against non-functional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being 2 million higher 2014: 3 million lower and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being 398 million lower 2014: 59 million lower.
The exchange sensitivities on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income relate to hedging of certain net asset currency positions in the Group as well as on cash flow hedges in respect of future transactions, but does not include sensitivities in respect of exchange on nonfinancial assets or liabilities.
Interest rate risk The objectives of the Groups interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash flow and economic value of the Group and to safeguard against any possible breach of its financial covenants.
Additional objectives are to minimise the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk.
The Group targets an interest cover ratio, as calculated under its key central banking facilities, of greater than 5 and for 2015 it is 11.6 times 2014: 12.0 times.
The only externally imposed capital requirement the Group has is in respect of its centrally managed banking facilities, which require a gross interest cover of at least 4.5 times.
In order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The Group sets targets within overall guidelines for the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on both a gross and net basis at least 50% fixed on a net basis in the short to the medium-term as a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by the CFC and the board of the main central finance company.
At 31 December 2015, the relevant ratios of floating to fixed rate borrowings were 44:56 2014: 45:55 on a gross basis and 33:67 2014: 30:70 on a net basis.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, to vary the fixed and floating mix.
The interest rate profile of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest rate exposure.
