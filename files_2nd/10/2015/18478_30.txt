The Group also continues with a number of risk management initiatives, including: implementing and rolling-out risk management software, to improve risk identification, remediation tracking and drive consistency: and rolling-out our Seven Elements of Compliance Management Programme, to help ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and drive consistency.

Additional financial reporting internal controls We have detailed policies and procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of Group financial statements.
This includes our comprehensive Group Accounting Manual GAM, which contains the detailed requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Groups finance team owns the GAM and we have rolled it out across the Group, obliging all Experian companies to follow its requirements.
The GAMs aims are to: provide guidance on accounting issues: enable consistent and well-defined information for IFRS reporting: provide uniform quantitative and qualitative measures of Group performance: and increase the efficiency of the Groups reporting process.
