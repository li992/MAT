STRATEGIC REPORT Risk management The Board has continued to identify, evaluate and monitor risks facing the Group and, during the year under review, a particular focus has been placed on assessing the likely impact that each identified risk could have on the business.
Our approach All businesses choose to take considered risks in the expectation of BUSINESS earning a return for their shareholders.
The Board has determined its OWNER risk appetite, stating the risks it seeks to take or is prepared to face within the companys business model and the adopted strategy, and has also defined the risks it is not prepared to take.
The latter are avoided oreliminated as far as possible, or transferred to insurers.
GROUP LEADERSHIP The Board is responsible for overseeing managements activities in EXECUTIVE TEAM identifying, evaluating and managing the risks facing the Group.
Importantly, we treat identifying and managing risk as an integral part of managing the business, and not as an additional bureaucratic chore.
Risks are recorded in the Groups risk register and regularly reviewed and evaluated.
Each risk has a business owner, responsible for managing that risk, implementing appropriate controls and mitigating actions and reporting IDENTIFY on it to the Leadership Team.
In turn, the principal risks are reported RISK onto the Board.
As a sense-check on managements actions, the Board undertakes its REGULARLY own assessment of principal risks in each year, which is then integrated ASSESS RISK REVIEW AND into the risk register.
