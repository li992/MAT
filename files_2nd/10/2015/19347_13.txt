Estimating the quantity and or grade of ore reserves requires the size, Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the samples.
