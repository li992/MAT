B6.3 RISK MANAGEMENT CULTURE The Board is committed to maintaining an effective risk management framework that is consistent and commensurate with the nature, complexity and risk profile of the business and is responsive to both internal and external events.
The Group is an inherently risk averse organisation which is expressed through the culture promoted by the Board and senior management.
This has resulted in historically low levels of credit and operational losses and the absence of any material conduct issues affecting customers.
The Group aims to help its customers by offering financial options which meet individual needs and achieve fair customer outcomes in a well-controlled environment.
The following risk principles are designed to support and protect the Groups strategic goals: Risk management is used to protect the Groups customers, shareholders, creditors and its reputation The fair treatment of customers and the delivery of fair outcomes is central to the Groups risk management approach The Group encourages a risk culture that has robust risk management at the heart of all decision-making within an open and transparent environment The Group only carries out business where the potential risk to itself and its customers has been considered together with the potential reward and where the residual risk exposure is within its designated risk appetite The Group utilises appropriate risk management processes to ensure that risks are identified, assessed, prioritised and managed in a consistent way Appropriate, timely and accurate risk management information is maintained and developed to support business decisions and to ensure the Group operates within agreed risk appetite B6.4 RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK Introduction The Groups risk management framework is designed to enable management to identify and focus attention on the risks most significant to its objectives and to provide an early warning of events that put those objectives at risk.
The framework includes: The Board Risk and Compliance Committee and its sub-committees described in B6.2 Dedicated teams within the Risk and Compliance function covering particular risk areas, described below A suite of risk policies, which include policies addressing: - Conduct risk - Complaint handling - Forbearance - Vulnerable customers - Operational risk - Credit risk - Compliance - Financial crime A professional Internal Audit function The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 117 Annual Report & Accounts 2015 Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Three lines of defence model The committee structures outlined above form the cornerstone for the governance of risk in a management framework organised within a developing Three Lines of Defence model as follows: The first line of defence, comprising executive directors, managers and employees, holds primary responsibility for designing, operating and monitoring risk management and control processes The second line of defence is provided by the Risk and Compliance function together with oversight provided by the Risk and Compliance Committee and supporting sub-committees The third line of defence is provided by the Internal Audit function and the Audit Committee which are responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defence The way in which this three lines of defence model aligns with the wider governance framework is illustrated below: The risk management framework is intended to provide a structured and disciplined approach to the management of risk.
The key objectives of the risk management framework are to: Establish standards for the consistent identification, measurement, monitoring, management and reporting of risk exposure and loss experience Outline the approach that will be taken in respect of setting and defining risk appetite and risk tolerances Promote risk management and the proactive reduction of the frequency and severity of risk events Facilitate adherence to regulatory requirements, including threshold conditions, capital standards and to support the regulatory requirements associated with the ICAAP Provide senior management and relevant committees with risk reporting that will be relevant and appropriate, enabling timely action to be taken in response to the information included within these reports Promote an appropriate risk culture across the Group PAGE 118 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance Annual Report & Accounts 2015 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Risk management function In order to further strengthen the effectiveness of the risk management structure, an integrated Group Risk and Compliance function was created with effect from 1 June 2015, reporting to the Group Chief Risk Officer, a new role within the Group.

Risk categorisation The maintenance of a standard, common risk language across the Group is a key enabler for risk identification and effective risk management.
It provides a consistent basis for risk assessment and the development of policy, risk appetite and appropriate risk management structures.
It also facilitates risk aggregation, risk reporting and segregation of accountabilities.
Accordingly, we use the following common risk categorisations: Business risk Credit risk Conduct risk Operational risk Liquidity and capital risk Market risk Pension obligation risk The principal risks identified under each of these headings are discussed in detail below.
