24 Vesuvius plc Section One Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Our Business The Board continually monitors the risks, both Risk internal and external, which could significantly impact the long-term performance of the Group.
Principal Risks The risks identified on pages 26 and 27 are those the Board considers to be the most relevant to the Group in relation to their potential impact on achievement of its strategic objectives.
All of the risks set out on pages 26 and 27 could materially affect the Group, its businesses, future operations and financial condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results.
These risks are not the only ones that the Group will face.
Some risks are not yet known and some currently not deemed to be material could become so.
Risk Management Risks are actively managed in order to mitigate exposure and, where cost effective, the risk is transferred to insurers.
The process for risk identification includes both top down and bottom up processes, which allow operational, functional, senior executive and Board members views on risk to be independently gathered to identify principal risks.
Once identified, the senior management owners for each principal risk update the mitigations of that specific risk and contribute to the analysis of likelihood and materiality.
This is reported to the Board.
We have also built a business structure that gives protection against the principal risks we face with diversified currencies, a widespread customer base, local production matching the diversity of our markets and intensive training of our employees.
During the year, the Group further developed its processes for business continuity planning, conducting workshops across the Groups major sites and business lines.
The Groups risks were also analysed in the context of viability, examining both financial and economic trend risks and significant event risks.
Board Monitoring Vesuvius operates a continuous process for identifying and evaluating significant risks, with regular reports made to the Board on the processes by which these are managed and mitigated.
Thus, the Board exercises its ultimate responsibility for the Groups risk management, by analysing major issues that have arisen during the year, considering how risks have changed over time, and assessing whether they are being effectively managed.

The Directors have determined that a three year period is an appropriate period over which to provide the viability statement because this is the period that the strategic business plan focuses on and is sufficiently funded by financing facilities with average maturity terms of 4.8 years.
In making this statement, the Directors have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks that may threaten the business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity of the Group.
This is embodied in the annual review of a three year bottom-up business plan process which includes a review of sensitivity to business as usual risks, such as profit growth and working capital variances, severe but plausible events and the impact on the central debt and headroom profile analysis.
The results take account of the availability and likely effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks.
Having considered all the principal risks identified by the Group, the following were selected for enhanced stress testing: an unplanned drop in customer demand, debt recovery risk due to customer default, reduction in earnings from increased interest charges and impact of volatility in foreign currency earnings.
Based on the results of these tests and considering the mitigating actions available to management, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period to 31 December 2018.
26 Vesuvius plc Section One Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Our Business Risk continued Changes to Risk in 2015 In 2015, the principal risks identified by the Group remained similar to those identified in 2014, though our ongoing review enabled us to refine some concerns, and recognise that two risks previously identified as being separate should be amalgamated.
Thus in 2015, as part of our review we combined product liability and loss of business reputation a risk added in 2014 into one risk area.
In addition in 2015 we identified more clearly the challenges posed by our Technical Services strategy and, as a consequence, successful delivery of this medium-term strategic aim is now characterised as one of our principal risks and uncertainties.
Having identified cyber security as a key risk in 2013, our ongoing assessment of Vesuvius exposure in this area led us to remove this from our principal risks in 2014 whilst noting that it remains, as for all companies, an area for our ongoing attention.
