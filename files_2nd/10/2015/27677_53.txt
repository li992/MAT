Financials 208 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED For the year ended 31 December 2015 F: Capital and Financial Risk Management F1: Capital management The Group manages its capital with a focus on capital efficiency and effective risk management.
The capital objectives are to maintain the Groups ability to continue as a going concern while supporting the optimisation of return relative to the risks.
The Group ensures that it can meet its expected capital and financing needs at all times having regard to the Groups business plans, forecasts and strategic initiatives and regulatory requirements in all businesses in the Group.
The Groups overall capital risk appetite is set with reference to the requirements of the relevant stakeholders and seeks to: Maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength to support stakeholder requirements Optimise debt to equity structure to enhance shareholder returns Retain financial flexibility by maintaining liquidity, including unutilised committed credit lines.
The primary sources of capital used by the Group are equity shareholders funds, subordinated debt and borrowings.
Alternative resources are utilised where appropriate.
Targets are established in relation to regulatory solvency, credit ratings, liquidity and dividend capacity and are a key tool in managing capital in accordance with our risk appetite and the requirements of our various stakeholders.
The individual companies in the Group are subject to regulatory capital requirements at an individual level.
In addition, the Group as a whole is subject to the solvency requirements of the Financial Groups Directive FGD as implemented by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
As at 31 December 2015, the unaudited pro-forma FGD surplus was estimated to be 1.7 billion 2014: 2.1 billion.
The FGD position will be submitted to the PRA by 30 April 2016.
With effect from 1 January 2016, the Group will measure Group solvency in accordance with the EU Solvency II Directive.
As at 1 January 2016, the unaudited pro-forma Group Solvency II surplus was estimated to be 1.6 billion.
Further detail as to the Groups regulatory capital surplus both FGD and Solvency II and that of subsidiaries is provided in the Annual Report and Accounts.
F2: Insurance risk risk arising within insurance contracts For accounting purposes insurance risk is defined as risk other than financial risk.
Contracts issued by the Group may include both insurance and financial risk.
Contracts with significant insurance risk are classified as insurance contracts, while contracts with no or insignificant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.
The Group assumes insurance risk by issuing insurance contracts, under which the Group agrees to compensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event the insured event affecting the policyholder occurs.
Insurance risk includes mortality and morbidity risk in the case of life assurance or risk of loss from fire, accident, or other source in the case of property & casualty.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to variable claims experience on life assurance, critical illness and other protection business and exposure to variable operating experience in respect of factors such as persistency levels and management expenses.
Unfavourable persistency, expenses and mortality and morbidity claim rates, relative to the actuarial assumptions made in the pricing process, may prevent the Group from achieving its profit objectives.
The Group has developed a risk policy which sets out the practices which are used to monitor and manage insurance risk as well as management information and stress-testing requirements.
The policy is cascaded to all relevant entities across the Group who each have their own risk policy suite aligned to the Group.
As well as management of persistency, expense and claims experience, the risk policy sets requirements and standards on matters such as underwriting and claims management practices, and the use of reinsurance to mitigate insurance risk.
The sensitivity of the Groups earnings and capital position to insurance risk is monitored through the Groups risk appetite reporting processes.
The insurance risk profile and experience is closely monitored to ensure that the exposure remains acceptable.
The financial impact of insurance risk events is examined through stress tests carried out within the IFRS sensitivities, ICA and Economic Capital assessment.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity risk is the risk that death, critical illness and disability claims are different from expected levels.
Possible causes are new and unexpected epidemics and widespread changes in lifestyle such as eating, smoking and exercise habits.
Higher than expected claims levels will reduce expected emerging profits.
For contracts where the insured risk is survival, the most significant factor that is likely to adversely impact the claims experience is continued improvement in medical science and social conditions that increase longevity.
For unit-linked contracts, a risk charge is applied to meet the expected cost of the insured benefit in excess of the unit value.
This risk charge can be altered in the event of significant changes in the expectation for future claims experience, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials The operations manage mortality and morbidity risks through its underwriting policy and external reinsurance arrangements where its 209 policy is to retain certain types of insurance risks within specified maximum single-event loss limits.
Exposures above accepted limits are transferred to reinsurance counterparties.
Persistency Persistency risk is the risk that policyholder surrenders, transfers or premium cessation on contracts occur at levels that are different to expected.
In order to limit this risk to an acceptable level, products including charging and commission structures are designed to limit the financial loss on surrender, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Persistency statistics are monitored monthly and a detailed persistency analysis at a product level is carried out on an annual basis.
Management actions may be triggered if statistics show significant adverse movement or emerging trends in experience.
Expenses Expense risk is the risk that actual expenses and expense inflation differ from expected levels.
Higher expenses and expense inflation may result in emerging profit falling below the Groups profit objectives.
Expense levels are monitored quarterly against budgets and forecasts.
An activity-based costing process is used to allocate costs relating to processes and activities to individual product lines.
Some products structures include maintenance charges.
These charges are reviewed annually in light of changes in maintenance expense levels.
This review may result in changes in charge levels, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Tax Tax risk is the risk that the projected taxation basis for basic life assurance business is incorrect, resulting in contracts being incorrectly priced.
Tax risk also represents potential changes in the interpretation or application of prevailing tax legislation as paid by either policyholders or shareholders, resulting in higher taxes reducing profitability or increasing shareholder tax burdens.
The taxation position of the operations is projected annually and tax changes will result in changes to new business pricing models as part of the annual control cycle.
High-risk issues and emerging trends are reported internally on a quarterly basis.
F3: Financial risk management A key component of our approach to capital management is to ensure that the Groups policies are aligned with the Groups overall strategy, business plans and risk appetite.
The Groups Capital Management Committee GCMC reviews the capital structure regularly.
The key focus of financial risk management for the Group is ensuring that the proceeds from its financial assets are sufficient to fund the obligations arising from its insurance and banking operations.
The most important components of financial risk are credit risk, market risk arising from changes in equity, bond prices, interest and foreign exchange rates and liquidity risk.
a Credit risk i Overall exposure to credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss to the Group by failing to discharge an obligation to repay cash or deliver another financial asset.
Credit risk in the group arise from a number of activities of the Group, namely banking lending, trading, investing and other activities of the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the financial loss from defaults.
Credit risk is managed through research and analysis at the time of investment or granting of the loan.
The Groups exposure and the credit rating of its counterparties are continuously monitored.
The Group is exposed to banking credit risk from lending and other financing activities, through its exposure to Nedbank and the banking operations within the Emerging Markets business.
Nedbanks lending portfolio forms a substantial part of the Groups loans and advances, as analysed in note G1.
Credit risk represents the most significant risk type facing Nedbank, accounting for the majority of its economic capital requirements.
Nedbanks credit risk profile is managed in terms of the credit risk management framework, which encompasses comprehensive credit risk policy, mandate limits and governance structures, and is approved by the Nedbank Board.
The Group is also exposed to the risk of credit defaults and movements in credit spreads from our insurance businesses.
This includes counterparty default risk, which also arises mainly from reinsurance and hedging arrangements.
The Group also has limited other credit risk exposures in respect of amounts due from policyholders and intermediaries.
Loans to policyholders are secured on the surrender value of the relevant policies.

The maximum exposure to credit risk with regards to derivative financial instruments represents the current fair value of these instruments and does not take into account the impact of any positive or adverse changes in the value of the derivative financial instruments.
The total credit exposure also includes potential exposure arising from financial guarantees given by the Group and undrawn loan commitments, which are not yet reflected in the Groups statement of financial position.

Market risk arises differently across the Groups businesses depending on the types of financial assets and liabilities held.
The Group has developed risk policies which set out the practices which are used to monitor and manage market risk.
These policies are cascaded to business units across the Group.
Each of the Groups business units has its own established set of policies, principles and governance processes to monitor and manage market risk within its individual businesses and in accordance with local regulatory requirements.
Group-level governance and monitoring processes provide oversight of these individual approaches to the management of market risk.
The sensitivity of the Groups earnings, capital position and embedded value to market risk is monitored through the Groups embedded value and risk appetite reporting processes.
ii Insurance operations For the Groups insurance operations, equity, property, volatility and interest rate risk exposure to capital and to earnings are quantified in accordance with the Groups risk appetite framework.
Additional detail is provided in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section.
In South Africa the stock selection and investment analysis process is supported by a well-developed research function.
For fixed annuities, market risks are managed where possible by investing in fixed interest securities with a duration closely corresponding to those liabilities.
Market risk on policies that include guarantees where shareholders carry the investment risk, principally reside in the South African guaranteed non-profit annuity book, which is closely matched with gilts and semi-gilts.
Other non-profit policies are also suitably matched based upon comprehensive investment guidelines.
Market risk on with-profit policies with guarantees is managed through appropriate asset-liability matching, which includes hedging, as per the PPFM Principles and Practices of Financial Management.
In Old Mutual Wealths unit-linked assurance operations, policyholders carry the full market risk, with the only risk to the Group being asset-based fee risk from charges on policyholder funds.
In respect of Old Mutual Wealths shareholders funds, market risk is addressed in Old Mutual Wealths investment policy, which provides for very limited opportunity for entities to invest their shareholder capital in equities and other volatile assets.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials For Old Mutual Bermuda, the market risk to shareholders post the sale of the business to Beechwood Bermuda Limited arises from the 211 retention of the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefits GMABs, which is reinsured by Old Mutual Bermuda Re Limited until the last guarantee has expired in August 2018.
These GMABs are US dollar-denominated guarantees.
The equity market risk and currency risk is managed through a hedging strategy.
The volatility risk associated with the GMAB is hedged by forward start options.
iii Banking operations The principal market risks arising in the Groups banking operations arise from: Trading risk in Nedbank Capital and Banking book interest rate risk from repricing and or maturity mismatches between onand off-balance sheet components in all banking businesses.
A comprehensive market risk framework is used to ensure that market risks are understood and managed.
Governance structures are in place to achieve effective independent monitoring and management of market risk.
Banking operations Trading risk Market risk exposures from trading activities at Nedbank Capital are measured using Value-at-Risk VaR, supplemented by sensitivity analysis, and stress and scenario analysis.
Limit structures are set accordingly.
The VaR risk measure for Nedbank estimates the potential loss in pre-tax profit over a given holding period for a specified confidence level.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-based approach that takes into account market volatilities as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.
Risks can be measured consistently across all markets and products, and risk measures can be aggregated to arrive at a single risk number.
The one-day 99% VaR number used by Nedbank represents the overnight loss that has less than a 1% chance of occurring under normal market conditions.
By its nature, VaR is only a single measure and cannot be relied upon on its own as a means of measuring and managing risk.

Nedbank uses standard analytical techniques to measure interest rate sensitivity within its banking book.
This includes static re-price gap analysis and a point-in-time interest income stress testing for parallel interest rate moves over a forward-looking 12-month period.
At 31 December 2015 the sensitivity of the banking book to a 1% instantaneous reduction in interest rates would have led to a reduction in net interest income over the next 12 months of 62 million 2014: 57 million.
OLD MUTUAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 Financials The table below shows the re-pricing profile of Nedbanks banking book, which highlights the fact that assets re-price quicker than 213 liabilities following derivative hedging activities: At 31 December 2015 m Up to 3 to 6 months 1 to More than Trading 3 months 6 months to 1 year 5 years 5 years and non-rate Total Interest rate re-pricing gap Total assets 26,195 1,486 1,013 1,957 1,035 8,883 40,569 Total liabilities and shareholders funds 23,346 1,136 1,446 889 558 13,194 40,569 Interest rate hedging activities 589 308 484 1,072 309 Repricing profile 3,438 658 51 4 168 4,311 Cumulative repricing profile 3,438 4,096 4,147 4,143 4,311 Expressed as a % of total assets 8.5% 10.1% 10.2% 10.2% 10.6% At 31 December 2014 m Up to 3 to 6 months 1 to More than Trading 3 months 6 months to 1 year 5 years 5 years and non-rate Total Interest rate re-pricing gap Total assets 29,517 1,492 1,295 2,559 902 9,204 44,969 Total liabilities and shareholders funds 27,068 1,459 1,514 918 265 13,745 44,969 Interest rate hedging activities 1,355 418 71 1,394 450 Repricing profile 3,804 451 148 247 187 4,541 Cumulative repricing profile 3,804 4,255 4,107 4,354 4,541 Expressed as a % of total assets 8.5% 9.5% 9.1% 9.7% 10.1% The analysis indicates that the maturity profile of financial assets is broadly matched to the financial liabilities due to derivative hedging activities.
This means that in the event of increasing interest rates, net interest income will remain stable in the short term.
F4: Currency translation risk The Group is exposed to movements in exchange rates from changes in the sterling value of surplus assets and earnings denominated in foreign currencies.
From a capital perspective, our capital is held where our risks are located and currency translation risk would only be realised if we were to require a transfer of surplus capital between regions during a period of stress.
The functional currencies of the Groups principal overseas operations are South African rand, US dollar and Euro.
Certain of the Groups business operations may undertake activities that are not in their functional currencies.
These activities, such as Nedbank, which has a functional currency of South African rand, lending in US dollar, are economically hedged by numerous activities such as the use of currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts.
These foreign currency translation tables below have been prepared on the basis that the values of the economic hedging instruments are reflected at their carrying value, as opposed to their notional amounts.
The tables are therefore a reflection of the foreign currency exposures in their respective currencies.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group manages liquidity by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Individual businesses separately maintain and manage their local liquidity requirements according to their business needs, within the overall liquidity framework established by Old Mutual plc.
The Group continues to meet Group and individual entity capital requirements, and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Groups available cash resources and, if necessary, available credit facilities.
The Groups liquid resources are held in large portfolios of highly marketable securities, for example listed bonds, actively traded pooled investments, equities and cash and cash equivalents.
Whilst most of the Groups policyholder and banking liabilities are generally repayable on demand, the Groups expectation is that policyholders and banking depositors will only require funds on an ongoing basis.
However, cash resources and other liquid assets are maintained in the event of a need for additional liquidity.
Information on the nature of the investments and securities held is given in note G2.
The Group extended the existing revolving credit facility of 800 million 2014: 800 million in August 2015 under the terms of the facility, resulting in a 727 million facility that matures in August 2020 and a 73 million facility that matures in August 2019.
Details, together with information on the Groups borrowed funds, are given in note G7.
The key information reviewed by the Groups Executive Directors and Executive Committee, together with the Groups Capital Management Committee, is a detailed management report on the Groups and holding companys current and planned capital and liquidity position, together with summary information on the current and planned liquidity positions of the Groups operating segments.
Forecasts are updated regularly based on new information received and also as part of the Groups annual business planning cycle.
The Group and holding companys liquidity and capital position and forecast are presented to the Old Mutual plc Board of Directors on a regular basis.
Additionally the Group conducts regular stress testing around liquidity requirements, as referenced in the Risks Section pages 82 to 97.
Group operating segments are required, both in terms of their local requirements and in accordance with direction from the holding company, to establish their own processes for managing their liquidity and capital needs and these are subject to review by their local oversight functions, with representation from the Group.
Further information on liquidity and the holding company cash flows is contained in the financial performance section of the Business Review section.
The Group does not have material liquidity exposure to special purpose entities or investment funds.
The contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities are set out in notes G4, G6, G7 and G8.
