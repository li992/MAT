Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 125 19 Financial instruments Accounting policy Financial instruments comprise investments other than investments in joint ventures or associates, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, payables and accruals, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
Investments other than investments in joint ventures and associates are classified as either held for trading or available for sale, as described in note 17.
These investments are typically classified as either Level 1 or 2 in the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of such investments is based on either quoted market prices or other observable market inputs.
Trade receivables are carried in the statement of financial position at invoiced value less allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Irrecoverable amounts are estimated based on the ageing of trade receivables, experience and circumstance.
Borrowings and payables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost other than fixed rate borrowings in designated hedging relationships for which the carrying amount of the hedged portion of the borrowings is subsequently adjusted for the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Where an effective hedge is in place against changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings, the hedged borrowings are adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with a corresponding income or expense included in the income statement within finance costs.
The offsetting gains or losses from remeasuring the fair value of the related derivatives are also recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
When the related derivative expires, is sold or terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged borrowing is amortised in the income statement over the period to maturity of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised net of tax directly in equity in thehedge reserve.
If a hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in therecognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of anasset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of hedges is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is either retained in equity until the firm commitment or forecasted transaction occurs, or, where a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, is immediately credited or expensed in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are classified as held for trading and recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement costs calculated using observable market rates of interest and exchange.
The fair value of long-term borrowings is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at observable market rates.
These instruments are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the IFRS13 fair value hierarchy.
The main financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk andcredit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Group businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The Groups businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, marketand credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements at competitive rates.
The balance of long-term debt, short-term debt and committed bank facilities is managed to provide security of funding, taking into account the cash generation cycle of the business and the uncertain size and timing of acquisition spend.
To accommodate the significant free cash flow generated by the Group and to capitalise on an inexpensive source of funding, a meaningful portion of the overall debt portfolio is typically kept short-term as long as there exists acceptable liquidity in the commercial paper markets and sufficient capacity under committed credit lines.
The Group's treasury policies ensure adequate liquidity by requiring a that no more than $1.5bn of term debt matures in any 12-month period, b that the sum of term debt maturing over the ensuing 12 months plus short-term borrowings is less than the sum of available cash plus committed facilities and c that minimum levels of borrowing with maturities over three and five years are maintained.
The treasury policies ensure debt efficiency by a targeting certain levels of short-term borrowings across a given year, b maintaining a weighted average maturity of the gross debt portfolio of approximately 5 years and c minimising surplus cash balances.
From time to time, based on cash flow and market conditions, the Group may redeem term debt early or repurchase outstanding debt in the open market.
126 RELX Group Annual reports and financial statements 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 Debt is issued to meet the funding requirements of various jurisdictions and in the currency that is needed.
It is recognised that debt can act as a natural translation hedge of earnings and net assets in currencies other than the reporting currencies.
For this reason, a significant proportion of the Groups net debt has historically been denominated in US dollars, reflecting the size and importance of the US businesses.
19 Financial instruments continued There were no changes to the Groups long-term approach to capital and liquidity management during the year.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and includes contractual gross cash flows to be exchanged as part of cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

The carrying amount of derivative financial assets comprises 36m 2014: 46m in relation to fair value hedges, 41m 2014: 60m in relation to cash flow hedges and 10m 2014: 3m not designated as hedging instruments, less 5m of cash collateral received from swap counterparties which has been offset against the related derivative financial assets 2014: 4m which has been added to the related derivative financial liabilities see 'Credit risk' below.
The expected cash flows in respect of the cash collateral have been included in the tables above together with the cash flows for the related cross-currency interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had access to a $2,000m committed bank facility maturing in July 2020, which was undrawn.
This facility backs up short-term borrowings.
All borrowings that mature within the next two years can be covered by the facility and by utilising available cash resources.
The committed bank facility, together with certain private placements, is subject to financial covenants typical to the Groups size and financial strength.
The Group had significant headroom within these covenants for the year ended 31 December 2015.
There are no financial covenants in any outstanding public bonds.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements and other information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 127 19 Financial instruments continued Market risk The Groups primary market risks are to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used by theGroup for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post-employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate exposure management The Groups interest rate exposure management policy aims to reduce the exposure of the Group to changes in interest rates at efficient cost.
To achieve this, the Group uses fixed rate term debt, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate options.
Interest rate derivatives are used only to hedge an underlying risk and no net market positions are held.
At 31 December 2015, 50% of gross borrowings were either fixed rate or had been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 18m 2014: 16m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2015.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 18m 2014: 16m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2015 is restricted to the change in carrying value offloating rate to fixed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash flow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives, of which there were none in the Group as at 31 December 2015.
Therefore, there would be no change 2014: no change in net equity from a theoretical change in interest rates.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of fixed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Foreign currency exposure management Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries other than those of each parent company.
Some of these exposures are offset by denominating borrowings in US dollars and other currencies.
Currency exposures on transactions denominated in a foreign currency are generally hedged using forward contracts.
In addition, recurring transactions and future investment exposures may be hedged, in advance of becoming contractual.
The precise policy differs according to the specific circumstances of the individual businesses.
Highly predictable future cash flows may be covered for transactions expected to occur during the next 24 months 50months for the Scientific, Technical & Medical subscription businesses within limits defined according tothe period before the transaction is expected to become contractual.
Cover takes the form of foreign exchange forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2015, the amount of outstanding foreign exchange cover against future transactions was 1.4bn 2014: 1.4bn.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2015 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 541m 2014: 524m.
This would be offset to a degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 286m 2014: 255m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2015 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 541m 2014: 524m and increase net borrowings by 286m 2014: 255m.
A retranslation of the Group's net profit for the year, assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures, would reduce net profit by 86m 2014: 80m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 86m 2014: 80m.
Credit risk The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result hasa credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
In certain situations, the Group enters into credit support arrangements with derivative counterparties to mitigate the credit exposures arising from hedge gains on the related financial instruments.
Under these arrangements, the Group receives or pays cash collateral equal to the mark to market valuation of the related derivative asset or liability on monthly settlement dates.
At 31 December 2015, 5m 2014: 4m of cash collateral had been received, and the resulting payable balance was offset against the related derivative assets of nil 2014: 4m added to the related derivative liabilities of 1m in the statement of financial position.
The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA3 by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
At 31 December 2015, cash and cash equivalents totalled 122m 2014: 276m, of which 91% 2014: 96% was held with banks rated AA3 or better.
