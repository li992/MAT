For the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements above, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis.
In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis, however each party to the master netting agreement or similar agreements will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
Note 22 Financial risk factors The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and the availability of funds to meet business needs.
The management of these risks is set out below.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board provides written principles for risk management, as described in the Principal risks and uncertainties on pages 22 to 25.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Debt issued at variable rates as well as cash deposits and short-term investments exposes the Groupto cash flow interest rate risk.
Debt issued at fixed rates exposes the Group to fair value risk.
The Groups interest rate management policy is explained onpage 25.
The Group has Retail Price Index RPI debt where the principal is indexed to increases in the RPI.
RPI debt is treated as floating rate debt.
The Group also has Limited Price lnflation LPI debt, where the principal is indexed to RPI, with an annual maximum increase of 5% and a minimum of0%.
LPI debt is treated as fixed rate debt.

The net counterparty exposure under derivative contracts is 1.4bn 2014: 1.2bn.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 14.7bn 2014: 13.3bn being the Groups total financial assets.
For credit risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 123.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed by short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition, the Group has committed facility agreements for 5.1bn 2014: 2.7bn, which mature between 2016 and 2019.
The Group has a European Medium Term Note programme of 15.0bn, of which 7.4bn was in issue at 28 February 2015 2014: 7.0bn, plus a Euro Commercial Paper programme of 2.0bn, 0.5bn of which was in issue at 28 February 2015 2014: nil, and a US Commercial Paper programme of $4.0bn, 0.7bn of which was in issue at 28 February 2015 2014: nil.
On 6 June 2014 and 1 July 2014, the Group issued 0.5bn and 2.0bn of long-term debt respectively.
During the year, the Group repaid 0.6bn, $0.5bn, 0.6bn, 6.5bn, CNY0.7bn and MYR0.1bn of long-term debt.
For liquidity risk relating to Tesco Bank, refer to the separate section on Tesco Bank financial risk factors on page 123.
The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives.
The potential cash outflow of 17.8bn is considered acceptable as it is offset by financial assets and trade receivables of 14.7bn 2014: 18.2bn offset by financial assets and trade receivables of 14.8bn.
The undiscounted cash flows will differ from both the carrying values and fair value.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
For index-linked liabilities, inflation is estimated at 3% for the life of the liability 2014: 3%.

Transactional exposures that could significantly impact the Group Income Statement are hedged.
These exposures are hedged via forward foreign currency contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional and fair value of these contracts is shown in Note 21: net investment exposure that arises from changes in the value of net investments denominated in currencies other than Pounds Sterling.
The Group hedges a part of its investments in its international subsidiaries via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies which are formally designated as net investment hedges: and loans to non-UK subsidiaries that are hedged via foreign currency transactions and borrowings in matching currencies.
These are not formally designated as hedges as gains and losses on hedges and hedged loans will naturally offset.
The impact on the Group financial statements from foreign currency volatility is shown in the sensitivity analysis below.
Sensitivity analysis The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-employment obligations and on the retranslation of overseas net assets as required by IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
However, it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from local entity non-functional currency financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 28February 2015.
It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due to financial instruments held at the balance sheet date.
It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked debt which has been swapped to fixed rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates or foreign exchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in foreign exchange rates are recorded directly in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments only affect the Group Income Statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with no impact on the Group Income Statement: and the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity that would result, at the balance sheet date, from changes in UK interest rates and currency exchange rates that are reasonably possible for major currencies where there have recently been significant movements: 2015 2014 Income Equity Income Equity gain loss gain loss gain loss gain loss m m m m 1% increase in interest rates 2014: 1% 57 5 10% appreciation of the Czech Koruna 2014: 15% 4 39 49 10% appreciation of the Euro 2014: 5% 31 39 1 24 5% appreciation of the Hungarian Florint 2014: nil 1 13 5% appreciation of the South Korean Won 2014: 10% 39 110 10% appreciation of the US Dollar 2014: 10% 3 96 4 161 5% appreciation of the Polish Zloty 2014: 5% 21 19 5% appreciation of the Hong Kong Dollar 2014: 10% 4 29 10% appreciation of the Turkish Lira 2014: 35% 1 79 A decrease in interest rates and a depreciation of foreign currencies would have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above.
122 Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Note 22 Financial risk factors continued The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income from changing exchange rates results from the revaluation of financial liabilities used as net investment hedges.
The impact on the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income will largely be offset by the revaluation in equity of the hedged assets.
The sensitivity movements in equity includes 100m 2014: 310m in relation to loans to Group entities that form part of their net investment.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while protecting and strengthening the balance sheet through the appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, buy back shares and cancel them, or issue new shares.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt capital market issues, commercial paper, bank borrowings, disposals of property assets and leases.
The policy for debt is to ensure a smooth debt maturity profile with the objective of ensuring continuity of funding.
This policy continued during the financial year with bonds redeemed of 1,493m 2014: 208m and 2,095m of new bonds issued 2014: 844m.
The Group borrows centrally and locally, using a variety of capital market instruments and borrowing facilities to meet the Groups business requirements of each local business.
Refer to Note 30 for the value of the Groups net debt 8.5bn: 2014: 6.6bn, and the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for the value of the Groups equity 7.1bn: 2014: 14.7bn.
Tesco Bank Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises where assets and liabilities in Tesco Banks banking activities have different repricing dates.
Tesco Bank policy seeks to minimise the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.
Potential exposures to interest rate movements in the medium to long-term are measured and controlled through position and sensitivity limits.
Short-term exposures are measured and controlled in terms of net interest income sensitivity over 12months to a 1% parallel movement in interest rates.
Tesco Bank also use Economic Value Equity EVE for risk management purposes with focus on the value of Tesco Bank in todays interest rate environment and its sensitivity to changes in interest rates.
Interest rate risk is managed using interest rate swaps as the main hedging instrument.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Tesco Bank is unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed within Tesco Banks banking activities and adheres to the liquidity requirements set by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
Tesco Banks Board has set a defined liquidity risk policy and contingency funding which is prudent and in excess of the minimum requirements as set out by the PRA and by Tesco Bank.
A diversified portfolio of high-quality liquid and marketable assets is maintained.
Cash flow commitments and marketable asset holdings are measured and managed on a daily basis.
Tesco Bank has sufficient liquidity to meet all foreseeable outflow requirements as they fall due and its liquidity risk is further mitigated by its well diversified retail deposit base and a pool of surplus cash resources that are invested in a range of marketable assets.
Credit risk Credit risk is the potential that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms.
Credit risk principally arises from the Banks retail lending activities but also from the placement of surplus funds with other banks and money market funds, investments in transferable securities and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.
In addition, credit risk arises from contractual arrangements with third parties where payments and commissions are due to the Bank for short periods of time.
Retail credit policy is managed through the credit risk policy framework with standards and limits defined at all stages of the customer lifecycle, including new account sanctioning, customer management and collections and recovery activity.
Customer lending decisions are managed principally through the deployment of bespoke credit scorecard models and credit policy rules, which exclude specific areas of lending, and an affordability assessment which determines a customers ability to repay an outstanding credit amount.
Wholesale credit risk is managed using a limit-based framework, with limits determined by counterparty credit worthiness, instrument type and remaining tenor.
A limits framework is also in place for the management of third party credit exposures.
Ineffective management and controls over the emerging asset quality of the Groups lending portfolios could expose the Group to unacceptable levels of bad debt.
The Groups asset quality is reflected through the level of its impairment by lending type.
Asset quality profiles are regularly monitored and reported to the appropriate senior management team and risk committees.
