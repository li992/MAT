Principal Risks and Uncertainties Risk management involves the identification and evaluation of risks and is the responsibility of the Group Board.
The Groups ability to manage risk is continually improving through the focus on risk management capability to ensure that it remains robust and that emerging risks are identified, assessed and managed effectively.
The risk management process incorporates both top-down and bottom-up elements to the identification, evaluation and management of risks, and all risks evaluated are referenced to the achievement of the Groups Strategic initiatives.
Risks are continually evaluated using consistent measurement criteria.
Mitigating controls are identified and opportunities for the enhancement of the Groups control environment are implemented.
Further information on the Groups risk management procedures is included in the Corporate Governance section on pages 64 to 66.
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on SiGs long-term performance.
