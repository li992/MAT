Principal risks and uncertainties Bal ancing risks and rewards We are transitioning the business to bring together all parts of the organisation as a connected whole One Sage, while at the same time the external risk environment in which we operate continues to evolve.
In light of this transition and these changes, we seek to ensure that the risk management framework continues to develop to meet our global needs.
We have continued to implement a number of enhancements during the year to drive greater consistency in activity, and improve governance surrounding these activities.
This ensures that risks continue to be managed appropriately and within agreed appetites.
As part of this process, the directors have carried out anassessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Risk environment Risk is inherent within our business activities, and we continue to prioritise and develop our risk management capability in recognition of this.
Timely identication of risks, combined with their appropriate management and escalation, enables us to successfully run our business and deliver strategic change, whilst ensuring that the likelihood and or impact associated with such risks is understood and managed within our dened risk appetite.
Risk governance We operate a formal governance structure to manage risk, which has been supplemented during 2015 with the introduction of two tiers of Risk Commiee.
