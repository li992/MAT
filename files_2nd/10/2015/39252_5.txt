Annual Report 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Company information AUK portfolio The combined AUK portfolio including Banbury Cross Retail Park was exchanged post year end for a combined purchase price of 489.7 million.
The portfolio comprises largely institutional quality assets which have strong property fundamentals and scope for adding capital value through active asset management.
The acquisition increases the Groups exposure to Greater London and the South East of England and includes four good quality distribution assets in established locations.
Assuming the full value of the AUK portfolio, 45.0% of the Groups portfolio will be in Greater London, the Big 6 UK regional cities Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and Leeds, and the Big 5 German cities Berlin, Dsseldorf, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich.
