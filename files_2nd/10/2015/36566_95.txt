These risks include market risk including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to economically hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board and management on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Groups management reports quarterly to the Board and bi-annually to the Audit Committee, an independent body that monitors risks and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.

Financial instruments continued Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: interest rate swaps and caps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the euro as their functional currency.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups exposure to foreign currency arises from the fact that there are foreign operations which transact business denominated in euro, with the translation of the local trading performance and local net asset to sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date giving rise to an exposure to fluctuations in the sterling: euro exchange rate.
The Groups approach to managing this exposure is to fund investments in euro-denominated operations with equity that is partly hedged by forward currency options to limit the overall exposure of the Group.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated financial instruments at the reporting date are as follows.
The carrying amount of the Groups non-financial instruments in euro-denominated operations is also presented.

At 31 December 2015 the net assets of the Group were 806.7 million 2014: 676.4 million of which 401.2 million were denominated in euro 2014: 348.8 million.
At 31 December 2015 the Group had currency options in place to buy 231.5 million for 317.5 million.
The table below shows the impact of a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling against the euro in relation to financial instruments alone.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap contracts.
98 Hansteen Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments during the year.
Increase decrease in profit before tax: Group Group Company Company 2015 2014 2015 2014 m m m m Increase interest rates by 1% 2.7 9.6 0.6 3.6 Decrease interest rates by 1% 3.0 7.5 0.4 0.4 There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
Interest rate swap and cap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Under interest rate cap contracts, the Group has limited its exposure to increases in interest rates by capping interest payable on its borrowings.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to theGroup.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is 79.9 million 2014: 128.5 million comprising trade and other receivables and cash and cash deposits.
The Groups principal credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade receivables of 7.5 million 2014: 7.8 million which consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to both the current and net assets of the Group and the Company.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the portfolio to either geographical business segment or company as the Group has a well spread diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 1% 2014: 1% of the gross rent roll.
Other receivables consist principally of tax and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
Cash deposits are held at banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which monitors the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements on a regular basis.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities.
As at 31 December 2015 the net debt to property value was 41.2% and the Group had 34.3 million of investment and trading properties that were not secured against the Groups borrowings.
