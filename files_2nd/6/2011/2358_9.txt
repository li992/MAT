Currency risk is not a consideration as the Group trades exclusively in the UK.
Analysis of net assets 2011 2010 With regard to interest rate risk, the Group from time to time m m will enter into hedge instruments to ensure that the Groups Net assets at 1 January 710.8 692.6 exposure to excessive fluctuations in floating rate borrowings is adequately hedged.

As the Group had no debt during the period of the hedge, these hedge instruments were regarded as ineffective and thus all costs were taken directly through income.
With the expiry of the hedge in March 2011, the Group assessed its future expected debt profile and, having quantified its interest rate risk, decided not to put in place a new hedge instrument for this facility.
The Group does not have a defined policy for interest rate hedging.
Credit risk is largely mitigated by the fact that the Groups sales are generally made on completion of a legal contract at which point monies are received in return for transfer of title.
During 2011, the Group continued to make a number of sales with the provision of a shared equity investment by the Group as a key part of the Groups sales incentive packages, either via the Government Home Buy Direct scheme or via the Groups own Jumpstart scheme.
This has led to an increase in the size of the Groups long term receivable Available for Sale Financial Asset balance which at 31 December 2011 was 38.7 million versus 31.1 million at 31 December 2010.
Whilst this does represent an increase in credit risk in total, each individual credit exposure is small given the high number of counter parties.
On average, individual shared equity exposure totals 23,000 2010: 24,000.
The Group has a 150 million syndicated facility which is committed to September 2013.
The Group regards this facility as adequate in terms of both flexibility and liquidity to cover its medium term cash flow needs.
