56 Man Group plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Review Our Approach to Reporting our Financial Performance In this years Annual Report we have adopted a different approach to presenting the financial statements and financial review.
We have summarised the key financial metrics of the business and the Key Performance Indicators on pages 20 to 25 to give you the salient facts regarding how our business performed this year.
The Financial Review contained on pages 54 to 75 gives a more detailed explanation of our financial performance by integrating the financial statements, accounting policies and explanations regarding our performance, capital and liquidity.
This section is aimed at giving salient information to you in a format that explains the relationships between funds under management, margins, profit, cash flow and capital, which underpin our sustainable business model.
The Additional Financial Information provided at the end of the Annual Report includes additional disclosures required to be compliant with accounting standards or the Companies Act.
Our view is that this Additional Financial Information is important but less significant to an understanding of our business and could be accessed through our website by readers requiring this level of detail.
Throughout the Annual Report we have added index tables and cross references to help navigate the report.
