leases are renewed or reviewed at current ERVs.
Further detail on the potential reversion is set out in the following tables and paragraphs.
For the UK it includes tenants break options.
For France, it is based on the date of lease expiry.
2 The ERV at 31 December 2011 for leases that expire or break in each year and ignoring the impact of rental growth and any rent-free periods.
The table above shows that over the period from 2012 to 2014, leases with current rents passing of 86.3 million will expire or are subject to tenants break clauses.
We estimate that additional rental income of 3.6 million per annum would be secured from these leases, assuming renewals take place at current rental values.
The potential for increased rents at the shopping centre and retail parks portfolios is tempered by the over-rented position of the offices.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of void periods, lease incentives or potential changes to rental values.
2 Projected rents for space that are subject to review in each year, based on the higher of the current rental income and the ERV as at 31 December 2011 and ignoring the impact of changes in rental values before the review date.
UK leases with rents passing of 99.1 million are subject to review in the next three years and, if reviewed to current rental values, we estimate that rents from these leases would increase by 6.5 million per annum by 2014.
In addition, assuming that outstanding rent review negotiations are concluded at current rental values, we would secure a further 3.2 million of annual rental income.
This is not a forecast and takes no account of potential changes in rental values before the relevant review dates.
The majority of leases in our French portfolio are subject to annual indexation rather than periodic review.
Tenant covenant strength Our ten most significant retail occupiers accounted for 57.8 million, or 17.8%, of rents passing at 31 December 2011, whilst 21.0 million, or 6.4% of rents passing, was represented by our five largest office occupiers.

The agencys risk indicator scale runs from one to five, where a score of one is low risk and two lower-than-average risk.
At the end of 2011, all of the top ten retail tenants were scored one.
Tenants with a low or lower-than-average risk indicator comprised 84% by passing rents of the UK retail portfolio and the score in that portfolio averaged 1.6.
At 31 December 2011, three of our top five office tenants had a low risk indicator and the others, one of which has its rent guaranteed by its parent company, were rated as two.
In the UK office portfolio at the end of 2011, the average risk score was 1.4 and 92% of passing rents was provided by tenants with a risk rating of one or two.
At 23 February 2012, in the UK 40 retail units were let to tenants in administration, and of these 20 continued to trade.
The equivalent figures in the French portfolio were 23 and 22 units respectively.
For the Group as a whole, income from tenants in administration no longer trading represented just 0.2% of passing rents at 31 December 2011.
Collection rates Despite the tough retailing environment, rent collection has remained excellent, with 98.4% collected within 14 days of the December 2011 quarter day in the UK, the same rate as was collected for the equivalent period in 2010.
For France the figures were 92.6% for the December 2011 quarter day and 85.1% for the comparative period in 2010.
