Financial review Continued strong performanCe The abg group achieved strong financial results over the course of the year with an increase of 26% in net earnings and earnings per share.
record gold prices lifted revenue and margins during the year, despite marginally lower production levels, positively impacting group net profit attributable to owners and ebiTda.
This enabled us to fund sustaining and expansionary capital expenditure while generating a further US$183 million in net cash flow to reach a year-end cash position of US$584 million.
cash margins per ounce improved to US$895 in 2011 from US$671 per ounce in the prior period as we were able to capture most of the increase in the gold price despite industry-wide cost pressures.
These cost pressures together with a slightly lower sales and production base meant that cash costs per ounce sold in 2011 increased from US$569 to US$692 per ounce sold.
The key finance initiatives during the year were: an amicable resolution of indirect tax recoverability through a future tax offset settlement with the Tra.
extension of the US$150 million undrawn revolving credit facility for a further 24 months with evergreen provisions to maintain financial flexibility going into 2012.
We achieved strong financial rebalancing of working capital requirements focusing on: Shortening the bullion and concentrate sales and receipts cycle, resulting from results over the course of the year.
a factoring arrangement and also leading to a second consecutive year of sales exceeding production.

gold prices averaged US$1,572 per ounce, a new annual average record and a US$347 per ounce improvement on the US$1,225 per ounce average in the prior year period.
The market price of gold has been influenced by low US dollar interest rates, sovereign debt concerns, investment demand and the monetary policies put in place by the worlds most prominent central banks.
as a result of the global easing of monetary policy, as well as large fiscal deficits incurred in the US and other major developed economies, there is a possibility that both inflation and US dollar depreciation could emerge in the coming years.
gold is viewed as a hedge against inflation and has historically been inversely correlated to the US dollar.
Therefore, higher inflation and or depreciation in the US dollar should be positive for the price of gold.
gold prices also continue to be influenced by negative long-term trends in global gold mine production, the impact of central bank gold purchases and investor interest in owning gold.
in 2011, central banks purchased an estimated 430 metric tonnes of gold, and investor interest led holdings by major global exchange traded funds to increase by 10 million ounces in the year to total 77 million ounces at the end of the period.
historically, gold has been viewed as a reliable store of value in times of financial uncertainty and inflation and as a fide facto global currency.

The year on year attributable US$000 2011 2010 gold sales volume decreased by 24,544 ounces but revenue benefited cost of sales from the higher average realised gold prices.
The decrease in sales ounces was primarily due to the lower production base as well as direct mining expenses 531,481 437,420 excess concentrate ounces on hand sold in 2010.
The average realised change in inventories 21,016 9,753 gold price was US$1,587 per ounce in 2011 compared to US$1,240 direct mining costs 510,465 427,667 per ounce in 2010. gold revenue amounted to US$1,150.0 million Third party smelting and refining fees 21,400 20,308 compared to US$921.3 million in 2010. royalty expense 38,100 31,549 depreciation and amortisation 134,149 109,515 co-product revenue included in total revenue amounted to Total 704,114 589,039 US$67.9 million for the year and increased by 26% from the prior year US$53.7 million.

This represents an increase of 22% from the prior year volumes.
The increased 2011 average realised copper price of US$3.82 US$437.4 million.
The key reasons for the increase can be attributed per pound compared to the prior year of US$3.54 per pound further to an overall increase in the operating cost of operations.

The 29% increase over the year was to stockpiles specifically at north mara and buzwagi.
driven by buzwagi and north mara due to higher open pit mining activities and the use of diesel spinning and back-up generated power in order to ensure stable and consistent power supply because of the difficulties in sourcing from the national power grid.
