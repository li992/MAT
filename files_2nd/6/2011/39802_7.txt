Total property return for the year was 0.8 per cent, a decline on the 6.8 per cent return for 2010.
This reects a consistent income return in comparison to the prior period, with the reduction attributable to the unrealised valuation deficit recognised in 2011 compared to a valuation surplus in 2010.

EPRA NAV per share at 31 December 2011 was 340 pence, compared with 376 pence as at 31 December 2010.
The decrease is largely as a result of the reduction in non-core property values, particularly in the second half of the year and dividends paid, offset by EPRA protgenerated.
