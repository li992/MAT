18 Business review | Chief Financial Officers overview Chief Financial Officers overview The continued growth in the profits of our Asian life insurance business was one of the highlights of our 2011 results, as Asia passed an important milestone 1 becoming the largest contributor to Group IFRS operating profit.
Nic Nicandrou 2011 was a productive year for Prudential during which we delivered strong Chief Financial Officer performance across all of our key metrics and made clear progress towards our 2013 Growth and Cash financial objectives.
At a Group level, the key headlines show that EEV new business profit new business 2 profit increased by 6 per cent to 2,151 million 2010: 2,028 million, IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns IFRS operating profit increased by 7 per cent to 2,070 million 2010: 1,941 million and underlying free surplus generation increased by 16 per cent to 1,983 million 2010: 1,714 million.
These results were delivered during a particularly challenging macroeconomic environment and are testament to the quality of our franchises across Asia, the US and the UK.
Growth 2 EEV new business profit In life insurance, new business profit was up 6 per cent to 2,151 million 2 2 2010: 2,028 million on APE sales in 2011 of 3,681 million 2010: 3,485 million 6% 2 resulting in a new business margin of 58 per cent 2010: 58 per cent.
The growth in 2,151m 2,028m both sales and new business profit was achieved while investing 14 per cent less capital than last year, reflecting our disciplined approach to optimising the balance between value creation and capital utilisation, and our ongoing focus on those products and geographies with the highest returns and shortest payback periods.
2 Asia produced new business profit of 1,076 million 2010: 902 million, and APE 2 sales of 1,660 million 2010: 1,501 million, up 19 per cent and 11 per cent 2010 2011 respectively on the previous year.
Our new business margin increased from 60 per cent to 65 per cent in 2011, driven by favourable country mix with a particularly strong performance in Indonesia, which is now the largest contributor to virtually all of our key financial metrics in Asia.
Jackson delivered new business profit of 815 million 2010: 761 million, up 7 per cent compared to 2010, based on APE sales of 1,275 million 2010: 1,164 million.
Our 58% new business margin in the US remains attractive at 64 per cent 2010: 65 per cent.
We New business margin continued to focus on variable annuities over the course of 2011 and APE sales in this product line grew by 15 per cent to 1,091 million 2010: 948 million.
We remain a top 3 three player in US variable annuities and continue to balance value, risk and capital.
In the UK, we delivered new business profit of 260 million 2010: 365 million and total APE sales of 746 million 2010: 820 million, down 29 per cent and 9 per cent respectively.
These declines are primarily due to the level of bulk annuity activity achieved in 2010, which was not repeated in 2011, as there were fewer attractive opportunities in which to deploy our capital in that segment of the market.
At a retail level, we delivered new business profit of 231 million 2010: 257 million and APE sales of 712 million 2010: 725 million as we continue to apply our value over volume approach, focusing on the product lines that produce the most attractive IRRs and payback periods.
In 2011 we delivered a retail new business margin of 32 per cent, down from 35 per cent in 2010, due to lower volumes of higher margin Notes individual annuities.

Prudential plc Annual Report 2011 Business review 19 Across our life insurance businesses we grew our shareholder-backed policyholder IFRS operating profit liabilities by 11.3 billion in 2011 to 133.5 billion.
This increase was driven by based on longer-term investment returns 9.0 billion of net inflows with the balance principally coming from foreign exchange and investment related movements.
7% In asset management, we have delivered 4.5 billion of net inflows over 2011 2,070m 1,941m 2010: 8.9 billion.
This is a good performance in what was a challenging year for asset managers.
At the end of 2011, our total funds under management were 351 billion, of which 111 billion are external assets.
M&G produced 4.4 billion 2010: 9.1 billion of net inflows in the period 3.9 billion retail, 0.5 billion institutional, an excellent result given the market backdrop.
M&G has ranked number 1 in the UK retail market for gross and net sales over the last 13 consecutive quarters based on data to the end of 1 December 2011.
At 31 December 2011 it had external funds under management of 2010 2011 91.9 billion, 3 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year.
External funds comprise 44.2 billion 2010: 42.5 billion of retail and 47.7 billion 2010: 46.8 billion of institutional assets.
Adding these funds to internal amounts, M&Gs total funds under management were 201.3 billion.
Eastspring Investments reported retail and institutional net inflows of 633 million in 2011 2010: 1.8 billion.
At the end of 2011, Eastspring Investments had 50.3 billion of funds under management, of which 19.2 billion were external assets.

South East Asia while The continued growth in the profits of our Asian life insurance business was one of the maintaining good highlights of our 2011 results, as Asia passed an important milestone becoming the 2 penetration of high largest contributor to Group IFRS operating profit.
Asias long-term business IFRS margin health and operating profit was up 32 per cent in 2011 to 709 million 2010: 536 million with particularly strong performances coming from our businesses in Indonesia, Singapore protection insurance, and Hong Kong.
We continue to see significant opportunities to grow both the size and and this should aid the productivity of our distribution channels across South East Asia while maintaining strong ongoing IFRS good penetration of high margin health and protection insurance, and this should aid performance.
Asias long-term EEV operating profit, a measure of the economic value creation in the year, grew by 22 per cent in 2011 to 1,764 million 2010: 1,450 million, further underlining the creation of sustainable value by these operations.
In the US, long-term business IFRS operating profit was down 17 per cent in 2011 to 694 million 2010: 833 million.
This reduction was due to the expected accounting impact of accelerated deferred acquisition cost DAC amortisation of 232 million 2010: 11 million, which masked an underlying improvement in earnings.
Excluding this effect, Jacksons earnings continued to grow during 2011 reflecting the rising asset base which generates both higher revenues and scale economies.
Fee income increased by 34 per cent from 506 million in 2010 to 680 million in 2011 as a result of the strong growth in separate account asset balances which at 31 December 2011 were 23 per cent higher at 38 billion 2010: 31 billion reflecting strong net inflows in variable annuities.
Spread income including the expected return on shareholders assets was 813 million in 2011 2010: 817 million and the average spread margin that we earned on general account liabilities increased from 243 bps in 2010 to 258 bps in 2011.

EEV operating earnings reduced by 9 per cent in 2011 to 853 million 2010: 936 million, principally reflecting the reduction in new business profits of our franchises across discussed above.
In asset management IFRS operating profit was up 22 per cent to 461 million compared to 378 million in 2010.
M&G including Prudential Capital delivered a record performance, growing IFRS operating profit by 26 per cent to 357 million, 2010: 284 million due to rising revenues which increased by 15 per cent on the prior year and a lower cost-income ratio of 60 per cent 2010: 63 per cent.
Eastspring Investments produced a good performance as rising revenues and a fall in the costincome ratio to 62 per cent 2010: 64 per cent drove IFRS operating profit higher by 11 per cent to 80 million 2010: 72 million.
Capital generation We take a disciplined approach to capital allocation across the Group.
Over the last few years we have taken several important steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital allocation process, emphasising an unbiased focus on the products and geographies with the most attractive profitability characteristics.
This has improved not only our returns on capital invested, but also our capital strength and capital fungibility.
In 2011 we have continued to produce significant amounts of free capital, which we measure as free surplus generated.
In 2011, we generated 2,536 million of underlying free surplus before reinvestment in new business from our life in-force and asset management businesses, up 8 per cent from 2,359 million in 2010.
We reinvested 553 million of the free surplus generated in the period into writing new business.
The majority of this reinvestment 297 million was into Asia, which remains the primary destination for investment within the Group.
In 2011 we have In the US, we invested 202 million in new business with a continued emphasis on variable annuities as we capitalised on the baby boomer demand for the product and continued to produce a weakened competitive environment following the financial market challenges of the significant amounts last few years.
In the UK, we invested 54 million in new business and our product of free capital, which focus remains annuities and with-profits bonds.
The IRRs on this invested capital were we measure as free more than 20 per cent in Asia, the US, and the UK, with payback periods of three years, surplus generated.
one year and four years respectively.
Of the remaining free surplus generated after reinvestment in new business, 1,105 million was remitted from the business units to Group.
This cash was used to meet central costs of 195 million, service net interest payments of 282 million and meet dividend payments of 642 million.
Furthermore, an aggregate 205 million was paid to secure new distribution agreements in Asia and to the UK tax authorities following the settlement reached in 2010.
The remaining free surplus generated in the period was retained within our businesses and this has bolstered local capital ratios.
The total free surplus balance deployed across our life and asset management operations increased from 3,338 million at the beginning of the period to 3,421 million at the end of the period.
Growth and Cash financial objectives The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties.
Prudentials actual future financial condition or performance or other indicated results may differ materially from those indicated in any such forward-looking statement, due to a number of important factors including those discussed under the heading Risk factors in this document.

Prudential plc Annual Report 2011 Business review 21 At our 2010 investor conference, entitled Growth and Cash, we announced new financial objectives demonstrating our confidence in continued rapid growth in Asia, and increasing levels of cash remittances from all of our businesses.
These objectives were defined as follows: 1 i Asia growth and profitability objectives: To double the 2009 value of IFRS life and asset management pre-tax operating profit in 2013 2009: 465 million : and To double the 2009 value of new business profits in 2013 2009: 713 million.
1 ii Business unit cash remittance objectives: Asia to deliver 300 million of net cash remittance to the Group in 2013 2009: 40 million : Jackson to deliver 200 million of net cash remittance to the Group in 2013 2009: 39 million : and UK to deliver 350 million of net cash remittance to the Group in 2013 2 2009: 284 million.
1 iii Cumulative net cash remittances: All business units in aggregate to deliver cumulative net cash remittances of at least 3.8 billion over the period 2010 to end-2013.
These net remittances are to be underpinned by a targeted level of cumulative underlying free surplus generation of 6.5 billion over the same period.
As mentioned in the Group Chief Executives report we believe we remain on track to achieve these objectives.
Below we set out in more detail our progress towards these objectives based on our results in 2011.

All of our All of our businesses businesses are now remitting considerable amounts of cash to Group and this is in line are now remitting with our strategy as we seek to move away from the historical reliance on the UK.

M&G delivered a large increase in the UK.
net remittances, reflecting its highly profitable growth and its capital-lite business model that facilitates a high dividend payout ratio from its earnings.
Asias remittances were also very strong in 2011 as it matures into an increasingly cash generative business, reaping the rewards of its significant growth and its health and protection product focus.
Against the cumulative 2010 to 2013 target of 3.8 billion, by the end of 2011 a total of 2,040 million has been remitted by business operations.
We remain confident of achieving this target.
Our confidence is underpinned by the strong underlying free surplus generation of our businesses which, by the end of 2011, had generated a total of 3.7 billion against our 2010 to 2013 cumulative target of 6.5 billion.
Capital position, financing and liquidity The Group has continued to maintain a strong capital position.
At 31 December 2011, our IGD surplus is estimated at 4.0 billion 2010: 4.3 billion, with coverage a very strong 2.75 times the requirement.
All of our subsidiaries maintain strong capital positions at the local regulatory level.
As mentioned above, Jacksons RBC ratio at the end of 2011 was 429 per cent.
In addition to our strong capital position, on a statutory Pillar 1 basis the total credit default reserve for the UK shareholder annuity funds also contributes to protecting our capital position in excess of the IGD surplus.
This credit default reserve, as at 31 December 2011, was 2.0 billion, notwithstanding the positive steps taken through 2011 to improve the credit quality of the 26.8 billion asset portfolio measured on a statutory basis.
This represents 33 per cent of the portfolio spread over swaps, compared with 43 per cent at 31 December 2010, when bond spreads over swap rates were much lower.
Importantly, it is equivalent to a default rate of 7.6 per cent over the life of these investments, considerably higher than what has been experienced historically for the types of fixed income securities that we hold.

development, the final outcome of Solvency II remains uncertain.
Despite this uncertainty, we continue to prepare for when the regime is eventually implemented.
Our financing and liquidity position remained strong throughout the year.
In December of 2011 we redeemed 500 million of Tier 2 subordinated notes at their first call date.
This redemption was effectively pre-financed via an issuance of US$550 million of Tier 1 subordinated notes in January of 2011, which raised 340 million net of transaction costs.
The next call on external financing is in December 2014 on the US$750 million of Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities.
Our central cash resources amounted to 1.2 billion at the end of 2011, a strong position.
We continue to engage with rating agencies in order to provide insurance financial strength ratings for the Groups insurance operations.
Prudentials senior debt is currently rated A by Standard & Poors, A2 by Moodys and A by Fitch.
Shareholders funds In 2011, investment markets experienced considerable volatility and recorded drops in both the global equity market indices and in long-term interest rates.
Despite these effects the Groups EEV shareholders funds increased by 8 per cent during 2011 to 19.6 billion 2010: 18.2 billion.
On a per share basis EEV at the end of 31 December 2011 stood at 771 pence, up from 715 pence at 31 December 2010.
IFRS shareholders funds were also 14 per cent higher at 9.1 billion 2010: 8.0 billion.
The increases on both reporting bases are the result of the Groups strong operating performance, offset by the relatively muted effect of the investment markets on the business, reflecting both the quality of the asset portfolio and the effectiveness of our proactive approach to risk management.

Barry Stowe Market overview Chief Executive The European debt crisis is driving significant uncertainty in the global Prudential Corporation Asia economy, however, Asia looks set to remain a world economic powerhouse as although lower external demand is impacting growth, regional and domestic demand remains robust.
1 2 The Asian Development Bank expects the Asian economies to grow by around 7 per cent in 2012, down from about 7.5 per cent in 2011 and 9 per cent in 2010, but still significantly higher than the rest of the world.
Over the last decade Asias sustained economic growth has resulted in the rapid 3 Total IFRS operating profit growth of the Asian middle class and now this is one of the fastest growing population groupings in the world.
Although Asia currently has less than 25 per cent of the worlds 32% middle class population, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 709m OECD sees this figure doubling in the next 15 years.
This middle class now have 536m increasing disposable income, assets and lifestyles they want to protect and the recognition of a need to plan their own financial futures, independent of any state provisions.
Asia is also seeing a significant rise in the incidence of non-communicable diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes as until comparatively recently people used to 2010 2011 die from infectious diseases and malnutrition before middle age ailments could arise.
However, now rich country diseases have very quickly become an issue in Asia.
The World Health Organisation expects the number of deaths in South East Asia attributable to non-communicable diseases or critical illnesses to increase by New business profit 20 per cent over the next 10 years and the number of diabetics in China is expected 19% to double by 2025.
These critical illnesses not only have the potential to decimate 1,076m individual families finances, they also impose a huge burden on the economy due to 902m lost working time through sick leave and acquired skills exiting the work force.
Raising awareness of lifestyle and related health issues together with the promotion of regular check ups, for example in relation to underwriting insurance policies, is becoming increasingly important as economies continue to develop.
Aligning to these developments, Asia is seeing a significant expansion of its savings and protection industry supported by governments and regulators.
For example, regulators 2010 2011 in China, Singapore and Malaysia have all recently stressed the importance of continuing to increase the rates of insurance penetration in their markets.
Regulatory standards are also being raised with, for example, greater emphasis on ensuring that products are fit for purpose and that customers fully appreciate the features of their policies.
Whereas compliance with the relevant regulations was always implicit in the way insurers ran their businesses, there is a trend towards a more explicit demonstration of this through documentation, audits and more formal management structures.

Distribution in the region remains dominated by traditional tied agency forces, but banks are becoming increasingly significant distributors.
The industrys growth has typically been constrained by the pace at which the insurers can build out distribution and assemble the infrastructures needed to administer and manage the increasing volumes of premiums generated by the business.
The size and significance of Asian insurers has increased in recent years.
A consequence of this has been their increased presence in the capital markets.
Today there is far more disclosure and analysis of the financial performance of the businesses than was the case a few years ago, but there is still some way to go before the industry has common reporting standards and accounting practices.
Market leadership is still typically gauged by simple sales metrics although this is changing as metrics that emphasise value generated using a risk-based assessment of returns to policyholders and shareholders are becoming more prevalent.
Regulators are now taking a broader view of market leadership too: leaders are expected to behave in an exemplary manner at all times, to drive improvements in all aspects of the business and to champion a variety of social initiatives.
Business performance Prudential has had operations in Asia since the 1920s, but began expanding its Asian business in 1994 as the Asian economic revolution was getting under way.
Today Prudential is a leading international insurer in Asia with six of its 11 operations being market leaders in terms of new business scale.
Prudential has established a high performance platform with multichannel distribution, a product portfolio based on regular premium savings policies with attached riders that provide additional protections and a well respected brand that is becoming increasingly well known as a champion of CSR initiatives including financial literacy.
Our strategy is focused on building high quality tied agency and complementary third party distribution channels, providing products that demonstrably meet customers savings and protection needs and strengthening and deepening customer relationships.
It continues to be driven in a highly focused and disciplined way.
While market outperformance in terms of new business growth is an indicator of success, Prudential prioritises quality of service, profitability, returns on capital and capital efficiency ahead of top-line growth.

Prudential has now delivered 10 consecutive quarters where the APE is higher than the same quarter in the prior year and the average growth rate over this period was 19 per cent including India.

Agency excluding India continues to be our largest distribution channel, generating 66 per cent of APE with a growth rate of 13 per cent over prior year.
We ended the year with 228,000 agents 365,000 including India.
However, although agency scale is important, management focus is also on further improving agent activity and productivity and we delivered a year-on-year increase in average active agents of 8 per cent, coupled with a 5 per cent increase in productivity.
Prudentials bancassurance model generated 29 per cent of APE in 2011 with a growth rate of 37 per cent over prior year.
New relationships that include our first full year of operations with UOB contributed 16 percentage points of this growth but our longestablished relationships with other partners including SCB, Maybank and SingPost also performed well, collectively growing 22 per cent over the prior year and reflecting our ongoing successes in generating value for our partners.
The new business mix for 2011 reflects our ongoing focus on regular premium savings with protection.
The proportion of regular premium business remains high at 91 per cent of APE and in line with prior years.
The proportion of protection business in the APE mix increased to 30 per cent from 27 per cent in the previous year while the proportion of linked business reduced to 32 per cent compared to 41 per cent in prior year principally due to a lower contribution from India and a move towards non linked policies in that market.
New business profits of 1,076 million are 19 per cent higher than last year and average new business profit margins increased from 60 per cent to 65 per cent.
The key driver for the increase in new business profit margin was a favourable change in country mix, in particular, a lower proportion of sales from India.
EEV profits from our in-force business of 688 million are up 25 per cent on prior year mainly driven by higher unwind as the scale of the book continues to grow.
We continue to review and update our models to reflect evolving experience trends and for year end 2011 we made a number of changes that resulted in a net positive assumption change of 10 million.
This included net positive changes, mainly on mortality and morbidity, totalling 150 million that were offset by a remodelling of withdrawal and lapse trends.
The main contributor to this negative adjustment was Malaysia where in the second half of 2011 we decided to strengthen our assumptions to reflect our recent experience on our PruSaver product riders in Malaysia where policyholders that had accumulated gains on the savings component of their unit-linked policies realised some of these when markets were high while continuing to make their regular premium payments.
This amounted to a negative charge to in-force profits of 108 million and remodelling of lapse trends in other markets such as India amounted to a net 32 million.
Actual net experience variances for the year were positive 65 million reflecting better than expected performances.
The assumption changes and variances remain very small in the context of total EEV shareholders funds of 8.5 billion.

New business strain as a percentage of APE reduced during 2011 to 3.3 per cent compared to 3.7 per cent in 2010, driven by favourable product and country mix.
During 2011, shareholder-backed business policyholder liabilities have increased to 18.3 billion 2010: 17.7 billion.
Our strong business momentum saw net insurance inflows of 1.8 billion up 42 per cent on last years equivalent amount of 1.3 billion, which were offset by falls in market value.
As expected outflows including those from partial withdrawals are at a lower run rate than 2010, both in absolute terms and when expressed as a percentage of opening policyholder liabilities.
Underlying free surplus generated by the life operations grew by 26 per cent to 410 million as the emergence of profits from the in-force book is increasing at a faster rate than the investment in new business.
The cash generating capacity of the life business is clearly demonstrated by net remittances of 239 million to the Group during 2011.
This includes 6 million as Prudentials share of the first dividend ever to be paid by a life insurance company in India since the industry was nationalised in the 1950s.

During 2011, the US equity markets continued to be challenging for the financial services industry, with higher volatility returning during the second half of the year, along with a decline of interest rates to historically low levels.
Despite a very volatile year, the S&P 500 index recovered from the large falls in the third quarter to finish flat for the year.
Implied volatility ended the year higher than that at year end 2010.
Overall, rates on 10-year treasuries reached new historical lows during the second half of 2011, finishing the year below 2 per cent, while AA corporate spreads widened from year end 2010 levels.
In such an environment, Jacksons asset and liability management continues to incorporate equity and interest rate exposure on an aggregate basis in order to ensure that total economic risk is hedged effectively within our established policy limits.
Jackson continues to adapt its hedging programme to market conditions in order to ensure continued strong risk management.
Despite historically low interest rates, volatile equity markets and the fluctuations in equity volatility experienced in 2011, Jacksons hedging programme continued to perform well, mitigating the impact of the macroeconomic challenges and supporting our robust capital position.
Jacksons approach to pricing and hedging has always been to adopt a conservative stance and we believe that this positions Jackson well to outperform its peers during periods of market dislocation.
Policyholder behaviour in 2011 continued to trend in line with both our pricing and reserving expectations.
The uncertain environment continues to provide an advantage to companies with good financial strength ratings and a track record of financial discipline.
Companies that were hardest hit by the market disruptions over the last few years still have to work to regain market share as customers and distributors seek product providers that offer consistency, stability and financial strength.
Jackson continues to benefit significantly from this flight to quality and heightened risk aversion.
Thanks to our financial stability and innovative products, we continue to enhance our reputation as a high-quality and reliable business partner, with sales increasing as more advisers have recognised the benefits of working with Jackson.
A significant part of Jacksons growth continues to come from an increase in its distribution penetration with sales through distributors who either did not previously sell Jacksons products or simply did not sell variable annuities.
In the second half of 2011, Jackson entered into another wirehouse distribution agreement further extending Jacksons ability to reach all major wirehouse firms in the US on attractive terms.
Our strategy focuses on balancing value, volume, capital efficiency, balance sheet strength and strict pricing discipline for both variable and fixed annuities.

Jacksons product diversity allows the company to quickly adapt to changing market conditions and sustain appropriate sales levels in all phases of the business cycle.
During the second half of 2011, sales slowed relative to the first half run rate due to proactive changes we made to our product offerings and shifts in the competitive environment.
During the third quarter, Jackson implemented various product initiatives to enhance product diversity and margins and further optimise the balance between 2010 2011 growth, capital and profitability.
Innovate around our key variable annuity product Jackson continues to innovate its product offerings, implementing various changes in 2011 to manage profitability, to comply with revised regulations and enhance risk management flexibility.

In 2011, for the sixth consecutive year, consecutive year, Jackson was rated as a World Class service provider by Service Jackson was rated Quality Measurement Group.
Jackson was able to provide this level of service in 2011 as a World Class while processing record retail sales, and decreasing its ratio of statutory general service provider expenses to average assets one measure of efficiency to 42 basis points, compared by Service Quality to the 2010 level of 44 basis points.
Financial performance IFRS pre-tax operating profit was 694 million in 2011, down 17 per cent from 833 million in 2010.
As previously indicated, this reduction was due to the expected accounting impact of accelerated deferred acquisition cost DAC amortisation of 232 million 2010: 11 million, which masked an underlying increase in earnings driven by higher fee income on separate account assets.
At 31 December 2011, Jackson had 37.8 billion in separate account assets, an increase of 21 per cent compared to 31.2 billion in 2010.
The increase in separate account assets primarily reflects the impact of substantial positive net flows.
This growth resulted in variable annuity separate account fee income of 680 million in 2011, up 34 per cent over the 506 million achieved in 2010.
38 Business review | Insurance operations | United States | continued Strengthening United States 2013 Financial objective Total spread income, including the expected return on shareholders assets, was 813 million in 2011, compared to 817 million in 2010.
Excluding the expected return Deliver 200 million on shareholders assets, spread income was 730 million, an increase of 38 million of net cash remittance over 2010.
Spread income benefited by 113 million from swap transactions entered to the Group into to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration 2010: 108 million.
This effect combined with the reduction in crediting rates has mitigated the downward pressures created by the lower interest rate environment.
Acquisition costs have increased in absolute terms compared to 2010 due to the growth in sales volumes.
However, acquisition costs as a percentage of APE have decreased to 70 per cent for 2011, compared to 73 per cent for 2010.
The DAC amortisation charge increased in 2011 to 619 million 2010: 334 million.
This comprises a core charge of 387 million 2010: 323 million and an accelerated charge of 232 million 2010: 11 million.
The higher core charge is in line with the increase in fee income and spread profits.
The accelerated charge reflects the anticipated additional amortisation of 166 million relating to the reversal of the benefit received in 2008 from the mean reversion formula and a charge of 66 million caused by lower than assumed separate account returns.
Administration expenses increased to 412 million in 2011 compared to 344 million in 2010, with the increase due primarily to higher asset-based commissions paid on the larger 2011 separate account balance.
These asset-based commissions paid upon policy anniversary dates are treated as an administration expense as opposed to a cost of acquisition and are offset by higher fees.
Jackson continues to actively manage its investment portfolio to mitigate investment risk.
Jackson reported net realised gains on debt securities of 106 million in 2011 compared to 11 million in 2010.
This comprises interest related realised gains during the period of 158 million 2010: 224 million, primarily due to sales of government and corporate debt, net recoveries on sales of previously impaired securities of 10 million 2010: losses of 89 million and bond write-downs of 62 million 2010: 124 million.
In addition to the net realised gains on debt securities described above, Jackson had write-downs of 28 million 2010: 12 million on commercial mortgage loans.
In 2011 and 2010, Jackson did not experience any defaults in its debt securities portfolio.
The net unrealised gain position has increased from 1,210 million at 31 December 2010 to 2,057 million at 31 December 2011 due primarily to the continued decline in the US Treasury rates.
Gross unrealised losses decreased from 370 million at 31 December 2010 to 246 million at 31 December 2011.
Jackson delivered record APE retail sales of 1,251 million in 2011, representing a 7 per cent increase over 2010 12 per cent at constant exchange rates.
Jackson has achieved these sales levels, while maintaining its pricing discipline, as it continued to write new business at aggregate internal rates of return IRR in excess of 20 per cent.
In 2011, record variable annuity VA APE sales of 1,091 million were 15 per cent higher than in 2010, as Jackson continued to benefit from its customers and distributors flight to quality.
Although we do not target volume or market share, these market conditions allowed Jacksons ranking to remain at third in variable annuity sales in the US for 2011, while increasing its market share to 11.4 per cent from 10.7 per cent 1 for the full year 2010.
Jackson ranks first among VA providers for adviser loyalty.
Jackson also earned the top ranking for satisfaction with external and internal 2 wholesaler support among VA providers.
Jacksons strategy of proactively managing fixed annuity FA volumes resulted in APE sales of 47 million, 44 per cent lower than in 2010.
Jackson ranked 14th in sales of traditional deferred fixed annuities through the third quarter of 2011, with a market share 3 of 1.9 per cent, compared to eighth with a 3.4 per cent market share for the full year 2010.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2011 Business review 39 Fixed index annuity FIA APE sales of 93 million in 2011 were down 15 per cent from 2010 as Jackson continued to focus its marketing efforts on higher margin VA products.
Jackson ranked ninth in sales of fixed index annuities through the third quarter of 2011, with a market share of 4.6 per cent, down from sixth and a market share of 5.2 per cent 4 in the full year 2010.
Jacksons growth moderated during the latter part of the year, with full year total retail annuity net flows of 8.5 billion in 2011, an increase of 6 per cent compared to 2010.
This modest increase was due to the impact of volatility in the S&P 500 experienced during the second half of the year, along with various product initiatives that were implemented during the third quarter.
These initiatives were taken in order to optimise the balance between growth, capital and profitability.
Retail annuity net flows continued to benefit from increased sales and continued low levels of surrender activity.
Jackson remained the third largest seller of individual annuities in the United States through the third quarter of 2011, with a market share of 8.4 per cent, up from 1 a market share of 8.0 per cent for the full year 2010.
EEV basis new business profit of 815 million was up 7 per cent on 2010, broadly in line with the 10 per cent increase in total APE sales.
Total new business margin was 64 per cent, compared to 65 per cent achieved in 2010.
The variable annuity new business margin of 69 per cent in 2011 decreased from 72 per cent in 2010.
The adverse effect on margin of the 142 bps decline in 10-year Treasury rates was largely mitigated by pricing actions taken over the past 15 months and a favourable shift in VA business mix.
The fixed indexed annuity new business margin remained flat at 41 per cent in 2011.
Lower assumed target spreads and future reinvestment yields have resulted in a decrease in the fixed annuity new business margin from 34 per cent to 29 per cent.
Total EEV basis operating profit for the long-term business in 2011 was 1,431 million, compared to 1,458 million in 2010.
In-force profits were 81 million lower than 2010, partially offset by the 54 million increase in new business profit.
The decline in in-force profits to 616 million 2010: 697 million was driven largely by a lower contribution from the unwind of the discount on the opening embedded value, as a result of lower interest rates, and by lower positive operating experience variances than seen in 2010.
In 2011, Jackson invested 202 million of free surplus to write 1,275 million of new business APE 2010: 300 million and 1,164 million, respectively.
The reduction in capital consumption year-on-year principally reflects the benefit of lower costs generated by economies of scale and favourable business mix in 2011.
Jackson wrote a higher proportion of variable annuity business, which consumes lower levels of initial capital and has lower initial reserving requirements as a result of product changes effected at the end of 2010.
Jacksons RBC level at the end of 2011 was 429 per cent, which compares to 483 per cent 5 in 2010.
Jackson continues to have in place a SSAP 86 permitted practice which has the effect of valuing the interest rate hedge programme at cost, thereby not recognising in the RBC ratio the significant mark to market gains on this programme that arose from the decline in interest rates during 2011.
The RBC ratio would be 482 per cent 2010: 470 per cent without the permitted practice.
Jacksons RBC ratio remains at an appropriate level despite net remittances of 322 million during 2011, a testament to both the strength of Jacksons balance sheet and the effectiveness of the hedging programme.

Rob Devey Market overview Chief Executive The UK life & pensions market, which is mature and the third largest in the Prudential UK and Europe world, is characterised by a concentration of wealth in the 45 to 74 age group and an ageing population, as the baby boomers get older and progressively move into retirement.
Many of these individuals are insufficiently prepared financially for the prospect of spending longer in retirement and as a result, are considering extending their working lives while adopting a more flexible approach towards retirement.
Prudential UK is well positioned to help the baby boomers and subsequent generations meet their financial needs both as they approach and during retirement through its range of market leading with-profits and annuity products.
In 2011 Prudential UK continued to pursue a value over volume strategy, actively choosing to compete selectively in the retirement savings and income markets, and balancing the writing of new business with sustainable cash generation and capital preservation.
Business performance Strategic focus on core strengths Prudential UK has a strong individual annuity business, built on a robust pipeline of internal vestings from maturing individual and corporate pension policies.
The internal vestings pipeline is supplemented by sales through intermediaries and strategic partnerships with third parties where Prudential is the recommended annuity provider for customers vesting their pensions at retirement.
Sales of individual annuities of APE 179 million were 13 per cent lower than in 2010 as Prudential UK continues proactively to manage the flow of external conventional new business to control capital consumption.
The proportion of with-profits annuity sales continues to increase, from 22 per cent in 2010 to 25 per cent in 2011.
Internal vestings sales of APE 122 million, were 2 per cent lower than in 2010, when a change in the minimum retirement age from 50 to 55 resulted in a temporary increase in sales, and a reduction in expected vestings in 2011.
Sales of external annuities of APE 57 million were down 30 per cent on the same period last year, mainly due to the end of a partnership agreement in the second half of 2010, consistent with Prudential UKs value over volume strategy.

During 2011, Prudential UK reintroduced the PruFund Total IFRS Protected Growth Fund, with a range of guarantees added to both the Growth and operating profit Cautious funds.
The PruFund range comprised 74 per cent of with-profits bond sales, driven by customer demand for products offering smoothed investment returns and optional capital guarantees.
Since inception in 2004, PruFund has accumulated 5.4 billion funds under management.
2011 also saw the launch of four new Risk Managed PruFunds, which combine the strengths of our PruFund proposition with elements of the risk-managed approach adopted by our unit-linked Dynamic Portfolios.
Corporate pensions sales of APE 233 million were 5 per cent higher than in 2010, with strong sales to new members of existing private sector schemes in the first half of the year due in part to existing customers transferring members from their defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes.
Prudential UK continues to focus on retaining and developing existing schemes, securing new members and incremental business.
Sales of other products, principally individual pensions, PruProtect, PruHealth and offshore bonds, of APE 122 million were 8 per cent below 2010.
Within this, however, individual pensions sales including income drawdown of APE 72 million were 4 per cent above last year.
Sales of the Flexible Retirement Plan, Prudential UKs Retail Distribution Review RDRcompliant individual pension and income drawdown product, grew by 20 per cent to APE 27 million.
In the Wholesale market, Prudential UKs aim is to continue to participate selectively in bulk and back-book buyouts using its financial strength, superior investment track record and annuitant mortality risk assessment and servicing capabilities.
In line with this approach, Prudential UK signed two bulk annuity buy-in insurance agreements in 2011, totalling 33 million APE 2010: 93 million APE.
Prudential UK will continue to maintain a strict focus on value and only participate in capital-efficient transactions that meet its return on capital requirements.

44 Business review | Insurance operations | United Kingdom | continued Focusing United Kingdom With-profits performance The strength and performance track record of Prudential UKs With-Profits Fund is widely recognised.
Despite extreme market volatility in 2011 the Fund continues to provide customers with solid returns over medium to long-term time horizons.
Over 10 years the Fund has delivered investment returns of 92.7 per cent, which compares favourably with other with-profits funds and the FTSE All-Share Index total return of 59.5 per cent over the same period.
This strong medium to long-term performance has shown that with-profits, when invested in an actively managed and financially strong fund like Prudentials, continues to be a very attractive medium to long-term investment, offering strong annualised returns compared with other investment options.
Prudentials with-profits customers benefit from the security offered by Prudentials large inherited estate, with the free assets of the with-profits fund valued at approximately 6.1 billion at the year end, valued on the regulatory realistic basis.
Launch of direct advice service In December 2011 Prudential UK launched a direct advice service, Prudential Financial Planning, to offer financial advice to existing customers who originally came to Prudential through its direct sales force.
Starting with 25 advisers, the expectation is that this channel will grow further in 2012 to meet customer demand.
Enhancing customer service Prudential UKs focus on delivering improved levels of customer service was recognised again at the 2011 Financial Adviser Service Awards, where it achieved two 5-Star ratings for excellent service in the Life & Pensions and Investment categories.

EEV new business profit reduced by of net cash remittance 29 per cent to 260 million and the total new business profit margin was 35 per cent for to the Group the period, 10 percentage points lower than in 2010.
This reduction reflected the lower impact of bulk annuity transactions in 2011.
The 2011 transactions generated EEV new business profit of 28 million 2010: 106 million and IFRS operating profit of 23 million 2010: 63 million.
Retail sales of APE 712 million excluding credit life and bulk annuities were 2 per cent below last year, a reflection of Prudentials strategy to allocate capital to opportunities that play to the core strengths of the business rather than pursuing top-line sales growth.
Retail EEV new business profit at 231 million was 10 per cent below 2010 257 million.
Retail new business margin reduced to 32 per cent, 3 per cent down on 2010, primarily driven by a changing business mix of lower shareholder-backed annuity sales and higher sales of corporate pensions.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2011 Business review 45 IFRS total operating profit was 1 per cent above the previous year at 723 million.
Of this total, 293 million 2010: 310 million relates to with-profits and 390 million 2010: 363 million to shareholder-backed business reflecting higher annuity profits.
Commission received on Prudential-branded General Insurance products contributed 40 million to IFRS operating profit in 2011, 6 million lower than in 2010 as the book of business originally transferred to Churchill in 2004 is, as expected, decreasing.
EEV total operating profit of 893 million was down 9 per cent, mainly due to the fall in new business profits.
Life in-force profits were higher at 593 million 2010: 571 million.
The contribution from the unwind of the discount on the opening embedded value was lower by 65 million reflecting the 151 bps reduction in long-term gilt yields.
The effect of this was offset by higher experience profits and 79 million favourable assumption change arising from the reduction in the long-term tax rate to 25 per cent.
Prudential UK continues to manage actively the retention of the in-force book.
During 2011, the experience at an aggregate level was in line with long-term assumptions.
Prudential UK writes with-profits annuity, with-profits bond and with-profits corporate and individual pensions business in its Life Fund, with other products backed by shareholder capital.
The weighted average post-tax IRR on the shareholder capital allocated to new business in the UK was in excess of 20 per cent and the undiscounted payback period on that new business was four years.
Underlying free surplus generated from the long-term in-force business in the UK amounted to 503 million 2010: 529 million.
Of this total, 54 million 2010: 65 million was reinvested in writing shareholder-backed business at attractive average IRRs.
At half year 2010 Prudential announced that the UK business had achieved its cost savings target of 195 million per annum.
At the end of 2010, the business announced a number of cost saving initiatives to reduce costs by a further 75 million per annum by the end of 2013.
The business has made good progress towards this objective and remains on track to deliver these savings by the end of 2013.
During 2011 Prudential UK remitted cash of 297 million to the Group, comprising 223 million from the annual with-profits transfer to shareholders and 74 million from the shareholder-backed business.
The business aims to generate 350 million per annum of sustainable cash remittances by 2013, supported by the strength of the with-profits business and surpluses arising from the large book of shareholder-backed annuities, maintained into the future by the pipeline of maturing individual and corporate pensions.

M&Gs 2011 financial performance continues the momentum from the strong full year results recorded in 2010.
Michael McLintock Market overview Chief Executive M&G is the UK and European fund manager of the Prudential Group with M&G responsibility for investments on behalf of both internal and external clients.
M&G is an investment-led business whose aim is to generate superior long-term returns for its third-party investors and the internal funds of the Prudential Group.
This is achieved by creating an environment that is attractive to investment talent.
Our investment performance has been robust in the face of ongoing macroeconomic instability.
Over the three years to 31 December 2011, 25 retail funds representing approximately 76 per cent of retail funds under management FUM, delivered first and second quartile investment performance.
The performance of our actively managed external institutional fixed income mandates also remains very strong with all of the mandates meeting or outperforming their benchmarks over the three years to 31 December 2011.
In the retail market, M&Gs aim is to operate a single fund range and to diversify the distribution base by accessing a wide variety of channels and geographies.
In recent years, this has resulted in significantly increased sales of UK-based funds in European and other international markets.
In the institutional marketplace, M&Gs approach centres on leveraging capabilities developed primarily for the Prudential internal funds to create higher margin external business opportunities.
This has allowed M&G to offer third-party clients, such as pension funds, an innovative range of specialist fixed income and related strategies, including private debt opportunities in leveraged finance, and infrastructure investment.
Market context Following considerable uncertainty over sovereign debts on both sides of the Atlantic and concerns over the lack of global economic growth, the third quarter of 2011 saw the FTSE 100 suffer its worst quarter for nine years, falling 14 per cent.
Markets rebounded over the fourth quarter with the index rising by 9 per cent.
M&Gs FUM has proved resilient in the face of the market volatility experienced over the second half of the year.
From a FUM level of 194.4 billion at the end of 30 September 2011, M&Gs FUM increased to 201.3 billion by 31 December 2011.
This included external funds under management, representing 46 per cent of total FUM, of 91.9 billion quarter to 30 September 2011: 87.3 billion.

After 26% two successive years of extremely high net sales, it was our expectation that net fund 357m flows would revert to somewhat lower levels in 2011 especially in light of the economic 284m headwinds experienced over the year.
However, while net sales are indeed lower, they remain strong.
Our ability to maintain this sales performance over the year again demonstrates our strength and depth across all the main asset classes and distribution channels.
Gross new business wins for the fourth quarter to 31 December 2011 totalled 2010 2011 6.2 billion, compared to 6.4 billion for the previous quarter.
Outflows totalled 4.4 billion quarter to 30 September 2011: 6.7 billion, resulting in net inflows for the quarter of 1.8 billion.
This was a positive turnaround on the total net outflow of 288 million experienced in the quarter to 30 September 2011. www.

50 Business review | Asset management | M&G | continued Optimising Asset management M&G Retail As announced previously, volatile market conditions and reduced investor confidence led to a considerable worsening of the sales environment in the overall market during the second half of 2011, in both Europe and the UK, and particularly for equity products.
The European funds industry suffered net outflows of 69.3 billion in 2011 only the 1 second time in the past decade net outflows were 298 billion in 2008.
This result masks a significant divide between the first half of the year, which saw net inflows of 96 billion, and the second half with net outflows of around 165 billion.
It also masks a divide between markets where investors have been the greatest net buyers notably the UK and where they have been in significant net outflow Continental Europe as 21 out of 33 markets suffered full year outflows.
Despite this challenging flow environment, M&Gs Retail business generated positive Sales performance net sales in the final quarter.
In our core UK market, gross inflows of 2.7 billion were over the year again generated over the quarter with corresponding net inflows of over 1.1 billion.
Over the demonstrates our full year to 31 December 2011, M&Gs UK Retail business has received gross inflows of strength and depth 11.2 billion, representing an increase of 10 per cent on 2010 levels.

M&Gs UK Retail business has been number one for gross and net retail sales over 2 13 consecutive quarters based on data to 31 December 2011.
The strength of our UK distribution channels has helped to offset the difficult conditions encountered in mainland Europe, where risk-averse investors have been withdrawing money from funds.
M&Gs European Retail distribution business did make up lost ground over the fourth quarter with positive net inflows being received.
M&G continued to expand its distribution capabilities, registering its OEIC fund range in Finland, Norway and Denmark in the fourth quarter.
By retail net sales, M&G ranked ninth 3 out of 48 cross-border groups in 2011.
M&G-managed retail FUM sourced outside of the UK now stand at 8.2 billion, the equivalent of almost one-fifth of the total retail external funds managed by M&G.
In product terms, retail fund flows across the industry, affected by the eurozone crisis, have seen muted demand for equity products in aggregate as bond products continue to remain the default choice for risk-averse investors.
However, flows into some of M&Gs flagship equity products have remained robust in spite of stock market conditions, with investor appetite for our global equity and emerging market products continuing.
M&Gs Property Portfolio Fund has also benefited from a consistent level of net sales over the full year.
It is a core pillar of M&Gs business performance that it is able to benefit from changing investor preferences as a result of its diversified product offering.
No fewer than 14 of M&Gs retail funds, representing all of the main asset classes, achieved net sales in excess of 50 million over the full year.

The outflows experienced over the year included, as expected, a number of segregated clients withdrawing money from public debt funds due to asset allocation decisions.
Additionally, outflows also reflected the contractual return of 696 million in capital to investors in mature closed-ended debt structures.
M&Gs Institutional business continues to benefit from its innovative approach to investment.
The Alternative Credit team has raised 200 million of capital for a UK social housing fund, the first fund of its kind to capitalise on the income-generating nature of the sector.
This is the second instance of M&G creating a fund to assist organisations starved of bank loans since the onset of the credit crisis.
The M&G UK Companies Financing Fund UKCFF, M&Gs loan facility for UK quoted companies, has now made total commitments of 710 million across eight loans, five of which were extended over 2011.
Total commitments of 1.4 billion have been raised since its launch in 2009.
The M&G Secured Property Income Fund combines the expertise of both M&Gs Fixed Income Team, with its extensive credit research capability, and PRUPIM, the real estate fund management arm of the M&G Group and its core capability in real estate investment analysis.

350 million in total was added to the NAV in 2011.
Fund performance is strong, investor interest remains high and we continue to work hard at maintaining a suitable pipeline of acquisition opportunities.

M&Gs operating margin increased to 1 40 per cent year to 31 December 2010: 37 per cent.
M&Gs very strong profit performance reflects in particular the transformation in net sales experienced by the business since the beginning of 2009, particularly from the Retail business.
We continue to seek operational efficiencies across the M&G Group to support the scalability of our business model.
This cost discipline, combined with the rise in FUM 2 has generated a cost income ratio of 60 per cent for the full year, an improvement on the 2010 result of 63 per cent.
Given the ongoing strength of its financial performance, M&G continues to provide M&G continues capital-efficient profits and cash generation for the Group.

80m 72m Markets remained challenging in 2011, with overall net outflows seen in the Asia excluding Japan onshore funds market.
Equity markets struggled to gain traction driven by poor investor sentiment in the face of weak macroeconomic signals.
Japan was also impacted by the natural disaster which occurred earlier in the year.
Eastspring Investments 2010 2011 In November 2011, Prudential announced that its Asian Fund Management operations would be rebranded Eastspring Investments.
The new brand, which was officially launched in February 2012, will enable the business to establish a cohesive regional presence thereby penetrating the offshore segment more effectively.
It also supports distribution to new markets beyond Asia.
Business performance Total funds under management of 50.3 billion were down 3 per cent over the same period last year.
The effect of positive net flows from the Asian Life Business and third party retail and institutional clients, was offset by the combined effect of outflows in the low margin money market funds MMF and the negative market movements particularly in the second half of the year.
Net inflows from third parties excluding MMF were 633 million compared to net inflows of 1,837 million during 2010.
This is attributed to lower bond fund returns and to Japan, where significant inflows from the launch of the Asia Oceania equity fund in 2010 were not repeated in 2011.
Clearly the environment in Japan was not conducive to product launches in the first half of 2011.
This situation was partially mitigated by net inflows from corporate and institutional clients in Korea, together with new institutional mandates.
Financial performance IFRS profits of 80 million are a record and were up 11 per cent on prior year as a result of higher average funds under management and disciplined management of costs.
