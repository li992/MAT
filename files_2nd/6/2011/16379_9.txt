Report of the Directors About Unilever FINANCIAL REVIEW 2011 The virtuous circle of growth is starting to work for us.
We have successfully accelerated our growth and at the same time have continued the steady and sustainable expansion of operating profit.
Delivering against our priorities Underlying sales growth ahead of our markets, with volumes broadly in line Markets continued to grow in value in 2011, with double digit growth in emerging markets and mid single digit growth overall.
Market volume growth has slowed however, reflecting the impact of rising prices and weak consumer confidence especially in Western Europe and North America.
Against this background, underlying sales growth of 6.5% was a strong performance.
It was growth ahead of our markets, and was driven by outstanding performance in emerging markets and in the Home Care and Personal Care categories.
In Foods and Refreshment, whilst price increases have impacted volumes, growth was in line with relevant markets and several key businesses gained share.
Volume growth overall was 1.6%, a step down from 2010 but broadly in line with our markets.
Price growth of 4.8% was ahead of our markets as we increased prices more than others in a number of categories.
Performance was particularly strong in emerging markets, which delivered underlying sales growth of 11.5%, a significant proportion of this from volume.
Double digit growth was achieved in a wide range of countries including China, India, Turkey, South Africa and Mexico.
Growth continued to be driven by innovation, with good progress in the year in rolling out bigger innovations more quickly across more markets.
The launch of new brands into new markets was also accelerated and acquisitions played an important role, with Alberto Culver performing particularly strongly.
Underlying operating margins protected in a difficult environment Underlying operating margin for the year was 14.9%, down slightly on the 15.0% achieved in 2010.
In the context of substantial cost inflation and depressed consumer demand in the developed world we have built market shares and held margins to within 0.1% of the prior year, reflecting the strength of our business.
Gross margin was down by 1.8% at constant currency, reflecting unusually high levels of cost inflation.
Strong pricing and excellent savings delivery were achieved in the year, but these were insufficient to fully compensate for the level of cost inflation suffered.
The lower gross margin was largely mitigated by overheads, where outstanding progress in savings programmes reduced the impact on margin by 1.0% for the year at constant currency.
Although part of this reduction was one-off, the various continuous improvement initiatives across the business have been a major success, resulting in accelerated savings in a wide range of areas.
Advertising and promotions expenditure increased by 150 million, but was 0.7% lower as a percentage of turnover, at constant currency.
Healthy cash delivery Cash generation was healthy, with free cash flow of 3.1 billion.
This was below the 2010 figure of 3.4 billion, the difference largely reflecting a significant step up in net capital expenditure to 2.0 billion, due to capacity expansion in the fast-growing emerging markets.
The net working capital movement was a small cash outflow in 2011.
This related to a series of financial items, with no significant movement in trade working capital, which has now been negative overall for nine consecutive quarters.
Key positive drivers of cash flow in 2011 were improved operating profit, which contributed around 0.1 billion, and income tax payments, 0.1 billion lower.
