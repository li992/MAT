The deficit in the plan recent triennial valuation was completed as of 30 September 2008 increased by $15.2 million 2010: declined by $5.1 million during and resulted in an agreed deficit with the Trustees of the UK scheme, the year, due to a decrease in the scheme assets of $2.8 million for funding purposes, of 101.7 million.
Under the related funding 2010: increase of $11.2 million and an increase in the scheme agreement, the Group then agreed to make deficit contributions liabilities of $12.4 million 2010: $6.1 million.
The scheme assets of 7.1 million in 2010 and, thereafter, an annual amount of either were 74 per cent invested in equities and generated a return of 8.0 million or 10.0 million, depending on whether an EBITDA minus one per cent in the year 2010: plus 15 per cent, which was threshold amount of 53.2 million was achieved by the Group in the the main contributor to the decrease in value.

The agreement also includes a commitment to increase the annual deficit contribution In the Netherlands, the Group operates an insured defined benefits by the same percentage as any increase in shareholder return, plan as is customary in that country.
At the end of 2011 the deficit once the total distribution to shareholders in any year exceeds the value for this plan was $7.5 million, compared to $1.4 million in the equivalent of 3.5 pence per share.
No payments were made under previous year.
In 2005 a number of changes were made to the benefits this commitment in 2011.
However, it is likely that a payment will be provided by the plan, as well as other non-pension benefits, as part made in 2012.
For example, if the interim dividend for 2012 is the of a negotiation with labour unions.
As a result of those changes, same as that paid in 2011 2.34 cents per share, then when combined the liability under the plan was reduced by $10.9 million and reported with the payment of the recommended final dividend for 2011 as a curtailment gain in that year.

The pensioner group challenged the court decision in valuation date of 30 September 2011 and, together with the related an appellate court, and in 2011 the appellate court overturned the funding discussions with the Trustees, should be concluded by the original decision.
Elementis has appealed that courts decision to end of 2012. the Supreme Court of the Netherlands, which will review the case sometime in the next two years.

This reversal is the main reason for the increase in deficit assets increased due to a nine per cent return on investments for value in 2011. the year 2010: 12 per cent, contributions from the Company of approximately $16.3 million, less benefit payments to members of Other liabilities amounted to $2.7 million 2010: $2.7 million and approximately $40.0 million.
The scheme liabilities increased due relate to pension arrangements for a relatively small number of mainly to a decline in real corporate bond yields of approximately people in Germany.
With the support of the Company, the Trustees have developed an investment strategy that broadly includes 50 per cent of the assets being invested in a liability matching fund and 50 per cent in an investment fund.
The liability matching fund consists of bonds, gilts and liquid assets, plus a portfolio of interest and inflation swaps, constructed in such a way as to match the interest and inflation risks inherent in a similar percentage of the scheme liabilities.
The purpose of this fund is to finance a portion of the liabilities without creating significant volatility in the reported deficit.
The investment fund, on the other hand, consists of a portfolio of return seeking assets, largely equities, with the aim of funding part of the liabilities by generating higher returns with an acceptable risk, while also contributing to reducing the deficit over time.
