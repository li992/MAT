a result of growth in the average number of employees The key cost drivers were the domestic inflation in Russia directly involved in production by 46% as a result of 6.1% CPI growth in 2011, and appreciation of the rouble production commencing at Albazino and a full year against the dollar 3.4% increase in average rate from of commercial production at Omolon including the 2010 to 2011.

growth at other mines made up another 16%.
Diesel fuel price inflation in particular is an important factor affecting our cost base and driving cost increases, especially for remote mines generating power using diesel gensets, and in-house and third party transportation costs.
