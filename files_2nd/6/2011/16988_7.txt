Operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation increased by 33% to 412.7m 2010: 309.7m after a negative currency translation impact of 2.4m, with the strengthening of sterling relative to the average US dollar rate in the prior year largely offset by weakness against the Australian dollar.
Excluding this impact, year on year growth in constant currency was 34%, with the increase in underlying performance being driven by growth in upstream oil and gas operations, strong performances across the Minerals portfolio and the impact of 2010 acquisitions within Power & Industrial.

On a constant currency basis, Minerals operating profits increased by 22% to 213.9m 2010: 176.0m giving a divisional operating margin of 17.6% 2010: 19.3% with the reduction driven by revenue mix and the dilution impact of Linatex margins.
Oil & Gas operating profits including joint venture interests increased to 183.1m 2010: 113.8m with an operating margin of 24.7% 2010: 25.2% : excluding the impact of acquisitions and one-off costs, the Oil & Gas divisional margin was 26.1% 2010: 25.2%.

This represents a margin of 8.7% 2010: 10.7% constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions and one-off costs a margin of 10.6% 2010: 11.7%.
Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and investment property in the year was 37.7m 2010: 34.3m resulting in operating profits from continuing operations before depreciation and intangibles amortisation EBITDA of 450.4m 2010: 344.0m.

The exceptional credit of 19.0m is a past service gain recognised under IAS19 following the decision by the Trustees of the Groups main staff and executive plans in the UK to provide CPI and not RPI-linked benefits to deferred members.
This follows the Governments recent changes in legislation to use CPI rather than RPI as the statutory measure by which to increase pensions.
