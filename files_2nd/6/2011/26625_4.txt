com Kevin Hayes Finance Director Man Group plc Report and accounts 13 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 Finance Directors review Change of financial year end Man has changed to a December year end to align its reporting cycle with that generally adopted in the asset management industry.
This report covers the nine months from 1 April to 31 December 2011.
We are required, for comparative purposes, to include the prior reported year ended 31 March 2011.
The GLG acquisition was completed in October 2010.
Therefore the results for the year ended 31 March 2011 include 5.5 months of GLGs results, whereas the current period includes GLG for the full nine months.
The two periods are therefore not directly comparable and we have explained changes that occurred during the year in absolute terms rather than in relation to prior year.
