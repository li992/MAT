22 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Operational and financial performance Introduction EBITDA was 334 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 compared to 392 million in 2010 and underlying basic earnings per share were 56 pence compared to 64 pence last year.
Our 2011 profit is in line with expectations, which increased during the year with an improvement in the trading environment, although commodity prices did soften towards the end of the period.
Earnings were below 2010 levels, which benefited from the accelerated hedge which we put in place during 2008 when wholesale margins were higher.
We have continued to exercise tight control over our cost base and our spend on capital projects.
2011 was a record year for health and safety performance at Drax and we have been supported by strong operational performance.
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited Haven Power, is meeting our growth expectations, with sales of 3.3TWh compared to 1.4TWh in 2010, largely as a result of the planned growth in its industrial and commercial I&C customer base, along with a continued increase in the volumes sold to the small and medium enterprise market SME.
In April, we were pleased to report that we had reached agreement with HMRC over the Eurobond tax position, resulting in cash tax relief of 180 million.
This has enabled us to release 148 million of cash to the business so far, with a further 32 million to follow over the coming years as we utilise the remaining losses.
In July, we completed the renancing of our letter of credit, working capital and term loan facilities, which were due to mature in December 2012.
These facilities were replaced by a 310 million revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2014, with the term loan repaid in full out of cash on hand.
At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board will recommend a final dividend for 2011 of 11.8 pence per share, taking total dividends for the year to 27.8 pence per share, or 101 million.
This review includes further explanation and commentary in relation to our principal performance indicators and the results for the year.
