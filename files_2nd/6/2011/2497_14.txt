Going concern Given the Groups history of growth in profit from operations, the high cash conversion rate from profit into cash, the access to the 2 billion revolving credit facility which is used only as a back stop and the spread of banks providing the facilities, the Group remains confident in its ability to access the debt capital markets.
This, together with the maturity profile of debt, spread over a long period with only limited redemptions scheduled for 2012, provides confidence that the Group has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
After reviewing the Groups budget, plans and refinancing arrangements, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
