the average of the net operating assets as at 1 January, 30 June and 31 December: this is the basis on which we report our calculations of ROCE.
The average net operating assets in 2011 were 1,224 million, up 26% on 2010.
In 2011 the ROCE decreased to 28.0% compared with 32.4% in 2010.
This decrease was due to increased working capital, and the absence of the major sporting events of 2010, which by their nature, were less capital intensive than the base business.
