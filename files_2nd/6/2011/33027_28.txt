Further The Group determines the above externalisation transactions to be significant using a range of factors.
We look at the specific details of the Groups pension schemes are included in Note 18 to the Financial Statements from page 165. circumstances of the individual externalisation arrangement and apply several quantitative and qualitative criteria.
Because we consider our Commitments and contingencies externalisation strategy to be an extension of our R&D strategy, the expected total value of development payments under the transaction The Group has commitments and contingencies which are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies described in the and its proportion of our annual R&D spend, both of which are proxies for overall research and development effort and cost, are important Financial Statements in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 146.
The Group also has taxation contingencies.
These are elements of the significance determination.
Other quantitative criteria we apply include, without limitation, expected levels of future sales, described in the Taxation section in the Critical accounting policies and estimates section on page 97 and in Note 25 to the Financial the possible value of milestone payments and the resources used for commercialisation activities for example, the number of staff.
Qualitative factors we consider include, without limitation, new market developments, new territories, new areas of research and Research and development collaboration payments Details of future potential research and development collaboration strategic implications.
payments are also included in Note 25 to the Financial Statements from page 181.
As detailed in Note 25, payments to our collaboration In aggregate, milestones capitalised under the Groups other externalisation arrangements totalled $123 million in 2011, $337 million partners may not become payable due to the inherent uncertainty in achieving the development and revenue milestones linked to the future in 2010 and $306 million in 2009, and the Group recognised other payments.
As part of our overall externalisation strategy, we may enter income in respect of other externalisation arrangements totalling into further collaboration projects in the future that may include $18 million in 2011, $82 million in 2010 and $440 million in 2009.

Non-controlling interests increased to $226 million and cash flow assume no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals.
In addition, our plans assume no premature loss of exclusivity for key AstraZeneca products.

In setting the distribution policy and the overall financial strategy, the Boards aim is to continue to strike a balance between the interests A planning assumption remains that continued productivity of the business, our financial creditors and our shareholders.
After improvements including successful completion of restructuring providing for business investment, funding the progressive dividend initiatives, will aid the achievement of levels of revenue and margins policy and meeting our debt service obligations, the Board will keep to generate the requisite operating cash flow over the planning period under review the opportunity to return cash in excess of these to support the reinvestment needs of the business, debt service requirements to shareholders through periodic share repurchases.
Future prospects As described earlier in our Annual Report, the coming years will be challenging for the industry and for AstraZeneca as its revenue base transitions through a period of exclusivity losses and new product launches.
AstraZeneca makes high-level planning assumptions for revenue evolution, margins, cash flow and business reinvestment to help guide the management of the business.

Income from royalties and from disposals of IP, brands and product lines is included in other operating income.
There may be further adjustments when actual rebates are invoiced based on utilisation information submitted to us in the case of contractual rebates and claims invoices are received in the case of regulatory rebates and chargebacks.
We believe that we have made reasonable estimates for future rebates using a similar methodology to that of previous years.
Inevitably, however, such estimates involve judgements on aggregate future sales levels, segment mix and the customers contractual performance.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Review 97 healthcollaboration Fighting the rise of cardiovascular disease According to some studies, up to 50% of people in certain Gulf states are affected by high cholesterol.
To fight this, we have launched a unique educational programme, called Safe @ Heart, designed to bring together all stakeholders to improve awareness and reduce cholesterol levels.
In 2009, a partnership between local cardiac societies and AstraZeneca launched the first large observational study of its kind CEPHEUS in the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia.
It analysed the current management of cholesterol treatment among more than 5,000 adult patients being treated with statins.
Preliminary results showed that 50% of the studied population did not reach their cholesterol treatment goals.
The Safe @ Heart programme is a practical response to this issue, taking a holistic, society-wide approach to driving improvements.
The programme includes working with physicians to stress the importance of reaching cholesterol goals and helping them improve cholesterol management.
It works with patients, carers and the general public to increase awareness and promote treatment adherence and lifestyle changes.
We are also working with health authorities and governments in the fight against the rise of cardiovascular disease in the region.
