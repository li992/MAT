This Financial Review The Groups financial results were driven by the strength of gold isintended to convey the main factors andsilver prices and the increase in sales volume of gold following affectingperformance and to provide a the successful expansion of production capacity at Soledad-Dipolos, detailed analysis of the financial results expanded milling capacity at Cinega and higher throughput at Herradura.

As anticipated, exploration expenditure rose signicantly over2010to support the Groups organic growth strategy.
Cash ow generated by our operations and the Silverstream Contract, combined with a healthy cash position, enabled the Company to continue investing in plant and equipment and to pay dividends.
Asof December, Fresnillo plc held US$684.9 million in cash which will continue to support our growth strategy in the future.

While this represented an average 1.7% revaluation, there However, a number of external factors also have a material was in fact significant uctuation in the exchange rate over the impacton our financial statements.
These include: course of the year: in the first eight months, the Mexican peso rose strongly against the US dollar, while in the last four months the dollar regained its strength against the peso.
This resulted in an estimated Precious metal prices US$3.4 million adverse effect on the Groups production costs In 2011, demand for precious metals as safe haven instruments denominated in Mexican pesos approximately 70% of total costs gained further momentum as a result of geopolitical tensions arising when converted to US dollars.

Year over yearchange % Revenues Steel balls for milling 14.1 Total revenues for the full year reached a new record at US$2,192.7 Explosives 18.6 million, a 55.6% increase compared to 2010.
This was explained by higher adjusted revenue, which rose by 56.6% to US$2,307.4 million.

and greater demand for these inputs as a result of industry-wide Saucito contributed 10.2% to adjusted revenue with 5.3 million silver expansion.
Specically, unit prices of explosives were affected as ounces and 29,532 gold ounces sold in its first year of operations.

The treatment charge per tonne of lead concentrate, including the escalator, remained stable, while the treatment charge per tonne of zinc concentrate decreased by 9.0%.
However, silver rening charges for lead concentrates increased by 193.8% year-on-year due to the shortage of global rening capacity toprocess lead concentrates with high silver content.
The higher silver rening charges, together with greater volumes ofconcentrates and dor shipped to Met-Mex, resulted in a 78.3% increase in treatment charges expressed in absolute terms in the income statement.
