About Redrow Business review Directors & Board reports Financial information Notice of AGM Miscellaneous information Redrow plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review 27 Financing and Treasury Management Redrow is a UK based housebuilder and therefore the main focus of its financial risk management surrounds the management of liquidity and interest rate risk i Liquidity The Group regularly prepares and reviews its cash flow forecasts which are used to manage liquidity risks in conjunction with the maintenance of appropriate committed banking facilities to ensure adequate headroom.
Facilities are kept under regular review and the Group maintains regular contact with its banks and other financial institutions.
This ensures Redrow remains attuned to new developments and opportunities and that our facilities remain aligned to our strategic and operational objectives and market conditions.
Our current banking syndicate comprises four banks and in addition to our committed facilities, Redrow also has further uncommitted bank facilities which are used to assist day to day cash management.
ii Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows money at floating rates.
Redrow uses simple risk management products, notably sterling denominated interest rate swaps, as appropriate to manage this risk.
Such products are not used for speculative or trading purposes.
Redrow regularly reviews its hedging requirements.
During the year the Group's outstanding interest rate swaps matured and the Board decided, taking into account current predicted LIBOR rates and the pricing of interest rate swaps, to retain all its debt at floating rates.
This decision is subject to regular review.
Financial management at Redrow is conducted centrally using policies approved by the Board.
Improvements to business processes During the year a team from across the functions of Finance, Commercial and Construction led the implementation of changes to Redrow's business processes for internal reporting to improve the timeliness and efficiency of the internal financial management reporting cycle.
This has enabled the timescale for the production of monthly management accounts to be reduced to 3 days post month end.
