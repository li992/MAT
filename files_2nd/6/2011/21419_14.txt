Premiums Gross premiums written have reduced by 2% in 2011 to $1,712.5m.
However, rates on renewal business on average increased by 1% across the portfolio.
We have continued to adjust our underwriting appetite in areas where competition is most intense.
The balance of our business has remained broadly unchanged from 2011.
We continue to operate a diversified portfolio by type of business and geographical location, and have sought out new opportunities in 2011 to complement our existing books of business.
In April 2011 we announced our acquisition of two Australian disability insurance managing general agents: Australian Income Protection and Blue-GUM Special Risks.
This acquisition has made a $10.1m contribution to our full year premiums written via our Lloyds platform and will significantly add to our Australian business and our life, accident and health portfolio.
In addition we have set up a life, accident and health business operation in Minneapolis, Minnesota, writing admitted business through our US insurance company, Beazley Insurance Company Inc. 30 Beazley Annual report 2011 www.

Premium retention rates Retention of business from existing brokers and clients is a key feature of Beazleys strategy.
It enables us to maintain a deep understanding of our clients businesses and requirements, affording greater insight into the risks involved in each policy we write and enabling us to price risk most accurately to achieve profit.

Rating environment Premium rates charged for renewal business increased by 1% during 2011 across the portfolio 2010: a decrease of 2%.
The largest rate changes were seen within our catastrophe-exposed classes: reinsurance 3% increase and property 3% increase.
Life, accident and health saw a 1% rate increase, whilst political risks and contingency and specialty lines had a 1% decrease and marine was unchanged.
Market conditions remain competitive across the portfolio.

The slight decrease was due to the group ceasing to underwrite admitted commercial property business in the US and accordingly no purchase of external reinsurance for this business was made.
The only significant new reinsurance purchased was the professions aggregate excess of loss cover which protects the group against an unexpected increase in the frequency of losses across most of the specialty lines business.
Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: to enable the group to write large or lead lines on risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims and expenses to total net earned premium.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio has increased in 2011 to 99% 2010: 88%.
This increase was driven by the cost of catastrophes in 2011: nevertheless a combined ratio of below 100% is a notable achievement under these circumstances and demonstrates the value in our diversified operating model in challenging years.
It is worth pointing out that the calculation of the combined ratio for Beazley includes all claims and other costs to the group but excludes foreign exchange gains or losses.
We believe this represents the most transparent and useful measure of operating performance as it ensures that all of the costs of being in business are captured, whether directly linked to underwriting activity or not.
Claims 2011 saw an unusually large incidence of natural catastrophes resulting in significant market losses.
The group was impacted by the catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2011 in Japan, New Zealand and Australia.
Taken together with the US tornadoes in April and May, we reported catastrophe losses of $183m in the first half of 2011.
Political unrest in Libya led to losses in the first half in political risks.
Despite this, the political risks and contingency division recorded a combined ratio of 79%, which was achieved following the first recoveries on the 2008 political losses.
The second half of the year saw loss activity continue with hurricane Irene and flooding in Thailand.
We incurred minor losses as a result of hurricane Irene and we estimate the cost of Thailand to be $42m.
Thanks to a $10m improvement in the estimate for the previously reported losses, this brings the total for these catastrophe events to $215m in 2011.
These losses have affected our reinsurance and property divisions and, to a lesser extent, the political risks and contingency division.
Our investments in our claims infrastructure will enable us to work closely with our clients and insureds to ensure claims are handled in an efficient and timely manner and to enable affected communities to start to rebuild.
Losses from 2010, including the earthquakes in Chile and New Zealand have developed well and contributed positively to prior year reserve releases during 2011.
com Business review Margin in net held reserves % % above actuarial best estimate 10 5 0 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 Financial year Reserve releases Beazley has a consistent reserving philosophy with initial reserves being set to include risk margins that may be released over time as and when any uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range 5-10% above the actuarial estimate.
We continue to maintain our reserve strength across the portfolio at 7.4% 2010: 7.9%.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
During 2011 we were able to make the following prior year reserve adjustments across divisions, with the overall net impact being an increased release to the group.
2011 2010 $m $m Life, accident and health 4.5 1.3 Marine 39.9 30.7 Political risks and contingency 22.1 18.8 Property 20.2 17.4 Reinsurance 38.0 22.1 Specialty lines 61.8 56.9 Total 186.5 144.6 Releases as a percentage of net earned premium 13.5% 10.3% Reserve releases increased slightly on specialty lines, reflecting the continuing satisfactory development of the significant volumes of business underwritten over the last ten years.
The releases in 2011 came mainly from the 2003 through 2006 underwriting years, reinforcing that they are exceptionally profitable.
The political risks and contingency reserve releases continued, with the 2010 underwriting year in particular developing well.
Marine reserve releases rose significantly, with the relatively benign 2009 underwriting year dominating.
The reinsurance and property releases increased with favourable development of past catastrophe events and the utilisation of earned catastrophe reserves offsetting the cost of the events of 2011.
Refer to note 24 for more details on the treatment of the claims related to 2011 catastrophe events.
com Beazley Annual report 2011 33 Business review Financial review Group performance continued Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased to $517.3m from $500.6m in 2010.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2011 2010 $m $m Brokerage costs 299.3 292.9 Other acquisition costs 91.4 88.5 Total acquisition costs 390.7 381.4 Administrative expenses 126.6 119.2 Total acquisition costs and administrative expenses 517.3 500.6 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premium they remain between 21% and 22%.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with accounting guidelines.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity eg underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
Administrative expenses comprise primarily IT costs, facilities costs, Lloyds central costs and other support costs.
These increased in 2011, the main reason being that a large proportion of the groups expenses are in sterling and on average sterling was stronger against the US dollar in 2011 compared to 2010.
Investment performance Investment income for the year ended 31 December 2011 was $39.3m, or an annualised return of 1.0%, compared with $37.5m or 1.0% over the same period in 2010.
Investment conditions continued to be difficult over the course of the year.
Financial markets experienced elevated levels of volatility as the effects of global overleveraging continued to manifest themselves via the European sovereign debt crisis.
This issue, coupled with the relatively lacklustre levels of global growth, contributed to interest rate levels falling further from already record low levels providing some boost to short-term returns, but decreasing the outlook for future returns.
In this environment the investment strategy focused on containing potential downside, whilst working to target absolute returns above short-term treasury bills.
We have paid particular attention to avoiding risks arising from the eurozone crisis, primarily those arising from peripheral sovereign debt as well as from the overall banking sector.
Our eurozone sovereign bond exposures are restricted to Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
The strategy continues to be implemented together with Falcon Money Management Limited, our associated company, and is unchanged from last year.
Our core portfolio, which amounted to 89.7% of fixed income investments, continues to be primarily allocated to core sovereign, supranational and agency debt whilst retaining elevated levels of cash.
We have marginally increased our allocations to US non-financial corporate and asset-backed credits to take advantage of wider spreads in the latter part of the year.
Duration of the portfolio as at the year end was 1.3 years 2010: 12 months with a yield to maturity of 0.8% 2010: 0.7%.
Our decision late in 2010 to increase and maintain duration worked well as interest rates fell further during 2011.
The investment committee does expect to further extend the duration of assets to more closely match liabilities in the future.
The balance of our investments remains invested in a diversified portfolio of capital growth assets with a focus on delivering absolute investment returns.

Tax Beazley is liable to corporation tax in a number of jurisdictions, notably the UK and Ireland.
Our effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate between the Irish and UK tax rates.
In 2011, the UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 27% to 25%.
This 2% reduction in the UK tax rate has been applied to our UK deferred tax liability brought forward.
This reduction in our deferred tax liability has offset our current tax charge to create an effective tax rate of 5% for the year.
