Organic growth in 2011 was 12% for the continuing businesses.
Organic growth is dened as the increase in revenue year on year including revenue growth from newly acquired companies and basing such growth on the revenue level for the comparable period in 2010, as if the acquired companies were owned in that period.

Underlying Operating profit Net Margins The table that follows shows underlying operating profit for the continuing business segments for 2011 and the comparative data for 2010 together with the net margins percentage.
Performance Wireless Continuing Materials Systems Unallocated businesses $m $m $m $m 2010 Operating profit 60.0 15.9 10.5 65.4 ROS 13.7% 7.9% 10.2% 2011 Operating profit 69.0 36.4 11.7 93.7 ROS 14.1% 12.2% 11.9% Gross margins of 37.7% 2010, 37.9% were largely unchanged year on year.
Although, the newly acquired businesses have above average gross margins, a higher proportion of smartphone, tablet and telematic revenues, which command below average gross margins, led to lower margins in the base business.
Overall gross margins, taking into account the newly acquired companies, were therefore at year on year.
Net margins for Performance Materials increased to 14.1% in 2011 2010, 13.7% and for Wireless Systems net margins increased to 12.2% 2010, 7.9%.
Loss The loss before tax from continuing operations was 101.7 million 2010, loss of 8.6 million.
There were no operations classied as discontinued in 2011.
Underlying profit Underlying profit before tax in the year was 52.7 million 2010, 40.2 million.
Underlying profit is dened as profit before tax, exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, the gain or loss on sale of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments, and acquisition transaction costs, as set out in note 13.
Exceptional Costs As a result of the decision to exit the Handset Antennae business, a non-cash asset impairment charge of 115.7 million, plus a 16.3 million restructuring charge have been provided for in respect of that business.
Overall, a cash surplus is expected to result from the decision taken to close the business, and arises from surpluses from the run out of the order book and the monetisation of working capital and xed assets.
Other exceptional costs in the period amounted to 8.1 million, including 3.8 million for bid defence costs.
Note 7 analyses these costs by segment.
The cash outlay on exceptional items in the period was 22.6 million including cash spent on exceptional items provided for in 2010 with a further cash outlay of 4.0 million to come in 2012 and 2013, for costs provided for in 2011.
Finance Costs Finance costs, excluding a loss on the fair valuing of financial instruments of 0.2 million 2010, gain of 1.2 million were 25 Finance Directors report Continued 6.7 million compared to 6.2 million in 2010.
Taxation The underlying tax charge on total underlying profit before tax is equivalent to an average tax rate of 17.1%, a reduction on the rate of 21.9% in 2010.
The average tax rate in 2012 is expected to be around the same level as in 2011.
The reduction in the tax rate reects higher profits in the USA which continue to be sheltered by amortised goodwill deductions, resulting from acquisitions and higher profits from European businesses which benefit from tax incentives.
An analysis of the total tax charge is given in note 11.
Underlying Earnings Continuing underlying earnings per share were 16.5 pence 2010, 11.8 pence.
Underlying earnings are based on underlying profit less underlying tax and exclude deferred tax movements.
The average number of shares in issue throughout 2011 was 265.4 million 2010, 266.0 million.

Treasury Policies Laird has a centralised Treasury function, the objectives of which are to monitor and manage the financial risks of the Group and to ensure that sucient liquidity is available to meet the requirements of the business.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and operates within a framework of policies and procedures.
Lairds Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to assist in the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
All hedging is carried out centrally and speculative trading is specically prohibited by Group Treasury policy.
Interest Rate Risk Laird is exposed to interest rate risk as it holds borrowings on both a xed and oating basis.
Lairds policy for this risk is to optimise the mix of xed and oating rate borrowings using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage Lairds finance costs.
Credit and Counterparty Risk Lairds policy on counterparty risk management is to place cash deposits and other financial instruments with our relationship banks, all of whom also provide credit facilities to Laird.
The level of exposure to each bank is continually monitored.
As at 31 December 2011 all cash and short-term deposits had a maturity of less than three months.
Foreign Exchange Management Laird aims to minimise its exposures to US Dollar transactional currency exposures by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
Laird aims to cover forward at least 75% of the unmatched cash ows on a quarterly basis.
Foreign currency borrowings are used to hedge partially the currencies of our principal assets and cash ows.
Where foreign currency borrowings are in the same currency as our investment in overseas assets they are treated as a hedge of the net investment.
Net Borrowings and Debt Facilities Net borrowings increased to 117.7 million: with the overall net increase being 14.1 million.
21.0 million was spent on the acquisition of Klver.
A cornerstone of Lairds financial planning is to ensure that the Group maintains committed loan finance which provides sucient headroom above expected borrowing requirements and has a significant proportion with terms that exceed one year.
Laird has 235 million 2010, 265 million of bilateral revolving credit facilities which do not expire until April 2016.
In addition, Laird has in issue $140.0 million 90.1 million of US Dollar Private Placement notes which have remaining terms in excess of two years 2014, $97 million, and five years 2016, $43 million.
Covenants A key consideration for financial planning is to maintain sucient headroom between borrowings and the ceiling set by the covenants.
Lairds bank facilities and US Private Placement loan notes contain two principal financial covenants: net debt EBITDA earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and interest cover.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, net borrowings were 1.4 times EBITDA, 39% of the maximum permitted of 3.5 times.
Interest cover was 10.0 times against the minimum requirement of 3.0 times.
Thus, there was sucient financial headroom.
We routinely estimate our expected headroom against the covenants and we test their sensitivity to a number of alternative scenarios to ensure ongoing compliance.
We do not anticipate approaching our covenant limits in the foreseeable future.
27 Finance Directors report Continued Currencies in 2011 The average and period end exchange rates are set out in note 5.
In 2011, almost 70% of revenues were negotiated in US Dollars.
With just under 40% of the cost base in US Dollars, there is a large US Dollar surplus.
Almost 20% of revenues are negotiated in Renminbi and 10% in Euros.
In most currencies other than the US Dollar and Euro, costs exceed revenues, the most significant being the Renminbi RMB.
This imbalance led to a theoretical adverse impact of some 5 million compared with the average exchange rates prevailing in 2010.
In so far as the strengthening of the RMB was reected and recovered in US Dollar selling prices, the impact on profits would be somewhat less.
We strive to balance local currency exposures but we operate a global business and this creates currency imbalances where we are unable to match operating and procurement costs with revenues in local currencies.
In addition, there is a translation impact in converting profits into our reporting currency Sterling : each US$0.01 appreciation against sterling approximates to an annual increase in operating profit of 0.4 million.
In 2011, sterling strength against the US Dollar reduced profits on translation by 2.4 million.
The majority of the Groups assets are held overseas and these are hedged in part by foreign currency loans.
Pensions There are 10 employees who are active members of dened benefit plans and approximately 1,600 deferred and current pensioners.
There is an overall dened benefit pension scheme surplus under IAS 19 of 1.0 million at 31 December 2011.
At 31 December 2010, there was an overall deficit of 0.1 million.
The principal driver of the year on year change resulting in a surplus was a 5.0 million increase in asset values.
The bond rate used to discount liabilities was 4.95% in 2011 compared to 5.5% in 2010 and contributed to the increase in the estimate of liabilities.
Shareholders Funds Shareholders funds at the 2011 year end were 440.4 million 2010, 574.9 million.
The reconciliation is set out in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Return on Capital Employed Return on capital employed underlying profit before interest and tax as a proportion of average shareholders funds plus net borrowings during the year was 9.7% in 2011 compared to 7.0% in 2010.
