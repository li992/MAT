In the absence of the above adjustments, the effective rates would have been 25.2% for 2011 and 27.9% for 2010 and the difference is mainly due to the reduction in tax rates already mentioned.
Profi t for the period As a result of the factors discussed above, profi t for 2011 was US$249.5m, a decrease of US$11.6m, or 4.4%, compared with 2010.
Earnings per share For 2011, basic and diluted earnings per share for profi t attributable to the equity holders of the Company were 55 cents US$ and 54 cents US$, respectively, compared with 57 cents US$ and 56 cents US$, respectively for 2010.

Revenue from our Cooperation Agreement with LightSquared, recorded within Other Income, was the primary driver of overall revenue growth for 2011.
Total MSS revenues decreased US$6.7m, or 0.9%, year on year.
Our FleetBroadband, SwiftBroadband and BGAN services have shown solid growth in revenue during 2011 compared with 2010.
This growth has been impacted by the decline in revenue from our BGAN and GAN services due to reduced traffi c levels from Afghanistan and a decline in maritime voice revenues due to the impact of product mix changes and the substitution of voice usage for email and Voice Over IP.
In addition, we experienced a decline in revenues from our older services such as Inmarsat B, Mini M, Fleet and GAN, as well as from Swift 64, year on year.

Capital expenditure, including own work capitalised, increased by US$350.3m in 2011, compared with 2010, primarily due to expenditure on our Global Xpress programme.
Capital expenditure may fl uctuate with the timing of milestone payments on current projects.

Although our outstanding Convertible Bonds do not mature until November 2017, holders have the right to require the Company to redeem any or all of the bonds at its accreted principal amount on 16 November 2012.
As there can be no certainty as to the outcome of this potential redemption event, we have classifi ed all the bonds as current liabilities.
If the holders exercised their rights in full the cost of redeeming all of the bonds would be US$331.5m.
The decrease in non-current liabilities of US$240.3m relates primarily to the decrease in borrowings due to the reclassifi cation of the liability component of the Convertible Bonds to current liabilities, the repayment of the non-current portion of the old Senior Credit Facility of US$150.0m and the transfer of US$44.1m of the EIB Facility to current borrowings, offset in part by the receipt of US$277.3m from the drawdown of the Ex-Im Bank Facility.
In addition, during 2011, other payables decreased due to the early settlement of the Segovia deferred consideration, provisions decreased due to a reduction in the Inmarsat Global Group balance sheet post-retirement liability provision following the review of actuarial The table below shows the consolidated Group balance sheet at assumptions for accounting purposes.

It is Rick Medlock likely that we will continue to face increasing competition from Chief Financial Offi cer other network operators in some or all of our target sectors in 6 March 2012 the future, particularly from existing mobile satellite network operators.
In addition, communications providers who operate private networks using VSAT or hybrid systems also continue to target users of mobile satellite services.
Technological innovation in the VSAT, together with increased C-band, Ku-band and Ka-band coverage and commoditisation, have increased, and we believe will continue to increase, the competitiveness of VSAT and hybrid systems in some traditional MSS sectors, including the maritime and aviation sectors.
Furthermore, the gradual extension of terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks to areas not currently served by them may reduce demand for some of our land mobile services in those areas.
We believe that our acquisition of Ship Equip and our investment in Global Xpress will position us favourably to compete with alternate technology providers and reduce the impact of such competition on our L-band MSS business.
