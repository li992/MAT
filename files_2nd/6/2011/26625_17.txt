The Financial review contained on pages 74 to 99 gives a detailed explanation of our financial performance by integrating the financial statements, accounting policies and explanations regarding our performance, capital and liquidity.
This section is aimed at giving salient information to you in a format that explains the relationships between funds under management, margins, profit, cash flow and capital, which underpin our sustainable business model.
The Additional financial information provided towards the end of this report pages 105 to 121 includes additional disclosures required to be compliant with accounting standards or the Companies Act.
Our view is that this Additional Financial Information is important but less significant to an understanding of our business and could be accessed through our website by readers requiring this level of detail.
Throughout this report we have added index tables and cross references to help navigate the report.
Man Group plc Report and accounts 77 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 1.
Basis of preparation Change in reporting period During 2011 we announced the decision to change our financial year end to a calendar year to align our financial reporting with that of our funds and the asset management industry generally.
We are therefore reporting our financial position and our results as at and for the nine months ended 31 December 2011.
For comparative purposes we are required to disclose our results for the 12 months ended 31 March 2011.
The acquisition of GLG was completed on 14 October 2010, and therefore the results for the 12 months ended 31 March 2011 had 5.5 months of GLG results compared to a full nine months in this period.
Accounting policies The audited consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Mans principal accounting policies have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in the Financial review and Additional financial information.
Accounting policies are included in the relevant sections, and an index of the significant policies is provided in the Additional financial information Note 2 AFI 2.
The impact of new accounting standards and amendments applicable to Mans nine month period ended 31 December 2011 and accounting standards that are not yet effective is outlined in AFI 2.
Consolidated group and reporting currency The consolidated group is Man Group plc and its subsidiaries Man.
The stand-alone parent company financial statements of Man Group plc have been included in the Additional financial information.
The majority of revenues, assets, liabilities and funding are denominated in US dollars USD and therefore Mans reporting currency is USD.
Judgemental areas and accounting estimates The most significant area of judgement is the allocation and evaluation of franchise value goodwill and intangible assets, in particular the franchise value in relation to the GLG acquisition.
This is discussed in detail in Note 12.
The valuation of the franchise value and intangibles has been an area of focus for the Group Board, and in particular the Audit and Risk Committee, during the period.
The report of the chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee discussed the involvement of the Committee in this evaluation on page 57.
Other areas of significant judgement are: the determination of fair values for investments including the Lehman claims : deferred compensation awards: and pension obligations.
A description of the assumptions made is given in the relevant sections of the Financial review and Additional financial information.
Going concern Mans business activity is discussed on pages 1 to 47, together with the significant risk factors pages 24 to 29.
Mans liquidity and capital positions are set out in Notes 17 and 22 and 24 respectively.
The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the consolidated and parent financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of certain financial instruments that are available-for-sale or held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial reporting controls The Companys systems of internal control aim to safeguard assets, ensure that proper accounting records are maintained, and ensure that the financial information used in the business and published externally is robust and reliable.
The financial reporting controls comply with the guidance given in Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
The Corporate governance report is provided on pages 48 to 61.
Independent audit The independent auditors report from PwC on page 100 expresses an unqualified opinion.
Audited financial information has been indicated with blue background shading.
Mans relationship with independent fund entities Man acts as the investment manager to fund entities.
Having considered all significant aspects of Mans relationships with fund entities, the directors are of the opinion that, although Man may have significant influence over the fund entities, the existence of independent boards of directors at the fund entities: termination provisions in the investment management agreements, which allow for the removal of the investment manager: the influence of investors: and, the arms length nature of Mans contracts with the fund entities: Man does not control the fund entities and their associated assets, liabilities and net income should not be consolidated into Mans financial statements.
An understanding of the aggregate funds under management and the fees earned from the fund entities is relevant to an understanding of Mans results and earnings sustainability and this information is provided in the Finance Directors review on page 13 and AFI 17.

Revenue and margins Management fees, which include all non-performance related fees and interest income from loans to fund products, are recognised in the period in which the services are rendered.
Performance fees are only recognised when they can be measured reliably.
Performance fees can only be measured reliably at the end of the performance period as the net asset value NAV of the fund products could move significantly, as a result of market movements, between Mans financial reporting period end and the end of the performance period.
The level of FUM drives the aggregate level of management fee revenue so in order to sustain a profitable business operating costs must be flexible with different levels of FUM.
Our strategy with regards to financial sustainability is to maintain net margins through a flexible cost base that reacts to changes in FUM.
Distribution costs Distribution costs paid to intermediaries and Mans sales executives are directly related to their marketing activity and the investors serviced by them.
The distribution expense is therefore variable to sales, FUM, and the associated management fee income to sustain management fee margins.
Distribution costs of $237 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $318 million comprise product placement fees of $83 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $151 million and investor servicing fees of $154 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $167 million.
Placement fees are paid for product launches or sales and are capitalised and amortised over the expected investment hold period refer Note 13.
Investor servicing fees are paid to intermediaries and employees for ongoing investor servicing and are expensed as incurred.
Mans internal sales force is compensated on the basis of commissions for originating assets and servicing investors and intermediaries.
Distribution costs this period included $10 million of internal sales commission costs, in particular for the institutional teams, which were previously included in compensation as these teams received discretionary compensation.
Distribution costs include $45 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $36 million relating to employees.
Asset services Asset services include valuations, fund accounting, and registrar functions performed by third parties under contract to Man, on behalf of the funds.
The cost of these services is based on activity or FUM, therefore variable with activity levels and FUM.
Previously many of these services had been performed internally.
During the period we completed an initiative to transition these services to third party providers and thereby reduce our internal resources.
Asset services costs for the period were $24 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $16 million.

Compensation 9 months to 12 months to 31 December 31 March $m 2011 2011 Salaries fixed 166 173 Salaries variable 124 165 Share-based payment charge 63 86 Fund product based payment charge 31 15 Social security costs 24 40 Pension costs 7 22 Compensation costs before adjusting items 415 501 Restructuring 7 55 GLG acquisition costs 10 Total compensation costs 422 566 Compensation is our largest cost and an important component of our ability to retain and attract talent at Man.
Our compensation strategy is set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 73.
In the short term the variable component of compensation adjusts with performance.
In the medium term the active management of headcount can reduce fixed based compensation, if required.
Compensation costs in total were $415 million, before adjusting items, or 33% of revenue compared to 34% for the previous year excluding adjusting items and a GLG purchase price accounting credit in the prior period of $54 million.
Fixed compensation and benefits was $191 million compared to $212 million in the prior 12 month period ended 31 March 2011.
Fixed compensation comprises: salaries fixed: pension costs: and a share of the social security costs.
The prior period included fixed compensation from GLG from 14 October 2010, the date of the acquisition.
During the period the remaining compensation cost synergies from the GLG acquisition were achieved.
Salaries, both fixed and variable, are charged to the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
The accounting for share-based and fund product based compensation arrangements is covered in Note 20.
The unamortised deferred compensation at period end was $91 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $177 million which had a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.6 years 31 March 2011: 2.0 years.
The decrease is due primarily to the share-based and fund product based amortisation charges as in the above table, net of a small amount of new additions in the period.
Compensation costs incurred as part of restructuring are accounted for in full at the time the obligation arises, following the communication of the formal plan, and include payments in lieu of notice and enhanced termination costs.
In the prior period GLG acquisition costs primarily relate to redundancy costs associated with achieving the acquisition cost synergies and were treated as adjusting items refer Note 8.
Pension costs relate to Mans defined contribution and defined benefit plans Note 21.
In the prior period, pension costs include $12 million related to amounts paid to beneficiaries in the defined benefit plan who elected to exit the plan.
Disclosures relating to directors remuneration are given in the Additional remuneration report information on page 133.

Within a range of FUM balances we can achieve scalability.
As FUM decreases beyond that range we have to take action to rebase our expenses in order to maintain our management fee margins.
Other costs, before adjusting items, were $262 million in the period, compared to $265 million in the prior period.
The increase on an annualised basis in other costs compared to the prior period primarily relates to occupancy costs and depreciation in connection with the new London headquarters and the inclusion of GLG costs for the full period, partially offset by the cost synergies related to the acquisition.
Restructuring costs primarily relate to onerous lease contracts on property in New York, where the plan is to consolidate our three existing offices.
In the prior period, the restructuring costs and GLG acquisition costs primarily related to professional fees.
Restructuring and GLG acquisition costs are treated as adjusting items to statutory profit Note 8.
Auditors remuneration, including advisory and professional services, is disclosed in more detail in the Corporate governance section on page 59.
Finance expense and finance income Finance expense includes interest expense on borrowings and fees of $83 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $86 million.
Finance income is $27 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $40 million.
The relative increase in finance expense from the prior period is primarily due to a $20 million charge relating to the debt buyback during the period refer to Note 17.

Taxation Man is a global business and therefore operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies set in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which they arise.
The majority of the Groups profit was earned in Switzerland, Australia and in the UK and the current effective tax rate of 17.6% 12 months to 31 March 2011: 15.7% is consistent with this earnings profile.
Further analysis is given in AFI 6.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profits Note 8 is 17.2% 12 months to 31 March 2011: 14.2%.
The higher rate is principally the result of losses for which no tax relief has been recognised and reduced relief on share-based compensation costs, which outweigh the effect of prior year tax credits.
Earnings per ordinary share EPS The calculation of basic EPS is based on: a basic post-tax net income, after payments to holders of the Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities $18 million after tax, $24 million for the prior period, of $141 million compared to $187 million in the prior period: and ordinary shares of 1,826,586,175 12 months to 31 March 2011: 1,749,928,034, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period after excluding the shares owned by the Man employee trusts.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted net income for adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS, together with details of the adjusted diluted and basic EPS is given in AFI 8.
Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, products structuring and distribution means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management businesses.
As a result, resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins, and distribution costs to allow for the analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.

The primary difference between post-tax income and cash flows from operating activities relates to: the non-cash amortisation of intangible assets, comprising GLG investment management contracts $47 million, and placement fees $75 million : other non-cash adjustments, including depreciation $21 million and share-based payments expense $70 million : as well as a reduction in loans to fund products $217 million, which are considered to be part of working capital.
In the prior period, cash flows from operating activities are 193% of statutory post-tax income.
The primary difference between post-tax income and cash flows from operating activities relates to non-cash items for the impairment charge for the Man MultiManager and Ore Hill businesses and the amortisation of intangibles, offset by the gain on sale of BlueCrest.
Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the purchase of the Lehman claims Note 14.3 and the fit out of Riverbank House.
In the prior period, cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the net cash paid to acquire GLG, partly offset by the consideration received for the disposal of the equity holding in BlueCrest.
Cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to the payment of dividends $394 million, the purchase of shares for cancellation $143 million, the purchase of shares for deferred compensation arrangements $56 million, and the purchases of senior debt $349 million as described in Note 17.
In the prior period, cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to the payment of dividends to ordinary shareholders $613 million, the repayment of the convertible note and senior debt acquired as part of the GLG acquisition $583 million, and the purchase of own shares by the ESOP Trust $108 million.

Franchise value Franchise value represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
The consideration transferred is the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred at the date of acquisition.
Franchise value is carried in the statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Franchise value has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Investment management contracts IMCs IMCs are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows of the contracts and distribution channels acquired and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives which are between 9 to 12 years, and 10 years for the GLG brand name.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units The franchise value and other intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of GLG has been allocated to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
77% of the acquired goodwill and all other intangible assets have been allocated to the GLG CGU goodwill: $1,077 million: other intangibles $672 million with the remaining 23% of the goodwill allocated to the AHL CGU goodwill: $326 million, which primarily represents the revenue synergies related to the AHL component of new AHL GLG IP220 structured products that were anticipated to be launched post acquisition.
Man Group plc Report and accounts 86 86 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 Financial review continued 12.
Franchise value goodwill and acquired intangibles continued GLG cash generating unit recoverable amount The recoverable amount of each CGU is the benefit to be derived from the asset, either through future use value in use or by disposal fair value less costs to sell of the asset, whichever is the higher.
In the case of the GLG CGU a value in use calculation gives the higher valuation, as a fair value approach would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute GLG products using its well established distribution channels, which is unlikely to be fully available to other market participants.
The value in use approach uses cash flow projections based on a stressed version of the Groups approved budget for the year to 31 December 2012 with a further two years of projections 2013 and 2014 plus a terminal value.
The following valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period in this case three years, and assumes no growth in asset flows after the three year budget period.
The value in use approach involves making judgemental assumptions.
Management were assisted by independent valuation experts in carrying out this valuation, as discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee report on page 57.
As the GLG acquisition was completed just over a year ago in October 2010 and given recent market conditions, it would be reasonable to expect the net present value of modelled cash flows to be similar to the carrying value, all other things being equal.
The strategic rationale for the acquisition and expectations of revenue synergies are still valid.
In particular, all the portfolio manager teams are still in place and the key institutional relationships have been maintained.
The anticipated cost synergies have been achieved and the anticipated revenue synergies are on track with the new sales achieved since acquisition in line with the original expectations, albeit redemptions have been somewhat higher than anticipated.
Given the relative size of the carrying value of the franchise value for this CGU and the volatility of redemptions and investment performance, management has subjected this valuation to extensive testing.
The key assumptions used in the cash flow model relate to investment performance which can give rise to performance fee income when products are above high water marks and to net flows sales and redemptions.
Gross investment performance, sales and redemptions are the primary components which impact the growth decline in funds under management, on which management fee income is based.
Actual Actual 3 year 5 year Actual Model annualised annualised return since Investment performance gross return applied to years 2012 to 2014 assumption return return inception gross gross gross gross Alternatives 12% 14% 5% 16% Long only 6% 11% 3% 7% In the above table for the model assumptions, the net performance return equivalent is approximately 8% for alternatives and 5% for long only.
The actual historical gross returns are approximated from published net returns.
Sales 2012 $11.5bn 2013 $12.6bn 2014 $13.9bn Redemption rates 2012 45% 2013 35% 2014 35% Implied long-term growth rate for total cash flows 2.1% Man Group plc Report and accounts 87 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 12.
Franchise value goodwill and acquired intangibles continued In terms of investment performance, the GLG alternatives composite return since inception is around 16% gross and GLG long only composite return since inception of around 7% gross.
The three year track record, which Man uses as a benchmark in its quarterly trading updates to the market, and demonstrates performance post the financial crisis in 2008, is around 14% gross for the GLG alternatives composite return and around 11% gross for the GLG long only composite return.
Man also typically discloses a five year annualised performance track record, which is around 5% gross for the GLG alternatives composite return and around 3% gross for the GLG long only composite return.
The base case performance assumptions used in the impairment model appear to sit comfortably in the range of these historical benchmarks.
Post the financial crisis in 2008, market studies indicated that the alternative investment industry would continue to grow and the actual experience over the last three years has validated these studies.
Therefore, in the absence of specific market predictions, historical data is a reasonable guide to future performance.
Despite the difficult market conditions in the second half of calendar 2011, gross sales relating to the GLG CGU were $11.3 billion.
The expected significant revenue synergies to be generated from acquiring and integrating the GLG business with Man, and evidence in 2011 that these revenue synergies are being achieved, support the gross sales assumption of $11.5 billion in 2012 and growing at 10% for the two following years.
The redemption rate assumption of 35% is in line with both the three and five year average redemption rates, which includes the particularly high redemption levels in 2008 and 2011.
Redemptions in 2011 were high 50% but given the market conditions in this period it is concluded that this was likely to be an exceptional year.
Reflecting the high redemptions rates in 2011, the redemption rate assumption has been set at 45% in 2012 and then reducing to 35% in 2013 and 2014, reflecting the longer term historical averages.
The terminal value is calculated at the end of 2014.
This is based on the closing funds under management as at 31 December 2014 and assumes nil net sales sales less redemptions in all future years.
It is assumed that a constant amount of performance fee income is earned post 2014 nil growth, so that funds under management, and therefore management fee income, only grow through the achievement of the investment performance assumption.
This results in an overall terminal growth rate for total net cash flows of 2.1%.
A bifurcated discount rate has been applied to the modelled cash flows to reflect the different risk profile of net performance fee income and net management fee income.
The post-tax discount rates applied to the after tax earnings are 11% for net management fee income and 17% for net performance fee income, reflecting the risk associated with each of these net income streams.
On a pre-tax basis these discount rates are 12.5% and 20.9% respectively.
Results and sensitivity The result of the value in use calculation suggests there is headroom of around $95 million over the carrying value of the franchise value and other intangibles balance and therefore no impairment is considered appropriate.
However, any reasonably significant adverse change to the key assumptions in the tables above is likely to result in an impairment charge in a future period.
In determining meaningful downside sensitivities, a possible scenario, albeit one that is not expected, would be a repeat of the difficult market conditions experienced in 2011.
The table below shows three increasingly adverse scenarios, whereby the base case key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions, which mirror the actual experience in 2011.
These stressed assumptions are applied to 2012 only in the first sensitivity: 2012 and 2013 in the second sensitivity: and in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in the third sensitivity.
The stressed assumptions are: sales as per the base case see above: redemption rate of 50%: and gross investment performance of negative 10% for alternative products and negative 14% for long only products.
The table shows the effect of these scenarios and the associated modelled impairment charge that would result.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.
Stressed assumptions applied in: 2012 only 20122013 20122014 Modelled impairment $m 287 798 1,466 If the post-tax discount rate for net management fee income was increased to 11.5% there would still be headroom of around $16 million but an increase to 12% would result in an impairment of around $53 million.
Increasing both discount rates by 1% to 18% and 12% for net performance fee income and net management fee income respectively, would result in a modelled impairment of around $60 million.

Franchise value goodwill and acquired intangibles continued Man Multi-Manager MMM cash generating unit The value of the MMM CGU has been reviewed at 31 December 2011 by assessing the fair value of the business based on sum of the parts market earnings multiples applied to the post-tax net earnings for calendar year 2011.
It is concluded that no impairment charge is required.
The year ended 31 December 2011 has been chosen as the most appropriate period on which to base the valuation as it represents the restructured business under the leadership of Luke Ellis, who was appointed in September 2010, and is less subjective than choosing a future period.
The most significant assumptions in this valuation are: the allocation of costs relating to the centralised shared infrastructure for operations, product structuring, distribution and other support functions: and the earnings multiple applied to net management fee income.
Centralised costs are allocated across internal business units using an activity based costing approach.
The average earnings multiples applied by analysts to Mans business and companies similar to MMM are around 11.5 times for management fees and 6 times for performance fees.
Applying these multiples to MMMs post-tax earnings of $48 million for the calendar year 2011 would result in a recoverable amount for MMM of $545 million with headroom of around $180 million at 31 December 2011.
It could be argued that it would be appropriate to use a lower multiple for MMM compared to that for the total Man Group as the quality of earnings for MMM may be considered to be lower than for AHL.
Reducing the earnings multiple for net management fee income by 20% to around 9.2 times would result in a recoverable amount of $435 million with headroom of approximately $70 million.
In addition, increasing the allocation of centralised costs by 10% would reduce this headroom to approximately nil.
AHL cash generating unit The value of the AHL CGU has been reviewed at 31 December 2011 by assessing the fair value of the business based on market multiples.
The average earnings multiples applied by analysts to Mans business are around 11.5 times for management fees and 6 times for performance fees.
As the majority of Mans earnings relate to AHL, it is thought appropriate to apply these multiples to AHL.
The fair value indicates a significant amount of headroom over the carrying value of the AHL goodwill and there are no realistic scenarios which would result in an impairment being recognised.
AHL continues to contribute a significant majority of Mans overall profitability and the amount of purchased goodwill relating to the AHL business is relatively small.

Other intangibles continued Placement fees Placement fees are paid to distributors and employees for selling fund products.
The majority of placement fees paid are capitalised as an intangible asset which represents the contractual right to benefit from future income from providing investment management services.
The amortisation period is based on managements estimate of the weighted average period over which Man expects to earn economic benefit from the investor in each product, estimated to be between two to five years on a straight-line basis.
If an investor redeems their investment in a fund product, the corresponding unamortised placement fee is written off.
The placement fees intangible is also subject to impairment testing each period to ensure that the future economic benefit arising from each fund product is in excess of the remaining unamortised balance.
Amortisation expense, amounts written off, and any impairment losses, are included in distribution costs in the Income Statement.
The weighted average remaining amortisation period of the unamortised placement fees at 31 December 2011 is 2.2 years 31 March 2011: 2.1 years.
From a capital management perspective capital is held against the unamortised balance of placement fees based on an evaluation of the risk of an accelerated accounting charge relating to poor investment performance or early redemptions.
From a regulatory capital perspective placement fees are an intangible asset and are required to be supported with Tier 1 regulatory capital.
Capitalised computer software Costs that are directly associated with the procurement or development of identifiable and unique software products, which will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as capitalised computer software.
Capitalised computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives 3 years and are subject to regular impairment reviews.
Amortisation of capitalised computer software is included in Other costs in the Income Statement.

Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short term advances primarily to Man structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The average balance during the period was $449 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $493 million.
Loans to fund products have decreased compared to the prior period as the structured product FUM has decreased together with the associated leverage.
The liquidity requirements of the structured products together with commitments to provide financial support refer to AFI 18, which give rise to loans to funds, are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing and any liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the committed syndicated revolving loan facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product was $18 million 31 March 2011: $41 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, but our internal modelling indicates that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of BBB or better.
Other investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our on-going business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products to investors.
These investments are generally held for less than one year.
Other investments in fund products are classified primarily at fair value through profit or loss.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
Other investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other available prices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported net asset values NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the timings of being able to redeem the fund product.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers VSPs based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the net asset values reported by the VSPs are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to NAVs where the timing of being able to redeem the fund product or events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets is disclosed in AFI 11.
Other investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore the commitment process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products was $36 million 31 March 2011: $45 million.
The market risk from other investments in fund products and other investments is modelled using a value at risk VaR methodology using a 95% confidence interval and one month time horizon.
The VaR is estimated to be $16 million at 31 December 2011 31 March 2011: $30 million.
The total net loss on investments in fund products reported in the Income Statement was $6 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: net gains of $32 million.
Fund investment for deferred compensation arrangements Employees are subject to mandatory deferral arrangements and as part of these arrangements employees can elect deferral into a designated series of Man fund products.
As the fund product plans are treated as variable plans for accounting purposes the compensation expense increases decreases based on the value of the designated fund products.
The fund product investments are held to offset this change in compensation during the vesting period and at vesting the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
The fund product investments are recorded at fair value with any unrealised gain loss during the vesting period charged to compensation expense in the Income Statement.
At period end, investment in fund products included $40 million 31 March 2011: $50 million of Man and GLG fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Man Group plc Report and accounts 91 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 14.
Investments in fund products and other investments continued 14.3.
Other investments Man has entered into a series of transactions to acquire, at the net asset values at the date of the transactions, all the residual exposure to the Lehman estates from funds Lehman claims managed by its wholly owned subsidiary GLG Partners LP.
These transactions mainly relate to GLGs European Long Short and North American Opportunity strategies.
The total consideration for the transactions was $355 million, payable in cash.
In return, Man will be entitled to benefit from, or bear the risk of, any change to the net asset value of the Lehman claims, with the funds sharing 50% of the upside in excess of a threshold where potential client money recoveries are significantly higher than currently expected.
Man will be entitled to the proceeds of each claim as and when it is distributed by the relevant Lehman estate, although the precise timing of receipts is difficult to determine given the complexity of the Lehman insolvency.
In September 2011, $22 million of the claims were realised at their carrying value.
The complex nature of underlying claims means there is no observable market for the Lehman exposures.
The purchase price was based on the aggregate of the carrying value of the Lehman exposures as recognised by the funds.
The fair values of the funds net assets are calculated monthly, and reviewed by the funds Independent Pricing Committees.
The fund directors approved the transaction following independent financial and legal analysis.
Man has elected to account for the Lehman exposures as available-forsale financial assets, which are held at fair value.
The fair value of the Lehman claims is based on a probability adjusted discounted cash flow scenario-based model.
As discussed above, there is significant uncertainty over the timing of the distribution of receipts.
Management have estimated the timing of receipts from each claim but the degree of uncertainty involved is a primary reason for these assets being classified as Level 3 financial assets.
Given the complex nature of the claims, it is not practical to give a meaningful quantification of the assumptions related to the timing of recovery of the assets.
Downward revisions in expected recoveries are likely to be recorded in the Income Statement as impairments, as they are likely to result from legal proceedings impacting on recovery rates and timings of distributions.
Upward revisions will be recorded in other comprehensive income until the administration process is materially complete, at which time any accumulated unrealised gains will be recycled through the Income Statement.

Fee receivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds NAV is determined.
All fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances were overdue or delinquent at period end.
Other receivables includes the BlueCrest loan notes, issued in March 2011, with a par value of $100 million, as part of the consideration received upon disposal of our equity stake.
The loan notes, which carry a 6.5% cash coupon, are repayable in 2016, although BlueCrest has the right to repay the loan notes before this date.
In certain circumstances, the maturity of the loan notes can be extended by BlueCrest, in which case the coupon may increase, but the final maturity will not be later than April 2019.
Man expects that the loan notes will be held to maturity and fully repaid.
For the Open Ended Investment Collective OEIC Funds businesses, Man acts as receiving agent for the collection of subscriptions due from customers and payable to the funds, and for redemption requests receivable from funds and payable to customers.
At 31 December 2011 the amount included in other receivables is $17 million 31 March 2011: $38 million.
The unsettled fund payable is recorded in trade and other payables.
The value of derivative financial instruments, which consist primarily of foreign exchange contracts, as at 31 December 2011 included in other receivables was $8 million 31 March 2011: $15 million and the notional value was $289 million 31 March 2011: $962 million.
All derivatives mature within one year.
During the period there were $61 million net realised and unrealised losses arising from derivatives 12 months ended 31 March 2011: $23 million net gains.

Foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the Groups foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities e. g. the 2015 Senior Fixed Rate Notes which are denominated in euros and sometimes to economically mitigate foreign currency cash flows.
At period end, $94 million 31 March 2011: $85 million of fee and other receivables are expected to be settled after 12 months.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables includes: accruals of $376 million 31 March 2011: $303 million, which includes compensation accruals: trade payables of $38 million 31 March 2011: $56 million, which primarily relate to GLGs OEIC business: provisions of $57 million 31 March 2011: $55 million, primarily relating to onerous property leases and to potential legal claims, and other payables of $204 million 31 March 2011: $233 million which include servicing fees payable to distributors and redemption proceeds due to investors.
Payables are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Included in trade and other payables at 31 December 2011 are balances of $99 million 31 March 2011: $87 million that are expected to be settled after more than 12 months.
Mans policy is to meet its contractual commitments and pay suppliers according to agreed terms.
The value of derivatives, comprising foreign exchange contracts, included in other payables as at 31 December 2011 was $15 million 31 March 2011: $1 million and the notional value was $653 million 31 March 2011: $308 million.
All derivative contracts mature within one year.
Cash, liquidity and borrowings Cash and cash equivalents of $1,639 million 31 March 2011: $2,359 million represent our funded liquidity resources to support our on-going operations and our stress liquidity requirements.
The cash is invested in accordance with strict limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite, which consider both the security and availability of the liquidity.
Accordingly, the cash is held in demand deposit bank accounts and unsecured and secured short term bank deposits.
All secured short term bank deposits are in the form of tripartite reverse repurchase agreements over liquid and diversified collateral and under industry standard general master repurchase agreements.
Under the reverse repurchase agreements, the Group is entitled to sell, transfer as collateral or pledge the securities it receives.
The fair value at the balance sheet date of collateral received in relation to repurchase agreements was $683 million and was greater than the carrying value of secured short term deposits placed at year end.

Foreign exchange and interest rate risk Man is subject to risk from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities.
A 10% strengthening weakening of the US dollar against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss gain of $5 million 31 March 2011: $13 million loss gain, with a corresponding impact on equity.
In respect of Mans monetary assets and liabilities which earn incur interest indexed to floating rates, as at 31 December 2011, a 50bp increase decrease in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in a $5 million increase or decrease 31 March 2011: $8 million increase or decrease in net interest income, with a corresponding impact on equity.
Liquidity and borrowings The business is cash generative at an operating level and it has the ability to generate significant equity and cash through performance fees, particularly from AHL.
Mans strategy is to have a diversified borrowing base combining both funded and unfunded committed facilities and sourced from financial institutions and capital markets.
Mans liquidity resources, aggregated to $3.2 billion at period end 31 March 2011: $4.8 billion and comprised: net free cash balances cash and cash equivalents less funded debt and the Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities of $273 million 31 March 2011: $581 million : total debt of $1.4 billion 31 March 2011: $1.8 billion, held as cash balances: and an undrawn committed syndicated loan facility of $1.56 billion 31 March 2011: $2.4 billion.
The maintenance of funded capacity and liquidity forms part of Mans strategy to manage the franchise risks of the business through different market conditions and business cycles.
The amount of potential liquidity requirements is modelled based on scenarios that Man Group plc Report and accounts 93 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 17.
Cash, liquidity and borrowings continued assume stressed market and economic conditions.
To maintain maximum flexibility none of our credit facilities have any covenants that are linked to maintaining minimum levels of funds under management, financial metrics or credit ratings.
With the exception of committed purchase arrangements AFI 18 the funding requirements relating to the investment management process are discretionary.
Where funding is utilised, transactions are evaluated on the economic benefit to the overall franchise and return on the capital deployed.
The mix of funded debt and committed facilities is a matter determined by the Board based on funding needs, availability and funding capacity in the capital and bank markets and therefore can change over time.
The liquidity profile of Man is monitored on a daily basis and the stress scenarios are updated regularly.
The Board reviews Mans funding resources at each Board meeting and on an annual basis as part of the strategic planning process.
Mans available liquidity is considered sufficient to cover the current and stress liquidity requirements.
The following table summarises Mans available liquidity maturity as at 31 December 2011 based on contractual maturity.

The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest method.
At period end, the fair value of borrowings was not significantly different to the carrying value.
The $172 million senior fixed rate notes issued in 2008 under Mans $3 billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme EMTN Programme mature on 1 August 2013 and have a coupon of 6.5% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears up to and including the maturity date 2013 Senior Fixed Rate Notes.
Man acquired $58 million of its $229 million 2013 Senior Fixed Rate Notes during the period.
The premium paid, and acceleration of an unwind of issue costs and fees, amounted to $5 million, and was included in finance expense.
The 382 million senior fixed rate notes issued in 2010 under the EMTN Programme mature on 18 February 2015 and have a coupon of 6.0% per annum payable annually in arrears up to and including the maturity date 2015 Senior Fixed Rate Notes.
The 2015 Senior Fixed Rate Notes are usually swapped into US dollars on an ongoing basis and invested in US dollars.

The $300 million RegS 11% perpetual subordinated capital securities Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities were issued in 2008 and have a perpetual maturity date with optional par redemption at Mans discretion on 7 May 2013 and any coupon date thereafter, subject to FSA approval.
On any coupon date we may exchange or vary the Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities for qualifying non-innovative Tier 1 securities e. g. perpetual non-cumulative preference shares.
The 11% per annum coupon is payable quarterly in arrears and is deferrable at the discretion of Man.
The Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities have been classified as equity on the basis that they are irredeemable except at the option of Man, and coupon payments and principal repayments can be deferred indefinitely.
The coupon is therefore classified as dividends in the equity section.
The committed syndicated revolving loan facility of $2.4 billion was restructured during the period and replaced with a new committed syndicated revolving loan facility of $1.56 billion.
The facility was undrawn at period end and has a maturity date of 22 July 2016.

On 3 May 2011, Man acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Ore Hill for predominantly share based consideration, with it becoming a subsidiary undertaking at that date.
Associates are entities in which Man holds an interest and over which it has significant influence but not control.
Joint ventures are entities in which Man has joint control through contractual arrangements.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are recorded by the equity method of accounting and at cost plus or minus our share of cumulative post-acquisition movements in undistributed profits or losses.
Gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entities.
Where Man has investments in certain fund entities over which it is able to exert significant influence but not control, these are classified as associates.
Man has applied the scope exclusion within IAS 28 Investments in Associates for mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities and has classified such holdings as investments and measured them at fair value through profit or loss.
Summary financial information of our associates has not been provided as it is considered excessive in length and is not considered meaningful.
Details of all associates will be annexed in the Companys annual return.
Man Group plc Report and accounts 95 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 19.
Leasehold improvements and equipment The increase in leasehold improvements and equipment reflects the costs associated with the investment in our new Data Centre facility Woking and the fit out of our new London headquarters, Riverbank House.
For the details of the movements in leasehold improvements and equipment during the period, refer to AFI 12.
Deferred compensation arrangements Man operates cash and equity settled share-based schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
Details of these schemes may be found in the Remuneration report on pages 62 to 73 and in the Additional remuneration report information on pages 122 to 123.
In respect of equity settled share-based schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using a binomial model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Financial assumptions include the future share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and the best estimate outcome of performance conditions.
Forfeiture and early vesting are based upon historical observable data.
The fair values per option and award granted during the period to employees, and the assumptions used in the calculations are contained in the AFI 14.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options awarded granted.
Changes to the original estimates, if any, are included in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
For cash-settled share-based compensation schemes, a liability is recognised for the services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement for the period, taking into account the period of vesting to date.
Man also operates compensation plans in which deferred compensation is invested in Man fund products.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, re-measured at each reporting date until the settlement date is reached.
The fair value of the awards equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at the settlement date.
During the period, $94 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $101 million was included in compensation expense for share-based payment and deferred fund product plans, split between equity settled share based payments of $56 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $76 million, cash-settled share based payments totalling $7 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $10 million, and deferred fund product plans of $31 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $15 million.
20.1 Employee Trusts The Employee Trusts have the obligation to deliver shares, options and fund product based payments which have been granted to employees.
Man contributed funds in order for the Trusts to meet their current period obligations of $38 million 12 months to 31 March 2011: $24 million in the period.
At period end the Employee Trusts held 55.5 million Man shares, $29 million notional value options over Man shares, and $16 million fund units to deliver against the future obligations.
The Trusts are fully consolidated into Man and shares held are treated as treasury stock for EPS purposes.
The shares held by the Trust are deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
Pension benefits Man operates 12 31 March 2011: 12 defined contribution plans and two 31 March 2011: two funded defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plans Man pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
Man has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.
Defined contribution pension costs for continued operations totalled $7 million for the nine months to 31 December 2011 12 months to 31 March 2011: $8 million.
The contributions are recognised as pension costs when they are due.
Man Group plc Report and accounts 96 96 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 Financial review continued 21.
Pension benefits continued Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland the Swiss Plan.
At 31 December 2011, the UK plan comprised 83% 31 March 2011: 78% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
The UK plan was closed to new members in May 1999, and to future accrual in May 2011.
The Swiss plan remains open to new members.
The asset recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets including the Reservoir Trust described below less the present value of the defined benefits obligation at the balance sheet date adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses.
The surplus or deficit before adjustment for unrecognised actuarial losses represents the shareholders obligation to the pension plans and the potential use of Mans resources in the future.
The latest funding valuation of the UK plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2008 and indicated a deficit of 75 million.
Man has agreed that from April 2010 additional cash contributions each year will be made to cover the cost of accruing benefits less the contributions made by active members.
In addition, to remove the funding deficit it was agreed that Man would pay 7.3 million every year from March 2010 until 31 March 2015 with a further lump sum to be paid in March 2016 to cover any remaining funding deficit at 31 December 2015.
Under these arrangements no cash contributions were made to the UK plan in the nine months to 31 December 2011 and 7.3 million is due in March 2012.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK plan, Man also set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 49 million or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gives the pension trustees comfort that Man can fund a deficit at 31 December 2015 and in the event that the UK plan is fully funded, allows Man to recover the assets so that the plan is not overfunded.
In addition, as part of a review of ongoing pension arrangements Man closed the UK plan to future benefit accrual from 31 May 2011.
Employed members of the UK plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the UK plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
For Man this process aligned compensation arrangements for employees in the UK plan with other employees, and reduced the administration cost of the UK plan.
All cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the date of the Groups IFRS transition 1 April 2004 were recognised in full.
Actuarial gains and losses arising subsequently from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are not recognised in the current period unless the cumulative unrecognised gain or loss at the end of the previous reporting period exceeds the greater of 10% of the plan assets or liabilities.
In these circumstances the excess is charged or credited to the income statement over the employees expected average remaining working lives.
The amounts recognised in the Statement of Financial Position are determined as follows: 31 December 31 March $m 2011 2011 Present value of funded obligations 385 366 Fair value of plan assets 381 401 Deficit surplus 4 35 Unrecognised actuarial losses 96 56 Net pension asset in the Statement of Financial Position at period end 92 91 Additional information regarding the actuarial valuation and changes in plan assets and liabilities has been included in AFI 15.
Our economic capital model includes capital in respect of a possible deficit in the pension plans.
This is also the amount of regulatory capital we hold under Pillar 2 in respect of the pension plans.

Shareholders equity decreased during the period as a result of dividend payments and the purchase of own shares, partially offset by profits for the period.
During the nine month period to 31 December 2011, the Company purchased 66,176,820 31 March 2011: nil ordinary shares, equivalent to 3.51% of the issued share capital for a total consideration of $143 million.
In the prior year shareholders equity increased as a result of profits and issuance of shares in relation to the GLG acquisition, net of dividend payments.
The close period buyback obligations relate to share buybacks contractually undertaken with third parties.
More information can be found in Note 4 of the Company financial statements.
The proposed final dividend will reduce shareholders equity by $124 million 31 March 2011: $229 million.

Capital management Investor confidence is an important element in the sustainability of our franchise.
That confidence comes, in part, from the strength of our capital base.
Man has maintained significant excess capital and available liquidity throughout the recent periods of financial crisis.
This capital has given Man flexibility to support our investors, intermediaries and financial partners and to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their investment exposures.
This confidence gives our franchise credibility and sustainability.
We have a conservative capital and liquidity framework which allows us to invest in the growth of the business.
We utilise capital to support the operation of the investment management process and the launch of new fund products.
We view this as a competitive advantage which allows us to align directly our interests with those of investors and intermediaries.
Man monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory capital and economic capital, including monthly reporting to Finance Committee and the Board.
The Board approach to the use or distribution of available capital surpluses is discussed in the Chairmans Review.
Post balance sheet events On 29 February 2012, the UK Supreme Court handed down a judgment in appeal regarding the direction sought by the administrators of Lehman Brothers International Europe LBIE in relation to certain client money held by LBIE.
It is likely that this judgment will have a significant impact on the timing and quantum of distributions of client money by LBIE.
As this outcome was anticipated by us, we do not believe that this decision will impact the valuation of the Lehman claims held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2011, although the decision confirms that the timing of the distribution of receipts remains uncertain.

Regulatory capital unaudited For regulatory capital purposes Man is subject to consolidated financial supervision by the UK Financial Services Authority FSA in the same manner as our bank intermediaries and counterparties.
Our regulatory capital requirements are in accordance with FSA rules consistent with the Capital Requirements Directive.
We use the Standardised Approach to calculate Pillar 1 requirements for both credit risk and operational risk.
Our assessment of internal capital adequacy for Pillar 2 purposes is based on our economic capital model which uses a combination of stochastic and scenario modelling.
Our financial resources have exceeded our financial resource requirements regulatory capital requirements at all times during the period.
The majority of our regulatory capital requirements relate to acquisition franchise value and other intangibles which, as we are subject to consolidated supervision, must be deducted in full from our Tier 1 capital.
The remaining financial resource requirements, mainly in relation to operational risk see page 26 for more details and risks arising on investments in fund products Note 14 are supported by available Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
The table below summarises the regulatory capital requirements.
The increase in excess capital from the previous period primarily relates to the decrease in the financial resources requirement, caused by a reduction in the Pillar 1 operational risk requirement, which is based on an average of the prior three years revenue.
Groups regulatory capital position 31 December 31 March 1 $m 2011 2011 Permitted share capital and reserves 3,696 3,653 Innovative Tier 1 Perpetual Subordinated Capital Securities 198 178 Less franchise value and other intangibles: Franchise value 1,733 1,704 Investments in associates JVs 36 66 Placement fees 157 184 Other intangibles 649 690 Available Tier 1 Group capital 1,319 1,187 Tier 2 capital subordinated debt 358 383 Other Tier 2 capital 106 126 Material holdings deductions 20 20 Group financial resources 1,763 1,676 Less financial resources requirement including a capital buffer 1,176 1,325 Excess capital 587 351 1 The Board capital buffer of $300 million has been added to the financial resources requirement in the comparative period.
Basel III and CRD IV come into force on 1 January 2013.
The FSA guidance has not been finalised and therefore it is not possible to definitively quantify the impact but it is likely that our available Tier 1 capital will reduce and there is a possibility that our qualifying Tier 2 capital will decrease.
