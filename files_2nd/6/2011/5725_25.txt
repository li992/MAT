52 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Review Giacomo Baizini Revenues grew by 22% to US$16.4 billion, driven primarily by price increases, particularly for steel products.
Stronger revenues and a higher proportion of value-added products within the revenue mix had a positive impact on EBITDA, which increased 23% year-onyear to US$2.9 billion.
Giacomo Baizini Chief Financial officer Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group on pages 84 to 151 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
The presentation currency is US dollars.
Overview We delivered a solid financial performance in 2011, increasing revenues by 22% to US$16.4billion and our EBITDA to US$2.9 billion, despite the volatile market environment.
We also successfully reduced our net debt by 10% to US$6,442 million as of 31 December 2011.
A further key achievement was the Companys successful incorporation in the UK during 2011 with a Premium Listing on the Main Market of the LSE.
As a result, on 7 December 2011 EVRAZ became a FTSE 100 company and the only steel stock in the UK FTSE All-Share Index.
The listing is enabling us to broaden our shareholder base and provide us with a greater access to international capital markets for our funding requirements.
Stronger revenues and a higher proportion of value-added products within the revenue mix had a positive impact on EBITDA, which increased 23% year-on-year to US$2.9 billion.
Whilst the Steel division was the major contributor to revenue growth, our mining operations were responsible for more than half the Groups EBITDA, reinforcing the value of a strong raw materials asset base.

This is due to the fact that our net profit line in 2011 was negatively affected by one-off items.
In H12011 we booked a loss of US$161 million relating to the successful incentivised conversion of our 2014 convertible bonds.
In H2 2011 we incurred US$19 million of expenses for obtaining the Premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.
Without these items our 2011 net profit would have been US$633 million.
Our H1 2011 profit was also affected by US$71 million of charges on early repurchase of our 2013 Eurobonds.
Cash Costs With regard to our cost structure, raw materials and goods for resale represent over 50% of our operating expenses and these costs are largely dependent on commodity prices and the wider market environment.
Auxiliary materials, contractor services, production labour and energy account for a further 40% and have been subject to inflation during the year.
With regard to personnel expenses for 2012, we have reached agreements with our Russian operations on wage increases to take effect twice a year, in March April and October.
Wage increases in our operations are agreed at a level of 10-12% for the year in the CIS, and 2-3% for our international operations.
Capital Requirements In addition to meeting its working capital requirements, EVRAZ expects that repayments of outstanding debt, capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments will represent the Companys most significant use of funds over the coming years.
Our capital expenditure programme is focused on the reconstruction and modernisation of existing production facilities in order to reduce costs, improve process flows and expand the product range.
We spent US$1.28 billion on total capital expenditure in 2011 compared with US$832 million in 2010, an increase of 54% due to renewed investment in modernisation projects and mine development.

US$1.2 billion of cash flows were used in investing activities, related to own capital expenditure and a further US$1.3 billion were used for financing activities, principally the payment of interest and dividends.
This represented a significant increase of 42% over 2010 as we made our first dividend payment since 2008, consisting of an interim dividend and a special dividend, which amounted to $491 million.

54 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Review Overview Continued Net Debt Over the past three years, EVRAZ has focused on financial management with the objective of reducing its total level of debt and replacing its short-term debt with longer-term debt to better match its funding to its planned long-term capital expenditure.
As a result, in 2011 we undertook a number of refinancing transactions which amounted to a total of approximately US$2 billion: r US$850 million of new 6.75% Eurobond due 2018 issued in May 2011.
We used part of the proceeds from this issue to purchase approximately US$622 million of the outstanding bonds due in 2013 r 20 billion rouble-denominated Bonds approximately US$721 million placed in June 2011 at 8.40% to take advantage of the Rouble bond market.
These were swapped into US dollars at rates of 4.45 4.60%.
r A 5-year US$500 million unsecured credit facility from Gazprombank closed in October 2011 used to prepay the existing US$300 million secured loan r A 5-year US$610 million revolving facility signed with a consortium of banks by our North American subsidiaries at a record-low 1.5% to 2% over LIBOR.
In June 2011, we also incentivised a conversion of US$650 million of convertible bonds due in 2014.
These transactions helped the Company to reduce its peak maturities in 2013 and 2014 and extend the average maturity across the debt portfolio, as well as to reduce our consolidated indebtedness and the average cost of debt.
Net debt at the end of the period was US$6,442 million compared to US$7,184 million at the end of 2010, a decrease of 10% year-on-year.
Furthermore, we have significantly reduced our short-term debt from US$2 billion in December 2009 to US$626 million at the end of 2011.
The average maturity of our debt is now 3.8 years, up from 3.4 years in June 2009.
As a result of our improved financial position, EVRAZs credit ratings have been upgraded to B, Stable from S&P, to Ba3, Stable from Moodys and to BB-, Stable from Fitch.
To manage liquidity risk, our target is to maintain a level of liquidity of above US$1 billion at any time.
This is cash as well as any undrawn credit facilities which can be rolled-over for a long-term period.
Dividends On 10 October 2011 the EVRAZ Board approved a new dividend policy.
Under the revised dividend policy EVRAZ is targeting a long-term average dividend payout ratio of at least 25% of the consolidated net profit calculated in accordance with IFRS and adjusted for non-recurring items.
Dividends are expected to be paid semi-annually.
In addition to the regular dividend payments, the Company may also employ special dividends from time to time at the discretion of the EVRAZ Board to return surplus capital to shareholders.
On the back of our strong financial results, during 2011 Evraz Group S. A. made its first dividend payment since 2008, paying an interim dividend of US$0.60 per share US$0.20 per GDR and a special dividend of US$2.70 per share US$0.90 per GDR.
EVRAZ plc has also declared a cash final dividend of US$0.17 per share.
This gives a total ordinary dividend for 2011 of US$317 million, which is approximately 50% of net profit adjusted for non-recurring items.
Exchange Rate Changes The Groups exposure to currency risk is disclosed in Note 29 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The currency risk is mostly related to the fluctuations of the Russian rouble against US dollar.
This contributed to increasing the costs at our Russian subsidiaries compared to 2010.
Our policy is not to take any specific hedging measures to mitigate fluctuating exchange rates, because we believe that our business is to a large extent naturally hedged against foreign exchange risk.
The majority of EVRAZ revenues are received in roubles for sales in Russia and US dollars almost all sales in other countries.
However, rouble prices in the Russian domestic market are linked to export parity, so viewed as effectively US dollar prices with a domestic premium in times of higher demand.
Also, domestic sales in Russia are generally more profitable compared to exports due to the effect of transportation costs.
When the Russian market performs well, the rouble appreciates, which leads to both increased costs and increased revenues in US dollar terms due to both the domestic premium and the higher proportion of domestic sales.
On the other hand, when the Russian economy weakens, rouble production costs fall, while steel prices usually follow the RUB USD exchange rate trend and more steel is exported.
Finally, almost all of EVRAZs debt is US dollar denominated including the Rouble bonds which are swapped into US dollars.
Business Overview Strategy Operating Review Sustainability Financial Review Governance Financial Statements EVRAZ plc 55 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Expenses Our interest expense relating to debt in 2011 was US$654 million, a decrease of 2% compared with US$670 million in 2010 due to a reduction in total debt.
We also realised a gain of US$66 million from the cross-currency swaps on the rouble bonds.
This means effectively an interest expense of US$588 million, which includes amortisation of debt issue costs.
Income Tax Our income tax expense amounted to US$420 million compared to US$163 million in 2010.
EVRAZs effective tax rate, defined as income tax expense benefit as a percentage of profit loss before tax, increased from 25.8% in 2010 to 48.1% in 2011.
EVRAZs income tax expense in 2010 was partially offset by a benefit of US$142 million relating to enacting a new tax code in Ukraine.
In 2011, the US$161 million expense related to the incentivised conversion of the 2014 convertible bonds and the US$71 million of premium paid in the tender of the 2013 Eurobonds were not deductible.
Outlook Given the challenging outlook for the industry, we continue carefully to monitor and proactively address any potential issues of future compliance with the covenants associated with the Companys financial indebtedness.
Furthermore, EVRAZ continues to have substantial financial headroom, having in excess of US$800 million of cash on our balance sheet at the end of 2011 as well as significant liquidity available in committed and uncommitted credit lines to support our operations and investment plans.
The successful placement of US$600 million of 2017 Eurobonds at a coupon of 7.40% in April 2012 only helped to strengthen our financial position in preparing for our 2013 maturities.
