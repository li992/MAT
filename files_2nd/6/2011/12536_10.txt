Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 21 As at 31 December 2011 proven and probable 2P reserves, on a working interest basis, were 284 mmboe 2010: 261 mmboe.
On a proforma basis the EnCore acquisition, completed in early January 2012, increased reserves to 296 mmboe, giving a reserve replacement ratio of 333 per cent.
Proven and 2P reserves and probable 2P 2C contingent reserves resources mmboe mmboe Start of 2011 261 488 Production 15 15 Net additions and revisions 38 40 End of 2011 284 513 EnCore acquisition 12 14 Proforma total 296 527 The EnCore acquisition completed in January 2012.
Reserve additions exclude EnCores interest in the Cladhan field which was sold in March 2012.
Upon completion of the EnCore acquisition, the percentage of liquids in total reserves increased from 35 per cent at the end of 2010 to 51 per cent.
The equivalent volume of 2P reserves on an entitlement basis amounted to 263.8 mmboe 2010: 222.0 mmboe based on a price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2012 and 2013 and US$75 bbl in real terms thereafter 2010: fixed price of US$75 bbl.
Booked reserve additions were mainly due to the acquisition of EnCore additional 15 per cent equity in Catcher area, progress with the Solan field and the additional equity acquired in Wytch Farm.
Other reserves additions included exploration successes at Burgman in the UK and at Kadanwari in Pakistan.
Proforma contingent resources at year-end were increased to 231 mmboe 2010: 227 mmboe.
Asia Premier successfully completed the Chim So and Gajah Baru projects achieving first oil and gas in the fourth quarter, driving the companys year-end production run-rate to 60 kboepd.
In Indonesia, we continue to develop our gas positions and are accelerating development of the Pelikan and Naga projects set to achieve sanction in the first half of 2012.
In Vietnam, significant progress has been achieved in plans to develop the Dua field which is also expected to be sanctioned in the first half of 2012.
22 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements OPERATIONS REVIEW continued Indonesia During 2011, the Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A sold an overall gross average of 161 billion British thermal units per day BBtud 2010: 160 BBtud, including rates in excess of 200 BBtud as Gajah Baru came on-stream.
The Anoa facility delivered 5 per cent over its contractual market share at nearly 42 per cent.
The non-operated Kakap field contributed a further 42 BBtud gross 2010: 54 BBtud.
Gross liquids production from the Block A Anoa field increased by over a third to an average 2,400 barrels of oil per day bopd 2010: 1,758 bopd with a further 3,400 bopd 2010: 2,993 bopd from Kakap.
Overall, net production from Indonesia amounted to 11,450 boepd 2010: 11,650 boepd.
The Gajah Baru development involved the successful installation in 2011 of a new central processing platform connected to a new wellhead platform on schedule and budget.
The gas export equipment was tied into the existing subsea West Natuna Transportation System pipeline to deliver additional gas to Singapore.
During the year, five development wells were successfully completed, providing in excess of 200 BBtud of gas deliverability from this new facility.
Volumes from the Gajah Baru field are being supplied in accordance with the second Gas Sales Agreement GSA2.
Good progress has also been made on a swap agreement GSA5 under which additional volumes of Gajah Baru gas supplied to Singapore will be swapped with existing supplies from Sumatra to Singapore.
These Sumatra volumes will be re-directed to the Indonesian domestic gas market.
The relevant agreements are expected to be completed shortly and physical supplies of up to 40 BBtud gross should commence in the second quarter of this year.
GSA5 will replace gas previously contracted to be supplied to Batam Island, Indonesia, under GSA3 and GSA4 until at least December 2013, when GSA3 and GSA4 contracts are expected to commence.
On the Anoa field, workovers were performed on the A7 and A11 wells.
These workovers added a further 30 million standard cubic feet per day mmscfd of gas deliverability.
A new oil well A22 was successfully completed which added around 1,500 bopd of incremental oil production.
A three-well drilling campaign on the Anoa fields West Lobe platform has progressed well and included the discovery of new reserves in the deeper Lama reservoir below Anoa.
In order to upgrade the compression facilities and to increase production capacity on the producing Anoa field, a major brown-field development project has been sanctioned, extending the assumed field plateau and developing some 200 bcf of gross field reserves.
This project, known as Anoa Phase 4, will be completed in 2013.
Elsewhere on the block, tendering commenced for the engineering, procurement, construction and installation EPCI contract for two wellhead platforms and connecting pipelines for the development of the Pelikan and Naga fields.
Final project sanction and contract award is expected in mid-2012, to provide future supply to existing Singapore and Indonesia sales contracts.
On the non-operated Block A in Aceh a fully termed production sharing contract PSC, extending the licence term for 20 years, became effective from 1 September 2011.
Work continued on the gas development project in support of two firm GSAs.
However, the EPCI contract for the facilities will be re-tendered and first gas is now scheduled for 2015.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 23 Vietnam First oil production from the Chim So oil field was achieved safely and on budget in October, followed by the commencement of gas export in early December.
By year-end, close to 2 million barrels had already been produced from six production wells.
A further three production wells will be available to come on-stream in early 2012 when the four well water injection system will also commence.
Further valuable opportunities have been identified in the Chim So area.
A well deepened into the Oligocene directly beneath the main field proved an estimated 17 metres of net hydrocarbon-bearing pay, and an additional well to be drilled in early 2012 will accelerate production from a shallow reservoir which has larger reserves than initially evaluated.
The CS-N2P well, a development production well for the Chim So project, intersected the shallow part of a previously undrilled fault terrace to the north west of the Chim So field.
The well encountered a 20 metre oil column in an independent closure within good quality Upper Dua sandstones.
The plan is to further appraise this new accumulation in 2012 as a near-field tie-back opportunity.
In December the Government of Vietnam approved the outline development plan for the Dua field and orders were placed for the equipment required to develop Dua as a tie-back to Chim So.
We are targeting full production from Dua in early 2014.
North Sea Our North Sea business unit continued to grow with the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc which held an additional 15 per cent in the Catcher area and the purchase of an additional 17.7 per cent equity in Wytch Farm.
The development portfolio has moved forward significantly with the Huntington field targeting first oil and the Rochelle area achieving project sanction for first gas during 2012.
Significant concept engineering work was completed on newly acquired projects, with the Solan project achieving Premier Board sanction in March 2012.
Production performance in the first half of 2011 was hampered by downtime on key producing assets.
These maintenance issues have been resolved and Premier is now seeing a stronger production performance from existing fields in 2012.
24 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements OPERATIONS REVIEW continued UK 2011 production net to Premier was 10,300 boepd 2010: 15,500 boepd.
Production was negatively affected by extended unplanned downtime on key producing assets.
The Balmoral area fields were shut-in in the first quarter due to topside integrity issues and in mid-year due to a subsea leak.
The non-operated Wytch Farm field was shut-in during January due to a flow line leak which occurred late in 2010 giving rise to a full pipeline integrity study.
Production from the non-operated Scott field was restricted in the first quarter due to a fracture in the gas export line which required restricted production from high gas oil ratio wells to comply with the gas flare consent.
Production from the Balmoral area improved in the second half of 2011 as the immediate issues that affected our production performance in the first half of the year were resolved.
The December 2011 B-Block production rate was significantly better at around 7,500 boepd net to Premier compared to the 2011 full-year average of 3,750 boepd.
The non-operated Kyle field contributed strong production until gale force winds in December damaged the mooring system of the host Banff FPSO production facility, forcing it 270 metres off location and causing damage to the Banff field subsea risers, umbilicals and possibly the FPSO turret.
The damage is currently being assessed by the operator of Banff but it is likely that the Kyle field will be shut-in until mid-2013.
Premier is currently processing insurance claims under its business interruption and property damage policies.
Several significant acquisitions were negotiated in 2011, the most significant of which being the purchase of EnCore Oil plc which included 15 per cent equity and operatorship of the Catcher area.
Premier now owns 50 per cent of the Catcher area and is therefore in a strong position to progress the development of the areas discovered resources towards first oil in 2015.
Development studies are well under way and a decision on the conceptual design is targeted for the first half of 2012.
In addition to Catcher, Premier acquired additional licences via the EnCore acquisition, including the Cladhan discovery and the Coaster prospect.
Premier agreed to sell its newly acquired 16.6 per cent equity interest in Cladhan for US$54 million and farm down 50 per cent of the acquired 100 per cent equity in the Coaster prospect on a promoted basis.
The sale of Cladhan was completed in March 2012.
Acquisition of an additional 17.7 per cent equity in the Wytch Farm producing asset was completed in late December at a final cost of US$90 million, increasing Premiers equity to 30.1 per cent of remaining reserves and adding approximately 2,500 boepd of net production in 2012.
A new pre-development asset was acquired by the purchase of a 60 per cent equity in the Solan field P164, Block 205 26a which is located west of Shetland.
Premier was appointed as development operator in January 2012.
The upfront acquisition cost was US$10 million, with Premier providing a carry and financing package to the prior owner during the development phase.
The Solan project received internal Premier approval in March 2012 and is expected to receive DECC development sanction approvals shortly.
The field is expected to produce around 42 million barrels following first oil in 2014 with capital expenditure of around US$850 million.
Premier also exercised an option to become the operator of the Fyne field with a 39.9 per cent equity stake, in return for providing a carry through ongoing exploration and appraisal work.
The results of the nearby Erne discovery well, drilled in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the East Fyne appraisal well, completed in 2012, are currently being evaluated by the joint venture partners.
However, at this stage, potential developments in the Greater Fyne area do not meet the companys economic thresholds.
Significant progress was achieved on other development assets.
The Phase 1 subsea installation for the Huntington field has been successfully completed and one injection and three production wells have been drilled with production rates testing at over 10,000 bopd per well.
Earlier schedule slippage on the Voyageur FPSO was addressed by a change in ownership of the vessel.
The FPSO upgrade is now progressing in Norway and the operator is expecting first oil during the fourth quarter.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 25 The East and West Rochelle subsea fields were unitised Premier equity 15 per cent to facilitate the fast track Rochelle development programme via the Scott platform host production facility.
A processing tariff was agreed with the Scott owners and initial Rochelle modifications were made to the Scott topside facility during the year.
The development programme has made good progress towards first gas from Rochelle in November 2012.
The subsea fabrication work is on schedule and drilling rigs have been contracted to drill the Rochelle development wells this summer.
The Caledonia field redevelopment project, close to the Balmoral area, made progress during 2011 and is now part of a project to bring fuel gas to Balmoral.
Project sanction is expected later in 2012 for first oil and gas in 2014.
Norway Progress has been made on the Bream development during 2011.
After engineering evaluation of a number of different alternatives, the selected development concept is an FPSO and subsea wells with artificial lift.
A specific FPSO has been identified and front end engineering studies are being conducted for both this vessel and the associated subsea systems and wells.
A project sanction decision will be taken after the engineering studies and FPSO contract negotiations are completed in the second quarter of 2012.
A licence extension until February 2013 has been granted.
The first oil date for the field would be late 2015.
The Fry project made a technical concept selection in the first quarter of 2011.
However, the operator decided not to continue the project in its current form for strategic reasons.
Further work has been completed during the year on a potential area development, which would take resources from a number of fields within a 10-20km distance to a central processing hub.
Middle East, Africa and Pakistan Natural decline in gas production in Pakistan was more than offset by ongoing infield development, exploration successes and compression upgrades.
Oil production in Mauritania also remained stable.
While the focus has been on enhancing the value of our Pakistan producing assets, we continue to build our exploration portfolio elsewhere in the region.
