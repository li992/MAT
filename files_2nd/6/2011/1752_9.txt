Professional and effective pension scheme management is paramount to enable members and sponsors to be confident in the trustees stewardship of the schemes.
As such, in addition to the investment subcommittee referred to above, a cross scheme governance committee has been established across the three largest schemes to improve the effectiveness of the trustee boards, sub-committees and advisers as well as to enhance trustee training and decision making.
Suitable measures will be introduced to ensure continuous improvement in these areas.
