During the year, the second stage of changes took effect that was started in 2010, to reduce accrual rates or increase member contributions.
Also during the year, a dynamic fiderisking strategy was implemented for the management of the assets of the main UK pension schemes under which asset and liability values are monitored on a daily basis by the asset manager and appropriate asset allocation decisions taken as the funding level improves against pre-agreed trigger points.
The triennial valuations of the main UK schemes as at 31st December 2010 were completed during the year.
These show a deterioration versus the position at the end of 2007 but an improvement on the interim valuation results at the end of 2008 and 2009.
The triennial valuation resulted in a continuation of the previously agreed deficit reduction cash contributions of 7.9 million in respect of 2011, but with a shortening of the contribution periods that now progressively reduce this amount in stages to nil by 2018, three years earlier than previously.

Capital structure Our policy remains to keep a strong balance sheet to protect the business and facilitate all required resources for future expansion whether capital investment, acquisitions or organic growth.
Where cash resources exceed expected future requirements, we will generally seek to return excess cash to shareholders.
The Group has operating companies in over 30 countries and the Group Treasury function in the UK centrally manages the various treasury and currency issues that arise from our geographically diverse business.
We monitor closely compliance with the Group Treasury Policy and typically use simple forward contracts to appropriately manage exposures to known cash flows.
