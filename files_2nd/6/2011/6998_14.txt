Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios.
These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to EBITDAR and fixed charge cover.
Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges.
Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
As a result of the current economic conditions and the attitude towards debt the Group has decided to reduce the level of net debt and operates favourably to these target metrics.
