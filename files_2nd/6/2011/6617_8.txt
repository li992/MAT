2.1 | Financial review BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION The financial information has been prepared on a basis as outlined in note1 of the financial statements.
It is presented in the Overview and the Financial review sections before significant items unless otherwise stated to provide an enhanced understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
Significant items are items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact and nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results.

38 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN RESuLTS Adjusted EBIT increased 2% to $ 5,398 million in 2011 compared to 2010.
The 2011 results benefited from generally higher average prices for the key commodities Glencore produces and mostly greater volumes handled by our marketing groups, tempered by the marked decline in agricultural marketing performance.
Nonetheless, the Groups large scale, vertically integrated business model, spanning a diverse commodity portfolio, served to underpin a modest overall rise in Group profitability.
Adjusted EBIT Adjusted EBIT by business segment is as follows: 2011 2010 Marketing Industrial Adjusted Marketing Industrial Adjusted US$million activities activities EBIT activities activities EBIT Metals and minerals 1242 1357 2599 48% 1401 1160 2561 48% Energy products 697 375 1072 20% 450 235 685 13% Agricultural products 8 39 47 1% 659 58 717 14% Corporate and other 20 1794 1774 33% 173 1500 1327 25% Total 1911 3487 5398 100% 2337 2953 5290 100% Corporate industrial activities include $1,893million 2010: $1,729million of Glencores equity accounted share of Xstratas income.
Marketing Adjusted EBIT declined by 18% to $1,911million in 2011, primarily due to the underperformance of our agricultural products division largely associated with the unprecedented volatility and disruption in the cotton market.
Industrial Adjusted EBIT was up by 18% to $3,487million in 2011, benefiting from generally stronger commodity prices and increased production at many operations, as ongoing expansionary plans are progressed.
The metals and minerals segment Adjusted EBIT increased slightly to $2,599million, with 17% growth in the industrial asset portfolio, driven by stronger metal prices and increased production, offsetting an 11% decline in marketing contribution.
The latter was due to lower profits from the ferroalloys and zinc copper departments which benefited in 2010 from strong physical purchasing and restocking fundamentals while overall firm physical premia and volumes were maintained during 2011.
The largest increase in Adjusted EBIT in 2011 was from the energy segment, up 56% to $1,072million, primarily due to the stronger oil market fundamentals during the first half of the year.
Increased coal volumes from Prodeco and commencement of oil production at the Aseng field in Q42011 accounted for the 60% increase in industrial energy EBIT contribution to $375million.
The agricultural products segment had a negative Adjusted EBIT of $47million in 2011, compared to a contribution of $ 717million in 2010.
The year-on-year decline was significantly impacted by the cotton activities, where extreme market volatility produced an outcome of ineffective hedging due to the dislocation of physical and paper markets and high levels of physical contractual non-performance by suppliers and customers.
Our agricultural asset portfolio is currently in a phase of considerable targeted expansion and development, which is expected to translate into enhanced scale and performance going forward.
The 2011 result, in large part, reflects the current negative biodiesel production margin environment in Europe.
Corporate and other primarily relates to the Groups equity accounted interest in Xstrata and the variable pool bonus accrual, the net result of which increased from $1,327million to $1,774million.
Xstrata accounted for $164million up 10% of this improvement, with overhead reduction accounting for the balance.
| Annual Report 2011 | 39 Revenue Revenue for the year ended 31December 2011 was $186,152million, a 28% increase compared to $144,978million in 2010.
The increase is primarily due to higher average commodity prices for most of the commodities which the Group produces and markets.
Higher year-on-year average prices were notable in crude oil 39% for Brent, copper 17%, wheat 22% and gold 28% however, given the relatively high contribution of Glencores oil business to Group revenue, the increase in average oil prices is the largest driver of the total revenue increase over the period.
Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold for the year ended 31December2011 was $ 181,938 million, a 30% increase from $ 140,467 million in the year ended 31December 2010.
This increase was primarily due to the higher commodity prices noted above and the resulting impact on the purchases of the respective commodities.
Selling and administrative expenses Selling and administrative expenses for the year ended 31December2011 were $ 857 million, a 19% reduction from $ 1,063 million in 2010, primarily due to lower variable employee compensation charges.
Share of income from associates and jointly controlled entities Share of income from associates and jointly controlled entities for the year ended 31December 2011 was $ 1,972million, a 8% increase from $ 1,829 million in 2010.
The improvement is primarily due to the higher earnings flow-through from Xstrata, supported by an increasing contribution from Mutanda.
Other expense net Net other expense for 2011 was $511million, compared to $8million in 2010.
The net amount in 2011 primarily comprised $344million of expenses related to Glencores listing, a $92million of mark-to-market loss in respect of various minority holdings in listed companies, $63million related to final costs associated with the settlement of the Prodeco option and $32million of asset impairments.
Interest income Interest income for the year ended 31December 2011 was $ 339million, a 21% increase over 2010.
Interest income includes interest earned on various loans extended, including to companies within the Russneft Group which primarily accounted for the overall increase compared to the prior year.
Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended 31December 2011 was $ 1,186 million, a 3% decline from $ 1,217 million in 2010, or flat, when taking into account $39million of capitalised borrowing costs written off in 2010.
Interest expense on floating rate debt decreased by $ 40 million to $ 511 million from $ 551 million excluding significant items over 2011.
Floating rate debt is predominantly used to fund fast turning and liquid working capital, the funding cost of which is taken into account in transactional pricing and terms and accordingly sought to be recovered in Adjusted EBIT of our marketing activities.
Interest expense on fixed rate funding was $ 675 million in 2011, an increase of $ 48 million over 2010.
The net increase is due to the Eurobond and Swiss Franc bond issuances in March 2010 and October 2010 January 2011.
Income taxes A net income tax credit of $ 264 million was recognised during the year ended 31December 2011 compared to an expense of $ 234 million for the year ended 31December 2010.
The 2011 credit resulted primarily from the recognition of substantial tax benefits that were crystallised following the reorganisation of the Glencore Group as part of the Listing.
It has been Glencores historical experience that its effective tax rate pre significant items on pre-tax income, excluding share of income from associates and jointly controlled entities and dividend income has been 10% as illustrated in the table below.
Following the Listing related Restructuring which crystallised significant available future tax benefits as noted above, it is expected that the future effective tax rate will increase relative to the past as going forward, old structure employee shareholder payments will no longer be available to offset marketing related taxable income.

| Annual Report 2011 | 41 SIgNIFICANT ITEMS Significant items are items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact and nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results to provide a better understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
In 2011, Glencore recognised $12 million of significant expenses which comprised a positive $ 25 million 2010: negative $ 790 million of mark to market adjustments associated with certain fixed price forward coal sales contracts relating to Prodecos future production that did not qualify for own use or cash flow hedge accounting, $92million of negative mark to mark adjustments on interests in other investments classified as held for trading and carried at fair value, with Glencores interest in Century Aluminum Company cash settled equity swaps, Volcan Compania Minera S. A.
A. and Nyrstar N. V. accounting for the majority of such movements, and $ 344 million of expenses related to the Listing of Glencore.
These expenses were largely offset by the recognition of $ 514 million of net tax credits relating primarily to certain income tax deductions that were crystallised, following the reorganisation of Glencore prior to Listing.
See notes 3 and 4 of the financial statements for additional details.
The net amount for 2010 included $ 225 million of Prodeco call option expenses, offset by $674million of impairment reversals following the rebound in market conditions and underlying valuation assumptions.
2010 also included a $ 462 million gain $ 315 million, net of non controlling interests related to the revaluation of the initial 40% interest in Vasilkovskoye Gold immediately prior to the acquisition of the remaining 60% interest in February 2010.
See note3 of the financial statements for additional details.
LIquIdITy ANd CAPITAL RESOuRCES CASH FLOw Cash generated by operating activities before working capital changes Net cash generated by operating activities before working capital changes in the year ended 31December 2011 was $ 4,101 million, a decrease of $ 133 million 3% compared to 2010 or up 5% pre significant items, taking into account $325million of relevant Listing Restructuring related expenses incurred during the year.
The pre significant items increase is consistent with the improved earnings.
Working capital changes Net working capital increased by $ 3,174 million during the year ended 31December 2011 compared to an increase of $ 2,998 million in 2010.
Much of the 2011 increase occurred in December 2011 alone $2.4billion, as Glencore was presented with highly attractive funded commodity sourcing opportunities.
Most of this working capital investment is temporary in nature and is expected to reverse during H12012.
Net cash used by investing activities Net cash used by investing activities was $ 3,690 million in 2011 compared to $ 4,755 million in 2010.
The net outflow in 2011 primarily related to the continued capital expenditure programs in respect of Vasilkovskoye Golds production ramp up, the various West African upstream oil development projects, the development of the Mutanda copper cobalt mine and production expansion at Katanga and Prodeco.
In addition, a few bolt on investments were progressed, including securing a 31.2% interest in Optimum Coal and 43.7% of Umcebo Coal as well as increasing various existing equity related holdings, including in Volcan, Century Aluminum and Minara Resources.
The 2010 net outflow included the $ 2,000 million base amount in relation to the exercise of the Prodeco call option.
Net cash generated by financing activities During 2011, in addition to regular bank and bond financing activities, Glencore refinanced the $ 2.8 billion $ 2.3 billion drawn bank loans secured by Xstrata shares with new 2 year $ 2.7 billion equivalent facilities and raised $ 7.6 billion net of issue costs via equity offerings on the London and Hong Kong stock exchanges.
42 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN ASSETS, LEVERAgE ANd wORKINg CAPITAL Total assets were $ 86,165 million as at 31December 2011 compared to $ 79,787 million as at 31December2010.
Over the same time period current assets increased from $ 44,296 million to $45,731 million.
The adjusted current ratio at 31 December2011 was 1.53 compared to 1.26 at 31December2010.
This improvement is attributable to the refinancing of the Xstrata secured bank loans and the resulting reclassification from current to non current borrowings, the repayment of various re-drawable short term facilities and the investment in working capital as noted above.
Non current assets increased from $ 35,491 million as at 31December2010 to $ 40,434 million as at 31December2011, primarily due to the capital expenditure programs noted above and the equity accounting pick-up of our share of Xstratas earnings.
Consistent with 31December2010, 99% $ 13,785 million of total marketing inventories were contractually sold or hedged readily marketable inventories at 31December2011.
These inventories are readily convertible into cash due to their liquid nature, widely available markets, and the fact that any associated price risk is covered either by a physical sale transaction or a hedge transaction on a commodity exchange or with a highly rated counterparty.
Given the highly liquid nature of these inventories, which represent a significant share of current assets, Glencore believes it is appropriate to consider them together with cash equivalents in analysing Group net debt levels and computing certain debt coverage ratios and credit trends.
Balance sheet liquidity is very healthy such that current capital employed plus liquid stakes in listed associates at book carrying value covers 143% of Glencores total gross debt as at 31December2011.

The ratio of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA improved from 2.38 times in 2010 to 2.00 times as at 31December 2011, while the ratio of FFO to Net debt improved from 22.6% in 2010 to 27.2% in 2011.
CAPITAL RESOuRCES ANd FINANCINg During the year ended 31December 2011, the following notable financing activities took place: In January, Glencore issued additional 5year, 3.625% CHF225 million $ 235 million bonds: In February and August, Glencore redeemed the $ 700 million 8% Perpetual bonds at par: In May, Glencore replaced the previous 364day $ 1,375 million and $ 515 million committed revolving credit facilities with two new 364 day committed revolving credit facilities for $ 2,925 million and $ 610 million respectively, both with a one year term extension option at Glencores discretion.
In addition, Glencore extended the final maturity of $ 8,340 million of the $ 8,370 million medium term revolver for a further year to May 2014.
In aggregate, the new facilities represent an overall increase in committed available liquidity of $ 1,645 million: In May, Glencore International plc was admitted to trading on the London and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges in what was the largest ever IPO of ordinary shares on the premium listing segment of the London Stock Exchange and the first simultaneous London primary and Hong Kong secondary IPO.
The offer represented 16.94% of Glencore International plcs post-IPO issued share capital and raised a net $ 7,291 million: and In June, Glencore refinanced the $ 2.8 billion $ 2.3 billion drawn facilities secured by Xstrata shares with new 2year $ 2.7 billion equivalent facilities.
44 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN Glencores main refinancing requirements over the next twelve months relate to a few secured borrowing base working capital facilities which ordinarily require extension renewal each year.
However, these tend to be routine given the underlying strong collateral and their modest amounts in the context of our overall balance sheet and funding liquidity levels.
As at 31December 2011, Glencore had available committed undrawn credit facilities and cash amounting to $ 6.8billion as a financial policy, Glencore has a $ 3 billion minimum threshold requirement.
Value at risk VaR One of the tools used by Glencore to monitor and limit its primary market risk exposure, namely commodity price risk related to its physical marketing activities, is the use of a VaR computation.
VaR is a risk measurement technique which estimates the potential loss that could occur on risk positions as a result of movements in risk factors over a specified time horizon, given a specific level of confidence.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability based approach that takes into account market volatilities, as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between commodities and markets.
In this way, risks can be measured consistently across all markets and commodities and risk measures can be aggregated to derive a single risk value.
Glencore has set a consolidated VaR limit 1 day 95% of $ 100 million representing less than 0.5% of Glencore shareholders funds.
Glencore uses a VaR approach based on Monte Carlo simulations and is computed at a 95% confidence level with a weighted data history using a combination of a one day and one week time horizon.
Average market risk VaR 1day 95% during the year ended 31December 2011 was $ 39 million 2010: $ 43 million, representing a modest 0.1% of shareholders equity.
Whilst it is Glencores policy to substantially hedge its commodity price risks, there remains the possibility that the hedging instruments chosen may not always provide effective mitigation of the underlying price risk.
The hedging instruments available to the marketing businesses may differ in specific characteristics to the risk exposure to be hedged, resulting in an ongoing and unavoidable basis risk exposure.
Residual basis risk exposures represent a key focus point for Glencores commodity department teams who actively engage in the management of such.
Credit ratings In light of our extensive funding activities, investment grade ratings are of utmost importance to us.
Following the Xstrata merger and Viterra acquisition announcements, Glencores current credit ratings are Baa2 review with direction uncertain from Moodys and BBB watch positive from S&P.
Dividend The Directors have proposed a 2011 final dividend of $0.10 per share, amounting to $692million.
The interim dividend of $0.05 per share, amounting to $346million, was paid on 30September 2011. Dividend dates 2012 Annual General Meeting 9May Ex-dividend date UK and Hong Kong 16May Last time for lodging transfers in Hong Kong 4:30 pm HK 17May Record date in Hong Kong Opening of business HK 18May Record date in UK Close of business UK 18May Deadline for return of currency election form Jersey shareholders 21May Applicable exchange rate date 25May Payment date 1June Shareholders on the Jersey register, may elect to receive the dividend in Sterling, Euro or Swiss Franc.
The Sterling, Euro or Swiss Franc amount will be determined by reference to the exchange rates applicable to the U. S. Dollar seven days prior to the dividend payment date.
Shareholders on the Hong Kong branch register will receive their dividends in Hong Kong Dollars.
Further details on dividend payments, together with currency election and dividend mandate forms, are available from Glencores website www.
com or from the Companys Registrars.
The Directors have proposed that the final dividend will be paid out of capital contribution reserves.
As such, the final dividend would be exempt from Swiss withholding tax.
As at 31December 2011, Glencore International plc had CHF14.4billion of such capital contribution reserves in its statutory accounts.
| Annual Report 2011 | 45 Notional allocation of debt and interest expense Glencores indebtedness is primarily arranged centrally, with the proceeds then applied to marketing and industrial activities as required.
Glencore does not allocate borrowings or interest to its three operating segments.
However, to assist investors in the assessment of overall performance and underlying value contributors of its integrated business model, Glencore notionally allocates its borrowings and interest expense between its marketing and industrial activities as follows: At a particular point in time, Glencore estimates the borrowings attributable to funding key working capital items within the marketing activities, including inventories, net cash margining and other accounts receivable payable, through the application of an appropriate loan to value ratio for each item.
The balance of Group borrowings is allocated to industrial activities including Glencores stake in Xstrata.
Once the average amount of borrowings notionally allocated to marketing activities for the relevant period has been estimated, the corresponding interest expense on those borrowings is estimated by applying the Groups average variable rate cost of funds during the relevant period to the average borrowing amount.
The balance of Group interest expense and all interest income is allocated to industrial activities.
The allocation is a company estimate only and is unaudited.
The table below summarises the notional allocation of borrowings and interest and corresponding implied earnings before tax of the marketing and industrial activities for the year ended 31December 2011.
Marketing Industrial US$million activities activities Total Adjusted EBIT 1911 3487 5398 Interest expense allocation 295 891 1186 Interest income allocation 339 339 Allocated profit before tax 1616 2935 4551 1 Allocated borrowings 31December 2011 14247 13821 28068 1 Allocated borrowings quarterly average 13161 14703 27864 Includes commodities sold with agreement to repurchase.
Based on the implied equity funding for the marketing activities working capital requirements, as well as the relatively modest level of non current assets employed in the marketing activities assumed to be equity funded, the return on notional equity for the marketing activities continued to be very healthy in 2011.
The industrial activities return on notional equity, although respectable, is being held back by mostly mid stage oil, copper, coal and gold development and expansion projects, where significant investments have been made to date, however the projects did not contribute to earnings in the year at anywhere near where their full production potential is expected to be.
46 | Annual Report 2011 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN SuBSEquENT EVENTS AFFECTINg OuR FINANCIAL POSITION On 7February 2012, Glencore announced its intention to acquire an additional 37.5% stake in Chemoil for cash consideration of $174million.
The transaction is expected to close in Q22012.
On 7February 2012, the Glencore Directors and the Independent Xstrata Directors announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended all-share merger the Merger of equals of Glencore and Xstrata to create a unique $90billion natural resources group.
The terms of the Merger provide Xstrata shareholders with 2.8 newly issued shares in Glencore for each Xstrata share held.
The Merger is to be effected by way of a Court sanctioned scheme of arrangement of Xstrata under Part26 of the UK Companies Act, pursuant to which Glencore will acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Xstrata not already owned by the Glencore Group.
The Merger is subject to shareholder, antitrust and regulatory approvals.
On 14March 2012, Glencore received the applicable regulatory approvals to complete the acquisition of an additional 28.5% interest in Optimum as originally agreed.
See note22 of the financial statements for more information.
On 20March 2012, Glencore signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Viterra for CAD16.25 per share in cash by way of a court approved plan of arrangement.
The transaction values Viterras equity at approximately CAD6.1 billion on a fully diluted basis.
At the same time, Glencore has entered into agreements with each of Agrium and Richardson International which provide for the sale of certain assets of Viterra including assets which comprise a majority of Viterras Canadian operations for a total cash consideration of CAD2.6billion, subject to specified purchase price adjustments, including payment for working capital.
Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of court, shareholder and regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse change.
The transaction is expected to close during third quarter of 2012.
