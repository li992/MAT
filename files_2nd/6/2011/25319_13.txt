The Group continues to be highly cash generative with cash generated from operations of 82.7 million while at the same time we grew our receivables book by 61.6 million.
The Group has a strong balance sheet and continues to be well funded.
Equity as a percentage of receivables increased by 4 percentage points to 58.5% and, despite this increased proportion of equity funding, the Groups return on capital employed ROCE increased by 0.5 percentage points to 22.7%.
