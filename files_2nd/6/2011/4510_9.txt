During 2010 11, special funding payments of 42.5m were made to the Groups pension fund, comprising the scheduled contribution of 7.5m and a one off special contribution of 35m following the sale of the Groups investment in Camelot.

IAS 19 Employee Benefits It is the responsibility of the Trustee to set the method and the assumptions for calculating the pension scheme liabilities under the scheme funding valuation.
The assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 valuation in the consolidated accounts are set by the Capital expenditure relative Group in compliance with the guidance given in IAS 19 and advice to depreciation from its actuary.
The discount rate used for calculating IAS 19 m 33.1 liabilities is the yield prevailing on AA rated corporate bonds.
Depreciation 30.7 29.3 Those used for ongoing triennial funding valuations are based Capital expenditure on actuarial advice taking into account the actual investment profile 24.4 of assets between bonds and equities over the longer term.
This 23.0 21.3 is the principal difference between the two sets of assumptions.
The valuation of the UK pension scheme under IAS 19 principles indicates a scheme deficit pre tax at 26 March 2011 of 100.5m March 2010: 124.8m.
This significant decrease in deficit during the year was due to the Groups special 35m and ongoing special contributions 7.5m along with the growth in the underlying stock market.
This has been partly offset by the 2009 2010 2011 reduction, from 5.8 per cent to 5.6 per cent, in the bond discount rate used to value the scheme liabilities.
The charge to operating profits in respect of the UK pension scheme for 2010 11 was Underlying effective tax rate 7.6m 2009 10: 4.5m.
In addition, under IAS 19 there was before exceptional items Percentage 29.9 a finance charge of 3.3m arising from the difference between 27.9 28.0 27.5 the expected return on assets and the interest on liabilities 27.0 2009 10: 6.3m.
The IAS 19 calculation is sensitive to small changes in the base assumptions used in the valuation.
An indication of the sensitivity is as follows: Change in Change in assumption liability Discount rate 0.1% -12m -0.1% 12m 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Inflation rate 0.1% 9m -0.1% -9m Group working capital advance payments m 70.1 62.9 54.6 44.0 39.6 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Group working capital trade working capital m 59.6 57.3 Trade working capital comprises inventory 51.2 plus trade receivables less trade payables and advance payments 27.7 11.2 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 fide La Rue Annual Report 2011 26
