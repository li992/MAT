Income statement Sercos income statement for the year is summarised in Figure 1 below.
This includes the results of joint ventures which are proportionately consolidated.

Organic revenue growth, excluding currency effects and acquisitions, was 3.5%, reflecting the growth of existing contracts and the contribution of new contracts started in 2010 and 2011.
 Following the significant acquisitions announced in the period, the calculations of Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted profit before tax and Adjusted EPS are now shown before acquisition-related costs as well as amortisation of acquired intangibles.
There is no impact on the comparative results.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 12.1% to 290.1m, representing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 6.2%.
Adjusted operating profit margin increased by 26 basis points 28 basis points excluding currency effects.
 Investment revenue and finance costs totalled a net cost of 27.9m 2010: 27.4m, an increase of 0.5m.
The increase excluding currency effects was 0.9m.
The principal reason for this increase was due to additional loans raised to finance acquisition activity, offset by greater interest receivable on retirement benefit obligations compared to the previous period.
 Adjusted profit before tax was 262.2m, an increase of 13.4%.
1.5 Acquisition-related costs These represent incremental costs arising from acquisition activity during the year.
3.1m of the costs incurred related to the acquisition of Intelenet.
1.7 Earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS rose by 14.1% to 39.59p.
EPS and Adjusted EPS are calculated on an average share base of 490.5m during the year 2010: 491.5m.
The decrease in the average share base resulted principally from the full weighting in 2011 of own shares purchased in 2010 to satisfy options granted under the Groups employee share option schemes.
2. Dividend Sercos policy is to increase the total dividend each year broadly in line with the increase in underlying earnings.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 5.90p per share, representing an increase on the 2010 final dividend of 14.6%, and bringing the total dividend for the year to 8.40p, a growth of 14.3%.
The final dividend will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 22 May 2012 to shareholders on the register as at 9 March 2012.

Cash flow The Group generated a free cash inflow of 168.3m 2010: 185.8m, with the reduction arising principally as a result of an increase in net capital expenditure.
Figure 2 analyses the cash flow.
As in previous years, we have designed the analysis to show the underlying cash performance of the Group the cash flows generated by subsidiaries plus the dividends received from joint ventures.
It therefore differs from the consolidated cash flow on page [112], which proportionately consolidates the cash flows of joint ventures.
The adjustment line in Figure 2 reconciles the movement in Group cash to the consolidated cash flow.
Figure2:Cashflow 2011 2010 Year ended 31 December m m Adjusted operating profit excluding joint ventures 208.5 194.1 Non cash items 64.2 61.8 Adjusted EBITDA excluding joint ventures 272.7 255.9 Working capital movement 32.3 30.6 Operating cash flow excluding joint ventures 240.4 225.3 Interest 32.7 25.2 Tax 32.2 24.0 Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets 71.5 41.8 Dividends from joint ventures 64.3 51.5 Group free cash flow 168.3 185.8 Acquisition of subsidiaries 325.3 2.3 Acquisition-related costs 3.7 Purchase of own shares and issue proceeds of share capital 6.7 14.7 Financing 236.0 173.4 Special pension contribution 40.0 20.0 Dividends paid 37.3 32.3 Group net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 8.7 56.9 Adjustment to include joint venture cash impacts 15.1 8.7 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents before exchange losses gains 23.8 48.2 Exchange loss gain 0.7 8.1 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 24.5 40.1 Note: Adjusted EBITDA excluding joint ventures is earnings from subsidiaries before interest, tax, depreciation, intangible amortisation and other non cash items.
Group free cash flow also excludes the cash impact of acquisition-related costs.
56 | Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011  Operating cash flow excluding joint ventures of 240.4m 2010: 225.3m reflects a conversion of Adjusted EBITDA into cash of 88% 2010: 88%.
The working capital movement of 32.3m 2010: 30.6m reflects the requirements of a growing business.
3.2 Interest Net interest paid increased to 32.7m 2010: 25.2m, principally reflecting higher Group recourse net debt following acquisitions in the period.
The increase in cash tax is principally as a result of higher overseas taxable profits arising in the period.
Cash tax remains below the equivalent charge in the income statement, principally as a result of the availability of accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences.
 Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets increased significantly to 71.5m 2010: 41.8m.
This resulted from the planned additional investment in SAP systems in 2011 and a return to a more normal underlying level of contract capital investment compared to last year.
This represents 1.9% of Group revenue excluding joint ventures 2010: 1.2%.
 Dividends received from joint ventures totalled 64.3m 2010: 51.5m, reflecting a higher than normal conversion rate of joint ventures profit after tax into dividends of 100%.
 This represents a 24.0m 2010: 23.0m purchase of own shares for the Employee Share Ownership Trust in order to satisfy options granted under the Groups share option schemes net of cash inflows of 17.3m 2010: 8.3m relating to proceeds from the issue of share capital and exercise of share options.
3.7 Financing The movement in financing is primarily due to acquisition funding.
 This 40.0m represents the second instalment of a special pension contribution into the Groups main defined benefit pension scheme which was agreed following the triennial actuarial valuation in 2009.
The first payment of 20.0m was made in December 2010.

Acquisitions On 14 March 2011, the Group acquired The Listening Company Limited, a leading UK provider of outsourced contact centre services.
The initial cash cost of the acquisition was 40.9m, comprising cash to the existing shareholders of 25.0m, plus the repayments of 15.9m of debt immediately after acquisition.
In addition, deferred consideration with a fair value of 12.5m is payable, contingent on the financial performance in the two-year period from 1 March 2011 to the end of February 2013.
The acquisition gave rise to goodwill of 39.4m.
Intangible assets arising on the acquisition have been recognised at 6.6m and will be amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected lives.
On 7 July 2011, the Group acquired 87% of the share capital of SKR BPO Services Private Limited and its subsidiary companies together Intelenet for an initial cash consideration of 249.3m.
A further 35.7m was paid on 19 October 2011 for the remaining 13% of share capital.
Net debt acquired was 51.1m, comprising 55.5m of acquired loans and 4.4m of acquired cash balances.
There are contingent deferred consideration cash payments of up to 49.8m through to December 2013.
The contingent cash payments are dependent principally on the delivery of revenue targets.
The fair value of this contingent deferred consideration is 23.7m.
Intangible assets arising on the acquisition have been recognised at 44.2m and will be amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected lives.
The acquisition gave rise to 289.2m of goodwill.
Intelenet is a leading provider of business process outsourcing BPO services to the private sector around the world and in the domestic Indian market.
It operates from 34 global delivery centres across seven countries, providing a broad range of middle and back office services and has a strong customer base of international organisations, predominantly across the financial services, travel, healthcare and telecom sectors.
During the year, the Group also made a number of smaller acquisitions.
Between March 2011 and December 2011, the Group acquired Braintree Clinical Services Limited, a UK-based company providing clinical and hospital services to Strategic Health Authorities: Philips Collection Services Limited, a UK-based company engaged in the provision of debt collection and fine management services: Excelior Pty Limited, an Australian registered company providing contact centre services: and JBI Properties Services Company LLC, a UAE-based company engaged in the provision of facilities management services.
The total consideration for these acquisitions amounted to 31.5m, of which 7.8m is deferred.
These acquisitions in aggregate gave rise to goodwill of 29.2m.
3.9m of acquisition-related costs incurred on the above acquisitions have been expensed to the income statement.
The cash flow impact of these acquisition-related costs included in the cash flow statement was 3.7m.

The increase was principally a result of acquisition activity.
Sources of funding are described in section 7 below.
Cash and cash equivalents includes encumbered cash of 5.5m 2010: 10.9m.
This is cash relating to customer advance payments.
 The Groups debt is non recourse if no Group company other than the relevant borrower has an obligation to repay the debt under a guarantee or other arrangement.
The debt is excluded from all of our credit agreements and other covenant calculations, and therefore has no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Group non recourse debt reduced by 8.2m to 15.5m, as a result of 7.9m payments made in line with the debt repayment schedule on debt relating to our Driver Examination Services contract in Canada and 0.3m decrease in non recourse debt due to exchange movements.
Pensions The Group is a sponsor of a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2011, the net retirement benefit asset included in the balance sheet arising from our defined benefit pension scheme obligations was 16.8m 2010: net liability 83.0m, on a pension scheme asset base of 1.7bn.

Within this charge, the Groups contributions to UK and other defined contribution pension schemes increased to 80.4m 2010: 76.0m.
The service charge relating to the Groups defined benefit schemes increased to 31.9m 2010: 30.5m, principally as a result of changes to the discount rate and inflation assumptions as at the end of 2010 and increases in payroll costs.
Serco has three main types of scheme which are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.
Each type has its own accounting treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards.
These are: Non contract specific schemes which do not relate to specific contracts or franchises.
For these schemes we charge the actuarial gain or loss for the year to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the SOCI : Reimbursable schemes where we have a right of full cost reimbursement and therefore include both the pension scheme deficit and offsetting reimbursable rights debtor in the balance sheet: and Not certain to be reimbursable schemes relating to specific contracts or franchises, where the deficit will pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss on our share of the deficit for the year to the SOCI, recognise a recoverable intangible asset on the balance sheet at the start of the contract or franchise and amortise the intangible asset to the income statement over the contract or franchise life.
Serco has limited commercial risk in relation to the contract specific schemes, due either to the right of cost reimbursement or because the deficit will, in general, pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
Among our non contract specific schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
At 31 December 2011, SPLAS had a surplus of 122.3m 2010: deficit of 16.4m.
This is calculated under IAS 19 using market-derived rates at 31 December 2011.
It therefore reflects the effect of the market conditions on investment returns in the year and the net impact of a decrease in inflation assumptions offset by a decrease in the applicable discount rate.
The estimated actuarial deficit of SPLAS as at 31 December 2011 was approximately 27.3m.
The value calculated in the latest triennial review was a deficit of 141m at 6 April 2009.
Following the 2009 review, the Group agreed with the Trustees to make a cash contribution of 60m to the scheme, of which 20m was paid in December 2010 and 40m in January 2011.
We continue to review the level of benefits and contributions under the scheme in the light of our business needs and changes to pension legislation.
Figure 5 shows the sensitivity of the liabilities of our pension schemes to changes in discount rates and to adjustments in the actuarial assumptions for the rate of inflation, members salary increases and life expectancies.

Treasury The Groups committed bank credit facilities total 726.7m 2010: 698.9m.
As at 31 December 2011, 241.3m had been drawn down on these combined bank facilities 2010: 329.8m.
The facilities comprised: a 400.0m syndicated revolving credit facility, maturing in September 2013: a syndicated amortising term loan of 75.0m repayable over three years to June 2014: a syndicated amortising term loan for US Dollar 258.4m 166.3m repayable in September 2012 and September 2013.
The next scheduled repayment of US Dollar 138.0m is due in September 2012: and bilateral credit facilities for 85.4m, of which 75.0m matures in September 2013 and Euro 12.5m 10.4m matures in April 2012.
In addition to the bank credit facilities, Serco has US private placements totalling 502.8m which will be repaid between 2012 and 2023.
This includes 408.6m of US private placement notes issued in 2011.
All of the Groups credit facilities detailed above are unsecured.
Going concern The Directors have acknowledged the guidance Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009, and An update for Directors of Listed Companies: Responding to increased country and currency risk in financial reports, published by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2009 and January 2012 respectively.
Whilst the current economic environment remains uncertain, the broad base of our contract portfolio and with over 90% of our customers being government bodies, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully as discussed in the section Principal Risks and Uncertainties and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Groups revenues are largely derived from long-term contracts with governments.
Historically, these contracts have been relatively resilient to changes in the general economy.
The contract portfolio is diverse and a downturn in any particular market, sector or geography has a more limited effect on the Group as a whole.
In addition, with an order book of 17.9bn and high visibility of future revenue streams 92% in 2012: 80% in 2013 and 70% in 2014, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks despite the current uncertain economic climate.
As at 31 December 2011, the Groups principal financing is through revolving credit facilities, term facilities and US private placements.
The Group has approximately 1,230m of committed credit facilities.
The headroom on the facilities was approximately 485m as at 31 December 2011.
Scheduled repayments in 2012 in respect of amortising term loans are for 25m in June against the 75m term loan and US Dollar 138m 89m in September against the US Dollar 258m term loan.
The Group fully expects to meet these repayments through operational cash flows.
Based on the information set out above, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
