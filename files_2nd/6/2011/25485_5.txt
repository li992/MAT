31 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Overview of the year 736 805 1 076 1 512 1 820 2 210 2 621 3 292 3 961 Financial review continued An overview of the operating environment impacting our business The UK economy started 2010 on a United Kingdom recovery footing, A brake to that recovery was applied in the final quarter of 2010 when severe snow impacted on UK GDP, such that the economy contracted by 0.5%.
Growth resumed in the first quarter of 2011, entering the registering 0.5%, overturning the previous quarters contraction.
There are a number of factors which 2010 11 financial are likely to weigh negatively on the UK 2011 growth outlook: the sizable scal consolidation, the impact year with recorded of above 4% in ation on consumer spending, and the impact of a possible increase in UK interest rates.
April 2011 marked the start of the more critical move in the governments scal tightening plans growth of 1% as the biggest discretionary consolidation of the five year programme came into effect, extracting just and 0.7% in the over 2% of GDP from the economy.
Regarding in ation, CPI in ation stood at 4.0% in March 2011, twice the 2% target.
With in ation forecast to remain between 4% and 5% over 2011, the Monetary second and third Policy Committee MPC is weighing up the right time to begin raising the UK Bank Rate.
may well begin tightening policy in Q4 this year.
Consumer con dence and recent retail sector data remain subdued, implying that the capacity of UK consumers and business to withstand rising interest rates is likely to be limited.
Consequently, it is likely that the economy will deliver ongoing, but gradual, expansion over 2011.
Eurozone Despite financial turbulence in several Euro area economies, the eurozone returned to growth in 2010, recording 1.7% growth, having contracted by 4.1% in 2009.
2010 closed with quarterly growth recorded at 0.3% in Q4.
The economy continued to expand in the first quarter of 2011, GDP showing an increase of 0.8%.
Despite the ongoing recovery of the eurozone as a whole, growth across countries has been very different, largely re ecting differences in the state of public and private sector balance sheets and the stance of macroeconomic policies.
At the top end, Germany expanded by 3.5% over 2010 whereas Greeces economy contracted by 4.5%.
These very different outlooks are likely to continue through the course of 2011.
The overall eurozone growth rate of 1.7% masks the tough year the eurozone has experienced.
Concerns about banking sector losses and scal sustainability led to widening sovereign spreads in the peripheral countries, in some cases reaching highs not seen since the launch of the Economic and Monetary Union.
During the last financial year, Greece, Ireland and, most recently Portugal, have requested financial assistance from the EU and IMF.
Despite the severe economic risks posed by the sovereign debt crises in peripheral countries, the spread of the crises from these countries has so far been relatively contained.
The containment of risks, market nerves and market losses has been aided by the creation of a package of stabilisation measures which included the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility, to support the joint EU IMF programme.
However, the downside risks to eurozone growth prospects from the continued peripheral debt crisis are ongoing, particularly given the remaining political hurdles that need to be overcome before an expansion to the existing support package can be signed off.
Throughout the last financial year the European Central Bank ECB held the re nancing rate at 1%, where it has been since June 2009, although the ECB increased the re nancing rate by 25 basis points to 1.25% in early April 2011.
The ECB has also provided enhanced credit support measures, including enhanced liquidity support.
The accommodative monetary policy stance looks to have assisted the overall eurozone growth rate over the last year.
Australia Australia escaped the global recession of recent years, recording only one quarter of contraction in 2008 and growing by 1.3% in 2009 and 2.7% in 2010.
On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 1.2%, 0.1% and 0.7% in the first three quarters of the 2010 11 financial year.
Flooding in key mining and agricultural regions resulted in the economy contracting by 1.2% in Q1 2011.
However, this is likely to be offset by stronger private investment in mining and commodity exports, beyond the end of the financial year.
Australian growth over the last year has continued to be based on emerging market demand for Australias commodity exports nearly 50% of Australias exports go to the economies 32 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Overview of the year of China, Japan and India, all which recorded rm growth in 2010.
Over 2010 as a whole Australian exports were up 5.3% on 2009 levels.
In Q2 2010 the CPI in ation rate reached 3.1%, just outside the Reserve Bank of Australias RBA 2-3% target range.
This led to the RBA tightening monetary policy, 2010 11 proved raising the headline cash rate from 4.25% in Spring 2010 to 4.75%, the current rate.
Despite the RBA tightening, domestic demand has held up rmly, having risen by 4.1% over 2010. to be a year of economic recovery United States for South Africa, Having contracted by 2.6% in 2009, the US economy bounced back to boast growth of 2.9% in with annual growth 2010.
Following the strong inventory restocking-driven growth in early 2010, economic growth of 2.8% compared slowed in the mid part of 2010 but strengthened again in the second half of the year, supported by rising consumer spending.
In Q4 2010, the economy expanded at a robust 3.1% annualised with the recession rate but this slowed to 1.8% in Q1 2011.
The unemployment rate has gradually fallen over the of the previous year, from 9.8% in April 2010 to 8.8% in March 2011, but at 8.8% the unemployment rate remains elevated.
Price pressures remained subdued over the course of the year, with headline in ation year.
having declined to a low of 1.1% during the year, from the 2.2% rate recorded in April 2010.
Throughout the financial year the Federal Reserve maintained the Federal Funds target interest rate at the 0-0.25% range, where it has been since the start of 2009.
Furthermore, the Federal Reserve embarked on QE2 in November 2010, announcing its intention to purchase a further $600 billion of longer term treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.
These added to existing purchases of mortgage-backed securities RMBS, agency debt and $300 billion of longer term treasuries.
This accommodative monetary policy stance has clearly been supportive for US growth over the year.
Unlike much of Western Europe, the US has not yet embarked on a programme of scal austerity measures, despite the scal fide cit now projected to reach 10% in 2011 and with general government gross debt expected to exceed 110% of GDP by 2016, according to the IMF.
South Africa 2010 11 proved to be a year of economic recovery for South Africa, with annual growth of 2.8% compared with the recession of the previous year.
Growth was led by consumption, both household and government, and the recovery was not hampered by higher taxes, reduced government spending or any of the other austerity measures being applied in many advanced economies.
Indeed, the private sector is becoming nancially healthier: spending on the back of rising real incomes, not excessive credit growth, and an ever growing middle class.
However, the xed investment sector remained in recession as corporates failed to take advantage of rand strength to import capital goods, preferring to wait until the recovery strengthened and proved sustainable.
In addition, and despite the health of government nances, public investment in infrastructure stagnated, after contracting sharply in 2009.
Job losses continued and corporate demand for credit fell on average, but rising disposable incomes and governments strong spend on social services saw living standards rise, as debt levels eased.
This trend in living standards is likely to continue, compensating in part for the small size of the population, in turn supporting growth.
South Africa also saw some considerable achievements in 2010, from being ranked sixth in the world for both soundness and sophistication of its financial markets in the most recent global competitiveness survey, to second on the ef cacy of corporate boards and first on both auditing and reporting standards, and the regulation of its securities exchange.
Due also to the Reserve Banks high level of financial market supervision and the protection provided by the few exchange controls still in place, South Africas financial system did not experience the same issues as the global financial community it never had a banking crisis and government borrowing was accordingly unaffected.
Consequently, South Africas scal fide cit shrunk, from 6.7% of GDP in 2009 10 to 5.0% in 2010 11, as the economy moved from a recession into a recovery phase.
South Africas low level of sovereign debt close to 30% of GDP last year means it can comfortably afford to increase borrowings to fund capital investment both xed and human while many advanced economies have cut back on building productive capacity.
As a result, South Africa is in a financial sense well structured for growth.

Our strategic goals and objectives are motivated by the desire to develop an ef cient and integrated business on an international scale through the active pursuit of clearly established core competencies in our principal business areas.
Our core philosophy has been to build well-fide ned, value-added businesses focused on serving the needs of select market niches where we can compete effectively.
We seek to maintain an appropriate balance between revenue earned from operational risk businesses and revenue earned from financial risk businesses.
This ensures that we are not over reliant on any one part of our business to sustain our activities and that we have a large recurring revenue base that enables us to navigate through varying cycles and to support our long-term growth objectives.
Our current strategic objectives include increasing the proportion of our non-lending revenue base which we largely intend to achieve through the continued strengthening and development of our wealth and asset management businesses.
