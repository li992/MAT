GKN DRIvElINE SalES By PRODuCT GROuP GKN Drivelines sales increased 15% to 2,795 million 2010: 2,433 million.
The favourable impact of currency translation was 20 million, the acquisition of Getrag Driveline Products on 30 September 2011 added 117 million, which was partly offset by 27 million lower sales resulting from the sale of GKN Drivelines 49% share of the Japanese driveshaft sales and distribution joint venture GKN JTEKT Ltd GTK in March 2011.
Underlying sales increased by 252 million 10%, including Constant Velocity Jointed CVJ Systems which grew 7% and non-CVJ sales which increased by 22%, compared with global vehicle production which increased 3%.
This market outperformance was broad based across North America, Europe, China and Japan, reflecting recent market share gains, the Groups stronger position in premium vehicles, demand for which continued to be strong, and GKN Drivelines broadening product mix, particularly with AWD systems and trans-axle solutions.
In Japan, the market outperformance reflected GKN Drivelines exposure to companies less affected by the earthquake and the priority given to reinstating production capability for exported vehicles.
In North America, lower production from Japanese companies experiencing component shortages was more than offset by GKN Drivelines market share gains through a broader product offering, new programme wins and stronger sales to domestic producers.
Trading profit increased to 195 million 2010: 169 million.
The impact of translational currency was 1 million positive, and acquisitions after costs and inventory fair value adjustment of 3 million added 4 million with underlying trading profit up by 21 million, including around 15 million negative impact from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, compounded by the floods in Thailand.
These affected production in Japan and overseas as component supply chains were disrupted.
Outside Japan, it was most pronounced for GKN Driveline in North America where many of the Japanese car manufacturers cut production rates significantly in the second quarter.
Engineering costs increased to support new programmes and future growth, and some temporary costs were incurred to raise capacity in some regions to keep pace with significant increases in demand.
GKN Drivelines trading margin was 7.1% 2010: 6.9% excluding Getrag Driveline Products.
GKN Drivelines mediumterm target margin range remains at 8-10%.
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets was 113 million 2010: 73 million, 1.0 times 2010: 0.7 times depreciation.
Return on average invested capital, excluding the Getrag Driveline Products acquisition, was 17.0% 2010: 16.0%, reflecting the increase in profitability.
During the year, GKN Driveline opened a new CVJ systems plant in Changchun, northern China, a precision forge at Oragadam, near Chennai, southern India, expanded production at WuHan, China and construction began on a new CVJ systems facility in Pune, India.

2E GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overall, GKN Driveline won 500 million annualised new and replacement business with the CVJ Systems business winning a healthy 65% of the contracts for which it bid.
GKN Driveline AWD Systems launched a power transfer unit PTU in China, saw good growth in propshaft production in Europe and benefited from strong sales in North America, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
It also won significant new business with unique all-wheel drive disconnect technology with vehicle manufacturers in the US, Europe and China.
In June, GKN Driveline invested 4 million in EVO Electric Ltd, a UK pioneer in axial flux motors, and formed a joint venture, GKN EVO eDrive Systems Limited, to manufacture and sell axial flux electric motors and drive systems for use in hybrid and all-electric vehicles.
GKN Driveline is already a pioneer in the development and supply of eTransmissions and eAxles for hybrid and electric vehicles.
This venture will enable GKN Driveline to offer advanced axial flux motors and generators for niche applications, adding to its existing eDrive systems portfolio and enhancing its capability in full driveline systems.
Recent new business wins in eDrive include: n major launch of eAxle for PSA Hybrid 4: n new European customer for 1-speed eTransmissions and demonstration vehicle contract for an Asian vehicle manufacturer: and n development orders for 2-speed transmissions from European and North American vehicle manufacturers.
On 30 September 2011, GKN Driveline completed the acquisition of Getrag Driveline Products, a tier one supplier of geared driveline products, namely power transfer units and rear drive units for AWD vehicles, along with final drive units for high-performance rear wheel drive vehicles.
Getrag Driveline Products, with operations in the United States and Europe, has been integrated into GKN Driveline.
Getrag Driveline Products has a product, manufacturing and customer footprint that is complementary to GKN Drivelines own geared product business, which is predominantly based in Asia.
Combined, the businesses are now the leading global supplier of AWD driveline products with an excellent customer base and product portfolio.
AWD and trans-axle solutions now represent 28% of GKN Driveline sales with significant further growth opportunities.
As part of the Getrag transaction, GKN Driveline also acquired an exclusive licence, principally for Europe and the Americas, to Getrags electric drivetrain technology for use in electric and certain hybrid vehicles, making GKN a leading player in eDrive solutions and very well placed for growth in the medium and long term.

2G GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 GKN aerospace GKN aEROSPaCE SalES By PRODuCT GKN Aerospace is a world leading global first tier supplier of airframe and engine structures, components, assemblies and transparencies to a wide range of aircraft and engine prime contractors and other first tier suppliers.
It operates in three main product areas: aerostructures, engine components sub-systems and special products.
The overall aerospace market remained positive in 2011, driven by a recovering civil aircraft market and a generally stable defence sector.
The division has increased its position in civil aerospace to 58% of sales, with defence representing 42%.
2011 saw the introduction into service of the Boeing 787, on which GKN Aerospace has sales of approximately $2.6 million per aircraft, and the announcement of the 737 MAX and A320neo single aisle aircraft upgrades.
Airbus is ramping up production of the A380 GKN sales of $8.0 million per aircraft, but announced that the first flight of the A350 would slip to 2013 GKN sales of $2.5 million per aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing estimate that between GKN aEROSPaCE SalES By MaRKET 28,000 and 32,000 new single aisle and wide bodied aircraft will be delivered by 2030.
Worldwide defence spending remains under pressure, largely driven by cutbacks throughout Europe and likely reductions in the US defence budget.
It is expected that the US 2013 !% defence budget submittal will be in line with 2012 spending levels.
GKNs position on key Military multi-year programmes such as the UH-60 Blackhawk Helicopter, F A-18 Super Hornet, F-15 Eagle and C-130J Super Hercules provide a strong production base for the business % Civil despite projected defence budget pressures.

Expenditure on intangible assets, mainly initial non-recurring programme costs, was 35 million 2010: 26 million.
57 million of the capital expenditure and non-recurring programme costs, including 6 million of capitalised borrowing costs, relate to the A350 wing assembly and trailing edge programme.
A total of 128 million had been invested on this programme by 31 December 2011, excluding 11 million of capitalised borrowing costs.
Spending, which has now reached its peak, is likely to reduce to around 33 million in 2012.
Customer advances in the GKN Aerospace businesses, which are shown in trade and other payables in the balance sheet, amounted to 63 million 2010: 70 million.
Return on average invested capital was 22.7% 2010: 23.3% reflecting the increased investment in new programmes, particularly the A350.
Important milestones include: n GKN Aerospace, with industry partners Airbus, AgustaWestland, Rolls-Royce, Umeco and Vestas celebrated the opening of the UK National Composites Centre near Filton, UK.
GKN Aerospace has been driving forward the use of composites in aviation and is expanding the application of new automated manufacturing techniques that will enable faster and more consistent manufacture of complex composite structures.
These techniques will be critical if the industry is to meet rising demand for new aircraft and for aircraft that offer improved performance, lower emissions and reduced maintenance.
n GKN Aerospace signed a memorandum of understanding with Commercial Aerospace of China COMAC to form a joint venture for composite structures manufacture of the horizontal tailplane for the C919 aircraft, positioning GKN Aerospace in the infancy of the civil aircraft industry in China.
n In November, it was announced that a new 14,000 square metre aerospace facility in Orangeburg, South Carolina, USA would be opened in 2012.

In total, 34 million of incremental shipping, purchasing and plant closure and remedial works costs were recorded.
15 million has subsequently been recovered from external insurance claims.
Further details are given in note 2 to the financial statements.
corporate costs Corporate costs, which comprise the costs of stewardship of the Group and operating charges and credits associated with the Groups legacy businesses, were 16 million 2010: 14 million.
Other financial information Restructuring and impairment charges There were no Group restructuring and impairment charges during the year 2010: 39 million.
Change in value of derivative and other financial instruments The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge much of its transactional exposure.
At 31 December 2011, the net fair value of such instruments was a liability of 84 million 2010: 54 million liability.
Where hedge accounting has not been applied, the change in fair value resulted in a charge of 29 million 2010: 3 million charge.
There was a 3 million charge arising from the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives in the year 2010: 3 million credit and a net gain of 2 million attributable to the currency impact on Group funding balances 2010: 12 million net gain.
There was a 1 million loss on the change in the fair value of GKN Powder Metallurgy commodity contracts 2010: nil.
amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations The charge for the amortisation of non-operating intangible assets for example, customer contracts, order backlogs and intellectual property rights arising on business combinations was 22 million 2010: 19 million.
The increase relates to the impact of the acquisitions of Getrag Driveline Products and Stromag.
Gains and losses on changes in Group structure During the year the Group sold its 49% share in a joint venture company, GKN JTEKT Limited realising a profit of 4 million and its Aerospace Engineering Services business realising a further profit of 4 million.
In 2010, the loss of 4 million principally related to the sale and closure of the Axles business.
Post-tax earnings of joint ventures In management figures, the sales and trading profits of joint ventures are included pro-rata in the individual divisions to which they relate, although shown separately post-tax in the accounts.
The Groups share of post-tax earnings of joint ventures in the year was 38 million 2010: 35 million.
Post-tax earnings on a management basis were 40 million 2010: 36 million, with trading profit of 49 million 2010: 44 million.
The Groups share of the tax charge amounted to 8 million 2010: 7 million with an interest charge of 1 million 2010: 1 million.
Underlying trading profit increased 7 million due to strong performance in our Chinese joint ventures, which increased by 6 million, and improvements in Emitec, which increased by 2 million.
Net financing costs Net financing costs totalled 61 million 2010: 75 million and include the non-cash charge on post-employment benefits of 17 million 2010: 31 million and unwind of discounts of 2 million 2010: 4 million.
Interest payable was 47 million 2010: 46 million, whilst interest receivable was 5 million 2010: 6 million resulting in net interest payable of 42 million 2010: 40 million.
Capitalised interest costs attributable to the Groups A350 investment were 6 million 2010: 4 million and interest charged on UK Government refundable advances was 2 million 2010: 2 million.
The non-cash charge on post-employment benefits arises as the expected return on scheme assets of 153 million 2010: 145 million was more than offset by interest on post-employment obligations of 170 million 2010: 176 million.
Details of the assumptions used in calculating post-employment costs and income are provided in note 14 to the financial statements.. 33 GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 MaNaGEMENT PROFIT BEFORE Tax Profit before tax OF CONTINuING OPERaTIONS The management profit before tax was 417 million 2010: 363 million, including the net m 19 million impact from the temporary closure of the Hoeganaes Gallatin plant, described on page 32.
The profit before tax on a statutory basis was 351 million 2010: 345 million.
Taxation The book tax rate on management profits of subsidiaries was 16% 2010: 11%, arising as a 60 million tax charge on management profits of subsidiaries of 377 million.
The Groups theoretical weighted average tax rate, which assumes that book profits losses are taxed at the statutory tax rates in the countries in which they arise, is 31% 2010: 32%.
The book tax rate is significantly lower, largely because of the recognition of substantial deferred tax assets mainly in the US, UK and Japan due to increased confidence in the Groups ability both to access and realise future taxable profits that absorb brought forward tax deductions, partially offset by an increase in the Groups provision for uncertain tax positions.
One of GKNs core strategic tax objectives is to access brought forward tax deductions in order to sustain a cash tax charge on management profits at or below 20%.
Cash tax provides a proxy for the cash cost of taxation of management profits.
In the near term, the cash tax rate is expected to continue at or below 20% due to further utilisation of brought forward tax deductions.
MaNaGEMENT EaRNINGS PER SHaRE The tax rate on statutory profits of subsidiaries was 14% 2010: 6% arising as a 45 million tax pence charge on statutory profits of 313 million.
Non-controlling interests The profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 27 million 2010: 20 million including a 21 million 2010: 15 million impact from the pension partnership arrangement see note 14 for further details.
Earnings per share Management earnings per share was 22.6 pence 2010: 20.7 pence.
On a statutory basis, earnings per share was 18.0 pence 2010: 19.6 pence.
Average shares outstanding in 2011 were 1,553.1 million see note 3 for further details.
Dividend In view of the improving trading performance and taking into account the Groups future prospects, the Board has decided to recommend a final dividend of 4.0 pence per share 2010: 3.5 pence.
The total dividend for the year will, therefore, be 6.0 pence 2010: 5.0 pence, representing a management earnings cover ratio of 3.8 times 2010: 4.1 times.
The intention is to have a progressive dividend policy based on a management earnings cover ratio of around 2.5 times.
The final dividend is payable on 21 May 2012 to shareholders on the register at 27 April 2012.
Shareholders may choose to use the Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP to reinvest the final dividend.

34 Review of performance Continued 2010: 55 million of expenditure on the Groups restructuring programmes and 19 million in relation to the temporary plant closure at Gallatin.

Pensions and post-employment obligations GKN operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes together with historic retiree medical arrangements across the Group.

Other net financing charges of 17 million 2010: 31 million have reduced partly due to the full year impact of the pension partnership arrangement and partly as a result of lower interest on liabilities due to the 30 basis point reduction in the discount rate between 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.

Financing The following section describes the way in which the Group manages and controls its treasury function and ensures it is financed in an appropriate and cost-effective manner.
Treasury management All treasury activities are co-ordinated through a central function Group Treasury, the purpose of which is to manage the financial risks of the Group and to secure short and long-term funding at the minimum cost to the Group.
It operates within a framework of clearly defined Board-approved policies and procedures, including permissible funding and hedging instruments, exposure limits and a system of authorities for the approval and execution of transactions.
It operates on a cost centre basis and is not permitted to make use of financial instruments or other derivatives other than to hedge identified exposures of the Group.
Speculative use of such instruments or derivatives is not permitted.
Group Treasury prepares reports at least annually to the Board, and on a monthly basis to the Finance Director and other senior executives of the Group.
In addition, liquidity, interest rate, currency and other financial risk exposures are monitored weekly.
The overall indebtedness of the Group is reported on a weekly basis to the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
The Group Treasury function is subject to an annual internal and external review of controls.
Funding and liquidity At 31 December 2011, UK committed bank facilities were 755 million.
Within this, there are committed revolving credit facilities of 675 million that include 445 million of new five year facilities put in place in the second half of the year.
The balance of UK committed facilities of 80 million is an eight-year amortising facility from the European Investment Bank EIB.
At 31 December 2011, drawings against the revolving credit facilities were 33 million and the Group drew down in full its 80 million facility from the EIB.
The EIB loan is repayable in five 16 million instalments from 2015 and bears a fixed interest rate of 4.1%.
Capital market borrowings were 526 million at 31 December 2011 and include unsecured issues of 176 million 7% bonds maturing in May 2012 and 350 million 6.75% bonds maturing in October 2019.
The weighted average maturity profile of the Groups committed borrowing facilities was 4.7 years.
This leaves the Group well placed in the short term to manage sudden changes in liquidity in the financial markets.
All of the Groups committed credit facilities have a financial covenant requiring EBITDA of subsidiaries to be at least 3.5 times net financing costs.
In addition, the new five-year revolving credit facilities put in place in 2011 contains a financial covenant requiring net debt to be no greater than 3 times EBITDA of subsidiaries.
The covenants are tested every six months using the previous 12 months results.
For the 12 months to 31 December 2011 EBITDA was 12.9 times greater than net interest, whilst net debt was 0.9 times EBITDA.
Financial resources and going concern At 31 December 2011, the Group had net borrowings of 538 million.
In addition, it had available, but undrawn, committed UK borrowing facilities totalling 642 million.
The next maturities of the Groups committed UK borrowing facilities are 176 million unsecured bond in May 2012 and 160 million revolving bank credit facilities in July 2013.
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements of the Group and the Company and compared them to the level of committed available borrowing facilities.
The assessment included a review of both divisional and Group financial forecasts, financial instruments and hedging arrangements for the 19 months from the balance sheet date.
Major assumptions have been compared to external reference points such as global light vehicle volumes, build schedules from aircraft assemblers and market forecasts from major manufacturers of agricultural and construction machinery.
The forecasts show that the Group will have a sufficient level of headroom in the foreseeable future and an assessment of the likelihood of breaching covenants in this period is considered to be remote.
Having undertaken this work, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate committed resources to fund its operations for the foreseeable future and so determine that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.
