The new 257.5 million bank facility expires in May 2016 and replaces our existing 295 million bank facility originally expiring in August 2013.
The level of operational flexibility under the new facility is similar to the existing facility and the blended cost of debt for the Group remains the same.
The Group has significant headroom on both the banking and securitisation covenants.

Net debt of 1,100.8 million at 1 October 2011 is an increase of 18.6 million compared to 1,082.2 million at 2 October 2010.
