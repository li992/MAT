The UK government implemented, with effect from 1 January 2011, the use of the Consumer Price Index CPI instead of the Retail Prices Index RPI for the purpose of determining statutory minimum pension increases for private sector pension schemes.
During the year, the deferred members of the UK Plan were advised of the change from the use of RPI to value their benefit to the use of CPI, with effect from 1 January 2011.
At the same time, deferred members were advised that the Company was to offer them the opportunity to transfer their benefits out of the UK Plan to another arrangement of their choice at an enhanced value, calculated to reflect the retention of RPI to value any deferred benefits so transferred.
The offer of enhanced transfer values closes during the first half of 2012.
This exercise eliminates the longevity and investment risk for Cookson in respect of the 37m of liabilities transferred out of the UK Plan.
