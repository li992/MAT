The Group operates one UK defined benefit scheme which had 284 active members and 909 deferred, pensionable deferred or pensionable members at 31 December 2011.
At 31 December 2011 the scheme had a deficit of $45.8m 2010: $33.3m before recognition of a deferred tax asset of $11.5m 2010: $9.0m.
In assessing the potential liabilities, judgement is required to determine the assumptions around future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity.
The increase from 2010 was due in part to lower than expected returns on scheme assets and partly to a reduction in the discount rate used which is based on corporate bond yields.
During the year a one-off contribution of 5.0m $8.0m was made to the scheme.
The scheme is closed to new members and future benefits under the scheme are provided on a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE basis.
