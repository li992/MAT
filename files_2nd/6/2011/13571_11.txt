The Groups joint venture with Daimler now owns over 99 per cent of Tognum for which Rolls-Royce paid cash consideration of 1.5 billion in 2011.
This joint venture investment made a 30 million net contribution after costs and financing to underlying profit before tax but did not impact the Groups 2011 revenues.
On January 2, 2012, the Group contributed its Bergen Diesels business to the joint venture, resulting in a cash benefit to the Group of 200 million.
The Groups proposed sale of its 32.5 per cent shareholding in IAE is subject to regulatory approval and did not impact 2011 financial performance.
Rolls-Royce will continue to play an active role as a first tier supplier to IAE of high-pressure compressors and fan blades and remains responsible for the final assembly of 50 per cent of the production engines.
The announced new joint venture with Pratt & Whitney to develop an engine to power the next generation of mid-size aircraft is also subject to regulatory approval and had no effect on 2011 financial performance.
