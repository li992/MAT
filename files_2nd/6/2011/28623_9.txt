Taxation The tax charge for 2011 was 10.4 million 2010: 8.5 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 26.7% of profit before income tax 2010: 28.4%.
The effective tax rate has fallen since 2010 primarily due to a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate for the current year and an over-provision for tax in the prior year compared to final tax computations.
These effects have been offset in part by the fall in value of deferred tax assets due to lower future years corporation tax rates in the UK.
The effective tax rate is slightly higher than the derived UK standard rate of corporation tax of 26.5% as the impact of disallowable expenses has been largely offset by the impact of over-provision in 2010.
