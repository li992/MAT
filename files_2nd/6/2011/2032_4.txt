Breakdown of Group Adjusted EBITDA Dividend 80.2m The Directors have chosen to adopt a progressive dividend policy while 6.5m 79.7m maintaining an appropriate level of dividend cover.
The dividend policy 7.0m re ects the strong cash ow characteristics and long-term earnings potential of the Betfair Group and allows us to retain suf cient capital to fund ongoing operating requirements and continue investment for long term growth.
It is therefore the Boards intention to target an initial payout ratio of approximately 20% of underlying pro t after tax after adding back losses in the Other Investments segment.
The Directors intend that the Company will pay an interim dividend and a final dividend in respect of each financial year in the approximate proportions of one-third and two-thirds of the total annual dividend respectively.
Core Other High roller Group Investments The Board recommends the payment of a final dividend of 5.9 pence per share, as the Company was only listed halfway through the financial year.
If the Company had been listed for the full financial year the total dividend for the year would have been 8.9 pence per share.
