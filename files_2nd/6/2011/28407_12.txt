52 DIRECTORS REPORT: BuSInESS REvIEw anD managEmEnT REPORT: fInanCIal REvIEw Financial review The groups strategy is to invest in businesses that generate a high return on capital in order to provide high returns to shareholders.
To support the delivery of this strategy, the group operates a strict financial model that aligns the groups dividend policy, gearing and growth plans.
The financial model is fully calibrated to ensure that the group maintains a robust capital structure providing a comfortable level of headroom against the groups banking covenants, including the gearing covenant of 5.0 times, and the regulatory capital requirements set by the FSA.
The strong capital generation of the businesses in which the group invests, supports the distribution of 80% of its post-tax earnings by way of dividend whilst retaining sufficient capital to support receivables growth consistent with managements medium-term growth plans for the group and a gearing ratio of 3.5 times.
The execution of the financial model, is underpinned by the groups consistent Andrew Fisher, application of prudent and appropriate accounting policies.
