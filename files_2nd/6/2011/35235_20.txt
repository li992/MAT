Performance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2011 Finance review Derwent Londons net asset value increased by 15.4% to 1,701p per share on an EPRA basis and the total portfolio grew to over 2.6bn as at December 2011, helping to further reduce our already modest gearing ratios.
We have also focused on refinancing a significant part of the Groups debt.
Since the beginning of 2011, we have signed 600m of new or extended facilities, which includes the issue in June of a 175m 2.75% convertible bond.
Damian Wisniewski Finance Director Looking back on 2011, the first half of the year showed a continuation of the relatively strong recovery in sentiment that characterised 2010 but, from mid-year onwards, the UKs economic recovery slowed and stresses within the Eurozone came prominently to the surface.
Certain European governments found that the cost of refinancing their sovereign debt was set to rise dramatically.
The interdependence of banks upon banks, and banks upon sovereign support, caused market concern and political solutions were not rapid enough to curtail a substantial loss of confidence.
The UK emerged as something of a safe haven, pushing gilt yields to almost record lows.
However, confidence 47% in the UKs domestic economy weakened in the second half, UK national debt levels also remain high and domestic consumer increase in net asset value demand is under sustained pressure.
since December 2009 We therefore remain some way from normal market conditions.
As a consequence, our financial initiatives in 2011 focused on preemptive mitigation of refinancing exposures, while also managing operational risk such as letting voids.
At the same time, we have worked to unlock valuable development opportunities for the future.

These are discussed in the Disposals section of the Property Review and amounted to 137.5m.
Group income statement The last year was characterised by a record level of new lettings and reviews for the Group which helped gross property income to grow by 5.1% to 125.5m from 119.4m for the year ended 31 December 2010.
After taking account of lease breaks and expiries, new lettings increased gross income by 3.3m compared to 2010.
Properties acquired in 2010 and 2011 added 7.2m of rental income when compared with the 2010 calendar year, partly due to the full years contribution from Central Cross, while 5.1% disposals only reduced rent by 1.6m.
However, as we progressed schemes at Riverwalk House, Hampstead Road, 88 Rosebery Avenue and 4 & 10 Pentonville Road, the income generated from increase in gross property those properties fell by 4.4m when compared with the prior year.

Premiums received from tenants terminating leases early totalled 1.4m after netting off the related accrued income from unamortised lease incentives.
The largest premium received came from a tenant who paid 1.5m to vacate the Johnson Building in December 2011: the resulting write-off of unamortised rent accrued through the rent-free period totalled 0.9m.
This lease surrender was supported by a back-to-back letting to Lastminute.

In addition, surrender premiums of 1.9m were paid in 2011 of which the largest was a 1.3m payment to secure vacant possession at 210 Old Street.
As a result, net property income increased by 4.2% to 117.7m, a slightly lower percentage than the increase in gross rents.
Net rental income took account of a further recovery of 1.6m of commercial rates rebates from prior years, marginally lower than the 1.7m rates credit in 2010.
36.1m Excluding the impact of acquisitions, disposals and properties under development, like-for-like net property income on an EPRA profit from disposals of investment basis rose by 3.7% from 2010 and an analysis is shown in the table above.
properties Administrative expenses increased to 22.7m from 20.9m in 2010 due mainly to increased staff and office costs.
As in the previous year, we have both increased and strengthened the management team and we believe this was a contributory factor to the valuable planning consents won during the year.
The Groups consistently strong performance over recent years has also contributed to an increase in the provision for long-term management incentives of 0.7m compared to 2010.

In addition, the impact of higher margins and fees charged on refinancing before 2012 and on bank facilities renewed since November 2010 and the lower level of floating rate debt combined to increase net finance costs from 2010.
Net finance costs, after capitalising 2.2m of interest in 2011, increased to 43.2m from 37.9m in 2010.
The 175m of unsecured convertible bonds issued in June 2011 pay a cash coupon of 2.75% pa but, in accordance with IFRS accounting rules, we have recognised the hybrid nature of this instrument 600m by booking an additional non-cash interest charge of 1.24% pa which added 1.0m to the 2011 finance cost.
In future years, the of facilities were refinanced during additional charge will be 1.9m pa.
In addition, the equity element of the convertible bond instrument of 9.4m, after costs, was the year recognised in reserves at the point of issue.
The resulting EPRA recurring profit before tax was 52.3m for the year ended 31 December 2011 compared with 55.2m in 2010.
Tax recoveries from historical positions in the UK and USA meant that EPRA earnings per share fell by less than 3% to 51.59p from 52.89p in 2010. Financing, net debt and cash flow As the Group entered 2011 it faced 32.5m of bank facilities The overall profit before taxation for the year was 233.0m expiring in 2012 and a further 575m due to expire in 2013.

A further contribution came from profits on disposals of investment properties in 2011 of 36.1m offset partially by the 26.5m markWe had also previously flagged that we would look to seek out to-market deficit on interest rate swaps referred to below.
The gain non-bank sources of debt and, after considering a number of other on disposals of investment properties came from the sales of low options, we decided to launch a 175m unsecured convertible yielding properties at Covent Garden and 78-79 Pentonville Road bond in May 2011, the first of its type by a UK REIT.
This was well in the first half of the year and Victory House, 18-30 Leonard Street received and was several times over-subscribed.

In aggregate, these sales a 2.75% pa coupon with an initial exercise price of 22.22, some achieved 38% above December 2010 book values, after costs.

This a relatively modest risk of dilution given the high conversion price recent decline in rates has been quite exceptional, with the 10-year relative to net asset value.
In documenting the issue, we were gilt hovering around 2.0% at the 2011 year end, illustrating a distinct able to include an allowance of up to 350m for other capital cooling of UK growth and interest rate expectations.
The resulting markets issues such as private placements and bonds, together mark-to-market deficit of 26.5m for 2011 compares with a 2.4m with unlimited access to bank and insurance company debt.
Interest rates have so far remained low into 2012.
We considered that this combination was unlikely to fetter our borrowing strategy over the five-year term of the bonds.
Taxation The 2011 tax credit relating to the non-REIT part of the business We have also taken action to renew and or extend and refinance was 1.3m.
This comprised a tax charge of 0.5m for the unelected bank facilities during the year.
In June 2011, the 100m bilateral share in our joint venture with the Portman Estate and a prior year revolving facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland was extended to tax credit of 1.8m.
The latter item benefited from the resolution of a renewal date of April 2015: the margin increased to 120bp and a long-running US tax matter resulting in a cash receipt of 0.4m.
In steps up again in April 2012 to 175bp for loan to value LTV ratios addition, we were able to release provisions against UK tax enquiries up to 65% and 200bp in the less likely event that we draw above amounting to 1.4m.
The deferred tax provision in 2011 fell slightly to 65% LTV.
5.2m as the effect of the higher revaluation surplus was more than offset by previously unrecognised tax losses and the reduced UK corporation tax rate which falls to 25% on 1 April 2012.

This 25m increase was executed in December 2011 on the same terms as the original facility which was arranged in November 2010.
Both of these transactions are indicative of the strong nature of our valued banking relationships and illustrate the increasingly binary nature of the bank loan environment.
For a small number of chosen borrowers, funds are available on terms that remain reasonably attractive while, for others, the facilities are either all but unavailable or are priced at a significant premium.
In the second half of the year, we approached a number of potential lenders to refinance part of the 375m syndicated loan facility expiring in March 2013 that was inherited upon the merger with London Merchant Securities in 2007.
Our intention was to remove the risk in relation to that part of this refinancing which was 175m to be funded by banks while leaving a further part which could be replaced with non-bank funding in 2012.
Derwent London favours facilities which are either held by one bank or by a small club of convertible bond issued in June banks and we therefore preferred to avoid assembling a new large syndicated facility.
After receiving several offers of funding, in December 2011 we signed a new 150m fully revolving five-year facility provided equally by The Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays and a new 150m fully revolving five-year facility provided by Lloyds Bank to replace and extend their existing 100m bilateral facility.
Although signed in 2011, these new facilities did not become available for drawing until January 2012 and so, as at the 2011 balance sheet date, the 375m facility was still in place.
In January 2012, the 375m facility was part-cancelled and now consists of a 150m fully revolving facility.
