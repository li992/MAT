Financial Commentary 2011 has been a good year for the business, particularly so considering the difficult economic environment and the uncertainty caused by the developing Euro crisis.
On the back of the 10% increase in new business, we are reporting a strong operating performance and growth in all key profit measures.
Of particular note is the continuing growth in the cash emergence as the business matures.
This cost associated with the investment in new business means the net income is correspondingly reduced, although the new funds under management added are expected to generate future returns.
Management believes it is important for investors to appreciate not only the short-term net income position, but also the full, long-term potential income of the business.
We therefore complement our IFRS disclosure with additional disclosure on an embedded value basis using EEV principles.
This measure assesses the discounted value of all future cash flows and we believe it better reflects the full economic value of the performance of the business.
Ultimately, the business model is set to generate cash in the long-term and growth in the income over the long-term will ensure we are able to pay a growing dividend to shareholders.
In other words, the embedded value profit we report in one year should materialise in IFRS and other measures in future years.

We use this to meet the overheads of the business and to pay a dividend to shareholders, but This section provides a summary of the different methods we also invest in growing the Partnership and acquiring and the insight each offers: new funds under management.

However, as the business model matures, the strain of new business acquisition should reduce as a proportion of the total income, resulting in growth in the cash result.

03183415 Business Review The commentary below provides an explanation of the Return on In-force Business movement for the year.
As shown in the tables above, the return on the in-force business is mainly driven by the level of the annual Notes management fees, the unwind of the surrender penalties, Since all numbers are expressed after tax, they are impacted by the prevailing tax rate for and the level of expenses.
In 2011 the tax rate has reduced by 2% compared to the prior year.
1 The net annual management fee: This is the manufacturing margin the Group retains from the funds under management after payment of the associated costs e. g. The vast majority of the return relates to the net income investment advisory fees and Partner remuneration.
Broadly speaking the Group from funds under management annual management fees retains around 1% before tax 0.7% after tax of funds under management.
The level of net annual management fee was some 21% higher than 2010.
This less the unwind of the surrender penalty.
Looking increase is in line with the growth in funds under management which averaged forward, funds under management at the start of 2012 are 27.7 billion in 2011 compared to 24.2 billion in 2010.
If we were to repeat the net inflows of 3.3 2.
Unwind of surrender penalties: This relates to the reserving methodology applied to the surrender penalties within the charging structure of the single premium life billion achieved in 2011 and if stock markets remained flat, bonds and pensions.
At the outset of the product we establish a liability net of the then the average funds under management for 2012 would outstanding surrender penalty which would apply if the policy were to be encashed.
be 30.1 billion some 9% higher than the same figure As the surrender penalty reduces to zero so the liability to the policyholder is enhanced by increasing their funds by 1% per annum over the first six years of the for2011.
This growth would then feed through into an product life, to correspond to this unwind of the surrender penalty.
In other increase in the return on the in-force business.
words there is a cost which offsets the annual management fee above.
Like the net annual management fee, the unwind of surrender penalties has increased due to growth in funds under management.
However, the increase has In addition, a proportion of the new business has a been partly offset by the fact that the funds under management added six years ago surrender penalty which unwinds during the first six years, have completed the surrender penalty period.
In addition, the increase in the minimum pension age from 50 to 55 from March meaning that this business does not contribute to the cash 2010 means this treatment can be applied to more of our pension business.
As a result until year seven.
The table below provides an result there has been an increase in the amount of the unwind of surrender penalties estimated breakdown of the single premium business over for 2011 compared to 2010, which now reflects a full year impact compared with 9months in 2010. the last six years where these surrender penalties apply.
Margin arising from new business: This is the cash impact of new business in the These premiums are not yet generating income within the year after taking into account the directly attributable expenses.
The negative margin on new business represents the upfront net cash outflow from a certain category of pension new business where we are unable to apply surrender penalties.
The increase in the minimum pension age from 50 to 55 referred to above With has reduced the proportion of this business.
surrender The margin has also increased as a result of a reduction in initial Partner Year penalties remuneration on Life business, introduced as part of the changes to equalise Partner Billion remuneration.
Establishment expenses: These are the expenses of running the Groups 2006 1.3 infrastructure as shown in the table on page 24.
In line with the rest of this table 2007 1.6 they are presented after allowance for tax.
2008 1.4 These expenses were 5.8% higher in the current year.
Since the analysis is presented after tax the increase reflects not just the 5.8% increase in these expenses but also 2009 1.6 the 2% reduction in corporation tax rate 2010 2.1 5.
Development expenses: these represent the expenditure associated with a 2011 2.2 significant development in our investment proposition together with the costs associated with training the Partnership towards full diploma qualification over the Total 10.2 next couple of years.
FSA FSCS Fees: This relates to the fees payable to the FSA and the FSCS for the year.
Shareholder interest arising from regulated and non-regulated business: This is the assumed income accruing on the investments and cash held for regulatory purposes together with the interest received on the surplus capital held by the Group.
The interest received is at a similar level to the prior year and reflects the low prevailing interest rates we obtain on the free assets.
Miscellaneous: This represents the cash flow of the business not covered in any of the other categories.
It will include miscellaneous product charges and the income and expenses included within the other operations of the business.
Variance: This reflects variances in the cash result in a year due to the impact of actual experience on insurance reserves, as well as variances in the settlement of tax related liabilities between the policyholders unit-linked funds, the shareholder and HMRC.
21 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Commentary continued The total business not yet contributing to the cash result is 10.2 billion or just over a third of the total funds under management at 31 December 2011.
Once this business reaches the end of the surrender period the cash result will increase.
For illustration purposes, if all the business was now at this level of maturity then the annual post-tax cash result based on 0.7% post-tax earnings from funds under management would be some 71.3 million higher.
ignores stock market movements and outflows since the date of original client investment The Board therefore expect the cash earnings from the in-force business to increase as funds under management grow and the business matures.
Return on Investment in New Business As noted in the table on page 15, 62.4 million 2010: 61.4 million of the cash arising from the in-force business has been re-invested in acquiring the new business during the year.
This investment in new business will generate income in the future that should significantly exceed the cost of investment and therefore provide positive returns for shareholders.
The table below provides details of the new business added during the reporting periods and different measures of valuing the investment: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Post-tax investment in new business Million 62.4 61.4 Post-tax present value of expected future cash returns Million 253.5 222.7 Post-tax present value of expected profit from investment Million 191.1 161.3 Gross inflow of funds under management Billion 5.2 4.7 Investment as % of gross inflow 1.2% 1.3% New business margin % of APE 38.3% 37.4% Cash payback period years 5 5 Internal rate of return net of tax 20.6% 19.6% The investment as a percentage of net inflow of funds under management was 1.9% compared with 2.0% for the prior year.
The cost of this re-investment to acquire new business is not expected to increase significantly and therefore the proportion of cash generated from the in-force business available to pay dividends to shareholders is expected to expand.
Capital Position The capital position of the Group, calculated on the regulatory basis solvency net assets and allowing for the regulatory solvency requirement, is shown in the table below.
The Group continues to be well capitalised in excess of the solvency requirements and the assets remain prudently managed being predominantly in cash, AAA money market funds and government backed securities.
Comparison with previous valuations would show that the Group solvency position has remained stable despite market volatility, reflecting the low appetite for market, credit and liquidity risks in relation to solvency.

23 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Commentary continued Solvency II We continue to prepare for the adoption of the new EU Solvency II requirements.
Based on the proposed rules, the Group will not be adversely impacted by these new requirements and we expect to see a reduction in the total capital we are required to hold for regulatory purposes.
Share Options Maturity At 31 December 2011 there were 20.9 million share options outstanding under the various share option schemes which, if exercised, will provide up to 49.1 million 2010: 59.2 million, of future capital for the Company.

SECTION 4: OTHER MATTERS The final section of this commentary covers a number of additional areas that will be of interest to shareholders.
Expenses The table below provides the usual breakdown of the expenditure before tax for the combined financial services activities.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December Notes 2011 2010 Million Million Paid from policy margins Partner remuneration 1 276.7 247.9 Investment expenses 1 92.5 87.7 Third party administration 1 33.5 33.4 402.7 369.0 Direct expenses Other new business related costs 2 54.5 49.5 Establishment costs 3 95.0 89.8 Development costs 4 4.5 5.7 FSA FSCS levy 5 8.0 10.3 Contribution from third party product sales 6 13.5 13.8 148.5 141.5 551.2 510.5 24 St. Jamess Place plc Registered No.
03183415 Business Review The growth in establishment expenses during the year was 5.8%, slightly above our original expectations of 5%.
In 2012 we expect establishment expenses to grow by 5%, and in addition we will be investing c. 3.0 million in re-launching the St. Jamess Place Academy and other initiatives.
The development expenses were 4.5 million during the year and we expect a further cost in 2012 of 5 to 6 million.
These costs are met from corresponding policy margins and any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not directly impact the profitability of the Company.
During 2011 we negotiated a reduction in the tariff payable to a number of the outsourced providers and consequently the relevant cost for the year was at a similar level to 2010, despite the higher level of new business and the growing in-force business.
The other new business related costs, such as sales force incentivisation, vary with the level of sales determined on our internal measure.
As production rises or falls these costs will move in the corresponding direction.
Establishment costs are the running costs of the Groups infrastructure and are relatively fixed in nature in the short-term, although subject to inflationary increases.
These costs will increase as the infrastructure expands to manage the higher number of existing clients and the growth in the Partnership.
Development costs represent the expenditure associated with a significant development in our investment proposition together with the costs associated with training the Partnership towards their diploma qualifications over the next couple of years.
The FSA FSCS costs represent the fees payable to the FSA of 4.5 million 2010: 4.1 million together with our required contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of 3.5 million 2010: 6.2 million.
Contribution from third party product sales reflects the net income received from wealth management sales of 3.5 million 2010: 4.2 million, sales of stakeholder products of 1.5 million 2010: 1.0 million and sales through the Protection Panel of 8.5 million 2010: 8.6 million.
During the current year, 6.6 million of software development costs have been capitalised as an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38.
This asset will be amortised over the following four years.
Life Taxation Changes The taxation rules for life assurance companies are expected to change from 1 January 2013.
The main change is to move the basis of assessment of corporation tax from the regulatory return to the IFRS result.
Based on the proposed rules, the Group will not be adversely impacted by these new requirements, although the timing of settlement of tax may be advanced marginally.
Movement in Funds under Management The table below shows the movement in the funds under management of the Group during the reporting period.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Billion Billion Opening funds under management 27.0 21.4 New money invested 5.2 4.7 Investment return 1.8 2.6 30.4 28.7 Regular withdrawals maturities 0.5 0.5 Surrenders part surrenders 1.4 1.2 Closing funds under management 28.5 27.0 Implied surrender rate as % of average funds under management 5.2% 5.0% Net inflow of funds 3.3 3.0 Net inflow as % of opening funds under management 12.2% 14.0% Shareholders will be pleased to note that the continued strong retention of funds under management, together with the level of new money invested, provides for net fund inflow of 3.3 billion.
This is 10% higher than the 3.0 billion for last year.
This net inflow represents 12.2% 2010: 14.0% of opening funds under management and can be viewed as the organic growth in funds.
25 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Commentary continued Noted below is an explanation of regular withdrawals, maturities and surrenders.
The regular withdrawals represent those amounts selected by clients which are paid out by way of periodic income.
The withdrawals have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Maturities are those sums paid out where the plan has reached the selected maturity date e. g. retirement date.
The expected maturities have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Surrenders and part surrenders are those amounts where clients have chosen to withdraw money from their plan.
Surrenders are assumed to occur in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit based on actual experience, updated on an annual basis, by plan duration and the age of the client.
The implied surrender rate shown in the table above is very much a simple average and reflects only recent experience.
Whilst it could be compared with the long-term assumptions underlying the calculation of the embedded value, it should not be assumed that small movements in this rate will result in a change to the long-term embedded value assumptions.
Concluding Remarks As I commented at the start of this statement, 2011 has seen a strong operating performance with an increase in allkey profit measures.
The performance is particularly pleasing given the difficult trading conditions in the second half of the year as the Euro crisis unfolded and stock markets became very volatile.
Looking forward, we believe the business has demonstrated its resilience to difficult trading conditions over the last few years, and as the business matures we expect further growth in the cash result.
