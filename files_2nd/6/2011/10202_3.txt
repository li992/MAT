Revenue Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted EBITDA The performance for the year has been disappointing with overall 54.85c $158.7m reported revenues being broadly fl at at $436.1 million 2010: -4.2% 2010: 57.26c -8.4% 2010: $173.3m $432.6 million.
When compared against pro-forma constant currency revenues for the year ended 30 April 2010 of $464.0 million Group 57.26 173.3 revenues have declined by 6.0%.
This is against an expectation at the 54.85 158.7 beginning of the year of mid-single digit revenue growth which had 41.51 118.6 been reduced at the interims to $453 million.
The reported revenues 32.08 are in line with the pre-close trading update given on 9 May 2011.

See fi gure 1 Adjusted profi t before tax Cash generated from $147.0m continuing operations The reduction in licence fee revenue by 15.2% is the primary reason -8.6% 2010: $160.9m $182.3m 77.3% behind the failure to meet expectations set at the beginning of the 2010: $102.8m year.
If we adjust for the impact of the credit note issued to our former 182.3 160.9 147.0 distributor in Brazil, explained in more detail below, the reduction in licence fee revenue is 14.2%.
Maintenance revenues were marginally 115.9 down on last years pro-forma number but benefi tted from back 105.0 102.8 85.6 91.0 billing revenues where older maintenance contracts were renewed.
67.1 Maintenance revenue on renewals does not start to be recognised until 58.2 the customer has renewed their order, the invoice has been issued and 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 the contract renewal date has passed.
Where the renewal date is in a prior period, this will result in revenues from the renewal date to the order signature date being recognised in the month of invoice.
This back billing benefi t was largely in the AMQ revenue stream and is unlikely to be repeated in the next fi financial year.
As maintenance revenue is related to the renewal rate on existing contracts and the initial maintenance fee attached to new licence sales, these two factors are going to result in a declining maintenance revenue in the next fi financial year.
