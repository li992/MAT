These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
Currency exposures on transactions denominated in a foreign currency are required to be hedged using forward contracts.
In addition, recurring transactions and future investment exposures may be hedged, in advance of becoming contractual.
The precise policy differs according to the specific circumstances of the individual businesses.
Highly predictable future cash flows may be covered for transactions expected to occur during the next 24 months 50 months for Elsevier science and medical subscription businesses within limits defined according to the period before the transaction is expected to become contractual.
Cover takes the form of foreign exchange forward contracts.

credit risk Reed Elsevier has a credit exposure for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents held with individual counterparties.
In addition, it has a credit risk from the potential non performance by counterparties to financial instruments: this credit risk normally being restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the full principal amount being hedged.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than A A2 by Standard & Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
At 31 December 2011, cash and cash equivalents totalled 726m, of which 98% was held with banks rated A A2 or better.
