Continuing basis Financial Following the sale of Devro GmbH on 30 September 2011, the numbers and values in the statement refer to continuing business unless stated otherwise.
The results of this business review contributed sales of 16.4 million and operating profit of 0.04 million in 2011 9 months, 2010 12 months : sales of 23.4 million and operating profit of 1.2 million.
Revenue Reported revenue for 2011 was 227.7 million 2010: 213.6 million, representing an increase of 14.1 million, or 6.6%, over 2010.
Of this increase, 6.3 million related to volume, 4.7 million to sales price and mix, and 3.1 million to foreign currency movements.
Sales revenues by product group were as follows: Collagen casings Other products Total 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 208.1m 191.6m 19.6m 22.0m 227.7m 213.6m Sales volumes of edible collagen rose by 4.6% in 2011 due to the growth experienced in many of the developing markets and the continued conversion of gut to collagen in established markets.
Distributed product sales, which included cellulose and fibrous casing, are no longer shown separately as the majority of these sales were part of Devro GmbH which was sold in September 2011 as referred to above.
Other Products, which includes collagen gel, collagen film and plastic casings, showed a Simon Webb Group Finance Director decline of 11% due to the conversion back to casing from co-extrusion by a large USA beefstick producer.
Year on year revenue growth between 2007 and 2011 can be further analysed as follows: Sales mix 2011 vs 2010 2010 vs 2009 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 Volume 3.0% 1.4% 3.8% 3.0% Price Mix 2.2% 4.2% 5.7% 4.3% Exchange 1.4% 2.6% 10.2% 9.1% Total 6.6% 8.2% 19.7% 16.4% Sales volumes increased overall, but there were significant movements between markets.
Pricing and sales mix improved again in 2011, reflecting underlying price increases and a change in mix to higher value customers, products and markets.
2011 revenue growth by geographical region compared to 2010 can be analysed as follows: Region 2011 Volume Price Mix Exchange Total Europe 8.5m 3.3% 3.2% 1.4% 7.9% Americas 0.8m 5.1% 0.0% -3.4% 1.7% Asia Pacific 4.8m -0.6% 3.3% 5.8% 8.5% Total 14.1m 3.0% 2.2% 1.4% 6.6% The above analysis covers all product ranges.
Within this analysis, edible collagen average price increased by 4.2% including the favourable impact of exchange.
European sales increased in volume terms, and showed price growth in part due to increased sales of Select casing.
Growth in the Americas was driven by encouraging sales in Latin America.
There was also a movement back to casing from collagen gel by one large American customer.
Selling prices continued to move ahead, but the adverse impact of selling lower-value products meant that the overall price mix effect was flat.
Progress in this 08 08 Business Review Directors Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information region was hampered by adverse exchange rate movement.
In Asia Pacific, there was an overall reduction in volumes, but this was limited to China and Australia, with other countries in South East Asia and Japan showing strong growth.
Operating profit The movement between 2010 and 2011 operating profit before exceptional items can be analysed as follows: Operating profit 2010 37.0m Price Mix 5.1m Volume 3.5m Manufacturing 1.9m Exchange 0.3m Input costs -5.1m Operating profit 2011 42.7m Price Mix Overall, we achieved a profit improvement of 5.1 million from higher sales prices and a better sales mix.
Of this, 2.4 million resulted from actual increases in sales prices and 2.7 million from changes to customers, markets and product mix.
Volume Profit impact of volume represents the gross margin earned on net additional sales between 2010 and 2011 by product group.
Manufacturing We continue to invest in new equipment to improve manufacturing efficiencies and productivity.
These benefits will come through in 2012 with the Bellshill lines and the USA investment coming on stream and in 2013 with the completion of the capital expenditure in the Czech Republic.
These projects will also help expand capacity.
Foreign currency Devro operates worldwide and with multiple currencies.
Its major transactional exposures arise from sales in euros, US dollars and Japanese yen whereas the manufacturing costs are in Australian dollars, Czech koruna, US dollars and sterling.
Translational exposures arise from the conversion of the results into sterling.
The overall impact of exchange on the results was low, showing a gain of 0.3 million compared to 2010.
There was an overall translation gain of 1.4 million which reflected the strength of the Czech koruna and Australian dollar against sterling, offset by 1.1 million of transaction loss.
This transactional loss was primarily due to the weakening of the euro against the Czech koruna.
Euro sales make up 30% of the groups total sales.
The group holds an average of 3 million in cash and the level of euro receivables is approximately 9 million.
The groups practice is to take out cash flow hedges across all currencies up to one year ahead, to mitigate the impact of future exchange rate volatility.
Input costs Input costs rose by 5.1 million during the year, of which inflation on wages and salaries accounted for 2.3 million.
The remainder reflects increases in hide and other raw material costs as well as investments in facilities particularly in China, Hong Kong and South East Asia.
Energy cost increases in 2011 were relatively small at 0.4 million as the businesses agree their electricity contracts forward by one year wherever possible.
We expect these costs to be approximately 2 million higher in 2012 in view of the rise in global energy costs reflected in contract renewals.
09 | Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Operating margin Financial Operating margin increased to 18.7% for the year, compared to 17.3% for 2010. review continued Analysis of results by half year H1 H2 TOTAL 2011 2010 % change 2011 2010 % change 2011 2010 % change Sales 107.1m 104.6m 2.4% 120.6m 109.0m 10.6% 227.7m 213.6m 6.6% Operating profit 19.5m 17.5m 11.6% 23.2m 19.5m 19.0% 42.7m 37.0m 15.5% % Margin 18.2% 16.7% 19.2% 17.9% 18.7% 17.3% before exceptionals The first half of the year showed a slower growth in sales, which reflected the strong comparisons in Q1 2010, particularly in China and UK, and also there was a series of natural disasters including severe weather, a tsunami in Japan and an earthquake in New Zealand.
In spite of these natural events, the group successfully grew its operating margins from 16.7% to 18.2% with improved pricing and stronger mix helping this growth.
During the second half of the year, sales momentum grew strongly with Select contributing to an improvement in Japan and Europe, with Russia and Eastern Europe continuing to expand.
Margins further strengthened in the second half in line with the increased volumes and the positive mix effect of Select.
Capital investment Capital expenditure in the year was 43.4 million.
The major items of investment related to the upgrade of some lines in the Bellshill factory in Scotland, one line in USA and work on the building in Jilemnice which will house replacement lines in the Czech Republic.
The benefits of the Bellshill and USA lines will come through in 2012 and the Czech investment in 2013.
Other significant expenditure included the installation of a gas co-generation plant in our factory in Bathurst, Australia at the end of December 2011.
This project will help reduce the carbon emissions of the business and control future energy costs.
Wherever we invest in capital expenditure the business targets a return on capital employed sufficient to at least maintain the current return on capital presently enjoyed by Devro.
For 2012 we expect capital investments to be over 30.0 million as the group looks to continue to expand capacity and improve manufacturing facilities.
Working capital 2010 2011 excluding Devro GmbH m No of days m No of days Inventories 27.6 54 25.5 54 Trade receivables 30.8 52 27.0 46 Other receivables 4.0 3.7 Accounts payable 8.5 28 8.4 24 Accruals and other payables 24.7 22.2 Total 29.2 25.6 Cash generation and optimising working capital remain a priority for Devro.
Gross inventory levels increased by 8% which reflects the building of inventory in anticipation of the work in Jilemnice in 2012 as new lines are installed.
Trade receivables increased in line with sales, with the number of days outstanding increasing due to a greater proportion of sales to Japan, where payment terms tend to be longer.
10 10 Business Review Directors Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Financing Key financial measures are as follows: 2011 2010 Net debt 22.7m 12.2m Net debt EBITDA 0.40 0.24 Gearing 16.2% 8.0% Return on Capital Employed ROCE 21.5% 21.1% Net debt rose by 10.5 million in 2011 as a result of capital investments offset by the strong EBITDA.
It is our intention to maintain a prudent level of gearing in the business in the future.
As expected, return on capital employed remained relatively flat as a result of the significant capital investment in 2011, the benefits of which will flow through in 2012 and 2013.
Interest 2011 2010 m m Net interest cost 0.9 0.7 Net finance income costs on pension assets and liabilities 1.2 1.1 Total net interest 0.3 1.8 Total net interest was an income figure in 2011 due to the net finance income on pensions.
This income is in spite of the overall gross deficit and reflects the difference between the expected returns on assets and the interest on liabilities.
In 2012, the net finance income on pensions will revert to an interest cost of 1.2m for the full year, which is more in line with the level experienced in 2010 1.1m cost Tax The group had an effective tax rate of 20.5% for 2011 2010: 21.6% before exceptional items.
The group continues to benefit from a lower tax rate in the Czech Republic in 2011 as a result of a local investment scheme, the benefits of which are expected to continue until at least 2015.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share for 2011 was 20.8 pence, up 22.4% 2010: 17.0 pence before exceptional items.
This reflected the improved operating margin and the net finance income on pensions.
Dividend With the improvement in performance, the Board is proposing an increase of 14.3% in the dividend for the year, making a final dividend of 5.5 pence per share 2010: 5.0 pence, bringing the total for the year to 8.0 pence per share 2010: 7.0 pence.
This will be payable on 4 May 2012 to shareholders on the register as at 30 March 2012.
Based on the proposal for the full year, dividend cover will be 2.6 times.
11 | Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Pensions Financial The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes around the world.
All of these are closed to new entrants although the liabilities to existing schemes are considerable.
review continued 2011 2010 m m Fair value of scheme assets 196.6 198.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 242.8 211.9 Net pension liabilities 46.2 13.4 During the year the value of the scheme assets was relatively stable.
However, the present value of the pension liabilities increased as a result of the fall in discount rates.
The UK scheme is the largest of the schemes and the discount rate decreased from 5.4% to 4.7% in 2011, generating 25 million of additional net liabilities.
In 2010, the UK scheme was restructured which has helped limit the volatility.
Work is ongoing with advisers to look at developing the group pension strategy in order to manage the underlying risks.
Further additional contributions will be made to the schemes in 2012 to reduce the deficit.
The results of the triennial valuation for the UK scheme as at 31 March 2011 will be concluded in the first half of 2012.
As a result of the increase in the pension deficit, the related deferred tax asset has risen to 13.8m from 5.4m in 2010.
Principal risks and uncertainties There are risks and uncertainties inherent in the groups operations which could have a significant impact on our business, results and financial position.
The groups risk management processes identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate the risks involved in our operations.
The more significant risks to which the group is exposed are: Loss of market share profit margins due to increased competitive pressures Disruption to supply and increase in price of key raw materials Foreign exchange rate movements Development of non-casing technologies Impact of changes in regulations affecting food production Increases in energy costs Increased funding requirements of pension schemes Customer credit risks Going concern The business renegotiated its banking facilities in September 2011 and has new 5 year revolving facilities of 51 million.
As at 31 December 2011 it was operating comfortably within the covenants relating to these facilities.
We believe that Devro is well financed and has sufficient liquidity to fund the future requirements of the business.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
