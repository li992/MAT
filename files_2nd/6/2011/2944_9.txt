The Group has operations in the UK, Middle East and North Africa and Canada, as described on pages 02 and 03.
Underlying cash flow from operations remained strong at 230.3 million 1 representing 107% of underlying profit from operations, despite the expected working capital outflow associated with downsizing our UK construction operations.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had net borrowing of 50.7 million 31 December 2010: net cash of 120.2 million, which was substantially better than expected following the acquisition of Carillion Energy Services in April 2011.
Total revenue of 5.1 billion 2010: 5.1 billion, including revenue from Joint Ventures of 898.0 million 2010: 902.5 million was unchanged, with the revenue contribution acquired with Carillion Energy Services offset by a reduction in UK Construction revenue, in line with the planned re-scaling of our UK construction activities.

Revenue increased by 11 per cent to 2,345.2 million, with the acquired revenue contribution from CES partially offset by the previously reported revenue reductions arising from contract demobilisations during 2010, notably contracts for Aviva and the Highways Agency, and the effect of our continuing focus on margins through contract selectivity.
This focus enabled us to maintain our operating margin in this segment at 5.2 per cent, despite challenging market conditions, with underlying operating profit increasing by nine per cent to 120.8 million, broadly half of the Groups total underlying operating profit.
The acquisition of CES in April 2011 was an important strategic development, driven primarily by the need to extend our support services offering to include energy efficiency services, given that these services are an increasingly important part of the integrated facilities management and maintenance solutions required by our customers.
The acquisition has also taken the Group into new markets with good prospects for growth.
While the UK Governments decision to reduce Feed-in-Tariffs for solar Carillion has provided facilities management services for photovoltaic systems Solar PV is expected to limit growth in the Solar Centricas UK property portfolio, including environmental PV market, CES continues to have good growth prospects in its other management services, since 2005. markets.
These prospects have been boosted by the UK Governments announcements regarding implementation of the provisions of the Energy Act 2011 and in particular, the Green Deal and the Energy Company Obligation ECO.
The Green Deal, which is to receive an Revenue additional 200 million of Government funding, is expected to kick-start at least 14 billion of investment in energy efficiency measures over the next decade.
The ECO, which the Government is committed to introduce in October 2012, is expected to create a market worth some 1.3 billion 2.3bn a year, initially up to 2015, but the present Government intends to extend this period to 2020.
2010: 2.1bn During 2011, we continued to win new orders by using our extensive capabilities and nationwide resources to target large complex contracts.
Underlying operating profit At 31 December 2011, our forward order book for support services was worth 12.3 billion 2010: 11.7 billion and in addition we had probable orders worth 0.6 billion 2010: 0.5 billion.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 27 Public Private Partnership projects In this segment we report the equity returns on investments in Public Private Partnership PPP projects in the UK and Canada.
We combine our expertise in private finance with our support services and construction capabilities to win and deliver fully integrated solutions for PPP projects, in which we invest equity and for which we secure construction contracts and long-term support services contracts, typically for up to 35 years.
The results of our PPP construction and support services contracts are reported in our Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services segments, respectively.
Once a project is mature, having passed from construction into the operational phase, we have the option of selling our equity and reinvesting the proceeds in new projects.
The one per cent reduction in revenue in 2011 reflected the sale of our equity investments in the Queen Alexandra Hospital project in June 2010 and in three further projects in 2011, partially offset by growth in the remainder of the portfolio.
The 15 per cent reduction in operating profit in 2011 reflected these equity sales and the fact that profit in 2010 benefited from the receipt of higher than normal fees upon achieving financial close on four large projects.
A Carillion Joint Venture is delivering the 157 million Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada, using the In 2011, a Carillion joint venture achieved financial close on a 1.7 billion, Alternative Financing Procurement model, which is similar to 30-year contract for the New Oakville Hospital PPP project in Ontario, the UKs Public Private Partnership model.
Canada, our sixth PPP hospital in Canada, in which we expect to invest some 28 million of equity.
During 2011, we also sold equity investments in three mature projects, namely South Ayrshire Schools, Three Shires Revenue Hospitals and the A249 Sheppey Route.
These sales generated total gross proceeds of 25.4 million, which represented an average discount rate of seven per cent, and a non-operating profit of 11.5 million.

The Directors 2010: 0.3bn valuation of this portfolio at 31 December 2011 increased to 164 million 2010: 135 million, based on discounting the cash flows from our investments at nine per cent.
At 31 December 2011 we also had Underlying operating profit commitments to invest a further 125 million of equity in financially closed projects that are still in the construction phase.
Our forward order book at 31 December 2011 was 2.7 billion 2010: 2.7 billion and we had probable orders worth 0.1 billion 2010: nil.
In addition, 19.9m we are currently short-listed for two further projects in which we could 2010: 23.4m potentially invest up to 65 million, namely the Royal Liverpool Hospital and Sheffield Highways.
Going forward, we continue to expect opportunities to add projects to Change from 2011 2010 2010 our portfolio.

We continued to make good progress in the Middle East, with revenue increasing by 11 per cent to 548.9 million.
Operating profit increased by three per cent to 49.1 million 2010: 47.5 million, despite the operating margin reducing to 8.9 per cent 2010: 9.6 per cent in line with the expectations we announced in 2010, namely that margins in this segment would ease back to around six per cent by 2013, because all our contracts are now competitively tendered rather than negotiated.
Our progress in 2011 continues to reflect the strength of our markets together with the reputation we have built over the last forty years for high-quality and on-time delivery.
As well as continuing to win contracts in the territories where we have well-established businesses, namely Abu Dhabi, Oman and Dubai, we successfully extended our Middle East operations to Qatar, where a Carillion joint venture won its first contract in 2011 a 395 million contract to deliver a major phase of the Msheireb Heart of Doha development for Msheireb Properties, a subsidiary of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development.

In assessing our prospects in the Middle East, our pipeline Revenue of contract opportunities is especially important, given that we are focused on large projects that can move quickly from tender stage to contract signature, causing substantial movements in order book value.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 29 Construction services excluding the Middle East In this segment we report the results of our UK building, civil engineering and developments businesses, together with those of our construction activities in Canada.
Revenue in this segment reduced by 17 per cent, as we continued to make progress with our objective of re-scaling UK construction to reduce its revenue by approximately one third, from the 2009 level of 1.8 billion to 1.2 billion, which we expect to acheive in 2012.
In 2011, UK construction revenue reduced by 24 per cent to 1.3 billion 2010: 1.7 billion.
Re-scaling is being achieved by tightening our contract selectivity criteria to base our UK activities progressively around the delivery of integrated solutions for PPP projects and support services customers, and high-quality, value-added contracts for long-term customers.
As expected, construction revenue in Canada remained broadly unchanged.
Our decision to re-scale UK construction anticipated the Governments cuts in capital spending of some 30 per cent in real terms over the current four-year spending plan.
It has also helped us to improve the operating margin in this segment, as we have avoided bidding for lower margin work at a time when the UK market is becoming increasingly competitive.
