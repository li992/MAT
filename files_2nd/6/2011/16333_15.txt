Introduction Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Performance Financial review continued All staff who have joined Ultra in the UK since the dened benefit scheme was closed in 2003 have been invited to become members of the Ultra Electronics Group Personal Pension Plan and since April 2011 the Ultra Electronics Group Flexible Retirement Plan.
Under the terms of this 60 dened contribution scheme, company payments are supplemented by contributions from employees.
Ultra sells its products and services in Certain employees at TCS in Canada participate in a dened over 60 countries worldwide benefit scheme.
This scheme is closed to new employees and had an IAS19 deficit of 1.2m at the end of the year 2010: deficit of 0.7m.
Regular payments continue to be made, with both company and employees making contributions, so as to maintain a satisfactory funding position.
The Groups remaining Canadian employees participate in a number of dened contribution pension plans.
In the US, Ultra offers a dened contribution 401 k retirement benefit plan to all full-time employees.
Under this plan, Ultra provides participating and contributing employees with matching contributions, subject to plan and US Internal Revenue Service limitations.
Adaptive Materials, Inc. had its own 401 k plan in place when it became part of Ultra during 2010 and this was consolidated into the main Ultra scheme on 5 January 2012.
SOTECH, which had its own 401 k plan in place when it became part of Ultra during 2011, will consolidate its plan into the main Ultra scheme during 2012.
Wells Fargo Bank N. A. provides third party administrative services and is also a directed trustee of the plan.
Foreign exchange risks Ultras results are affected by both the translation and transaction effects of foreign currency movements.
By their nature, currency translation risks cannot be mitigated but the transaction position is actively managed.
The majority of sales made by Ultras businesses are made in local currency, thus avoiding any transaction risk.
However, this risk does arise when businesses make sales and purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies, most often in US dollars.
To reduce the potential volatility, Ultra attempts to source, in US dollars, a high proportion of the product sold in US dollars.
For the remaining net expense, the Groups policy is to hedge forward the foreign currency trading exposure in order to increase certainty.
The expected ows are reviewed on a regular basis and additional layers of cover are taken out so that, at year-end, 84% of the expected exposure for 2012 was covered, reducing to 25% of the exposure for 2015.
Exposure to other currencies is hedged as it arises on specic contracts.
