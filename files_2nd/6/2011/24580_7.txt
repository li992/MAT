These firms maintain capital resources at a level which satisfies both their regulatory capital requirements as well as their working capital requirements.
Within the industry, regulatory capital requirements have increased in recent years and we expect this to continue as a result of FSA requirements.
During the 2011 financial year we held a healthy margin of at least six times the Pillar 1 minimum capital requirement.
This equates to a margin of approximately three times the Pillar 2 capital requirement, which is our own assessment of the minimum amount of capital that we believe is adequate as identified during our Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
