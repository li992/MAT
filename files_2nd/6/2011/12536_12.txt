28 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements EXPLORATION REVIEW continued In Mauritania, the exploration PSC extension was signed and ratified in 2011, resulting in a new PSC.
The new PSC, in which Premier holds a 6.23 per cent equity interest, has a gross 2 area of 10,725km.
The plan is to drill the first of two exploration wells on this new PSC in the latter half of 2012.
Additional acreage was secured in East Africa via Premiers entry into two new PSCs, offshore Kenya.
Offshore East Africa was an industry focus in 2011 with the discovery of significant resources offshore Mozambique and Tanzania.
Premiers acreage offers the potential to extend these successful plays northwards into offshore Kenya.
Premier plans to drill between 15 and 20 exploration and appraisal wells in 2012, including a further exploration well on the UK Catcher Block and two wells, Coaster and Spaniards, on acreage acquired through the EnCore acquisition.
In Norway, the Luno II well is planned for the fourth quarter and, in Asia, the appraisal of the north west Chim So discovery will take place, as well as four exploration wells in Indonesia.
Asia Indonesia On the Premier-operated Tuna PSC, exploration wells Gajah Laut Utara and Belut Laut were drilled to test the Miocene and Oligocene potential of two prospects on the block.
Gajah Laut Utara spudded in May 2011 and was followed by Belut Laut which spudded in July.
Both wells encountered good oil and gas shows in the Oligocene section, proving the existence of a working petroleum system in both of these previously undrilled sub-basins.
Post-well studies will continue into 2012 with further drilling in the Nam Con Son Basin planned after integration of the 2011 results.
On Natuna Sea Block A, a block-wide prospect inventory review was carried out to characterise the remaining exploration potential on the block.
Two exploration wells, Anoa Deep WL-5X and Biawak Besar, were scheduled for drilling in early 2012.
In February 2012, it was announced that the Anoa Deep well had successfully encountered some 300 feet of fractured Lama Formation sandstone, which tested gas at a rate of 17 mmscfd from a 112 feet interval.
In North Sumatra, preparations are at an advanced stage for the drilling of the Matang-1 exploration well during 2012 on Block A Aceh.
Planning and preparation has continued on the non-operated Buton Block, for the drilling of the Benteng-1 exploration well, which is now scheduled to drill in the first half of 2012.
` Following the exploration discovery at C R ong Do CRD in Block 07 03, Premier drilled and tested the CRD-2X appraisal well into the Oligocene sands that had not been tested by the discovery well.
Drill stem tests of the hydrocarbon bearing sands in the Oligocene section flowed gas and condensate at potentially commercial rates, and the well was then sidetracked to provide further data on the distribution of hydrocarbons in the Miocene sands.
Evaluation of the CRD discovery and the surrounding exploration acreage continued throughout the year.
The high risk Qua Mit Vang well, drilled in Block 104-109 05, was plugged and abandoned after flowing gas with 99 per cent carbon dioxide from fractured basement rock, with well costs substantially carried via a farminee.
In Block 12W, two development wells drilled into a fault terrace to the north west of the Chim So field proved the presence of oil in this previously undrilled area, encountering columns of 15 and 89 metres of oil bearing sands within good quality Upper Dua sandstones.
A dedicated appraisal well will be drilled into this discovery in 2012.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 29 North Sea UK Premier continued its success in the Catcher area licence P1430, Block 28 9 with discoveries at Burgman and Catcher North in 2011, both of which will contribute to a Catcher area 2 development plan.
The joint venture also acquired 455km 3D seismic data across Block 28 9 2 and 190km 3D data on the surrounding open acreage.
Premier became operator of Central Fyne in May 2011 with a 39.9 per cent equity interest by exercising a farm-in option to drill the East Fyne well in licence P077, Block 21 28a.
Premier also agreed to participate in the Erne exploration well in nearby licence P1875, Block 21 29d.
The Erne well was drilled in December and was suspended as a potential tie-back to any future developments in the Greater Fyne area.
Subsequent to year-end, the East Fyne appraisal well was also drilled.
Despite encountering oil and gas-bearing sands, the well was plugged and abandoned.
The results of the wells are currently being incorporated into the plans for the Greater Fyne area by the partnership group.
The Bluebell prospect on P1466, Block 15 24c, was farmed down from a Premier 100 per cent equity position to a farminee who funded 67.67 per cent of the well cost in return for a 40 per cent interest.
Post year-end, it was announced that the Palaeocene target encountered excellent sand quality but was water wet.
Norway During the year, two wells were drilled on the PL378 licence which contains the 2009 Grosbeak discovery.
The first well, an exploration well on the Gnatcatcher prospect, was dry.
The second well, an appraisal on the Grosbeak discovery, delivered mixed results.
The primary bore was on prognosis and confirmed the oil water contact seen in the discovery well.
The subsequent side-track came in deep with the target sands penetrated below the contact.
The partnership is now focusing on commercialising Grosbeak, together with other discoveries in the nearby area.
Premier drilled an operated exploration well on the southern segment of the Gardrofa prospect in licence PL406 in the third quarter of 2011.
The well was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.
Premier made good progress in building its portfolio in 2011, with significant new acreage awards and acquisitions.
Premier was awarded two licences early in the year from the 2010 APA Licence Round: one, operated in the Central North Sea PL567, on which the work programme comprises seismic reprocessing: and the second, PL378B, as protection acreage to the PL378 Grosbeak licence.
Further additions were captured in the third quarter when a transaction to acquire three operated exploration blocks in the North Sea was agreed with Nexen.
Two of these blocks, PL539 and PL566S are close to PL567.
An application was submitted for four blocks in the 2011 APA Licence Round and, in January 2012, the Ministry notified that this had been successful, with four new licences being offered for award.
Three of these licences are in the Central North Sea and one is in mid-Norway.
30 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements EXPLORATION REVIEW continued Middle East, Africa and Pakistan Pakistan Three exploration wells K-25 Dir-A, K-27, and K-28 were drilled in 2011 in the Kadanwari Lease.
The Kadanwari K-25 Dir-A well tested 4 mmscfd but, due to tight reservoir conditions, the decision on whether to tie-in this well for production is still pending.
However, both K-27 and K-28 exploration wells tested at high flow rates up to 50 mmscfd in K-27 and approximately 30 mmscfd in K-28.
The K-27 well was tied in to the system in early March 2012 and is expected to add around 8 bcf of reserves, net to Premier.
The K-28 well, together with the K-30 well, which was successfully drilled in early 2012, will be tied in by mid-year 2012 to produce at maximum available plant capacity.
Egypt The award of the South Darag Block in the Gulf of Suez is awaiting formal government ratification having been delayed by the Egyptian parliamentary election process.
Premier farmed into the non-operated North Red Sea Block 1 in December 2010, taking a 20 per cent interest.
The NRS-2 Cherry exploration well was drilled to a target depth of 5,200 metres.
The well encountered hydrocarbon shows whilst drilling, but failed to intersect reservoir quality sandstones.
Geological studies are continuing to assess further prospectivity on the block.
Kenya In May 2011, Premier made an entry into Kenya with the signing of two PSCs for offshore exploration blocks L10A and L10B.
A 3D seismic data acquisition programme was completed ahead of schedule at year-end and a 2D programme was completed on 15 January 2012.
Processing and interpretation will take place in 2012 with exploration drilling provisionally scheduled for 2013.
SADR Premiers exploration rights in the Daora, Haouza, Mahbes and Mijek blocks in the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic SADR remain under force majeure while awaiting resolution of sovereignty under a United Nations mandated process.
Premier extended its acreage position in the SADR by gaining the Laguara Block as part of the EnCore acquisition.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 31 FINANCIAL REVIEW By Tony Durrant Finance Director Economic and business background Oil prices further strengthened during 2011 due to supply concerns and the volatile political situation in the Middle East.
Brent crude prices averaged US$111.3 bbl for the year, against US$79.5 bbl in 2010.
Premiers portfolio of crudes sells at an average of US$1.5 bbl premium to Brent.
Given the timing of our crude oil liftings, average actual realisations pre-hedge for the year were US$111.9 bbl 2010: US$79.7 bbl.
After taking into account the effect of long-term hedging contracts, the average oil price realised for 2011 was US$89.6 bbl 2010: US$78.3 bbl.
In Indonesia, 2011 has seen continuing good production performance from Natuna Sea Block A coupled with strong demand for gas from Singapore.
Under the first Gas Sales Agreement GSA1, out of a total Singapore demand of 364 BBtud 2010: 355 BBtud, gross sales from the Anoa field for the year averaged 152 BBtud, a share of approximately 42 per cent of deliveries against a contractual share of 36.9 per cent.
In October, gas production commenced from the Gajah Baru field.
Under the second Gas Sales Agreement GSA2, volumes at Gajah Baru are continuing to increase with current production rates of around 60-90 BBtud gross.
In Vietnam, first oil from the Chim So field was achieved in October 2011 with gas exports commencing in December.
Reservoir and well performance has exceeded expectations, though some topside and marine system facility issues remain to be resolved.
Excellent pricing has been achieved for oil cargoes sold in 2011, averaging in excess of US$5.50 bbl over Brent prices.
In the UK, production from the Balmoral area improved in the second half of 2011, as the immediate issues that affected our production performance in the first half of the year were resolved.
A good production result was achieved from the Scott area and Kyle fields.
In Pakistan, natural gas is a critical component of the countrys energy needs, meeting around 47 per cent of total energy requirements.
Total domestic gas production has remained at around 4 bcf per day, with demand continuing to grow at around 10 per cent per annum due to population growth and usage of natural gas as vehicle fuel.
This has created an increased shortfall of gas resulting in supply shortages in the country.
With significant gas reserves remaining, we are well placed to maintain or increase production through front end compression projects and new development drilling.
Income statement Production in 2011, on a working interest basis, averaged 40.4 kboepd 2010: 42.8 kboepd.
On an entitlement basis, which under the terms of our PSCs allows for additional government take at higher oil prices, production was 37.7 kboepd 2010: 38.3 kboepd.
Working interest gas production averaged 153 mmscfd 2010: 156 mmscfd during the year, or approximately 65 per cent of total production.
Average gas prices for the group were US$8.51 per thousand standard cubic feet mscf 32 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements FINANCIAL REVIEW continued 2010: US$6.26 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, which are linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil HSFO pricing, in turn closely linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$19.5 mscf 2010: US$13.9 mscf for the year.
Average gas prices for Pakistan were US$3.8 mscf 2010: US$3.5 mscf.
Total sales revenue from all operations reached a new record level of US$826.8 million 2010: US$763.6 million driven by higher commodity prices.
Cost of sales was lower by US$115.6 million at US$414.9 million 2010: US$530.5 million mainly reflecting a US$25.9 million impairment reversal against a US$65.3 million charge in 2010, due principally to the sustained high oil price environment, which necessitated an increase in the base price assumption used for the valuation of future cash flows.
Unit operating costs were US$15.9 per barrel of oil equivalent boe 2010: US$13.9 boe reflecting higher unit costs in the UK, as production levels declined, and the inclusion of Vietnam operating costs in the last quarter.
Underlying unit amortisation excluding impairment rose to US$13.8 boe 2010: US$12.6 boe largely as a result of the addition of Chim So field production in Vietnam.
Exploration expense and pre-licence exploration costs amounted to US$187.5 million 2010: US$68.2 million and US$23.0 million 2010: US$18.9 million respectively.
This includes the write-off of the following exploration wells: Gardrofa and Gnatcatcher in Norway: Cherry in Egypt: Qua Mit Vang in Vietnam: and Gajah Laut Utara and Belut Laut in Indonesia.
The decision was also taken to write-off US$31.7 million of costs in relation to the Fyne area, since at this stage potential developments in the Greater Fyne area do not meet the companys project development metrics.
Net administrative costs were US$25.8 million 2010: US$18.3 million, with the increase mainly due to transaction costs incurred to acquire EnCore Oil plc.
Operating profits were US$175.6 million 2010: US$127.7 million.
Finance costs and other charges, net of interest revenue and other gains, were US$68.1 million 2010: US$65.5 million, reflecting lower levels of interest income and increased gross debt levels offset by higher capitalisation of borrowing costs for our development projects in Asia and the UK.
The charge arising due to the unwinding of the discounted decommissioning provision increased to US$28.3 million 2010: US$16.2 million reflecting increased provisions and a higher discount rate.
Pre-tax profits of US$141.5 million 2010: US$100.8 million also reflect a positive adjustment of US$34.0 million in respect of the groups commodity hedge portfolio 2010: US$38.6 million.
This was driven by the unwinding of prior year provisions in respect of our oil and gas hedges.
The current tax charge for 2011 is US$77.3 million, an effective tax rate of 44 per cent of operating profits.
Additionally, US$72.1 million has been provided for potential additional tax charges in Indonesia and Pakistan over fiscal disputes relating to prior years.
These disputes are subject to clarification between the host governments and the oil and gas industry.
These charges are offset by a deferred tax credit of US$177.0 million, resulting in a net tax credit of US$29.7 million 2010: US$29.0 million.
The deferred tax credit arises mainly in the UK and includes the impact of a 12 per cent increase in supplementary corporation tax for the industry and the availability of Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement RFES allowances.
In addition, a deferred tax asset of US$87.0 million was recognised.
This relates to US$140.0 million of previously unbooked UK corporation tax allowances which, following the groups acquisition of additional fields in the UK, are now expected to be fully utilised.
At year-end the group had an estimated US$1.36 billion of carried forward UK corporation tax allowances which will be utilised against UK ring fence profits over time.
Profit after tax is a record US$171.2 million 2010: US$129.8 million resulting in basic earnings per share of 36.6 cents 2010 restated: 28.0 cents.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 33 Cash flow kboepd Cash flow from operating activities was US$485.9 million 2010: US$436.0 million after accounting for tax payments of US$44.0 million 2010: US$67.9 million.

296 Acquisitions RESERVES In December, Premier completed the acquisition of an additional 17.715 per cent interest in Wytch Farm for an adjusted consideration of US$89.9 million, taking its total interest to 30.1 per cent.
The acquisition of EnCore Oil plc was approved by its shareholders in December and subsequently sanctioned by the court in January 2012.
Shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCores shares elected to take new Premier shares, which began trading in January 2012. mmboe Total consideration of US$407.6 million was therefore satisfied by the issuance of 60.9 million new Premier shares and the payment of 14.1 million US$21.6 million in cash.
As a result of the acquisition, Premier has increased its stake in the Catcher project from 35 per cent to 50 per cent and has assumed operatorship.
This acquisition will be accounted for in the groups 2012 financial statements.
231 RESOURCES Balance sheet position Net debt at 31 December 2011 amounted to US$744.0 million 2010: US$405.7 million, with cash resources of US$309.1 million 2010: US$299.7 million.

Other debt includes 75.0 million of long-term senior notes, which are valued at year-end 171 US$1.296: spot rate.
However these will be redeemed at US$1.423: due to a cross currency swap arrangement.
PROFIT AFTER TAX In June 2011, the company issued seven and 10 year senior notes of US$244.0 million and 75.0 million in the private placement market.
Total debt facilities therefore increased to US$2,184.9 million 2010: US$1,572.0 million.
As at year-end, drawn borrowings were US$1,053.1 million and issued letters of credit were US$324.7 million.
Undrawn facilities were therefore US$807.1 million, which, together with cash in hand, provided available cash funding and letter of credit capacity of US$1,116.2 million.
Subsequent to year-end, additional bank facilities of US$350.0 million were negotiated and a second issue of senior notes was completed.
This second issue, with maturities of seven, 10 and 12 years, amounted to US$202.0 million and 25.0 million.
A US$175.0 million term loan has been repaid during March 2012, leaving cash and undrawn facilities of approximately US$1.4 billion.
