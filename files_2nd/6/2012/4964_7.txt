Drax Group plc Annual report and 20 accounts 2012 Operational and financial performance Strength across our operations Introduction Our 2012 profit reects continued strength in our operations.
We also delivered another year of industry-leading safety statistics, against a backdrop of significant project activity at the Drax site, including a planned double outage and commencement of construction on our new biomass storage and handling facilities.
EBITDA was 298 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 compared to 334 million in 2011 and underlying basic earnings per share were 52 pence compared to 56 pence last year.
A year-on-year increase in gross margin reects a record level of generation at the power station.
This was offset at EBITDA level by higher operating costs of the planned double outage and costs we incurred, following the Governments conrmation of regulatory support for biomass, as we accelerated our plans to put ourselves in the best possible position to convert a first unit to biomass in April 2013.
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited Haven Power continued to deliver good growth during 2012.
Sales increased from 3.3TWh in 2011 to 5.1TWh in 2012, largely as a result of the planned growth of the industrial and commercial customer base.
Towards the end of the year we secured the nancing required to support our biomass transformation plans, with the successful completion of a share placing, agreement of new term loan facilities, and the renancing of our working capital and letter of credit facilities.
With net cash of 311 million at the year end, we have in place a strong financial platform from which to realise our ambitions.
At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board will recommend a final dividend for 2012 of 10.9 pence per share, taking total dividends for the year to 97 million.
This review includes further explanation and commentary in relation to our principal performance indicators and the results for the year.
