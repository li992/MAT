This excludes exceptional items, the amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets and fair value changes on certain operating and financing derivatives together exceptional and other items.

Discontinued operations in 2012 comprise the Personal Care business and in 2011 also include the Closures business which was sold in 2011.

summary of the statutory performance The increase in Beverage Cans is driven by overall volume growth 2011 of 6% and some price increases partly offset by pass through of 2012 restated lower metal costs in 2012.

This reflects the mix of profits in the territories in which we after tax 45 67 112 operate, as well as the availability of tax incentives in some jurisdictions.

Cash tax differs first half, is described in Discontinued operations on page 36. from the charge to the income statement due to the utilisation of tax restructuring of businesses assets such as tax losses and other deductions allowed under local The restructuring charge of 44m including 6m related to tax laws, and payments of taxes sometimes falling outside the asset impairments on total operations principally arose as financial year to which they relate.
We anticipate cash tax to aconsequence of the disposal of Personal Care.
When we continue to be lower than the charge to the income statement announced the sale of Personal Care in July 2012, we stated forthe foreseeable future.
thatwe would need to carry out a restructuring programme to remove residual overheads and would incur some separation costs.
It isexpected that the cash costs will be in the region of 15m in 2012 and 2013.
35 other items discontinued operations Personal Care and Closures During the year the Group decided to market the Personal Care amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets Intangible assets, such as technology patents and customer business, including the High Barrier Food packaging business, for contracts, are required to be recognised on the acquisition of disposal.
The Personal Care business was therefore reclassified as businesses and amortised over their useful life.
The directors a discontinued operation and consequently its results are disclosed separately from those of the continuing operations.
The Group consider that separate disclosure, within exceptional and other items, of the amortisation of such acquired intangibles relating announced the sale of the Personal Care business in July 2012 and tototal operations amounting to 21m 2011: 26m aids it was completed in December 2012. comparison of organic change in underlying profit.
Personal Personal Care and operating derivatives fair value changes Care Closures Fair value changes on operating derivatives relate to changes in the 2012 2011 value of commodity hedges for the forward purchase of aluminium m m and resin and the fair value movements on non hedge accounted Sales: forward exchange contracts.
Accounting rules require that the Personal Care 448 502 effectiveness of our commodity hedges is tested at each reporting Closures 205 date.
Where a hedge is deemed to be effective the fair value change Total 448 707 is recorded in the relevant hedge reserve and where it is ineffective Underlying operating profit: or there is over hedging, the relevant proportion of the fair value is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement.
Personal Care 33 37 Closures 13 Effectiveness on our aluminium forward deals is calculated by Total 33 50 comparing the value of the forward deals to the value of our underlying hedged item: for Rexam this is principally aluminium Underlying profit before tax 32 49 coil.
Current accounting rules require that the ingot conversion cost Underlying profit after tax 17 27 of and metal premium on our aluminium coil be included when Exceptional and other items: calculating the effectiveness of our underlying hedged item, Impairment of goodwill 181 despite the fact that we only hedge the underlying LME portion Impairment of other assets 2 34 ofthe aluminium coils.
The effect of the movement in conversion costs against the movement in the aluminium price has resulted Amortisation of certain acquired inaluminium hedges failing the effectiveness test.
As aluminium intangibleassets 3 7 prices have increased, this has given rise to a gain of 11m 2011: Restructuring and other exceptional items 9 5 nil.
Revised accounting standards are being drafted which will Tax on exceptional and other items 3 15 address this particular anomaly but they are not currently expected Exceptional and other items after tax 192 31 to be implemented before 2015.
In addition, there was a loss of Profit on disposal: 4m 2011: nil relating to fair value changes on certain non Personal Care 125 hedge accounted forward foreign exchange contracts.
Closures 91 This accounting treatment can give rise to income statement Loss profit for the year after tax 50 87 volatility up to the date the hedge matures and management believe that it is more appropriate to exclude any such movements from underlying profit.
As the hedge matures, at which point the cost will be substantially passed onto our customers, any realised gain or loss on the hedge is reversed in full from fair value changes on operating derivatives and recognised within underlying profit.
fair value changes on financing derivatives The fair value of the derivatives arising on financing activities directly relates to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The fair value will change as the transactions to which they relate mature, as new derivatives are transacted and due to the passage of time.
The fair value change on financing derivatives forthe year was a net loss of 20m 2011: net gain 23m.
