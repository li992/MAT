Revenue stated after deducting inter-segmental consolidation adjustments of US$60.4 million 2010: US$27.8 million.
Revenues including sales tax benefit but before its subsequent reversal Group Essar Energy increased revenue before reversal of sales tax benefit by US$11.9 billion in the 15 month period ended 31March 2012, compared to the 12 month period to December 2010.
Of this amount, US$6.4 billion reected the acquisition of the Stanlow renery and US$5.5 billion was the increase in revenue attributable to the Vadinar renery before the reversal of the sales tax benefit.
Revenues Power Power revenues increased in 201112 by US$34.7 million to US$356.5 million from US$321.8 million in 2010 after eliminating inter-segmental revenues for the current period of US$60.4 million 2010: US$27.8 million.
On a 12 month pro rata basis revenue has decreased, due to lower UI in Bhander Power US$23.5 million compared to 2010 and adverse foreign exchange differences US$12.9 million.

PLF & Availability not considered, as plant under trial run.
4 In VPCL Base Plant and Ph1, method of computing equivalent units of Power and PLF have been revised.
Previous period gures CY2010 have been revised accordingly.
5 Salaya I generation under trial run.
Operationally, all plants performed well in 201112, with the key measure of plant availability between 93% and 99%.
Given the issues of high gas prices and low gas availability from Indias KG-D6 eld, overall generation from Essars portfolio in the 15 month period was 7,907 MU.
This compares with 6,624 MU generated in the 12 months of 2010.
The pro rata reduction in generation was primarily due to lower demand for power from the Bhander and Hazira I gas-red stations in Gujarat due to higher gas prices and import through UI, against export in the previous period.
The smaller 85 MW gas-red plant at Algoma, Canada, providing power for Essar Steels plant, again performed well with generation for the 15 month period at 671 MWh.
Revenues Exploration and Production Revenues were primarily impacted by lower production from the CB-ON 3 eld in Gujarat which led to decreased sales of 8,696 barrels in the 15 months of 201112 from 9,616 barrels in 2010, due to delays in receiving replacement sub-surface pumps.
Revenues including sales tax benefit but before its subsequent reversal Rening and Marketing India Rening and Marketing India revenues including sales tax benefit but before its subsequent reversal increased by US$5,564 million from US$9,681 million in 2010 to US$15,245 million in the 15 months to March 2012.
This was primarily as a result of an increase in the quantity of the products sold and higher product prices partly offset by decreased sales of traded products.
In more detail: t US$3,936 million increase due to increases in the selling price of renery products.
The average selling price of renery products was US$891 MT during the 15 month to March 2012 as against US$647 MT in 2010 t US$1,483 million increase in sales quantity of renery products.
During the 15 month period ended March 2012 including the 35 day scheduled shutdown, 16,113 KT of petroleum product was sold, again 13,819 KT in 2010 t US$46 million increase in sales tax benefit mainly due to an increase in selling prices and the higher quantity of products sold as compared to the comparative period t Increase of US$143 million in traded crude oil sales t US$151 million decrease in traded products sales t Increase in Duty Draw Back Income of US$8 million t Decrease in Hedging Loss by US$13 million Revenues Rening and Marketing UK Stanlow renery has contributed sales of US$6.4 billion in the first eight months of ownership to March 2012.
Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012 40 Business review Financial review Rening and Marketing operational information Throughput and production from the Companys rening assets compared to the prior period is as follows: Throughput mmt Production mmt 15 months 12 months 15 months 12 months ended ended ended ended 31 March 31 December 31 March 31 December Operational Assets 2012 2010 2012 2010 Vadinar 17.1 14.7 16.3 13.9 Stanlow 6.8 6.3 Mombasa 2.0 1.6 1.9 1.5 The significant change in the period was the acquisition of the Stanlow renery in August and the planned 35 day shut down at the Vadinar renery.
EBITDA Operational EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and any non-operational items.
Non-operational items include the reversal of the sales tax benefit, the bargain purchase on acquiring the Stanlow renery, the gain on settlement liabilities and in addition, in 2010, the foreign exchange gain on conversion of the IPO proceeds in to US dollars and the profit on available for sale investments.
Adjusted EBITDA removes the other foreign exchange impact see page 42 and the deferred sales tax benefit recognised in the period before its subsequent reversal.
The Groups Operational EBITDA before adjustment for loss of sales tax benefit decreased by US$22.7 million, or 3.17%, inthe 15 months ended March 2012 compared to the 12 months ended December 2010.
Operational EBITDA Power Powers operational EBITDA in the 15 months to March 2012 was higher by US$9.0 million at US$222.5 million than the US$213.5 million in the 12 months of 2010.
Pro rata, this represented a decrease of 17%.
This reduction in pro rata operational EBITDA was largely driven by the significant Rupee depreciation during the period which created foreign exchange losses of US$43.8 million 2010: gain US$16.7 million on borrowings and trade payable in foreign currencies.
Operational EBITDA Rening and Marketing India R&M India operational EBITDA increased to US$522.1 million during the 15 month period ended March 2012 from US$514.7 million in the 12 months to December 2010.
Operational EBITDA increased due to increase in GRMs of US$299.5 million, increased sales tax incentive of US$46.8 million which were offset by higher operating costs of US$36.8 million and foreign exchange losses of US$259.9 million 2010: gain U$33.6 million.
Operational EBITDA Rening and Marketing UK The renerys performance in its first period end of operation was an operational EBITDA loss of US$30.2 million.
The results were primarily impacted by a reduced Northern European rening margin index which limited the Stanlow GRM to US$3.06 bbl.
This downward revision on the index has impacted the region as a whole.

Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012 42 Business review Financial review Net finance costs excluding exceptional items 15 months 12 months ended ended 31 March 31 December US$ million 2012 2010 Total finance costs excluding exceptional items 889.2 471.7 Less: borrowing costs capitalised 399.8 154.6 Unwinding of discount 32.5 19.5 Finance cost charged to the income statement excluding exceptional items 521.9 336.6 Total finance income 146.7 64.2 Less: interest income capitalised 8.7 15.0 Finance income recognised in the income statement 138.0 49.2 Net finance costs excluding exceptional items 383.9 287.4 The total finance cost has increased by US$417.5 million primarily due to increases in loans taken for power projects, expansion of the Vadinar renery, convertible bonds and the bridge loan.
Net finance costs increased due to the increased interest cost of loans mentioned above offset by an increase in interest income from the short-term deployment of surplus funds of US$82.5 million together with an increase in interest capitalised of US$245.2 million in respect of costs directly attributed to assets under construction.
The adjustment within finance costs for the loss of sales tax benefit amounts to US$58.6 million and reects the unwinding of the discount on the liability to the State of Gujarat and the additional interest provided of US$321.5 million on the lapse of a prepayment option relating to a facility that was part of the MRA loan.
Foreign exchange impact The total foreign exchange impact for the 15 months to 31 March 2012 was US$316.9 million, excluding a non-operational gain of US$1.7 million 2010: US$41.3 million, due to the depreciation of the Rupee against the US dollar.
A certain portion of the foreign exchange impact amounting to US$73.7 million is offset in the pricing of products in our Renery and Marketing businesses.
The other foreign exchange impact items amounting to US$243.2 million relate to the revaluation of assets and liabilities at the end of the period, the foreign exchange impact on project finance transactions and the cost of foreign exchange hedging.
The tax income of US$383.4 million in March 2012 December 2010: tax charge of US$117.2 million comprises current tax of US$38.1 million December 2010: US$30.6 million and a deferred tax income of US$421.5 million December 2010: deferred tax expense of US$86.6 million.
The current tax charge has increased due to an increase in profits which are subject to corporate income tax or MAT as appropriate.
The majority of profits derived from operations in India are subject to MAT.
MAT is charged on book profits in India at a rate of 20.01%, but is available as a credit against corporate income tax in the following 10 years.
In addition a deferred tax asset was created at 24% on the losses incurred by Essar Oil UK.
The adjustment within taxation for the loss of sales tax benefit reects a deferred tax asset amounting to US$309.9 million based on the India Corporate tax rate has been recognised on the consequential losses of the sales tax benefit to be set off against future profits and US$104.3 million of additional interest recognised due to the expiry of a prepayment option in April 2012 of a facility that was part of the MRA loan.
Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012 COMPAN Y BUSINESS FINANCIA L OVERVIEW REVIEW GOVERNAN C E STATEMENT S 43 Other non-operational gains and losses Other gains and losses include non-operational gains that have decreased by US$40.1 million to US$20.9 million for the 15month period to 31 March 2012 compared to US$61.0 million in 2010.
The decrease is largely due to the one-off gain in 2010 of US$41.0 million from conversion of the IPO proceeds into US dollars partially offset by a gain on the acquisition of the Stanlow renery in the 15 month period to 31 March 2012 of US$18.9 million.
Exceptional items During the 15 month period there were two non-recurring items of such signicance that they have been disclosed separately on the face of the profit and loss account.
The first item concerns the eligibility of the Groups subsidiary Essar Oil to participate in the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme the Scheme where on 17 January 2012, the Honourable Supreme Court of India set aside the previous judgment of the High Court of Gujarat and ruled that the Group could not participate in the Scheme.
The Group continued to apply the accounting policy in respect of the Sales Tax benefit up to 31 December 2011 as the revenue was earned.
The result of the Honourable Supreme Court judgment on 17 January meant the entire amount previously recognised to 17 January 2012 was adjusted in the current period.
The second item is an additional non-cash interest charge due to the lapse of a prepayment option relating to a facility that is partof Essar Oils MRA loans.
Essar Oil is in the process of replacing the current MRA loans with a new loan facility the CDR exit.
The new facility is in the final stages of documentation and we expect final approval for the CDR exit shortly.
As a result of the current stage of replacing the MRA loans, Essar Oil did not exercise a prepayment option on one of the MRA facilities which was available up until 24 April 2012.
Previously, the assumption had been that Essar Oil would exercise this pre-payment option.
However, as the new facility has not yet been signed, under IFRS the accounting treatment reects the current MRA terms, which means a revaluation of the loans excluding the prepayment option.
The impact, net of deferred tax, is US$217 million which is an accounting provision and has no immediate cash ow impact.
We expect this provision to be partially reversed oncethe new facility is nalised.
The impact of both these exceptional items on the 15 months to 31 March 2012 is as follows: Interest on Loss of lapse of 15 months ended 31 March 2012 Sales Tax prepayment US$ million benefit option Total Adjustment to Revenue 1,053.7 1,053.7 Adjustment to General and administration expenses 39.9 39.9 Impact on EBIDTA 1,013.8 1,013.8 Adjustment to Finance costs additional interest charge 58.6 321.5 262.9 Impact on profit before tax 955.2 321.5 1,276.7 Adjustment to tax 309.9 104.3 414.2 Impact on profit after tax 645.3 217.2 862.5 Loss after tax Loss after tax is US$764.3 million compared to profit after tax of US$248.3 million in 2010 resulted in a decrease of US$1,012.6 million.
This is after providing for exceptional items of US$862.5 million as explained in exceptional items above and the balance of US$150.1 million was as a result of the operations as discussed above.
Operational earnings per share of 3.2 US cents in 201112 is down from 17.1 US cents per share in 2010 as a result of the reduced profit after tax.
Basic earnings per share shows a loss of 53.0 US cents reecting the impact of the exceptional items discussed above and in further detail in Note 11.

In the Power segment, operational assets increased mainly due to the commissioning of Vadinar P1 with the transfer of the related assets from assets under construction to operational offset by exchange rate variations.
The operational assets in R&M India increased mainly due to commissioning of the Vadinar renery phase 1 project.
The 14% depreciation of the Rupee from December 2010 caused a reduction in property, plant and equipment of US$505.4 million, US$26.9 million and US$623.0 million in the Power, Exploration and Production and Renery and Marketing India segments respectively.
Debt As at As at 31 March 31 December US$ million unless specified 2012 2010 Rupee debt Rs.
The increase in borrowings is in line with funding requirements in respect of expansion projects in Power, Exploration and Production and Renery and Marketing India segment and a US$321.5 million impact from exceptional items.
The 14% depreciation of the Rupee from December 2010 caused a reduction in loans of US$641.9 million compared with the exchange rate at 31 December 2010.
Other non-current assets Other non-current assets have decreased by US$25.8 million over December 2010 primarily as a result of reclassication ofreceivable of sales tax assignment liability paid to current assets and reduction in prepayment of arrangement fees on unutilised debt facilities partly offset by deferred tax assets created on business losses.
Current assets Current assets have increased by US$3,168.9 million to US$6,532.5 million over December 2010 primarily as a result of thefollowing: t Current assets of the Stanlow renery US$2,321 million t US$405 million reclassication from non-current assets to current assets of the sales tax assignment liability which is partlyset off by a reduction of US$46 million in the sales tax liability already paid included within non-current assets t An increase in export debtors of US$164 million made over the period end which was partly offset by a decrease in domestic debtors of US$11 million t An increase of US$35 million in inventory as result of coal inventory for power plant Current liabilities Current liabilities increased by 174% to US$7,603.5 million from 31 December 2010, primarily due to: t Current liabilities of the Stanlow renery of US$2,221.3 million including deferred consideration for the Stanlow renery t Deferred sales tax liability of US$1,206 million t An increase in crude oil liabilities up by US$900 million t A loan of US$450 million to acquire Stanlow renery t Increase in short-term working capital loan US$235.8 million Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities have increased by US$1,097.5 million, representing a 22% increase, from 31 December 2010 primarily due to the following: t US$224.0 million decrease on the discounted sales tax liability following reclassication to current liability t US$2,064 million increase in long-term borrowings which include a convertible bond of US$550 million and a US$450 million secured and guaranteed term loan as noted in the capital and liquidity section t Decrease by US$160 million in deferred tax liabilities driven primarily by the impact of property, plant and equipment as well as unabsorbed depreciation, business losses and recognition of MAT credit Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012 46 Business review Financial review Cash ows 15 months 12 months ended ended 31 March 31 December US$ million 2012 2010 Net cash generated from operating activities A 1,116.3 261.8 Acquisition of subsidiary, including cost of acquisition 1,024.0 31.2 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 2,268.2 2,556.2 Other investments 29.2 24.6 Net cash used in investing activities B 3,321.4 2,612.0 Interest paid C 622.7 309.1 Free cash ow excluding bank deposits A B C 2,827.8 3,182.9 Proceeds from issuance of share capital 2,442.5 Total cash change before net borrowings 2,827.8 740.4 Cash ow from nancing activities other than interest paid 2,956.7 1,194.2 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 128.9 453.8 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 674.0 563.7 Bank deposits at end of period 464.7 529.4 Cash, cash equivalents and bank deposits at end of period 1,138.7 1,093.1 Restricted cash and amounts earmarked for trade payables 702.1 618.6 Net cash, cash equivalents and bank deposits 436.6 474.5 Net cash used in investing activities has increased by US$709.4 million from US$2,612.0 million in 2010.
The increase is mainly due to investment of US$1,024.0 million in the Stanlow renery and the lower expenditure is as a result of certain projects nearing completion.
At the 31 March 2012 there was net cash, cash equivalents and bank deposits amounting to US$436.6 million 2010 US$474.5 million which will be used by the business in funding future growth.
Capital and liquidity During 2011, the Company issued a convertible bond which raised US$550 million before transaction costs to pursue current and further investments.
On 1 July 2011, Essar Energy entered into a US$450 million secured and guaranteed term loan.
Essar Energy utilised this loanto enable Essar Oil UK to finance the Stanlow acquisition and may also utilise the loan, amongst other things, for general corporate purposes.
This loan was renanced on 14 May 2012 with a new US$300 million three year secured loan facility and US$150 million of internal cash resources.
Separately, Essar Energy also signed on the same date a US$250 million 3.5 year subordinated unsecured loan facility with Essar Global for general corporate purposes.
A US$1.5 billion working capital revolving credit facility was executed on 1 July 2011 to finance the inventory and operating requirements of the Stanlow renery.
Despite volatile market conditions, syndication of US$750 million was completed with seven new lenders added to the original six underwriting banks.
Essar Oil has submitted a proposal to exit the current MRA loan facility of US$1.7 billion by a fresh loan facility with standard terms and conditions.
Essar Oil is currently at the final stages of negotiation to exit the existing MRA loan facility, final approval for which is expected shortly.
Essar Oil is also in the advanced stages of arranging a new c. US$1 billion Rs.
50 billion bank term loan facility.
This facility is being put in place as a contingency measure for in the event that Essar Oil is required to pay its deferred sales tax liability to the Government of Gujarat.
Essar Energy had underlying gross debt of US$6,710 million, net debt underlying of US$6,273 million and gearing of 63.2% as of 31 March 2012.
At 31 December 2010, Essar Energy had gross debt of US$4,040 million, net debt underlying of US$3,565 million and gearing of 43.4%.
The gross and net debt increased largely as a result of the Companys continued capital expenditure programme in the Power, Exploration and Production and Rening and Marketing India businesses and following the acquisition of the Stanlow renery.
It is anticipated that the Groups debt will continue to increase as projects are funded with peak debt forecast to occur in FY 2013.
Any surplus funds are invested in highly rated liquid securities, bank deposits, a trade advance and short-term recoverable advance in line with the Groups financial and risk policy.
The Group continues to be able to borrow at competitive rates for working capital and expansion projects.
Essar Energy plc Annual Report and accounts 2012 COMPAN Y BUSINESS FINANCIA L OVERVIEW REVIEW GOVERNAN C E STATEMENT S 47 Going concern The Group has prepared detailed annual business plans for the year to June 2013 based on the annual business plans for the 2013 financial year.
These business plans were used as the basis for assessing the Groups cash headroom and compliance with banking covenants.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible charges in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within its current available funding and anticipated roll-over of facilities which mature in the ordinary course of business together with other facilities which have been agreed with the relevant banks but await final documentation.
As set out in Note 8, on 17 January 2012, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Group was not entitled to participate in the Sales Tax Incentive Scheme the Scheme, and on 24 January the Government of Gujarat served notice on the Group requiring it to pay the outstanding sales tax liability of US$1,186.9 million plus associated interest.
The Group has now led a writ petition with the High Court of Gujarat to waive or reduce the interest owed, and to defer the payment of sales tax over a number of years as may be permitted under the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act 2003.
The High Court of Gujarat has admitted the writ petition and asked the Government of Gujarat to consider this application.
In view of the matter being sub judice, the timing of payment of the sales tax liability and related interest, if any, is not denitive and will not be known until determined by the current legal process.
In view of this and based on legal advice, the interest on the Sales Tax liability has been treated as a contingency as set out in Note 29.
The Group plans to fund any repayment of the sales tax liability through a combination of internal funding and through obtaining a new loan facility.
The Group is currently in advanced stages of establishing credit facilities of c. US$1 billion with its lenders to ensure that the Group has adequate funds available to meet any liabilities due to the State of Gujarat as and when the decision of the Government of Gujarat the High Court is established.
Although the facility is expected to be committed shortly, the process is ongoing.
For this reason the Directors are required to conclude that these circumstances represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Groups and Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Although there is no denitive sales tax liability payment schedule at this time, the Board is confident of arranging the facility well ahead of any payments falling due, resulting from the pending legal process.
In addition, if the Government of Gujarat permits payment of the liability in instalments as requested then the facility may not be fully drawn down with the liability partly met through the Groups internal resources.
The Directors have examined all available evidence and have concluded that although there is a risk that they will not be able to secure agreement with the lenders outlined above, in light of the supportive nature of the relationship held with the lenders and the advanced stage the Group is in establishing the facility, the Directors are satisfied that adequate financial resources will continue to be made available to the Group and the Company so as to enable it to continue to trade on a going concern basis.
As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis inpreparing the Group and Companys financial statements.
