Todays gas detection market demands personal monitors that are informative and easy to use.
Customer research prompted two key technical innovations in our new Gas-Pro confined space entry monitor which give the user increased confidence that their environment is a safe place to work.
Crowcon Detection Instruments Innovation in action The new Gas-Pro personal gas detector is routinely used to check that a confined space is safe to enter and work in.
An innovative pre-entry check function guides users through the process and logs data that shows safe pre-entry compliance or unsafe gas levels.
Another new feature, a traffic light status indicator, tells the user at a glance whether their monitor is providing complete protection or needs calibration.
