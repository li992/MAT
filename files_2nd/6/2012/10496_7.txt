This highlights the importance of the Groups efforts to increase both energy efficiency and energy self-sufficiency.
Mondis well established and relentless pursuit of cost savings initiatives bore significant benefits across the value chain.
These initiatives enabled the Group to realise significant savings on input costs and fixed cost increases were kept well within inflation.
Currencies The weaker South African rand and a stronger Polish zloty and US dollar against the euro provided a net positive impact to the Group.
Positive translational and transaction gains were realised in Packaging Paper, Fibre Packaging and the South Africa Division.
Exchange rate volatility was more muted during the year with most currencies trading within a relatively narrow range against the euro.
Tax The Groups strategy is to achieve a sustainable and competitive tax rate reflecting the current tax composition of the Group, whilst acting in a transparent and professional manner.
The effective tax rate before special items was 20% consistent with that of 2011.
The low tax rate continues to be a result of profitability in regions with lower statutory tax rates and the benefits of tax incentives granted in certain countries in which the Group operates, notably those related to the major Polish and Russian projects.

indd 25 2013 03 04 2:59 PM Chief financial officers review continued Non-controlling interests Earnings attributable to holders of non-controlling interests declined significantly from E70 million in the prior year to E35 million, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the non-controlling interest in Mondi Swiecie in the second quarter of 2012.
Cash flow Despite the challenging economic environment, EBITDA from continuing operations of E923 million was only 4% lower than in 2011.
The strong cash generation reflects the contribution in the fourth quarter from the acquisition of Nordenia and the successful profit improvement and cost containment initiatives throughout the Group.
Mondi generated E845 million of cash from operations 2011: E917 million after taking into account a net increase in working capital of E80 million.
The increase in working capital includes the settlement of a number of short-term obligations recognised as part of the acquisition of Nordenia as well as the cancellation of the factoring arrangements that were in place prior to the acquisition.
The strong cash flow generation, supplemented by additional borrowings raised during the year, were applied to fund the Groups capital expenditure of E298 million, its strategic acquisitions and distributions to shareholders.
Capital investment programme Capital expenditure of E298 million was E35 million higher than the prior year.
The capital expenditure to depreciation ratio was 86% including expenditure on a number of the Groups strategic energy projects.
In early 2012, Mondi announced that it had approved various energy related investments totalling approximately E140 million.
The benefits of these investments, mainly in the form of reduced energy costs, improved efficiencies and energy self-sufficiency are expected to be realised from the end of 2013 as these projects reach completion.

Ongoing initiatives by management in implementing profit improvement initiatives which include operation optimisation, cost-cutting, and restructuring and rationalisation activities have consolidated the Groups leading cost position in its chosen markets.
Working capital levels and capital expenditure programmes are strictly monitored and controlled.
The Group meets its funding requirements from a variety of sources as more fully described in note 21 of the annual financial statements.
The availability of some of these facilities is dependent on the Group meeting certain financial covenants all of which have been complied with.
Mondi had E762 million of undrawn committed debt facilities as at 31 December 2012 which should provide sufficient liquidity in the medium term.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, including an assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, particularly in Europe, indicate that the Group should be able to operate well within the level of its current facilities and related covenants.
The directors have reviewed the overall Group strategy, the budget for 2013 and subsequent years, considered the assumptions contained in the budget and reviewed the critical risks which may impact the Groups performance.
After making such enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the integrated report and financial statements.
