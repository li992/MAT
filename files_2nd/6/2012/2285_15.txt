There have been no other post balance sheet events.
Going concern In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report, the Directors have considered the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position.
This includes an overview of the Groups financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a combination of committed and uncommitted facilities and overdrafts.
The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities are repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due for renewal as set out below.
There is sufficient headroom in the committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities can be operated as contracted for the foreseeable future.
