Financial review Business review Financial review Prudential plc Annual Report 2012 47 Basis of preparation Results bases The IFRS basis results have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies discussed in notes A2 to A4 of the IFRS fi financial statements.
Life insurance products are, by their nature, long-term and the profi t on this business is generated over a signifi cant number of years.
Accounting under IFRS alone does not, in Prudentials opinion, fully refl ect the value of future profi t streams.
Prudential considers that embedded value reporting provides investors with a measure of the future profi t streams of the Groups in-force long-term businesses and is a valuable supplement to statutory accounts.
The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the EEV principles discussed in note 1 of EEV basis supplementary information.
Operating profi t based on longer-term investment returns The Group provides supplementary analysis of profi t before tax attributable to shareholders so as to distinguish operating profi t based on longer-term investment returns from the other elements of total profi t shown.
Operating profi t per share is calculated using operating profi ts based on longer-term investment returns, aft er related tax and non-controlling interests.
Exchange translation Actual Exchange Rate AER and Constant Exchange Rate CER The comparative results have been prepared using previously reported exchange rates AER basis except where otherwise stated.
