Strategy, risks and corporate social responsibility Details of the companys strategy are included in the Chief Executives review on page 3.
An analysis of risks facing the company is set out on page 12.
The companys approach to corporate social responsibility is set out in a separate statement on page 14.
Economic climate The companys bill and general payments service, which accounts for 40% 2011: 41% of our net revenue, has continued to be resilient, as consumers discretion in expenditure is limited for essential services and our service continues to be popular.
Utility providers continue to install new prepay gas and electricity meters, which will have a beneficial impact on our transaction volumes.
The internet payment market continues to grow substantially.
There has been an adverse impact on our mobile top-ups as mobile operators continue to offer more airtime at lower cost and to promote prepay less than contract.
PayByPhone is able to offer parking authorities a more cost-effective collection system for parking compared to pay and display machines.
This has led to an increase in the number of tenders being issued as parking authorities try to reduce their costs.
PayPoints exposure to retail agent debt is limited as credit granted to retail agents is restricted by daily direct debiting for all UK and Irish transactions, other than EPoS mobile top-ups which are collected weekly.
There is some concentration of risk in multiple retail agents.
Most of PayPoints clients in the UK, other than for top-ups, bear the cost of retail agent bad debt.
In PayPoint Romania, the risk of bad debt lies with the company.
net, exposure is limited to receivables from merchants for fees, except in the case of bureau internet merchants, where PayPoint.
net retains credit risk on merchant default for credit card charge backs, a risk mitigated in part by cash retention.
In PayByPhone, exposure is limited to receivables from parking authorities.
