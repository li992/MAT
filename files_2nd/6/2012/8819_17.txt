Pensions In May 2006 the main UK pension scheme changed from a final pensionable salary scheme to an average salary scheme.
Benefits accrued to current active members prior to 1 May 2006 are linked to future price inflation rather than future salary increases.
Following a consultation period with current active members in early 2010 future accrual is also now capped at 1% perannum.

During 2012 the Group contributed cash of 9.8m 2011: 8.7m to the Fund.
Following the full actuarial valuation carried out as at 31 March 2012, the Company agreed with the Trustees of the Fund to contribute an additional annual cash contribution of 11m plus RPI, which will commence on 1April2013.
IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits will become effective for the Group in its 2013 accounts.
Under IAS 19R the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation, and the expected rate of return on plan assets will be replaced with a net interest charge that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.
The impact on the results for the year ended 31 December 2013 will be to increase net operating costs by 1m and to increase pension related finance charges by 1.3m.
In addition, amortisation for benefits that do notvest immediately is eliminated resulting in an increase to net operating costs of 1m.
The deficit at31 December 2012 would reduce by 5.6m.
John Menzies plc Annual Report 2012 21 Operating Review: Group Financial Review continued Non-underlying Performance The results for the year include the following one-off and or material items, which the Group considers should be highlighted to provide a better understanding of the Accounts: i Costs of rationalising excess capacity comprised asset write-downs and staff redundancy in Distribution 4.1m 2011: 2.5m andin Aviation 6.6m 2011: 1.7m.
ii A provision of 7.7m for future lease obligations in UK and US Cargo atAviation.
Under IFRS, previously capitalised goodwill is no longer amortised.
However, these results include animpairment charge of 1.8m, reflectingthe remaining life of the current licence at Menzies Macau AviationServices Ltd. IFRS requires the price paid for a business to be allocated between goodwilland other intangible assets.
The other intangible assets capitalised are amortised and this amortisation charge of 4.6m 2011: 3.9m has been highlighted to present a clearer trading position.
Further details are disclosed in Note 5 to the Accounts.
Interest The net underlying interest charge is analysed as follows: 2012 2011 m m Fixed rate sterling term loan 1.3 1.5 Fixed rate sterling loan 0.4 1.6 Floating rate sterling term loan 1.7 0.6 Preference shares 0.1 0.1 Cash overdrafts 0.3 1.1 Other finance charge income 0.9 1.4 Net underlying interest charge 4.7 3.5 The sterling term loan is at a fixed rate of 6.23% and is repayable between 2013 and 2020.
During 2009 the Group hedged the exposure to interest rate rises by entering into 75m of interest rate swap agreements, whereby the Group paid a fixed rate of interest and received a variable rate of LIBOR margin on the notional amount.
50m of these interest rate swaps matured in 2011 and the remaining 25m matured in June 2012.
Other finance charge income is the net financial charge income from the pension scheme under IAS 19.
John Menzies plc Annual Report 2012 22 Taxation The tax rate on underlying profits for the year was 24.5%, compared with 23.4% in 2011 and is analysed as: % Tax due at UK rate 24.5 Non-tax deductible items 0.2 Unrelieved overseas losses 1.7 Utilisation of tax losses 0.3 Lower rate of tax on overseas earnings 0.3 Write-off of deferred tax asset 0.5 Deferred tax rate change 0.8 Prior year adjustment 1.0 Underlying tax rate 24.5 Tax paid during the year was 9.5m.
Underlying tax rate The tax effect of the exceptional items, described in Note 5 on the accounts, is a net credit of 2.3m.
The UK Government has announced that the main rate of UK corporation 24.5% tax will be reduced from the current rate of 24%, which has applied from 1 April 2012, to 21%, by means of a series of annual reductions.
The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% from 1 April 2013 was enacted on 17 July 2012.
As this rate was enacted at the balance sheet date, and reduces the tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences reverse, it had the effect of reducing the UK deferred tax asset.
However, as most of that deferred tax asset relates to the UK pension deficit the majority of the reduction was debited to other comprehensive income and did not have a material effect on the effective tax rate or on profit.
It is expected that this treatment will also apply in relation to the further rate reductions announced by the Government.
Those further rate reductions are to be incorporated within future legislative acts and so will not be substantively enacted until later periods.
The estimated effect of the further reductions in the rate to 21% by 2014 would be to decrease the net UK deferred tax asset by 1m.
Property, Plant and Equipment Purchases of property, plant and equipment totalled: Plant & Property Equipment Total m m m Distribution 0.1 3.3 3.4 Aviation 0.8 12.5 13.3 0.9 15.8 16.7 Aviations capital expenditure mainly comprised equipment to service ground handling contracts.

Capitalised goodwill amounts to 50.6m compared to 54.4m in 2011.
Thisgoodwill is no longer amortised but rather is subject to an annual impairment review.
Amortisation periods for contracts are business-stream dependent and varyfrom zero to 10 years.
Where the contracts are not amortised, they aresubject to an annual impairment test at cash-generating unit level.
Other Investments This includes cash invested in joint ventures and associates.

John Menzies plc Annual Report 2012 24 Going Concern At 31 December 2012 the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 185.4m, with an expiry profile of: 50m January 2013 70m May 2014 25m June 2014 20m September 2017 20.4m March 2020 The 50m facility expiring in January 2013 was successfully refinanced withthe same lender in January with a new 55m 3 year facility expiring inJanuary 2016.
Under the terms of these facilities, the financial covenants are tested semi-annually.
The Group has complied fully with the financial covenant tests.
The Group updates trading forecasts covering a forward 15 month period ona regular basis, which together with the supporting assumptions are reviewed by the Board.
The current forecast shows that the Group is able tooperate within both its committed banking facilities and related financial covenants during this period and the Directors believe that the assumptions underpinning this forecast are both prudent and reasonable.
The Directors therefore believe, on the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Outlook Menzies Aviation is trading in line with expectations with good visibility on summer schedules across the network.
The closure of the Chicago cargo operations are on track and global relationships with affected airlines have been maintained.
Contract wins are most prevalent in the first half and the year has started well with a number of new contracts gained across the network.
Trading at Menzies Distribution in itscore business has continued to be challenging with weekly magazines in particular continuing to underperform.
However, the Orbital Marketing Services business acquired in November 2012 is performing well with integration plans and synergy benefits on track.
In addition, contract negotiations with a number of publishers continue and it is expected a number of these will be concluded during the year.
Overall, the challenging trading climate continues but prospects forthe Group remain strong and theBoard are confident of delivering further growth during 2013.
