The difference in growth rates between Group turnover and net fees was primarily driven by a change in mix between the temporary and permanent businesses.
Exchange rate movements had a positive impact on the results overall increasing net fees and operating profit by 7.1 million and 3.4 million respectively, as depreciation in the rate of exchange ofthe Euro was more than offset by favourable movements in other Group currencies, particularly the Australian Dollar.
Fluctuations in exchange rates remain a significant sensitivity for the Group.
1 The Groups operating cost base increased by 8% versus prior year.
This was principally due to the fact that, whilst the Groups consultant headcount increased 1% year-on-year at the end of June, it was 9% higher, on average, throughout the year.
The other primary driver of the increase was a rise in commission payments in line with net fees.
The Groups conversion rate, 2 which is the proportion of net fees converted into operating profit, increased to 17.5% from 17.0% in the prior year.
This was driven by net fee growth and strong control of the Groups operating cost base.

The full year increase was driven by an 11% rise in the number of consultants in the International business, where we continue to invest in order to ensure the Group capitalises onthe more buoyant markets and on the clear structural growth opportunities that exist across many of our International markets.
This was principally offset by a 10% reduction in consultant headcount in the UK, which was largely as a result of natural attrition, as we reacted to changes in market conditions to defend the financial performance of the business.

The average fee per placement increased by 6%, driven primarily by the mix of business, as more of our permanent fees were generated by the International business where the average salary of candidates placed is higher.

The charge for the Pension Protection Fund levy 7 was 0.9 million 2011: 0.3 million.
It is expected that the net finance charge for the year ending 30 June 2013 will be around 10 million due to the IAS 19 pension charge and an expected increase due to early refinancing of the revolving credit facility.

This was higher than the cash flow conversion in the prior year 2011: 85% primarily as a result of stronger working capital management, with trade debtor 2008 101% days decreased to 35 days 2011: 38 days.
Overall, cash inflow from working capital was 3 3.2 million and net cash generated by operations was 162.2 million 2011: 97.3 million.

33 directors report business review rEtIrEmEnt bEnEfIts dIvIdEnd pEr sharE pEncE The Groups pension liability under IAS 19 at 30 June 2012 of 15.4 million 10.4 million netof deferred tax increased by 3.5 million compared to 30 June 2011, primarily due to the net effect of a decrease in the net yield discount rate versus RPI inflation rate being partially offset by higher than expected asset returns and employer contributions.
2012 2.50 During the year, the Company contributed 15.5 million of cash to the defined benefit scheme 2011: 16.5 million, which included 12.4 million funding towards the pension deficit in line 2011 5.80 with previous guidance.
capItal structurE and dIvIdEnd 2010 5.80 The Boards priorities for our free cash flow are to fund the Groups investment and development, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver a sustainable dividend at a level 2009 5.80 that is affordable and appropriate.
As we set out in our Half Year Results statement, the increased global economic uncertainty, 2008 5.80 which impacted our business in the year, slowed the pace of the Groups profit growth.
At the end of the first half, considering this slowing of profit growth and our view on the likely growth in Group profitability in the second half, the Board decided that, whilst the previous level of dividend remained affordable, it was no longer appropriate to maintain the nEt dEbt cash m dividend at that level, which had been uncovered for the last two years.
The Board therefore decided to rebase the dividend and paid an interim dividend of 0.83 pence per share 2011: 1.85 pence.
2012 132.9 In line with this policy, the Board proposes to pay a final dividend of 1.67 pence per share 2011: 3.95 pence, resulting in a total dividend for the full year of 2.50 pence per share 2011: 5.80 pence.
2011 134.8 2 We believe that dividends should be covered by earnings in the range 2.0x to 3.0x and consider this payout policy to be appropriately covered by earnings and cash flow.
2010 77.2 The Board remains committed to paying a sustainable and progressive dividend.
It is our 2 intention to grow the dividend when dividend cover sustainably reaches circa 2.5x.
2009 0.7 The recommended dividend payment date will be 16 November 2012 and, if approved, will be paid to shareholders who are on the register at the close of business on 12 October 2012.
2008 81.1 trEasury managEmEnt The Groups operations are financed by retained earnings and bank borrowings.
The Group has an unsecured 300 million revolving credit facility, in place until January 2014, and uses this facility to manage its day-to-day working capital requirements as appropriate.
We have begun refinancing discussions with our banking group, which are progressing well.
All borrowings are raised by the Groups UK-based Treasury department, which manages the Groups treasury risk in accordance with policies set by the Board.
The Groups treasury department does not engage in speculative transactions and does not operate as a profit centre.
The Board considers it appropriate to use certain derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate movements under its floating rate revolving credit facility.
The Group holds six interest rate swaps which exchange a fixed payment for floating rate receipt on a total debt value of 40 million with an equal mix of two-year and three-year maturities, which commenced in October 2011.
The Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Counterparty risk primarily arises from investment of any surplus funds.
The Group restricts transactions to banks and money market funds that have an acceptable credit rating and limits exposure to each institution.
