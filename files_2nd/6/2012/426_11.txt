The policy of the Group is to protect its minimum cash ow requirement in a period of a sustained downturn in oil prices.
As such the minimum amount of our working interest we would seek to protect with these arrangements is between 20-30% of estimated production for a rolling period of 18 to 24 months forward.
Based on our current outlook, the hedges above cover approximately 30% of production for 2013 and the first half of 2014.
