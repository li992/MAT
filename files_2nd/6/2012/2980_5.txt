8 Operational and financial review Our focus is to deliver long-term sustainable growth I am excited to have joined Carpetright as its Chief Executive.
Whilst it has been seven years since I was previously in an executive role here, Carpetright is a business I know well.
Notwithstanding the on-going challenges of the difficult consumer environment, I have been encouraged by what I have seen so far in the six weeks since becoming Chief Executive.
The Group remains in a commanding position in its markets, with a number one position in floor coverings and a fast growing bed business in the UK: a strong presence in the Netherlands and Belgium: and a recovering business in Ireland.
Carpetright is also a business that is focused and tightly managed which provides a firm basis for recovery.
Critically, it has over 3,000 great people across its operations committed to customers and improving the performance of the Group.
Together, this makes a solid platform from which to build and I look forward to working with Lord Harris and the team in the future development of the business.
