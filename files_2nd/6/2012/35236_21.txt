FINANCE REVIEW Damian Wisniewski In 2012, EPRA net asset value per share Finance Director increased by 10.9%, EPRA profit before tax rose slightly despite the increase in development activity and all our planned refinancing was completed.
Over many years, Derwent Londons business model has been Investment property, net assets and gearing to add value through refurbishment, redevelopment and asset management while also maintaining a secure recurring income m % stream, modest leverage and strong interest cover.
The strength 3,000 40 of our balance sheet plus the confidence that comes from robust five-year financial projections supports the business and enables us to plan to take account of anticipated market cycles.
This allows decision-taking that fuels growth backed by a careful 2,400 36 assessment of the risks.
The calendar year 2012 was, in many respects, a significant one for London.
Sterling was seen as a relative safe haven while many 1,800 32 of the other European economies were under extreme pressure.
Notwithstanding the lack of overall economic growth in the UK and the domestic tension caused by a deficit reduction programme, 1,200 28 policies exercised by Government and the Bank of England helped to encourage capital flows into London.
This strengthened sterling and forced interest rates down to exceptionally low levels though there has been some correction in both measures in the 600 24 first few weeks of 2013.
Another notable feature of the year for our sector was the continued and substantial disparity between availability and cost of 0 20 Dec 10 Jun 11 Dec 11 Jun 12 Dec 12 capital for those seen as strong borrowers and the rest.
In particular, investors associated with London continued to defy the Property portfolio LTV ratio gloom which was felt in much of the rest of the UK.
Net assets attributable to equity shareholders All these factors meant that this was a good environment for stronger companies within our sector to refinance.
In January 2012, we completed 300m of bank facilities signed in December 2011.
In addition, Derwent London secured 83m of inexpensive long-term debt in August 2012, tapping a source which we had not previously utilised.
We also continued our policy of recycling capital through asset sales, improved our overall interest cover and drove rental growth in the portfolio with like-for-like net rental growth up by 8.2% on the year.
With low voids and much of the existing development pipeline fide-risked through pre-lets, we have been able to push ahead with important new projects such as Turnmill EC1 and 40 Chancery Lane WC2 and to commit to our largest scheme to 10.9% date at 80 Charlotte Street W1.
In addition, we have now agreed increase in EPRA NAV to accelerate the development of the White Collar Factory at City Road EC1.

This was largely due to another pronounced rise in value of the property portfolio which showed an increase of 170p per 7 30 50 share after allowing for capital expenditure and lease incentives.

The mark-to-market cost of derivatives rose by 2p per share to 53p, offset by a fall in deferred tax liabilities of 5p as certain historical tax issues were successfully resolved.

We invested 77.5m in the portfolio and capitalised 140 4.9m of interest against figures of 41.0m and 2.2m, respectively, in 2011.
This rebalancing of activity away from the 135 4.6 2.7 income-producing part of the portfolio inevitably has an impact upon rental income.
However, through strong lettings and asset 4.0 management together with careful financial planning, we have 7.2 130 1.6 6.1 1.3 sought to ensure that earnings are broadly flat year on year.
125.5 124.8 125 EPRA recurring profit before tax increased slightly to 52.5m for the year ended 31 December 2012 compared with 52.3m in 2011.
The prior year benefited from the write-back of 1.8m of 120 current tax provisions and this is the main reason why EPRA earnings per share fell back a little to 50.4p from 51.6p in 2011.
115 Although we have extended our development programme and recycled capital through property disposals, gross rental income 110 increased slightly during the year by 0.6m to 124.7m.
New lettings in 2012 added 3.7m of income in the year while rent 105 reviews, mainly in relation to the settlement of the 2011 review at 8 Fitzroy Street W1, added a further 3.5m.
Lettings and reviews Lettings 100 from the previous year also contributed 4.6m.
Properties and reviews acquired in 2012 increased 2012 rent by 1.6m while the loss of income from properties sold was 6.1m.
Lease breaks, expiries and voids reduced rent by a further 6.7m.
Premiums received from lease surrenders vary from year to year and, on a net basis, 2012 125.5 1.6 6.1 7.2 4.6 2.7 4.0 1.3 124.8 were only 0.1m in 2012 against 1.4m in 2011.

The prior year also benefited from 1.6m of rates credits: in 2012 the 140 10.3 recovery of overpaid rates was 0.3m.
Surrender premiums paid 2.5 124.7 0.1 to tenants fell to 0.2m in 2012 compared to 1.9m in 2011.
24.5 120 The real progress in rental income levels across the portfolio can be demonstrated by the strong increase in like-for-like property income where the effects of acquisitions, disposals and 100 40.8 developments are taken out: EPRA net rental income increased by 8.2% during the year.

Development activity and a greater emphasis on areas 0.8 52.5 60 such as sustainability have increased headcount again in 2012.
If the provision for cash-settled share options is excluded, the underlying increase in administrative expenses was 7.5%, due 40 mainly to increased staff costs.
The Groups consistently strong performance over recent years has contributed to an increase 20 in the provision for long-term management incentives of 0.7m compared to 2011.
Net finance costs fell to 40.8m from 43.2m in the prior year due 0 partly to a higher amount capitalised on projects, 4.9m against 2.2m last year.
Interest costs have fallen by 2.3m compared to the previous year, offset by an increase of 2.5m in charges for arrangement and non-utilisation fees.

50% During the year, we have completed the remaining refinancing requirement while also continuing with our strategic aims of diversifying sources of debt, lengthening average debt maturities and managing the cost and risk profile associated with our debt facilities.
In January 2012, the new bank facilities documented in December 2011 were drawn.
These consisted of a 150m fully revolving five-year facility provided equally by RBS and Barclays and a new 150m fully revolving five-year facility provided by Lloyds Bank to replace and extend their existing 100m bilateral facility.
In January 2012, we also broke two interest rate swaps with a principal amount of 130m and a weighted average rate of about 5.0% which were due to expire in March 2013.
The cost of breaking these swaps was 6.3m, a small discount to the additional interest charge that we would have incurred through the remaining life of the swaps.
At the same time, we swapped a total of 70m to April 2019 at just under 2.0%.
Following the repayment in January 2012 of the last loan notes associated with the London Merchant Securities PLC LMS transaction, the 32.5m unsecured loan note facility due to expire in June 2012 was also cancelled.
In addition, the Groups overdraft facility was reduced to 2.5m from 10.0m in July 2012.
With low levels of leverage, good interest cover and sufficient headroom under our facilities, the Group is in robust financial shape.

Overall, these actions reduced the level of swaps at the balance sheet date by 125m compared to a year earlier, while the amount of fixed rate debt increased by 83m.
This overall reduction of 42m moved the proportion at fixed rates or swapped to 92% from 98% at the end of 2011 and provided a weighted average cost of debt of 4.88% on an IFRS basis, or 4.63% using the cash cost of the convertible bonds.

The principal properties disposed of were Riverwalk House, 232-242 Vauxhall Bridge Road SW1, the Triangle Centre in Scotland and a half share in 1-5 Grosvenor Place SW1, which together provided a cash inflow of 161.0m after costs.
Combined with this small increase in debt, the strong rise in property values meant that the Groups overall LTV ratio fell to 30.0% from 32.0% in 2011.
NAV gearing fell correspondingly from 50.4% to 45.6%.
We focus more on interest cover than absolute levels of leverage and are pleased to report that gross interest cover rose to 351% for the year compared to 307% in 2011.
Net interest cover, after property and administrative expenses and treating interest capitalised as an expense, increased to 223% in 2012 from 214% in the previous year.
Dividend Our approach is to manage dividend distribution in a way that maintains sufficient dividend cover out of recurring earnings but which also reflects a progressive and sustainable level of growth for our shareholders.
The Board has been able to recommend an 8.4% increase in the proposed final dividend to 23.75p per share of which 18.75p will be paid as a PID with the balance of 5.00p as a conventional dividend.
This will bring the total dividend for the year to 33.70p per share, an increase of 2.35p or 7.5% over 2011.
