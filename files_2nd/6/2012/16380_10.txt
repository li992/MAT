The virtuous circle of growth continues to work for us.
FINANCIAL We delivered consistent and strong top-line growth, wellbalanced between volume and price and improved core REVIEW 2012 operating margin.
Delivering consistent top line growth and improved profitability Strong underlying sales growth, led by solid volume growth Growth of our markets remained positive in 2012.
This was primarily driven by strong growth in emerging markets which grew in volume and value terms, while developed markets remained largely unchanged due to continued weak consumer confidence in Western Europe and North America.
Despite the challenging environment, we have delivered strong underlying sales growth of 6.9% 2011: 6.5%.
We accelerated volume growth to 3.4% 2011: 1.6%, well balanced with a 3.3% contribution from price 2011: 4.8%.
All of our categories and each of our three geographical areas reported positive growth.
As in the prior year, emerging markets were the key growth drivers with underlying sales up 11.4%.
We achieved double-digit growth in many countries, including Indonesia, China, Brazil and Vietnam.
In developed markets we managed to grow the business despite difficult markets: our underlying sales were up 1.6%, split equally between volume and price.
Our focus on bigger and better innovation, rolled out faster to more markets is a key driver behind our performance.
The rollout of our brands to new markets, including the more recently acquired brands, such as the launch of TRESemm in Brazil also contributed strongly.
Amongst our categories, Home Care and Personal Care grew ahead of the markets, up 10.3% and 10.0% respectively: resulting in solid market share gains.
In Home Care, we outperformed market growth in laundry and household cleaning.
In Personal Care, our hair care business garnered market shares around the world, and skin care as well as deodorants reflected the success of innovations.
In Foods, underlying sales growth of 1.8% reflects a mixed performance, benefiting from the rollout of new products and our marketing campaigns to introduce new uses of our products to consumers.
At the same time, declining markets in our spreads business and the impact of price rises we took in 2011 to counter sharply increased raw material costs impacted growth momentum.
6.3% underlying sales growth in Refreshment reflects the continued success of the global rollout of our ice cream brands and innovations, as well as improved growth momentum in tea, especially in emerging markets.
Solid progress in core operating margin Despite further increases in input costs and adverse currency changes, gross margin improved by 0.1% to 40.0% at constant exchange rates, reflecting disciplined cost management and our increased focus on improving gross margin consistently.
Core operating margin was up 0.3% to 13.8%, driven by the progress in gross margin, continued savings programmes and lower expenses for restructuring.
Advertising and promotional expenses increased by 470 million, at constant exchange rates.
Strong free cash flow generation Free cash flow of 4.3 billion was up by 1.2 billion, driven by higher operating profit and improvement in working capital management.
Consistent management focus has resulted in negative working capital for 13 consecutive quarters with further progress in all its components: inventories, trade receivables and trade payables.
Net capital expenditure of 2.1 billion was in line with last year, at 4.2% of turnover, reflecting investment in the capacity required for our growing business.
