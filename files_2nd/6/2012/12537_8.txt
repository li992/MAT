Highlights and achievements Chris Craft Completed agreement with Skeie to increase Business Unit Manager equity in Bream to 40 per cent Premier Oil Norway Completed acquisition of three operated exploration licences on the margin of the Mandal High Built further on Mandal High position through the APA 2012 Licensing Round The Norway Business Unit is focused on bringing on-stream the developments which meet our internal metrics while pursuing high impact exploration.
We also continue to seek to actively manage our portfolio, both through acquisitions and disposals.
Active exploration DEVELOPMENT In August, Premier acquired a 20 per cent interest in PL407, which contains the Bream field, and a 40 per cent equity interest in the adjacent PL406 licence.
This increased Premiers share in the Bream project to 40 per cent and the companys operated interest in PL406, which contains the Mackerel oil discovery and the Herring exploration prospect, to 80 per cent.
Premier paid an upfront consideration of US$10 million with further payments of up to US$17.5 million contingent upon certain milestones being reached.
Engineering studies for the subsea systems and wells for Bream were completed during 2012 but the studies carried out for the lifetime extension and upgrade of the FPSO targeted for the field demonstrated that the vessel was not suitable.
The joint venture partnership has investigated alternative production facility options and a new build vessel has been identified.
Commercial negotiations are under way with the contractor for this vessel and it is expected that front end engineering studies will start in the second quarter of 2013.
During 2012, Premier completed subsurface evaluations for the Mackerel discovery.
Based on the results, a subsea tie-back to the Bream FPSO is the most economic solution.
An exploration well on the adjacent prospect, Herring, is also planned to be drilled as part of the development project.
Project sanction and submission of development plans to the authorities for the Bream development are expected in early 2014.
First oil is targeted for 2017 with an initial production rate of approximately 14,000 boepd net to Premier.
Elsewhere in Norway, commercial discussions have been held with field owners in the Fry area with the intent of developing a central processing hub for a number of discoveries close to Fry.
This has proved a slow process, however the pace is expected to pick up in 2013 with equity alignment discussions taking place with the operator of a nearby field.
Norway continued EXPLORATION Work continued in 2012 to evaluate the Grosbeak discovery in PL378.
The partnership is participating in an area forum that is evaluating the best way of developing the resources in the area.
In addition, a significant oil discovery Skarfjell was made in the adjacent licence in 2012.
Current mapping indicates that a significant portion of Skarfjell extends into PL378 and preparations for appraisal drilling have been initiated.
In February 2012, Premier completed its acquisition of three operated exploration licences.
These licences are close to Premiers existing Freki licence and are on the margin of the Mandal High in the Southern Norwegian North Sea.
Evaluation of this acreage has so far resulted in a drill recommendation being brought forward to our partners in PL539 and we are awaiting a decision shortly.
Premier built further on its acreage position in and around the Mandal High through the APA 2012 Licensing Round in which it was awarded a 20 per cent operated interest in the Skala exploration licence in January 2013.
As a result, Premier now has access to around 200 mmbbls of net prospective resources on and around the Mandal High.
In the operated licence PL622 a 3D survey was successfully acquired during the summer in co-operation with PGS.
Looking forward, the Luno II exploration well in PL359 in the North Sea offshore Norway spudded in March 2013 and the results of the well are expected by the end of April.
The well is looking to prove up the Jurassic reservoir sandstones to the south of the Edvard Greig field and is targeting a gross mean unrisked prospective resource of 120 mmboe.
