FINANCIAL REVIEW A STRONG BALANCE SHEET TO FUND HIGH-IMPACT EXPLORATION We end 2012 with strong operating cash flow, low gearing and a well-funded balance sheet.
We are well-placed to fund our exploration-led growth strategy from operational cash flow and to fund selective developments from a combination of debt and portfolio management.
We had a successful year from a financial perspective.
Our balance sheet has been transformed by the completion of the $2.9 billion farm-down in Uganda, the successful and cost-effective resolution of Jubilee production issues and the refinancing of our $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility, extending final maturity from 2015 to 2019.
We therefore end 2012 with strong operating cash flow, low gearing and a well-financed balance sheet.
Increased portfolio management It was also a year for significant portfolio development.
In addition to the Uganda farm-down, we undertook a detailed review of resource allocation, opportunities to monetise assets and the strategic decisions required both to move the exploration needle and to focus our spend.
Firstly we undertook a thorough review of the exploration assets carried in our balance sheet at the half-year.
We evaluated these assets against our expected near-term work programmes and the relative attractiveness of investment in these assets, compared with the exploration opportunities.
This resulted in an asset write-down of $371 million.
Secondly we invested in five new country entries, including Ian Springett Chief Financial Officer the $372 million acquisition of Spring Energy in Norway.
