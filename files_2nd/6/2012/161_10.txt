Year on year Group gold sales volume decreased by 13.1%, while gold revenue benefited from higher average realised gold prices.
The decrease in gold sales was primarily due to the lower production base and the back-ended nature of production in December 2012, which deferred sales into 2013.
The average realised gold price was US$1,668 per ounce in 2012 compared to US$1,587 per ounce in 2011.

The decrease in the production of gold copper concentrate at US$1,087,339 US$719 Oz US$330,869 Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi resulted in the decrease in copper sales volumes.
The 2012 average realised copper price of US$3.57 per pound compared unfavourably to 2011 US$3.82 per pound, and was driven by global market factors regarding supply and demand.

Coppers fall during the second half of 2012 occurred mainly due Commodity prices to uncertainty regarding the global economic recovery, and softer demand Gold prices have a significant impact on ABGs operating earnings from emerging markets, especially China.
