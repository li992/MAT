Financial review US$500m Returned to shareholders since demerger US$1bn Invested in business since demerger Our 2011 12 financial performance demonstrates the broad strength we have across our Group.
Despite a weak global economy and challenging conditions in some of our markets, particularly the Caribbean, we have met or exceeded our outlook in four business units.
Since our demerger in 2010 we have invested around US$1 billion into the business, increased our return on invested capital and returned more than US$500 million to our shareholders.

This decision, when combined with a successful US$1 billion renancing exercise during the year, puts our Group nancing on a strong footing and allows us to look forward with confidence.
