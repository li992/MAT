Translation hedging has been maintained towards the upper end of the 50 to 90 per cent policy range in order to substantially reduce the impact of movements in the sterling euro exchange rate on NAV and EPRA profits of the Group.
A 5 per cent strengthening against sterling in the value of the other currencies in which the Group operates at 31 December 2012 would have increased net assets by approximately 15 million and increased reported gearing by less than 1 per cent.
Including the impact of forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts used to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets, the increase in gearing would have been approximately 2 per cent.
A 5 per cent strengthening against sterling in the value of the other currencies in which the Group operates at 31 December 2012, including the impact of forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts used to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets, would have increased the LTV ratio on a look-through basis by 0.6 per cent.
The average exchange rate used to translate euro denominated earnings generated during 2012 into sterling within the consolidated income statement of the Group was 1.23: 1.
Based on the hedging position at 31 December 2012, and assuming that this position had applied throughout 2012, if the euro had been 5 per cent stronger than it was against sterling throughout the year 1.17: 1, EPRA profits after tax for the year would have been approximately 1.9 million 1 per cent higher than those reported.
