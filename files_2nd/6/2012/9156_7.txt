areprovided in note 24 of the accounts.
The decrease in the net deficit was predominantly due to strong asset returns, more than offsetting a lower discount rate used to value the UK CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT pension obligation.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are: To safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and retain financial exibility in order to continue to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders: and To maintain a solid investment grade credit rating.
The Group manages its capital by: Continued focus on free cash ow generation: Setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the context of current year and forecast free cash ow generation: Rigorous review of capital investments and post investment reviews to drive better returns: and Monitoring the level of the Groups financial and leasehold debt in the context of Group performance and its credit rating.
Kingsher Insurance Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, is subject to minimum capital requirements as a consequence of its insurance activities.
The Group complied with the externally imposed capital requirements during the year.
PROPERTY The Group owns a significant property portfolio, most of which is used for trading purposes.
If the Group had continued to revalue this in its books it would have had a market value of 3.5 billion at year end 2010 11: 3.3 billion, compared to the net book value of 2.8 billion recorded in the financial statements.
The values are based on valuations performed by external qualied valuers where the key assumption is the estimated yields.
The valuation exercise was performed in November 2011 with over one-third of the portfolio valued by external professional valuers.
In addition, the Group has a lease portfolio which is treated as debt by the rating agencies and is valued by them at around 3.5 billion.
The Group calculates this leasehold debt by using property yields, assuming occupancy of the property for the longer term.
On this basis the value of leasehold debt at the year end was 4.9 billion.
PENSIONS The approach used to prepare the pension valuation is in line with current market practice and international accounting standards, and has been applied consistently.
This accounting valuation is very sensitive to a number of assumptions and market rates which are likely to uctuate in the future.
To aid understanding of the impact that changes to the assumptions could have on the reported UK pension surplus, we have included sensitivity analysis as part of the pension disclosure in note 27.
Further details of all the key assumptions are also contained within thenote.
