Financial Review Despite weak coal prices, underlying EBITDA of $365m was achieved In 2012, the Group generated revenues of $1,531m with an operating loss of $757m.
2012 was the first year in which the Groups results included a full years contribution from PT Berau and a nine month contribution from PT Bumi for the period before it was classified as an associate.
In 2011, the Group results included 10 months contribution from those businesses.
Summary of financial results The Group revenue for the year was $1,531m 2011: $1,407m and reflects that of PT Berau only.
Gross profit was $411m 2011: $531m, representing a gross margin of 27% 2011: 38%.
Group operating loss was $757m 2011: $276m operating profit and Group loss before finance items and tax was $2,312m 2011: $237m profit.
The profit and loss disparities between 2012 and 2011 primarily relate to our $167m share of the net loss of PT Bumi 2011: $39m loss, $815m impairment of goodwill 2011: nil, $152m of other exceptional costs 2011: $49m and $1,394m loss on reclassification of associate to investment 2011: nil.
Reclassifications and restatements The extensive review of the financial position of PT Berau by new management identified expenditures by new management incurred in 2011 for which no clear business purpose could be established.
Consideration has been given to the presentation of these amounts to provide information on a comparable basis.
Amounts have been reclassified or restated where appropriate and details are included in the basis of preparation Note 2.1 c to the Financial Statements.
Underlying earnings and underlying EBITDA Bumi plc management believes that underlying earnings and underlying EBITDA more clearly reflect the operating and financial performance of the business.
They are calculated in the table below.

Underlying EBITDA represents the whole Group.
Bumi plc Annual Report Page 13 Financial Review continued Movements in underlying earnings and net earnings Revenues In 2012, revenues were adversely impacted by lower prices, but this was partially offset by increased sales volumes.
Prices are set by reference to the FOB Newcastle coal GCNEWC index price for thermal coal and then adjusted for qualitative factors such as calorific value, moisture, ash and sulphur content.
On average, the Newcastle Index fell 21% between 2011 and 2012, with PT Beraus average selling price falling by 13%, helped by an improved product mix.
This was offset by a 5% increase in sales volumes to 21.1 mt 2011: 20.0 mt.
Cost of sales PT Beraus cost of sales per tonne was slightly higher due principally to an increase in over burden distances leading to increased mining cost and fuel usage and a slight increase in fuel prices and stripping ratios 9.6 bcm per tonne in 2012 compared with 9.5 bcm per tonne in 2011.
The amortisation of mining licences is included within cost of sales.
These licences were fair valued on the acquisition of PT Berau and the charge for the year was $116 m 2011: $88m.
Operating costs General and administrative costs were $37m higher in 2012 than 2011 due to a full years contribution from PT Berau in 2012 and the impact of a full organisation for the London head office.
Distribution and marketing costs were $24m higher because 2012 represented a full years contribution, compared to 10 months in 2011.
Finance costs Finance costs were $52m higher than in 2011, partly because PT Berau was consolidated for 12 months, and partly due to the costs of refinancing $340m of bank loans that were refinanced in March 2012 with a $500m five year bond.
The new bond was issued at a coupon of 7.25% per annum.
Tax Tax was $55m lower than 2011 due to lower profits.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests relate to the large loss in the year.
Items excluded from underlying earnings Corporate transaction costs In 2011, $66m of corporate transaction costs were incurred on the completion of the acquisitions of PT Bumi and PT Berau and the transaction for Bumi plc to acquire PT Bumi Resources Minerals Tbk which did not complete.
Movement on financial instruments at fair value In 2011, the $286m related to a fair value loss on acquisition related financial instruments.
The movement on acquisition related financial instruments is a non cash cost that arose because of the relative movement in PT Berau, PT Bumi and Vallar plc share prices, and because of the Indonesian rupiah exchange rate between 1 January 2011 and the completion of the acquisitions during 2011.
In 2012, the $24m relates to an embedded derivative in relation to PT Beraus senior secured notes, in which PT Berau has the option to repay early.
Details are shown in note 23 to the Financial Statements.
Impairment of goodwill Impairment of goodwill relates to PT Berau.
During 2012, the significant and prolonged decrease in benchmark thermal coal prices indicated that PT Berau could be impaired, and an assessment of impairment was undertaken.
The assessment took into account revised assumptions of long term thermal coal and oil prices, expansion plans and future volumes, capital expenditure requirements, expected production costs and a revised mine plan resulting in an impairment of $815m.
Details of the key assumptions and sensitivity analysis are included in note 13 to the Financial Statements.
Bumi plc Annual Report Page 14 Financial Review continued Share of net loss of associate The $167m net loss relates to the Groups share of PT Bumis results up to 30 September 2012, the point at which it was determined there was a loss of significant influence.
The $39m figure for 2011 was for the 10 months post acquisition result.
This item has been excluded from underlying earnings as PT Bumi is no longer an associate and no longer represents part of the ongoing business of the Group.
Other exceptional costs During the year end reporting process, a number of payments were identified as requiring further explanation by the former management of PT Berau.
The explanations, and evidence provided, raised concerns regarding potential financial irregularities.
An extensive review of the financial position of PT Berau has been conducted by the new management team which confirms that there is evidence of apparent financial irregularities, and has identified significant expenditure, predominantly in 2012, for which there is no clear business purpose.
Such expenditure is disclosed as other exceptional costs and amounts incurred in the year total $152m 2011: $49m.
Comparatives have been restated to ensure a consistent presentation of the costs incurred in the ordinary course of the business.
Loss arising on reclassification of PT Bumi With effect from 30 September 2012, the Board concluded that it no longer had significant influence over PT Bumi, following the resignation of Ari Hudaya who is the President Director of PT Bumi as Non-Executive Director of Bumi plc.
This judgement is explained further in note 3.4 to the Financial Statements.
In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates, the interest in PT Bumi was reclassified to a financial asset available for sale.
On losing influence, the interest was valued by marking the investment to market leading to a loss of $1,394m.
As at 31 December 2012, the investment was again marked to market and the movement recognised in other comprehensive income.
Acquisitions in the year During the year, previous management acquired two companies, PT Kirana Berau and PT Manira Mitra for $4m for the purposes of holding the proposed overland conveyor and power plant assets.
At the time of the acquisition, it was represented by former Directors of PT Berau that these entities contained certain rights to operate in the region which warranted the acquisition price.
Following a review of expenditures, it was determined that there was no clear business purpose for these expenditures and as a result the goodwill presented at 30 June 2012 has now been written off through other exceptional costs.
Balance sheet Goodwill arising on the acquisitions of subsidiaries was tested for impairment at the year end, and an impairment charge of $815m was recorded.
Further details are shown in Note 13 to the financial statements.
The Groups 29.2% interest in PT Bumi is now recorded as an investment and is measured by reference to its quoted share price.
Trade and other receivables increased by $97m to $592m due to an increase in the VAT recoverable on expenses incurred as explained in more detail in note 3.7 to the financial statements.
Similarly, trade and other payables increased by $228m to $833m due to an increase in the royalty payable and increase in accruals.
The extensive review of the financial position of PT Berau by the new management team identified certain time deposits in cash and cash equivalents that were pledged.
These amounts have been reclassified to restricted cash as the funds are not immediately available.
Comparatives have been restated and further details are in note 19.
The Groups net debt was $514m 2011: $323m restated.
In March 2012, the Board approved a $500m bond by PT Berau at a fixed rate of 7.25%.
The bond was used to refinance $340m of outstanding bank loans and to fund capital expenditures required for expanding the business.
Cash flow Cash inflows from operations in 2012 were $348m 2011: $460m restated, a decrease primarily caused by lower coal prices.
Tax paid was $214m 2011: $255m, which is high compared to profit due to a change in the monthly payment regime for PT Berau.
Purchase of property, plant and equipment was $58m 2011: $42m restated.
This related to the commencement of expansion projects to achieve the Groups near term production target of 30 mt.
Dividends received by the Group from its associate were $9m 2011: $30m.
The extensive review of the financial position of PT Berau by new management identified cash that was pledged and this has been reflected in movements in restricted cash.
Bumi plc Annual Report Page 15 Financial Review continued Capital expenditure The Groups capital expenditure of $125m related principally to PT Berau.
At Lati there was expenditure on upgrading the crusher and port facilities, at Binungan on upgrading the hauling facilities and at Sambarata on increasing coal crushing and stock piling capacities.
There was also expenditure in relation to deferred stripping costs.
Prior period adjustment The Groups 2011 tax charge has been restated following the identification of costs with no clear business purpose and an additional charge of $20m has been reflected.
Going concern In assessing the Groups going concern status, the Directors have taken into account the factors set out in the Operating Review, Financial Review and Principal Risks and Uncertainties, the Groups cash balances, borrowings, cash flow projections, current commodity prices and the markets future price expectations.
The Directors have also considered the Groups operating cost profile, its capital expenditure and financing plans.
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing their financial statements.
Dividends Dividends paid to non-controlling interests relate to payments by PT Berau Coal to its minority shareholder and by PT Berau to its minority shareholders.
