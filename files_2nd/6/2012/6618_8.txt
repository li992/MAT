2.1 | Financial review BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION The financial information has been prepared on a basis as outlined in note1 of the financial statements.
It is presented in the Overview and the Financial review sections before significant items unless otherwise stated to provide an enhanced understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
Significant items are items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact and nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results.

36 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN RESuLTS Adjusted EBIT decreased by 17% to $ 4,470 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower contributions from our industrial activities which were affected by generally lower year on year average commodity prices for the key commodities which we and our associates primarily Xstrata produce.
Given the largely fixed cost nature of depreciation and amortisation non-cash over a certain level of production, Adjusted EBITDA was only 8% lower in 2012, compared to 2011.
Adjusted EBIT contribution from marketing was $2,130million 2011: $1,911million representing 48% of Adjusted EBIT for the year, an increase from 35% in the prior year.
These results highlight the reinforcing the strength and resilience of Glencores business model and the diversification benefits associated with combining and integrating, across a broad spectrum of commodities, a portfolio of industrial assets with large scale physical sourcing, marketing and logistics capabilities.
Adjusted EBIT Adjusted EBIT by business segment is as follows: 2012 2011 Marketing Industrial Adjusted Marketing Industrial Adjusted US$million activities activities EBIT activities activities EBIT Metals and minerals 1363 708 2071 46% 1242 1357 2599 48% Energy products 435 594 1029 23% 697 375 1072 20% Agricultural products 371 10 361 8% 8 39 47 1% Corporate and other 39 1048 1009 23% 20 1794 1774 33% Total 2130 2340 4470 100% 1911 3487 5398 100% Corporate industrial activities include $1,174million 2011: $1,893million of Glencores equity accounted share of Xstratas income.
Marketing Adjusted EBIT was $2,130million up 11% over 2011.
2012 saw an improved performance by metals and minerals, with generally good volume growth e. g. copper and nickel and healthy physical premia for many of Glencores core products.
The energy result was weaker due to fewer arbitrage opportunities, against a backdrop of relatively low volatility and the continuing weak freight markets.
Agricultural products showed a marked improvement over 2011, with the events surrounding cotton now behind us and on an adjusted comparable basis, its performance was relatively stable year over year.
Industrial Adjusted EBIT declined by 33% to $2,340million in 2012, primarily due to weaker average commodity prices, including nickel, coal API 2, zinc and copper, down 23%, 24%, 11% and 10% respectively.
These lower prices impact our own controlled operations as well as our share of Xstratas earnings.
The commencement of oil production at the Aseng field in Q42011 was largely accountable for the increase in energy products industrial performance.
Corporate and other primarily relates to the equity accounted interest in Xstrata and also includes the variable pool bonus cost, the net result of which was down 43% to $1,009million in 2012 compared to 2011.
| Annual Report 2012 | 37 Revenue Revenue for the year ended 31December 2012 was $214,436million, a 15% increase compared to $186,152million in 2011.
The increase was primarily due to higher oil volumes handled 39%, partially offset by lower period-on-period metals prices as noted above.
Cost of goods sold Cost of goods sold for the year ended 31December2012 was $ 210,435 million, a 16% increase from $ 181,938 million in 2011 primarily due to the higher oil volumes noted above.
Selling and administrative expenses Selling and administrative expenses for the year ended 31December2012 were $ 997 million, a 16% increase from $ 857 million in 2011, due to somewhat higher employee compensation charges, commensurate with an expansion of business activities and performance.
Share of income from associates and jointly controlled entities Share of income from associates and jointly controlled entities for the year ended 31December 2012 was $ 367million, a 81% decrease from $ 1,972 million in 2011.
The decrease reflects reduced earnings flowthrough from Xstrata primarily due to the lower commodity prices and various impairment charges which it took $299million equity earnings, including $875million of significant items: 2011: $1,868million, including $25million of significant items.
Loss gain on disposal of investments Loss on disposal of investments for the year ended 2012 was $128million, compared to a gain of $9million in 2011.
The amount in 2012 primarily comprised an accounting dilution loss following an Xstrata share issuance in March 2012 part of its employee stock ownership plan, which saw Glencores effective ownership reduce from 34.5% to 34.2%.
Other expense net Net other expense for 2012 was $1,214million, compared to $511million in 2011.
2012 primarily comprised impairments of $1,650million, $120million acquisition related expenses and $109million of expense related to phantom equity awards granted upon Glencores listing, offset by a net $497million accounting gain mainly related to the revaluation of Glencores initial 40% interest in Mutanda upon acquisition of an additional 20% interest in April 2012.
There were also $179million of positive mark to market adjustments related to certain fixed priced forward coal sales contracts in respect of Prodecos future production.
The impairment amount mainly comprises $1.2billion of previously recognised negative fair value adjustments reclassified from other comprehensive income to the statement of income in respect of Glencores interest in UC Rusal.
This reclassification had no impact on Glencores net asset equity position which has consistently, for many years, reflected the mark-to-market fair value of this holding.
Evidence of this lack of impact is clear on page111, where total comprehensive income attributable to equity holders was lower by a mere 10% in 2012 compared to 2011, contributing to a 7% increase in total equity, excluding noncontrolling interests.
The net amount in 2011 primarily comprised $344million of expenses related to Glencores listing, a $92million of mark-to-market loss in respect of various minority holdings in listed companies, $63million related to final costs associated with the settlement of the Prodeco option and $32million of asset impairments.
See notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further explanations.
Interest income Interest income for the year ended 31December 2012 was $ 401million, an 18% increase over 2011 due to higher average advance balances outstanding.
Interest income includes interest earned on various loans extended, including to OAO Russneft.
Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended 31December 2012 was $ 1,371 million, a 16% increase from $ 1,186 million in 2011.
The increase was mainly due to higher average debt levels.
38 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN Income taxes A net income tax credit of $ 76 million was recognised during the year ended 31December 2012 compared to a tax credit of $ 264 million in 2011.
The 2012 credit resulted primarily from the recognition of crystallised tax benefits resulting in losses carried forward, following an internal reorganisation of our existing ownership interest in Xstrata.
The 2011 credit resulted primarily from the recognition of tax deductions associated with the conversion of the Glencore Group from private to public ownership as part of its listing.
It has been Glencores historical experience that its effective tax rate pre significant items on pre-tax income, excluding share of income from associates and jointly controlled entities and dividend income, has been approximately 10%, particularly in years where the marketing to industrial profit contribution mix is higher.
This rate has been reflected in the table below.
It is likely that the future effective tax rate will increase relative to the past, however, as noted above, this will largely be a function of Glencores profit mix marketing vs industrial.

| Annual Report 2012 | 39 SIgNIFICANT ITEMS Significant items are items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact and nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results to provide a better understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
In 2012, Glencore recognised $2,056 million of significant expenses on a net basis which comprised primarily impairment charges of $1,650million 2011: $32million and our share of Xstratas exceptional items 2012: $875million, 2011: $25million, offset by a $497million accounting gain on the revaluation of previously held interests in subsidiaries acquired during the year.
In 2011, Glencore recognised $12million of significant expenses on a net basis which comprised primarily $344million of expenses related to Glencores listing, a $92million of mark-to-market loss in respect of various minority holdings in listed companies, $63million related to final costs associated with the settlement of the Prodeco option and $ 32million of asset impairments.
These expenses were largely offset by the recognition of $514million of net tax credits relating primarily to certain income tax deductions that were crystallised, following the reorganisation of Glencore prior to Listing.
See comments in other expense net above and notes 2, 4 and 5 of the financial statements for additional details.
LIquIdITy ANd CAPITAL RESOuRCES CASH FLOw Cash generated by operating activities before working capital changes Cash generated by operating activities before working capital changes for the year ended 31December2012 was $ 4,782 million, an increase of $ 681 million 17% compared to 2011, reflecting the higher Adjusted EBITDA from marketing activities.
On a more comparable basis, the increase is 8%, taking into account $325million of listing related cash expenses in the 2011 period see movement in net debt table below.
Working capital changes Cash net working capital decreased by $727 million during the year ended 31December 2012 compared to an increase of $ 3,174 million in 2011.
Much of the 2011 increase occurred in Q42011, as Glencore was presented with highly attractive funded commodity sourcing opportunities.
2012 saw a partial release of this increase, via the movement in receivables and payables, however marketing related inventory balances increased during the year.
Inventory levels were higher in metals and naturally in the agricultural division, which took on substantial levels of working capital towards the end of 2012, in no small part due to the mid-December acquisition of Viterra see note24 of the financial statements.
In 2013, we are focused on working capital levels associated with the 2012 acquisitions, including a natural release of working capital once various earmarked non-core components of Viterra have been sold.
Net cash used by investing activities Net cash used by investing activities was $ 9,539 million in 2012 compared to $ 3,690 million in 2011.
The net outflow in 2012 primarily related to the acquisition of Viterra, an additional 32% interest in Optimum, an additional 20% interest in Mutanda, two European manganese operations and an 80% interest in Rosh Pinah see note24 of the financial statements, along with continued capital expenditure programs in respect of the various E&P upstream oil development projects, the development of the Mutanda and Kansuki copper cobalt operations and the production expansions at Katanga, Cobar and Prodeco.
Net cash generated by financing activities During 2012, Glencore issued $2,951million bonds 6 year 4.125% EUR1,250million bonds, 10 year 5.5% GBP500million bonds and 6.5 year 2.625% CHF450million bonds.
40 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN ASSETS, LEVERAgE ANd wORKINg CAPITAL Total assets were $ 105,537 million as at 31December 2012 compared to $ 86,165 million as at 31December2011.
Over the same time period current assets increased from $ 45,731 million to $54,059 million.
The adjusted current ratio at 31 December2012 reduced to 1.16x, as the Xstrata secured bank loans and the October 2013 Eurobonds moved from non current to current borrowings.
Adjusting for these two movements given our c. $9billion of long term committed liquidity could have been drawn to repay short term debt, the Adjusted current ratio improves to 1.27x.
Non current assets increased from $ 40,434 million as at 31December2011 to $ 51,478 million as at 31December2012, primarily due to the acquisitions and capital expenditure programs noted above, including large non controlling interest asset gross-ups in relation to Mutanda and Optimum, where Glencore moved from equity to consolidated accounting during the year.
Consistent with 31December2011, 99% $ 17,290 million of total marketing inventories were readily marketable inventories at 31December2012.
These inventories are readily convertible into cash due to their liquid nature, widely available markets, and the fact that any associated price risk is or could be covered either by a physical sale transaction or a hedge transaction on a commodity exchange or with a highly rated counterparty.
Given the highly liquid nature of these inventories, which represent a significant share of current assets, Glencore believes it is appropriate to consider them together with cash equivalents in analysing Group net debt levels and computing certain debt coverage ratios and credit trends.
Balance sheet liquidity remains very healthy such that current capital employed plus investments in listed associates at book carrying value covers 115% of Glencores total gross debt as at 31December2012.

$359million of net debt was assumed in the Viterra acquisition and $3.6billion of net debt was incurred to finance Glencores effective share of the equity purchase consideration.
Adjusting for the increase in net debt attributable to the Viterra acquisition completed mid-December 2012, net debt would be $11,457million, a decrease of $1,481million compared to 2011.
The ratio of Net debt adjusted for the Viterra acquisition to Adjusted EBITDA improved from 2.00 times in 2011 to 1.93 times as at 31December 2012, while the ratio of FFO to Net debt adjusted for the Viterra acquisition improved from 27.2% in 2011 to 35.9% in 2012.
A healthy positive free cash flow generation FFO is expected from the Viterra asset base going forward, which is expected to offer support to debt coverage ratios and deleveraging initiatives into the future.
42 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN CAPITAL RESOuRCES ANd FINANCINg During the year ended 31December2012, the following notable financing activities took place: In April 2012, Glencore issued EUR1,250million 4.125% bonds maturing in 2018 and GBP300million 5.5% bonds maturing in 2022, totalling $2.15billion equivalent: In April 2012, Glencore updated its revolving credit facilities totalling $12.8billion.
The facilities comprise: 1 a $4,435million 14 month revolving credit facility with a 10 month term-out option and 10 month extension option, that refinanced Glencores existing $3,535million 364-day revolving credit facility, i. e. an increase of $900million and 2 an amount of $8,030million of the existing $8,370million 3-year revolving credit facility was extended for a further year to May 2015: In April 2012, Glencore signed a $3.1billion syndicated loan backing the proposed merger with Xstrata, after raising $11billion in syndication from 31 banks, a scale-back exceeding 70%: In June 2012, Glencore concluded a 1 year syndicated term loan facility with a 1 year term out option at Glencores discretion of some $1.5billion in support of the announced acquisition of Viterra, once again scaling back an oversubscribed syndication process: In July 2012, Glencore issued CHF450million 2.625% bonds maturing in 2018: In October 2012, Glencore signed a new 364 day committed $2.2billion secured inventory and receivables borrowing base facility, which renewed the existing $1.7billion facility: and In November 2012, Glencore issued GBP200million 5.5% bonds maturing in 2022.
As at 31December 2012, Glencore had available committed undrawn credit facilities and cash amounting to $ 9billion as an internal financial policy, Glencore has a $ 3 billion minimum threshold requirement.
Value at risk VaR One of the tools used by Glencore to monitor and limit its primary market risk exposure, namely commodity price risk related to its physical marketing activities, is the use of a VaR computation.
VaR is a risk measurement technique which estimates the potential loss that could occur on risk positions as a result of movements in risk factors over a specified time horizon, given a specific level of confidence.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability based approach that takes into account market volatilities, as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between commodities and markets.
In this way, risks can be measured consistently across all markets and commodities and risk measures can be aggregated to derive a single risk value.
Glencore has set a consolidated VaR limit 1 day 95% of $ 100 million representing less than 0.3% of equity.
Glencore uses a VaR approach based on Monte Carlo simulations and is computed at a 95% confidence level with a weighted data history using a combination of a one day and one week time horizon.
Average market risk VaR 1day 95% during the year ended 31December 2012 was $ 40 million 2011: $ 39 million, representing a modest 0.1% of shareholders equity.
Whilst it is Glencores policy to substantially hedge its commodity price risks, there remains the possibility that the hedging instruments chosen may not always provide effective mitigation of the underlying price risk.
The hedging instruments available to the marketing businesses may differ in specific characteristics to the risk exposure to be hedged, resulting in an ongoing and unavoidable basis risk exposure.
Residual basis risk exposures represent a key focus point for Glencores commodity department teams who actively engage in the management of such.
Credit ratings In light of our extensive funding activities, investment grade ratings are of utmost importance to us.
Following the Viterra acquisition, the Xstrata merger shareholder approval and assumed completion thereof, the enlarged Groups credit ratings were confirmed as Baa2 stable from Moodys and BBB stable from S&P.
Glencores current ratings are Baa2 review with direction uncertain from Moodys and BBB stable from S&P.
| Annual Report 2012 | 43 Dividend The Directors have proposed a 2012 final dividend of $0.1035 per share, amounting to $735million.
An interim dividend of $0.054 per share, amounting to $374million, was paid on 13September 2012.

The Sterling, Euro or Swiss Franc amount will be determined by reference to the exchange rates applicable to the U. S. Dollar seven days prior to the dividend payment date.
Shareholders on the Hong Kong branch register will receive their dividends in Hong Kong Dollars.
Further details on dividend payments, together with currency election and dividend mandate forms, are available from Glencores website www.

The Directors have proposed that the final dividend will be paid out of capital contribution reserves.
As such, the final dividend would be exempt from Swiss withholding tax.
As at 31December2012, Glencore International plc had CHF13.4billion of such capital contribution reserves in its statutory accounts.
44 | Annual Report 2012 | overview | BUSiNeSS review | CorPorATe GoverNANCe | FiNANCiAL STATeMeNTS | AddiTioNAL iNForMATioN Notional allocation of debt and interest expense Glencores indebtedness is primarily arranged centrally, with the proceeds then applied to marketing and industrial activities as required.
Glencore does not allocate borrowings or interest to its three operating segments.
However, to assist investors in the assessment of overall performance and underlying value contributors of its integrated business model, Glencore notionally allocates its borrowings and interest expense between its marketing and industrial activities as follows: At a particular point in time, Glencore estimates the borrowings attributable to funding key working capital items within the marketing activities, including inventories, net cash margining and other accounts receivable payable, through the application of an appropriate loan to value ratio for each item.
The balance of Group borrowings is allocated to industrial activities including Glencores stake in Xstrata.
Once the average amount of borrowings notionally allocated to marketing activities for the relevant period has been estimated, the corresponding interest expense on those borrowings is estimated by applying the Groups average variable rate cost of funds during the relevant period to the average borrowing amount.
The balance of Group interest expense and all interest income is allocated to industrial activities.
The allocation is a company estimate only and is unaudited.
The table below summarises the notional allocation of borrowings and interest and corresponding implied earnings before tax of the marketing and industrial activities for the year ended 31December 2012.
Marketing Industrial US$million activities activities Total Adjusted EBIT 2130 2340 4470 Interest expense allocation 342 1029 1371 Interest income allocation 401 401 Allocated profit before tax 1788 1712 3500 Allocated borrowings31December 2012 16668 18858 35526 Allocated borrowingsquarterly average 14765 15714 30479 Based on the implied equity funding for the marketing activities working capital requirements, as well as the relatively modest level of non current assets employed in the marketing activities assumed to be equity funded, the return on notional equity for the marketing activities continued to be very healthy in 2012.
The industrial activities return on notional equity, although respectable, is being held back by mostly mid stage oil, copper, coal and gold development and expansion projects, where significant investments have been made to date, however the projects did not contribute to earnings in the year at anywhere near where their full production potential is expected to be and given the timing of certain acquisitions, noteably Viterra, the full effect of the earnings is yet to be reflected as allocated profits.
SuBSEquENT EVENTS AFFECTINg OuR FINANCIAL POSITION On 26February2013, Glencore-controlled Kazzinc purchased an 89.5% interest in two gold deposits in northern Kazakhstan with combined resources of 75,727tonnes of gold for $179million.
The transaction was accomplished via the purchase of Kazakh company Orion Minerals which owns subsoil rights at the Raigorodok field in the Akmola Region and the Komarovskoye field in the Kostanai region.
