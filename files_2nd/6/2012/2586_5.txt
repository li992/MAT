Summary and outlook This has been another successful year for BTG.
Operational progress has continued at pace, with the first full year of direct CroFaband DigiFabsales generating increases in end-market volumes: the launch of our second direct field force on 1January 2012 for LCBead in the US: the approval from the FDA of Voraxazeand positive results from the PEM Phase III clinical trials.
Biocompatibles has been successfully integrated and we have met our cost savings and earnings enhancement commitments in the first full year of acquisition.
Looking ahead, the Specialty Pharmaceuticals operating segment is expected to see benefits from the commercial launch of Voraxaze in the current financial year as we look to leverage the existing infrastructure to support this potentially life-saving product.
The Interventional Medicine business will benefit from the first full year of direct sales of LC Bead in the US.
