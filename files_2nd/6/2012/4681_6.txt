Financial review Revenue Revenue for 2012 was 241.1 million 2011: 227.7 million which reflected improved sales volumes of edible collagen partially offset by the impact of a weakened euro.
Worldwide demand for collagen casing remains strong and the growth was particularly significant in Japan and Germany, where Select has helped generate additional sales, as well as Eastern Europe, Russia and the Americas.
Year on year growth in revenue can be further analysed as follows: 2012 vs 2011 2011 vs 2010 2010 vs 2009 Volume 5.3% 3.0% 1.4% 0RICE MIX 2.8% 2.2% 4.2% Simon Webb Group Finance Director Foreign exchange -2.2% 1.4% 2.6% Total 5.9% 6.6% 8.2% Sales volumes increased overall, with edible collagen casing increasing by 7.1%, partially offset by a drop in non-edible collagen casing and other products.
0RICE MIX CONTINUES TO HELP THE GROWTH IN SALES WITH THE PREMIUM PRICED Select growing as a proportion of sales.
Price increases averaged 1.0% during the period but were not enough to recover the increases in input costs experienced during the year.
Exchange negatively impacted the growth in sales by -2.2% largely reflecting the weaker euro against sterling.
Operating profit The movement in operating profit between 2011 and 2012 can be analysed as follows: Operating profit 2011 42.7m 0RICE MIX 3.5m Volume 5.2m Manufacturing efficiencies 1.6m Foreign exchange -1.7m Input costs -5.8m Other costs -2.3m Operating profit 2012 43.2m Price mix F THE a MILLION GROWTH IN PROFITS FROM PRICE MIX PRICE ACCOUNTS FOR a MILLION OF THIS AND 1.5 million represents mix.
As we enter 2013, the intention is to look for further selling price increases to recover the significant rises in input costs.
Volume Volumes continued to grow in the business which has helped contribute to an improvement in profitability.
Manufacturing efficiencies We continue to invest in new equipment in order to improve manufacturing efficiencies and productivity.
Much of the additional volume is generated without adding to the number of employees which helps to generate manufacturing efficiencies.
These investments also help reduce the energy consumed per kilometre of casing produced and contribute to improvements in yield.
The 1.6 million additional contribution in 2012 mainly reflects the benefits of the investment in our new lines in Scotland as well as improvements in manufacturing at the US plant in the first half of the year.
Contributions from the ongoing investment in the Czech Republic are expected to start to flow through towards the latter part of 2013.
10 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Business Review Directors Report Financial Statements Shareholder Information Foreign exchange Devro operates worldwide and in multiple currencies as outlined in the table below: % of total 2012 Sales Operating costs Euro 30% 10% Czech koruna 2% 14% APANESE YEN !USTRALIAN DOLLAR 21% 24% US dollar 29% 24% Sterling 12% 28% Others 6% Total 100% 100% A key relationship for the business is between euro and sterling and much of the exchange loss in 2012 over the prior year relates to the weakness of the euro during 2012.
The results are also impacted, but to a lesser extent, by the US and Australian dollar and by the Japanese yen where the significant growth in sales to Japan has given rise to greater exposure.
Devro, on average, hedges approximately 50% of its cash flow foreign exchange exposure for the year ahead.
Input and other costs Input costs rose by 5.8 million reflecting increased raw material costs of 3.3 million, and energy costs of 2.5 million.
Other costs increased by 2.3 million, which included inflation on wages and salaries as well as our continued investment in people and infrastructure in order to support the future growth in the business.
Operating margin The operating margin was 17.9% in 2012 compared to 18.7% in 2011.
In 2012 the margin was adversely impacted by increased input costs and movements in exchange rates.
The higher input costs were only partly recovered by price increases in 2012 and further price increases are planned for 2013.
Adjusted for the adverse movement in exchange rates, the operating margin for 2012 was 18.2%.
Capital investment Capital invested in 2012 was 33 million 2011: 43 million.
The most significant area of investment related to the development of one of our halls in the Czech Republic, which is on track and due for completion in late 2013.
We also invested in our Australian plant in order to update a number of lines which will help provide further growth in 2013.
For 2013 we expect capital expenditure to be up to 35 million excluding any possible investment in upgrading the US facility.
Much of this relates to the completion of the Czech upgrade referred to earlier.
Working capital 2012 2011 m No of days m No of days 28 41 Inventories 28 54 Trade and other receivables 36 53 35 52 Trade and other payables 31 26 34 28 Total 33 29 Cash generation and the optimisation of working capital remain a priority for Devro.
Inventory levels of finished goods were particularly low at the year end which reflects the strong demand.
Trade and other payables reduced due to the timing of capital spend at the year end.
11 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Financial review continued Financing Key financial measures are as follows: 2012 2011 Net debt 26.1m 22.7m.
0.4 0.4 Gearing 17.8% 16.2% Return on capital employed ROCE 19.5% 21.5% Net debt rose in 2012 in line with our expectations as a result of the capital investments made.
The bank revolving facility remains at 51 million and the levels of debt during the year were well within this.
Should a decision be taken to make a significant investment in the USA, the current banking covenants provide adequate headroom to facilitate further borrowing as required.
As expected, ROCE reduced from 21.5% to 19.5% as a result of the significant capital investment programme in 2012, the benefits of which will flow through in late 2013 and 2014.
In particular, there will be considerable extra capacity coming on stream in late 2013 with the completion of the Czech plants upgrade.
ET FINANCE COST INCOME ON PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 1.4 1.2 Total net interest cost income 2.4 0.3 The net interest cost for 2012 was marginally higher than 2011 reflecting the slightly increased debt levels during the year.
4HE NET FINANCE COST INCOME ON PENSIONS REPRESENTS THE INTEREST COST ON THE PENSION liabilities offset by the expected return on the pension assets.
It does not represent the cash or economic cost to the business and from 2013 the accounting for pension interest will CHANGE &OR THIS REASON EARNINGS PER SHARE IS ALSO PRESENTED EXCLUDING NET FINANCE COST income on pension assets and liabilities.

Tax The groups effective tax rate reduced from 20.5% in 2011 to 18.9% in 2012 which reflects the fact that a greater proportion of the groups profits are being made in the Czech Republic where there is a benefit from an investment incentive scheme that is due to continue until 2017.

Pensions The group operates a number of defined benefit schemes around the world.
All of these are closed to new entrants.
The net pension liabilities of these schemes can be analysed as follows: 2012 2011 m m Fair value of scheme assets 203.1 196.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 262.4 242.8 Net pension liabilities 59.3 46.2 The increase in the net pension liability reflects the reduction in discount rates.
Options are continually under review and a plan is in place to address the deficit.
Principal risks and uncertainties There are risks and uncertainties inherent in the groups operations which could have a significant impact on our business, results and financial position.
The groups risk management processes identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate the risks involved in our operations.
The more significant risks to which the group is exposed are: s, OSS OF MARKET SHARE PROFIT MARGINS DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES s $ISRUPTION TO SUPPLY OR INCREASE IN PRICE OF KEY RAW MATERIALS s 0RODUCT CONTAMINATION s &OREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS s 3HORTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH RELEVANT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE s #USTOMER CREDIT RISKS s MPACT OF CHANGES IN REGULATIONS AFFECTING FOOD PRODUCTION s NCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS s NCREASED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF PENSION SCHEMES s $EVELOPMENT OF NON CASING TECHNOLOGIES These are generally consistent with those detailed in the 2011 Annual Report.
Going concern The business renegotiated its banking facilities in September 2011 and has a 5 year revolving facility of 51 million.
As at 31 December 2012 it was operating comfortably within the covenants related to these facilities, and we believe it has sufficient liquidity to fund the future requirements of the business.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
