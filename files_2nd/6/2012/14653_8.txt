Revenue from continuing operations was similar yearonyear at $472.4 million 2011 $470.5 million.
Spirents 2012 acquisitions, Mu Dynamics, Inc. Mu and Metrico Wireless, Inc. Metrico generated $12.7 million of revenue in total since acquisition.
Service Assurance revenues were down $15.7 million yearonyear and our positioning products in Performance Analysis were down by $13.8 million 26 per cent compared with 2011.
Overall Performance Analysis division revenue was up by 4 per cent.
There were some areas of rapid growth: for example, 4G LTE wireless device test, data center switching and high speed Ethernet test.
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2012 the Service Assurance division delivered a much improved result.
