Bovis Homes Group PLC | 27 Financial risk and liquidity The Group largely sees three categories of financial risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Currency risk is not a consideration as the Group trades exclusively in the UK.
With regard to interest rate risk, the Group from time to time will enter into hedge instruments to ensure that the Groups exposure to excessive fluctuations in floating rate borrowings is adequately hedged.
The Group does not have a defined policy for interest rate hedging.
Credit risk is largely mitigated by the fact that the Groups sales are generally made on completion of a legal contract at which point monies are received in return for transfer of title.
During 2012, the Group continued to make a number of sales with the provision of a shared equity investment by the Group as a key part of the Groups sales incentive packages, either via the Government FirstBuy scheme or via the Groups own Jumpstart scheme.
This has led to an increase in the size of the Groups long term receivable Available for Sale Financial Asset balance which at 31 December 2012 was 43.9 million versus 38.7 million at 31 December 2011.
Whilst this does represent an increase in credit risk in total, each individual credit exposure is small given the high number of counter parties.
On average, individual shared equity exposure amounts to 20,000 2011: 23,000.
Details of the Groups financing arrangements are included on page 27.
The Group regards this new facility as adequate in terms of both flexibility and liquidity to cover its medium term cash flow needs.
Financial reporting There have been no changes to the Groups accounting policies during 2012.
