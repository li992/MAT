24 Review of performance In this section Group performance page 25 Divisional performance page 25 Other financial information page 31 Another strong year for GKN with record profits in all four divisions Definitions In this review, financial information, unless otherwise stated, is presented on a management basis which aggregates the sales and trading profit of subsidiaries excluding certain subsidiary businesses sold and closed with the Groups share of the sales and trading profit of joint ventures.
References to trading margins are to trading profit expressed as a percentage of sales.
Management profit or loss before tax is management trading profit less net subsidiary interest payable and receivable and the Groups share of net interest payable and receivable and taxation of joint ventures.
These figures better reflect performance of continuing businesses.
Where appropriate, reference is made to organic results which exclude the impact of acquisitions divestments as well as currency translation on the results of overseas operations.
Operating cash flow is cash generated from operations adjusted for capital expenditure, government capital grants, proceeds from disposal of fixed assets and government refundable advances.
Free cash flow is operating cash flow including interest, tax, joint venture dividends, own shares purchased and amounts paid to non-controlling interests, but excluding dividends paid to GKN shareholders.
Return on average invested capital ROIC is management trading profit as a percentage of average total net assets of continuing subsidiaries and joint ventures excluding current and deferred tax, net debt, post-employment obligations and derivative financial instruments.
Exchange rates Exchange rates used for currencies most relevant to the Groups operations are: Average Year End 2012 2011 2012 2011 Euro 1.23 1.15 1.23 1.20 US dollar 1.58 1.60 1.63 1.55 The approximate impact on 2012 trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures of a 1% movement in the average rate would be euro 1 million, US dollar 2 million.

2O Review of performance GKN Driveline GKN Driveline is a world leading supplier of automotive driveline systems and solutions.
As a global business serving the worlds leading vehicle manufacturers, it develops, builds and supplies an extensive range of automotive driveline products and systems for use in the most sophisticated premium vehicles, that demand complex driving dynamics, to the smallest ultra low-cost cars.
The key financial results for the year are as follows: 2012 2011 Change Headline Organic m % m % Sales m 3,236 2,795 441 16 187 7 Trading Profit m 235 195 40 21 26 14 Trading Margin 7.3% 7.0% ROIC 16.0% 17.0% Getrag Driveline Products was acquired on 30 September 2011 and trading profit in 2011 included acquisition related charges of 3 million.
GKN Drivelines sales increased 16% to 3,236 million 2011: 2,795 million.
The adverse impact of currency translation was 78 million.
The additional period of ownership of Getrag Driveline Products, which was acquired on 30 September 2011, added 339 million of sales which was partly offset by 7 million lower sales resulting from the sale of GKN Drivelines 49% share of the Japanese driveshaft sales and distribution joint venture GKN JTEKT Ltd GTK, in March 2011.
Organic sales increased by 187 million 7%, including Constant Velocity Testing an eDrive gearbox at GKN Driveline Jointed CVJ Systems which grew 6% and non-CVJ sales which increased by 8%, compared with global vehicle production which was up 6%.
GKN Driveline sales by region of origin The Divisions sales are across diverse geographies and platforms.
Its market outperformance was broad based across North America, Europe and China reflecting recent market share gains, $m #m a stronger position in premium vehicles, demand for which continued to be good, and GKN Other India Drivelines broadening product mix, particularly with all-wheel drive AWD systems.
"In Japan, ""#m GKN Driveline was affected less than the market generally by the earthquake in 2011 and China therefore did not benefit from the significant bounce back in production volumes in 2012."
m Furthermore, many of GKN Drivelines sales in Japan are AWD products for cars that are exported, , m Japan including many to China where a political dispute affected sales of Japanese cars in that country.
"Europe ""#m Trading profit increased to 235 million 2011: 195 million."
The impact of currency translation South America was 7 million adverse while the additional period of ownership of Getrag Driveline Products contributed 21 million.
The organic increase in trading profit was 26 million 14%, held back by slower demand in Japan and Europe, operating inefficiencies in India, increased engineering  m North America costs to support new programmes and helped by the absence of 3 million of one-off Getrag Driveline Products acquisition charges that reduced profits in 2011.
GKN Drivelines trading margin was 7.3% 2011: 7.0%.
GKN Driveline sales by product group Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets was 159 million 2011: 113 million, 1.3 times 2011: 1.0 times depreciation.
Return on average invested capital was 16.0% 2011: 17.0%:  m eDrive Systems or 14.7% including the pro forma impact of Getrag Driveline Products.
"During the year, new business wins continued across GKN Drivelines product groups, ""#m #m Transaxle Solutions Other including the CVJ Systems business, significant customer wins in AWD systems, strong gains in electronic differential lockers which is part of Transaxle Solutions and eAxle wins for hybrid vehicles which is part of eDrive."
!m , m GKN Drivelines expansion plans also continued with the addition of its third precision forge AWD Systems CVJ Systems in Celaya, Mexico with an annual capacity of more than 15 million forgings, the expansion of two of its plant in China and the opening of a new plant in Pune, India.
A new innovative manufacturing flow line was also opened at Trier, Germany which automates the production of precision forgings.
This process increases safety and efficiency and reduces inventory and energy consumption.

2Q Review of performance GKN Aerospace GKN Aerospace is a world leading global first tier supplier of airframe and engine structures, components, assemblies and transparencies to a wide range of aircraft and engine prime contractors and other first tier suppliers.
It operates in three main product areas: aerostructures, engine components and sub-systems, and special products.
The overall aerospace market remained positive in 2012 driven by a growing commercial aircraft market partly offset by a more subdued military market.
The division has increased its sales for commercial air transport to 64%, with military representing 36%.
In the commercial aerospace market, preliminary data indicate that passenger air traffic rose around 5% in 2012 and is projected to continue to grow at a similar pace throughout 2013.
Longer term worldwide passenger market demand is projected to grow at around 5% with worldwide cargo traffic market growth at around 6%.
Commercial aircraft production is expected to grow strongly with Airbus and Boeing continuing to project the procurement of new single aisle and wide-bodied aircraft at between 28,000 and 34,000 by 2030.
Both companies continue to benefit from increasing deliveries and record order backlog.
This sustained order growth led both Airbus and Boeing to increase production levels for single aisle and wide-bodied aircraft.
The business jet market is also showing some signs of recovery.
Worldwide military spending remains under pressure, largely driven by cutbacks throughout Europe and likely reductions in the US Defense Budget.
GKNs position on key multi-year programmes such as the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter, F A-18 Super Hornet, F-15 Eagle and Integration of inner, mid and outer spars for an A350 fixed C-130J Super Hercules provide a stable production base despite potential budget pressure trailing edge wing and delay in the F-35 programme ramp-up.

"m Aerostructures GKN Aerospace sales of 1,775 million were 294 million higher than the prior year 2011: #""!m 1,481 million."
The impact from currency on translation of sales was 7 million positive.
Special products The first time contribution of Volvo Aero acquired on 1 October 2012 was 191 million and sales from disposals was 15 million negative, representing sales from the Engineering Services division, which was sold in November 2011.
The organic increase in sales of 111 million represented an 8% increase.
This level of increase reflects 2% lower production rates on military programmes, such as the C-17, F-15 and F-18, being more than offset by 15% higher commercial sales, particularly for the Airbus A320, A330 and the Boeing 787.
2R GKN Aerospace sales by market As previously reported with the 2012 half year results, as part of the finalisation of commercial contracts relating to the Filton acquisition, it has been agreed that GKN Aerospace would cease managing a supply chain contract on behalf of Airbus from the end of 2012, which has an annual sales value of around 100 million.
However, its trading profit will only reduce slightly and its trading margin will improve, due to the lower margin earned on this pass-through business.
% % Military Trading profit in 2012 increased by 4 million to 170 million 2011: 166 million.
The impact Civil from currency on translation of results was 1 million positive and the lower than anticipated volumes through the new A350 facility reduced profit by around 11 million.
Volvo Aero generated a trading profit of 15 million before incurring 22 million of one-off restructuring and transaction costs.
The inventory fair-value adjustment and pension scheme curtailment credit in relation to Volvo Aero are taken outside of management figures and details can be found on page 31 and page 34, respectively.
The trading margin was unchanged at 11.2%, excluding Volvo Aero.
Capital expenditure on tangible assets in 2012 amounted to 42 million 2011: 59 million which represents 1.0 times depreciation 2011: 1.7 times.
Expenditure on intangible assets, mainly initial non-recurring programme costs, was 50 million 2011: 35 million.
21 million of the capital expenditure and non-recurring programme costs, including 3 million of capitalised borrowing costs, relate to the A350 wing assembly and trailing edge programme.
A total of 153 million had been invested on this programme by 31 December 2012, excluding 16 million of capitalised borrowing costs.
Spending is likely to reduce to around 25 million in 2013.
Customer advances in the GKN Aerospace businesses, which are shown in trade and other payables in the balance sheet, amounted to 66 million 2011: 63 million.
Return on average invested capital was 23.0% 2011: 22.7%, excluding Volvo Aero.
During the year a number of important new contracts worth around $1.4 billion and other milestones were achieved, including: n Establishing a new composite aerostructures manufacturing facility in Mexico to manufacture composite airframe structures, initially for the Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.
n Winning new contracts to provide key metal and composite structures and fuel systems for the new 525 Relentless Bell helicopter.
n A new contract for the design, development and production of transparencies cockpit and passenger cabin windows, winglets and ailerons for the Bombardier Global 7000 and Global 8000 business jets.
n Further work packages for the Boeing 787 relating to floor sections, wing ribs and seat tracks.
n A multi-year contract extension for the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.
30 Review of performance GKN Land Systems GKN Land Systems is a leading supplier of technology differentiated power management solutions and services.
It designs, manufactures and supplies products and services for the agricultural, construction, mining and utility vehicle markets and key industrial segments, offering integrated powertrain solutions.
Sales in GKN Land Systems were ahead of the prior year although its markets were very mixed.
The agricultural equipment market continued to enjoy good growth whereas construction, mining, industrial and automotive markets became more challenging as the year progressed, particularly in Europe.
Industrial markets were particularly volatile in certain segments, including wind, with weakness particularly acute in certain regions, such as Europe.
Automotive structures activity declined slightly due to some planned programme cessations with further reductions anticipated in 2013.
The key financial results for the year are as follows: 2012 2011 Change Headline Organic m % m % Sales m 933 885 48 56 1 Trading Profit m 88 67 21 31 15 23 Trading Margin 9.4% 7.6% ROIC 21.3% 29.5% Stromag was acquired on 5 September 2011 and trading profit in 2011 included acquisition related charges of Inspecting lead angle of a fan hub at GKN Land Systems 5 million.
Against this background, sales in the period were 933 million, 5% higher than the prior year GKN Land Systems sales by market 2011: 885 million.
The negative impact of currency translation was 30 million.
Excluding the 72 million of sales attributable to the additional period of ownership of Stromag, which was acquired on 5 September 2011, the organic increase in sales was 6 million 1%.
"""$m Construction and Mining GKN Land Systems reported a 31% increase in trading profit to 88 million 2011: 67 million."
Organic trading profit increased within GKN Land Systems, principally driven by pricing actions and productivity improvements.
"The additional period of ownership of Stromag m  #""m contributed 9 million."
The trading margin was 9.4% compared with 7.6% in 2011, reflecting Agriculture Industrial the strong increase in profitability of the division and the absence of 5 million of one-off Stromag acquisition charges that reduced profits in 2011.
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets was 20 million 2011: 18 million, 1.2 times 2011: 1.3 times depreciation.

31 Other Businesses GKNs Other Businesses comprise Cylinder Liners, which is mainly a 59% owned venture in China, manufacturing engine liners for the truck market in the US, Europe and China and a 50% share in Emitec, which manufactures metallic substrates for catalytic converters in Germany, the US, China and India.
Sales in the year were 86 million 2011: 106 million, reflecting the slowing sales in the commercial vehicle market.
GKNs Other Businesses reported a trading loss of 4 million 2011: trading profit of 3 million.
Impact on prior year comparatives In 2011, there was a net 19 million cost due to the temporary closure of the Hoeganaes Gallatin plant in the US, following a hydrogen explosion.
Other financial information Corporate costs Corporate costs, which comprise the costs of stewardship of the Group and operating charges and credits associated with the Groups legacy businesses, were 21 million 2011: 16 million.
Change in value of derivative and other financial instruments The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge much of its transactional exposure.
At 31 December 2012, the net fair value of such instruments was an asset of 33 million 2011: net liability of 84 million.
Where hedge accounting has not been applied, the change in fair value is reflected in the income statement as a component of operating profit and resulted in a credit of 117 million 2011: 29 million charge.
There was a 1 million charge arising from the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives in the year 2011: 3 million charge and a net gain of 9 million attributable to the currency impact on Group funding balances 2011: 2 million net gain.
There was a 1 million gain due to the change in the fair value of GKN Powder Metallurgy commodity contracts 2011: 1 million loss.
Amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations The charge for the amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations for example customer contracts, order backlog, technology and intellectual property rights was 37 million 2011: 22 million.
The increase relates to the impact of the Getrag Driveline Products and Stromag acquisitions in September 2011 and the Volvo Aero acquisition on 1 October 2012.
Gains and losses on changes in Group structure During the year the Group sold GKN Geplasmetal S. A. for cash consideration of 3 million realising a profit of 1 million and its 49% share in a joint venture company, GKN JTEKT Thailand Limited for cash consideration of 1 million, realising neither a profit nor loss.
In addition a gain of 4 million was realised after final settlement of contingent consideration relating to a previous transaction.
Reversal of inventory fair value adjustment arising on business combinations The inventory fair value adjustment of 37 million arising on acquisition of Volvo Aero reversed in full before the year end.
Post-tax earnings of joint ventures In management figures, the sales and trading profits of joint ventures are included pro-rata in the individual divisions to which they relate, although shown separately post-tax in the statutory income statement.
The Groups share of post-tax earnings of joint ventures in the year was 38 million 2011: 38 million.
Post-tax earnings on a management basis were 41 million 2011: 40 million, with trading profit of 49 million 2011: 49 million.
The Groups share of the tax charge amounted to 7 million 2011: 8 million with an interest charge of 1 million 2011: 1 million.
Underlying trading profit decreased 1 million reflecting a slow-down in sales to the commercial vehicle market within Other Businesses.
32 Review of performance Net financing costs Net financing costs totalled 78 million 2011: 61 million and include the non-cash charge on post-employment benefits of 20 million 2011: 17 million and unwind of discounts of 6 million 2011: 2 million.
Interest payable was 60 million 2011: 47 million, whilst interest receivable was 8 million 2011: 5 million resulting in net interest payable of 52 million 2011: 42 million.
Capitalised interest costs attributable to the Groups A350 investment were 5 million 2011: 6 million and interest charged on UK Government refundable advances was 5 million 2011: 2 million.
The non-cash charge on post-employment benefits arises as the expected return on scheme assets of 138 million 2011: 153 million was more than offset by interest on post-employment obligations of 158 million 2011: 170 million.
Details of the assumptions used in calculating post-employment costs and income are provided in note 25.
Profit before tax Management profit before tax of continuing operations m The management profit before tax was 497 million 2011: 417 million.
The profit before tax on a statutory basis was 588 million 2011: 351 million.
$ Taxation The book tax rate on management profits of subsidiaries was 16% 2011: 16%, arising as a # # 74 million tax charge on management profits of subsidiaries of 456 million.
The Groups theoretical weighted average tax rate, which assumes that book profits losses !
are taxed at the statutory tax rates in the countries in which they arise, is 32% 2011: 31%.
The book tax rate is significantly lower, largely because of the recognition of substantial deferred tax assets mainly in the US and UK due to increased confidence in the Groups  ability both to access and realise future taxable profits that absorb brought forward tax deductions, partially offset by an increase in the Groups provision for uncertain tax positions.
One of GKNs tax objectives is to utilise prior years tax losses in order to reduce the cash tax charge on management profits.
Cash tax provides a proxy for the cash cost of taxation of management profits.
In the near term, the cash      tax rate is expected to continue at or below 20% due to further utilisation of brought forward tax deductions.
The tax rate on statutory profits of subsidiaries was 15% 2011: 14% arising as an 85 million tax charge on statutory profits of 550 million.
Non-controlling interests The profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 23 million 2011: 27 million including a 20 million 2011: 21 million impact from the pension partnership arrangement.
Earnings per share Management earnings per share pence Management earnings per share was 26.5 pence 2011: 22.6 pence, including the effect of the 19 million net charge relating to the Hoeganaes incident at Gallatin, US.
basis earnings per share was 30.2 pence 2011: 18.0 pence.
2012 were 1,587.8 million see note 7 for further details.
In view of the improving trading performance and taking into account the Groups future prospects, the Board has decided to recommend a final dividend of 4.8 pence per share !.
The total dividend for the year will, therefore, be 7.2 pence per share 2011: 6.0 pence.
The Groups objective is to have a progressive dividend policy reflecting growth.
in earnings per share and free cash flow generation, including the pension deficit funding.
The final dividend is payable on 20 May 2013 to shareholders on the register at 12 April 2013.
Shareholders may choose to use the Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP to reinvest the final dividend.

"The net amount included within trading profit of 42 million 2011: 33 million includes "" "" the current service cost of 44 million 2011: 38 million partly offset by past service credits and settlement credits."
The increase in service cost is primarily attributable to the UK and includes the effects of increases in pensionable payroll and the removal of age related rebates from April 2012 due to the UK Governments abolition of contracting out rules this      contracting out effect is partly offset by lower national insurance payments within the staff costs component of the Income Statement.
The net post-employment finance charge of 20 million 2011: 17 million has risen slightly due to interest costs on liabilities being more than offset by lower expected returns on scheme assets.

In addition, 30 million was distributed from the pension partnership to the UK pension scheme in June 2012. Business review.
34 Review of performance UK pensions During the year, the UK defined benefit pension scheme was split into two separate schemes each with different characteristics.
Both schemes are funded, defined benefit plans: one of the schemes primarily comprises pensioner members associated with businesses no longer owned by GKN, whilst the other comprises other pensioner and deferred members as well as current employees who accrue future benefits on a career average basis.
A hybrid pension plan providing a combination of defined benefit and defined contribution benefits is currently open to new members.
Members currently in employment with the Company represent approximately 17% of total liabilities of 2,846 million 2011: 2,650 million.
The accounting deficit at 31 December 2012 of 324 million was 65 million higher than the deficit at the end of 2011.
December 2012 asset values were above those of end December 2011 but the valuations of liabilities at 31 December 2012 were 196 million higher.
This increase in liabilities largely reflected a 60 basis point reduction in discount rate to 4.1%.
Overseas pensions Overseas pension obligations arise mainly in the US, Germany and Japan.
The overseas pension deficit increased by 40 million to 579 million.
This included a 97 million adverse impact from actuarial assumptions, offset to an extent by a US curtailment gain.
On 1 April 2012 the Group transferred the assets and liabilities of its defined benefit pension scheme of the hourly paid workers at GKN Aerospaces St. Louis facility in the US to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAM National Pension Fund.
As a result there was a net pension scheme curtailment benefit of 35 million.
When acquiring Volvo Aero, the Group wished to minimise its exposure to historic Swedish pension liabilities and, therefore, a portion of the agreed acquisition price was set aside in order to insure against this risk on completion of the deal.
On acquisition, the Group assumed a defined benefit pension deficit of 67 million, 64 million of which related to a Swedish pension scheme.
Shortly after the acquisition, the Group spent 46 million to fund a fully insured buy-out of the Swedish pension scheme with a third party insurer, thereby taking control of a business in which pensions had been largely fide-risked.
This resulted in a net pension curtailment credit of 18 million recognised in the Income Statement, in addition to a credit of 10 million on the settlement of associated payroll taxes, which took the total curtailment credit for the Swedish pension arrangements to 28 million.
Retiree medical and life insurance GKN operates retiree medical and life insurance arrangements in North America and the Group also has a UK scheme which has been closed to new members for many years.
The obligation in respect of all schemes at the end of the year was 75 million compared with 70 million at the end of 2011, the movement being caused principally by changed actuarial assumptions.
Defined contribution pension schemes Besides the above defined benefit pension schemes, the Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in relation to which the 2012 income statement charge was 21 million.
2013 reporting changes 2013 will see the new requirements of IAS 19 introduced with the primary impact on the Group being an increase in other net financing charge of around 20 million.
Additionally, the Company will review the structure of the pension partnership arrangement which, subject to the consent of the Trustees, may result in an increase to the IAS 19 reported UK deficit and related other net financing charge in 2013.
If these partnership changes were effective from the start of 2013 the reported deficit would increase by around 340 million and 2013 other net financing charge would increase by a further 14 million.
None of the above reporting changes would impact the underlying cash flows paid to the UK Pension scheme.
3N Net assets Net assets of 1,927 million were 303 million higher than the December 2011 year end figure of 1,624 million.
The increase includes actuarial losses on post-employment obligations net of tax of 73 million, adverse currency movements net of tax of 134 million and dividends paid to equity shareholders of 101 million offset by retained profit of 503 million and net proceeds from an equity placing of 137 million.
Financing The following section describes the way in which the Group manages and controls its treasury function and ensures it is financed in an appropriate and cost-effective manner.
Treasury management All treasury activities are co-ordinated through a central function Group Treasury, the purpose of which is to manage the financial risks of the Group and to secure short and long term funding at the minimum cost to the Group.
It operates within a framework of clearly defined Board-approved policies and procedures, including permissible funding and hedging instruments, exposure limits and a system of authorities for the approval and execution of transactions.
It operates on a cost centre basis and is not permitted to make use of financial instruments or other derivatives other than to hedge identified exposures of the Group.
Speculative use of such instruments or derivatives is not permitted.
Group Treasury prepares reports at least annually to the Board, and on a monthly basis to the Finance Director and other senior executives of the Group.
In addition, liquidity, interest rate, currency and other financial risk exposures are monitored weekly.
The overall indebtedness of the Group is reported on a weekly basis to the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
The Group Treasury function is subject to an annual internal and external review of controls.
Funding, liquidity and going concern At 31 December 2012, UK committed bank facilities were 917 million, 837 million of which were committed revolving credit facilities together with an 80 million eight-year amortising facility from the European Investment Bank EIB.
The next major maturities of the committed bank facilities are 592 million in 2016.
At 31 December 2012, the 80 million facility from the EIB was fully drawn and drawings against the revolving credit facilities were 77 million, leaving undrawn, committed UK borrowing facilities totalling 760 million.
Capital market borrowings were 800 million at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: 526 million and include existing unsecured 350 million 6.75% bonds maturing in October 2019 and new unsecured 450 million 5.375% bonds maturing in September 2022.
The weighted average maturity profile of the Groups committed borrowing facilities was 6.1 years.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had net borrowings of 871 million.
All of the Groups committed credit facilities have a financial covenant requiring EBITDA of subsidiaries to be at least 3.5 times net financing costs and net debt must be no greater than 3 times EBITDA of subsidiaries.
The covenants are tested every six months using the previous 12 months results.
For the 12 months to 31 December 2012, EBITDA was 13 times greater than net interest, whilst net debt was 1.2 times EBITDA.
The Directors have taken into account both divisional and Group forecasts to assess the future funding requirements of the Group and compared them to the level of committed available borrowing facilities, described above.
The Directors have concluded that the Group will have a sufficient level of headroom in the foreseeable future and that the likelihood of breaching covenants in this period is remote, such that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.
