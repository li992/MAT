Financial review This commentary and analysis of our financial results for the year ended 31 March 2012 provides an overview of our financial performance relative to the groups results for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Further detail on the performance of our business divisions is provided in the divisional review section of this report.
The financial information discussed below is based on the period under review, and may not necessarily reflect the financial condition or results of the operations of the group going forward.
Presentation of financial information Introduction Investec operates under a DLC structure with premium primary listings of Investec plc on the London Stock Exchange and Investec Limited on the JSE Limited.
In terms of the contracts constituting the DLC structure, Investec plc and Investec Limited effectively form a single economic enterprise in which the economic and voting rights of ordinary shareholders of the companies are maintained in equilibrium relative to each other.
The directors of the two companies consider that for financial reporting purposes, the fairest presentation is achieved by combining the results and financial position of both companies.
Accordingly, the year-end results for Investec plc and Investec Limited present the results and financial position of the combined DLC group under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, denominated in Pounds Sterling.
All references in this document to Investec or the group relate to the combined DLC group comprising Investec plc and Investec Limited.
Exchange rates Our reporting currency is Pounds Sterling.
Certain of our operations are conducted by entities outside the UK.
The results of operations and the financial condition of our individual companies are reported in the local currencies of the countries in which they are domiciled, including Rands, Australian Dollars, Euros and US Dollars.
These results are then translated into Pounds Sterling at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our combined consolidated financial results.
In the case of the income statement, the weighted average rate for the relevant period is applied and, in the case of the balance sheet, the relevant closing rate is used.
The following table sets out the movements in certain relevant exchange rates against Pounds Sterling over the period.

The most significant impact arises from the volatility of the Rand.
The average Rand: Pounds Sterling exchange rate over the period has depreciated by 6.2% and the closing rate has depreciated by 12.8% since 31 March 2011.
The following table provides an analysis of the impact of the Rand appreciation on our reported numbers.

Investec integrated annual report 2012 | Operating financial review 33 Financial review continued An overview of the operating environment impacting our SAs private business sector was South Africa ranked highly South Africa achieved economic growth of close to 3.0% in 2011 12, similar to the year in global before, as the countrys long-term wealth creation trend was re-established.
Growth has comparisons tended to average 3.3% year-on-year over the ANCs tenure, from 1994 to date, and real incomes per capita have risen to a large extent, from R27 521 per person in 1993 to on its financial R38 734 in 2011.
It has been a situation where growth begets growth.
The compounding system second effect of 18 years of virtually uninterrupted economic expansion has considerably raised incomes and the size of the economy.
Inflation has been consistently combated and South in terms of Africans have, in the main, experienced a higher standard of living each year.
There are now soundness of substantially fewer individuals in the lowest income and living standard measures when compared to 1994.
The poor have benefited from a massive rollout of services although banks from sixth further rollout and substantially improved quality is outstanding.
Welfare payments, have previously, been responsible from lifting many out of the lowest living standard and income measures.
reporting, Stubbornly high levels of unemployment due chiefly to a skills mismatch and attendant poverty with a Gini coefficient above 60 representing a high degree of income inequality in auditing and part belies this positive income story.
However, without the significant rise in wealth levels and reporting concomitant expansion in government tax revenues the sustained deepening of the welfare net could not have occurred.
standards first again Once again, according to the Global Competitiveness Report, South Africas private sector was ranked highly on its financial system.
Soundness of banks was ranked second from and efficacy of sixth previously, auditing and reporting standards were ranked first again and efficacy of corporate boards corporate boards was ranked second again.
South Africas fiscal deficit shrank, from 6.5% of GDP in 2009 10 to 4.8% in 2011 12, as the economy experienced its second year of second again.
significant expansion, and clearly no monies were needed for financial sector bailouts.
The deficit is expected to drop to 3.0% year-on-year in 2014 15 as fiscal health improves further on strengthening growth we expect growth will approach 5.0% year-on-year by 2014 15.
The resultant real rise in incomes and tax revenues will fund both welfare and vitally needed services such as education and health.
This is key, as the achievement of a low, single digit unemployment rate will depend on adequate education and poverty reduction.
South Africas low level of sovereign debt 33.3% of GDP means it can comfortably increase borrowings expected to peak at 38.5% of GDP in 2014 15 to fund capital investment both fixed and human and governments proposed R3 trillion infrastructure rollout.
Effective, and consistent, implementation of this infrastructure rollout, with the necessary private sector involvement, has the potential to eradicate structural unemployment and so considerably reduce poverty and inequality within thirty years.
United Kingdom Over the 2011 12 financial year, the UK economy remained weak.
The latest statistics from the Office for National Statistics show the UK economy having reported only one quarter of growth, contracting in the remaining three quarters.
As the year closed, UK GDP still stood 4.3% below its pre-recession peak.
Seeking to support the UK economy onto some form of recovery footing, and having fended off calls for tighter policy as inflation trended upwards, the UK Monetary Policy Committee kept policy highly expansionary during the period under review.
The official bank rate remained at 0.5% throughout the year, marking three years of record low rates in March 2012.
Signs of a slowdown in the economy and a tightening in credit conditions resulted in the committee sanctioning further Quantitative Easing QE in October 2011.
Originally the MPC voted to add a further 75 billion of asset purchases to take the target to 275 billion, but the Committee raised the QE target by another 50 billion in February 2012 to 325 billion.
The UKs long-term sovereign credit rating remained at AAA according to all the main ratings agencies, but both Moodys and Fitch placed Britain on a negative outlook in the 2011 12 period.
However, there was not a perceptible market reaction to this news with confidence aided by the Chancellors continued tough emphasis on Plan A for fiscal consolidation.
34 Investec integrated annual report 2012 | Operating financial review Eurozone As the 2011 12 financial year got underway, the Euro area economy was showing signs of recovery, assisted by some settling in Euro crisis tensions.
With inflation having been subject to upward pressures following increases in oil and commodity prices, the ECB Governing Council voted to raise its main refinancing rate by 25bps in both April and July 2011, to 1.5%.
When the ECB voted to lift the refi rate in July the economic outlook had already begun to deteriorate rapidly, not helped by agreement on a second Greek bailout unravelling fairly soon after it was announced.
Further, talk of private sector bondholder losses, subsequently enforced, also raised the level of unease.
From June 2011, concerns over the vulnerability of various peripheral Euro area sovereign markets, especially Italy and Spain, also began to weigh more heavily on markets, triggering a sharp tightening in credit conditions through summer 2011 onwards.
To help get the flow of credit moving again, and to assist banks in refinancing an estimated 240 billion of maturing liabilities in the first three months of 2012, the ECB held two three-year Longer-Term Refinancing Operations LTROs, whose combined take-up exceeded 1 trillion.
Indeed at the end of March 2012 the Eurosystem had over 750 billion of excess liquidity.
The second Greek bailout was eventually renegotiated and rubber stamped in March 2012, easing fears of an uncontrolled default by the Hellenic Republic.
Sentiment was also stabilised towards the end of the financial year by Euro area authorities giving the go ahead to run the two rescue facilities, the European Financial Stability Facility and its replacement, the European Stability Mechanism, in tandem, thereby raising Europes bailout capacity by 200 billion to 700 billion.
As the financial year closed, the Euro area economy appeared to be showing some signs of stabilisation, albeit at very low levels with the Euro area economy likely to have contracted again in the first half of 2012.
With Euro crisis risks continuing to loom large and with Spain and Italy still in the frame for further bouts of contagion, the Eurozone entered the new 2012 13 financial year on a weak and vulnerable footing.
Australia As the 2011 12 financial year got underway, the Australian economy was recovering quickly from the floods that weighed heavily on the Q1 2011 growth outturn.
In the third and fourth quarters the economy continued to expand, but at a more moderate pace than in Q2.
Consumption and investment remained robust through the year, with the latter continuing to gain support from buoyant Asian resource demand.
As fears over the Euro area debt crisis, and some signs of slowing growth in China risked weighing on growth in the period ahead, the Reserve Bank opted to add the safety net of a cut in the cash rate, reducing it by 25bps in November and December 2011 to 4.25%.
A few nerves over possible upside risks to inflation, as oil prices began to track upwards again at the turn of 2012, put on ice any further moves to ease policy at the start of 2012.
As the financial year closed the cash rate remained at 4.25%.
The Australian Dollar exhibited periods of extreme strength at points during the period, exceeding the USD1.10 level in July 2011.
It was then subject to selling pressure in October and November as risk-appetite took a hit: this took it below parity, but it subsequently closed the 2011 12 financial year at USD1.0350.
United States The US economy continued to grow moderately through the 2011 12 financial year, with disruption from political fights over the US debt ceiling, and the impact of spring 2011s sharp increase in oil prices, weighing on growth, but not putting the brakes on recovery altogether.
In the period under review US GDP surpassed its pre-recession peak, with the continued growth helping to bring the unemployment rate down from 9.0% in April 2011 to 8.2% in March 2012.
Over the financial year as a whole, the US economy grew by 1.7%.
However, housing market activity remained heavily depressed, with only a few signs of a modest increase in activity appearing at the turn of 2012.
US monetary policy remained highly accommodating throughout the financial year, with the Federal Reserve having stayed nervous about the downside risks posed, particularly by the continuation of the Euro area sovereign debt crisis.
Not content with the pace of improvement in the labour market and fearful of the Euro crisis, the Fed sought to ease policy by introducing written guidance into its policy statements in August 2011.
The statements sought to convince markets that Fed policy would remain loose for a sustained period, with the wording of the statement in August implying the Federal funds target rate would remain close to current lows, of 0.0% 0.25% until mid-2013.
In January 2012, the Federal Reserve extended that language to imply that rates would remain low for even longer, until at least through late-2014.
Fears over the sluggishness of the US housing sector, and the extent to which this could weigh on the jobs recovery, may have been the decisive factor in encouraging the Fed to embark on Operation Twist in September 2011.
Under the programme, the Fed is selling USD400 billion of shorter-term Treasury securities and using the proceeds to buy longer-term Treasury securities, extending the average maturity of the Feds security portfolio and aiming to put downward pressure on longer-term rates.
As the final quarter of the 2011 12 financial year progressed, the US appeared to shift onto a firmer recovery footing, with survey data continuing to have firmed and with the jobs recovery somewhat brighter too.
As the financial year drew to a close, the US outlook remained bright, but with the threat of an oil price increase weighing on consumer spending and growth, a continuing threat.
