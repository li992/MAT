Jonathan Sorrell Chief Financial Officer Overview Key performance indicators KPIs 2012 has clearly been another challenging year for the financial markets Our financial KPIs illustrate and measure the relationship between the and for Man.

We have reviewed our KPIs this year to ensure they are appropriate The significant impairment of the goodwill relating to the GLG business measures for our changing business.
Since our previous KPIs were $837 million and the legacy Multi-Manager business $142 million was established, the Groups business and operating environment has the main driver of the statutory loss of $745 million for the year.
As a result, the Board has changed all of our KPIs this year to four new metrics that more simply and accurately measure the performance of the business.
Our four new KPIs comprise measures Gross management fee margins for each product type remained stable for investment performance, investor flows, EBITDA margin, and EPS but with the continued decline in the guaranteed product business the growth, which are explained in more detail on the opposite page.

We have taken actions to realign our cost base with the current revenue run rate, KPIs are used on a regular basis to evaluate progress against our five key and have delivered the $95 million of cost savings announced in late priorities: investment performance: creating options for growth: 2011 January 2012 and are on track to deliver the additional $100 million distribution effectiveness: cost reduction: and balance sheet efficiency.

The cash impact of the adjusting items is a net cash inflow of around $60 million.
The comparative information for the adjusted management fee EPS growth KPI is for the previous nine month period to 31 December 2011 As well as focusing on reducing our cost base, we have taken a number annualised : therefore, the 2011 information is not directly comparable to ofactions to enhance Mans capital and liquidity position during 2012, the current year for this KPI.
We have provided comparative information including the realisation of the Lehman claim assets and the repayment for all KPIs for the previous nine month period to 31 December 2011 only.

FRM, whilst recording positive performance, was below the benchmark in 2012, primarily as their portfolios generally carry less equity market beta than the broader indices.
