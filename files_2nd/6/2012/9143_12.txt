Our business 46 Financial review Revenue has slightly decreased by 5% 110m, as a result of the Operating profit current market conditions across many of our UK businesses.
In Construction, our pipeline is strong: however our key focus remains attracting quality work and we will not seek growth of our revenue at 5% the expense of that quality, preferring to utilise our technical skills to 74.4m 2012 provide the best solution to clients.
In Services, revenue declined as 71.1m 2011 a result of a lower level of activity in our Maintenance business, which has been expected as a result of the ongoing budget pressures faced Including joint ventures, before the amortisation by our local authority customers, particularly in the area of planned of intangible assets relating to contract rights.
This was partially mitigated by an improvement in the FM and Environmental businesses in which revenue improved through successful contract renewals and extensions.
Operating pro t including joint ventures, before the amortisation of intangible assets relating to contract rights, was 5% ahead of last year at 74.4m.
The operating margin in Construction of 2.5%, bene tted from the completion of contracts secured when pricing was less competitive and as a result of our prudent pro t recognition policy.
In Services, we have maintained an operating margin of 4.5%, which is a good result in light of the lower level of planned and capital works which has affected our Maintenance activities.
The sizeable growth in operating pro t in Property results from the ongoing progress of our 750m property development pipeline, the good level of housing sales achieved and the disposal of two of our PFI investments, which generated a 6.7m operating pro t. Detailed information on the operating performance of each of the divisions is provided within the business review.
Corporate costs at 2.9m have reduced considerably compared to 2011, primarily due to a reduced pension charge relating to Corporate costs our fide ned bene t pension schemes, and are analysed in the 2012 2011 Change m m m adjacent table.
Unrecovered overhead 0.6 0.4 0.2 This reduction is a direct result of changes in the underlying Pension charge 2.3 4.8 2.5 pension assumptions, in particular the discount rate and the expected return on assets.
This is covered in more detail in the 2.9 5.2 2.3 pensions section of this review.
The Groups net finance cost, analysed below, includes interest receivable arising from average month-end net cash balances of 95m for the year 2011: 129m after considerable investment during the year, and re ects a reduction in the sub debt interest receivable following the ongoing PFI investment disposals.
The increase in interest payable includes the fees following the extension of our revolving credit facilities, which now total 120m and are available until September 2016.
The unwinding of the discount on long-term liabilities and the share of joint venture interest, when combined, have not signi cantly increased.
The change in presentation is a result of the Lloyds property portfolio acquisition in April 2011, which we now consolidate, whereas prior to April 2011 its results were equity accounted.

This includes a joint venture tax charge of 0.2m 2011: 0.3m and is stated before minority interests of 1.1m 2011: 0.5m.
The minority interest relates to the share of pro ts of our Maintenance business which are attributable to contracts with local authorities.
The Groups effective tax rate, including joint venture tax on joint venture pro ts, has reduced from 19% last year to 13% mainly as a result the successful completion of negotiations with HMRC, which began in 2010, and the reduction in the standard corporation tax rate to 24%.

Construction has also seen a 120 one-off cash unwind of approximately 30m following major project completions.

However, in one area the workload is now forecast to be below the contracted amount and 5,500 therefore we have prudently adjusted the order book to re ect this, which has had a negative impact of 180m, as shown in the -180 645 5,000 graph to the left.

During the period to August 2012, we completed and announced Net assets 2011: 164m two acquisitions as follows: in April 2012, we acquired certain of the construction 154m operations of Aberdeen-based Stewart Milne for a total cash consideration of 1m paid on completion: and Average month-end net cash in August 2012, we completed our investment in Biogen UK Limited for a maximum total investment of 24.4m, of which 2012 95m 5.4m was invested on completion.

This decrease re ects unit and land Residential work in progress 124 133 sales over the year, partially offset by investment in work in progress in our mixed-tenure housing business.

In the year, we completed 18m of land sales on deferred cash terms, at an average breakeven pro t position.
As we have stated previously, the majority of our land was purchased before 2008 and therefore we do not anticipate recognising pro t from land sales, the focus being on cash generation.
Pensions The Group participates in two principal schemes: the Kier Group Pension Scheme, which includes a fide ned bene t section, and a fide ned bene t scheme on behalf of its employees in Kier Shef eld LLP.
The financial statements re ect the pension scheme fide cits calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
Workload Our business 50 Financial review At 30 June 2012, the net fide cit under the Kier Group Pension Scheme was 45m 2011: 23m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 722m 2011: 680m and the net present value of the liabilities was 781m 2011: 711m.
The increase in the net fide cit is a result of changes in the key assumptions.
The decrease in discount rate to 4.7% 2011: 5.5% increased the liabilities, while the changes in in ation and the return on the assets, combined with the ongoing contributions mitigated this to some extent.
We continue to progress with our recovery plan of additional annual fide cit contributions of 8m and we make available our PFI investments where appropriate.
In December 2011 we transferred our Hinchingbrooke investment for 3m to the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
The Group is committed to continuing to support the funding position of the scheme.
At 30 June 2012, the scheme relating to Kier Shef eld LLP showed a net surplus position of 1m 2011: net surplus 1m.
Note 8 to the financial statements includes a sensitivity analysis that highlights the impact of changes to the key assumptions to the Kier Group Pension Scheme and the Kier Shef eld LLP Pension Scheme.
Net pension charges of 2.3m 2011: 4.8m have been made to the income statement in accordance with IAS 19.
The lower charge re ects the higher return on scheme assets.
IAS 19 re-presentation The new pensions accounting will come into force for us for the Interest charge on net deficit indicative only June 2014 financial year, and will therefore require restatement 2012 2012 Using June 2012 pre-tax gures Current New Change of the 2013 gures, as comparatives.
The expected return on m m m scheme assets and the interest cost on scheme liabilities which are currently reported in the income statement will be replaced Service cost 12.7 12.7 with an interest charge on the net fide cit, as shown indicatively in Expected return on scheme assets 57.7 the table to the left.
June 2011: 7.0% Interest cost on scheme liabilities 47.3 The difference of 12m, in this example, will be re-presented in June 2011: 5.5% the statement of comprehensive income.
The quantum of the change relates to the difference between the expected return Interest on net fide cit 1.6 on assets and the discount rate.
The greater this difference, June 2011: 5.5% the greater the impact of the change in 2014, and vice versa.
Total 2.3 14.3 12.0 It should be noted however, that this accounting change has no impact on cash and no impact on the pension fide cit.
It is simply 10.4m net credit is represented as 1.6m charge.

Going concern The directors report states that appropriate enquiries have been made regarding the level of resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and the chief executives review highlights the activities of the Group and those factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position.
The Group has considerable financial resources, committed banking facilities, long-term contracts and a strong order book, and for this reason the directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups financial statements.
