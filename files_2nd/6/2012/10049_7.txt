These are derived from products which have eliminated re-related deaths of pilots and crew involved in survivable helicopter crashes.
MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 BUSINESS REVIEW 21 IED-resistant fuel tanks Our fuel tanks are unique.
Some can take a bullet, which means that military pilots and crew can get back to base safely without loss of fuel or risk of re.
Some remain intact after high impact helicopter crashes on rough terrain, enabling pilots and crew who survive to avoid further injury or death by fuel re.
And now, theres a range that enables soldiers to walk away from survivable IED events in ghting vehicles.
Maintaining fuel integrity under dynamic loads Until the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, mines were the main threat to ground vehicles.
Today, the armour plating that countered mines is easily defeated by the explosive force of IEDs that send metal into fuel tanks, igniting them.
Thats why Meggitt has launched puncture and blast-resistant self-sealing fuel cells for military vehicles, based on decades protecting air crew from fuel-related res with crashworthy fuel cells after survivable helicopter crashes.
Whether it is a blast or gunre event, the coated fabric from which the fuel tanks are made provides the strength to maintain fuel integrity under dynamic loads.
From aircraft to landcraft Now in series production, the US Army has equipped over 4,000 Bradley Fighting Vehicles with this vital fuel tank technology in an upgrade programme designed to enhance the vehicles survivability during contemporary warfare.
Meggitts first ground vehicle contract for leak-proof, life-saving fuel containment products evidences success in the groups strategy to expand its markets beyond aerospace.

Only we can make PCHEs on a commercial scale.
The compactness of PCHEs creates a multiplier effect, cutting millions of dollars from total build costs by shrinking topside bulk and simplifying construction.
Higher output, more safety At the heart of a Meggitt PCHE is a joint-less diffusionbonded matrix of chemically-etched micro-channels.
Three-to five-times lighter and smaller than traditional units, our PCHEs are capable of much higher throughput, accommodate much higher pressures up to 650 bar and, because they are 100 times less likely to develop a leak, are extremely safe.
Made from corrosion-resistant materials and with 25-year life spans to match the offshore platforms on which they serve, Meggitts PCHEs are resilient enough to shrug off the most extreme operating conditions.
