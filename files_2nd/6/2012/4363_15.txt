34 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 Business review continued Financial review Overview We continue to make progress against our strategy of growing branded sales, delivering cost savings and controlling cash.
In doing so, we have benefited again this year from being a broadly based business with strong performances from our branded Spreads and Cheese divisions compensating for more challenging trading in Dairies.
Delivery against our strategy Sales of our five key brands have increased by 11% in the year and we continue to invest more in marketing and new product development to drive future brand growth.
We have delivered on our cost saving targets across the business to help mitigate inflationary cost pressures.
Furthermore, we have invested in our core Dairies processing sites in order to drive efficiencies and increase capacity, which will facilitate the planned closure of two non-core sites in 2012 13.
Net debt has increased over the year, however a strong focus on cash has limited the increase to 24.8 million despite the acquisition of MH Foods, the Office of Fair Trading OFT settlement, continued capital investment in our core Dairies business and a cheese stock build driven by increased production and milk cost rises.

At 31 March 2012, gearing being the ratio of net debt to shareholders funds was 123% 2011: 85%.
Borrowing facilities Group borrowing facilities comprise: 345.5 million of loan notes maturing between April 2013 and November 2021: and a 170 million Alastair Murray Finance Director plus 150 million multi-currency revolving credit facility expiring in 23 May 2012 October 2016.
At 31 March 2012 there was 303.2 million effective headroom against committed facilities 2011: 324.3 million.
On 12 October 2011 the Group agreed a new five-year revolving credit facility of 170 million plus 150 million with a syndicate of five banks.
Additionally, in November 2011, the Group raised a further $85 million 54.5 million by way of a debt private placement with US investors comprising a mix of 7-year and 10-year notes.
The new facility was used to refinance the previously existing bank facilities of: 100 million which was due to mature on 8 November 2011: and 85 million plus 175 million which was due to mature on 16 July 2013.
These actions together leave overall Group facilities broadly unchanged but, importantly, deliver security of funding for the Group in the medium term, which we believe is especially important given current conditions in financial markets.
Key financial covenants under the new facility are unchanged but margins have increased slightly, reflecting current market conditions.
Borrowing facilities are subject to covenants which specify a maximum ratio of net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and a minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
The Group remains comfortably within its covenants with a net debt to EBITDA ratio at 31 March 2012 of 2.2 times March 2011: 2.2 times.
Treasury policies The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which controls cash management and borrowings and the Groups financial risks.
The main treasury risks faced by the Group are liquidity, interest rates and foreign currency.
The Group only uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business and financing activities.
Transactions of a speculative nature are prohibited.
The Groups treasury activities are governed by policies approved and monitored by the Board.
These policies are summarised in Note 30 to the financial statements.
Net assets Net assets at 31 March 2012 totalled 274.3 million 2011: 365.5 million.
This reduction principally reflects the impairment of goodwill in the Dairies segment.
Combined goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment total 713.4 million 2011: 799.6 million.
Inventories of 187.8 million are 23.3 million higher than the previous year, mainly reflecting increases in maturing cheese stock values.
