The Group has adopted a forward fuel buying policy in order to secure a degree of certainty in its planning.
The Boards policy is to hedge fully a minimum of 15 months demand across all exposed businesses, together with at least 50% of the next nine months consumption in contract businesses.
Based on expected Jez Maiden hedgable consumption, a proportion of this is xed for the Group Finance Director future.
Currently, the Group is 100% xed for 2013 at an 28 February 2013 average price of 49 pence litre excluding delivery and tax, 100% xed for 2014 at an average price of 50p and 10% xed for 2015 at 49p.
Where businesses have freedom to price services, this hedge provides sufficient protection to recover fuel price increases through the fare basket.
In contract businesses, where price escalation may be restricted by a formula independent of fuel costs, extended cover, up to the life of the contract, may be taken, subject to availability and liquidity in the hedging market.
The latter is rarely available beyond three years from the trading date.
