However, rates on renewal business on average increased by 3% across the portfolio.
We have continued to adjust our underwriting appetite in areas where competition is most intense.
Our portfolio by business division has remained broadly unchanged from 2011.
We continue to operate a diversied portfolio by type of business and geographical location, and have grown our business across all six divisions during 2012.

Premium retention rates Retention of business from existing brokers and clients is a key feature of Beazleys strategy.
It enables us to maintain a deep understanding of our clients businesses and requirements, affording greater insight into the risks involved in each policy we write and enabling us to price risk most accurately to achieve profit.

The most notable rate increases were seen in our specialty lines division 3% increase, 2011: 1% decrease, where rate increases have not been seen for the past six years.
Increases were the most significant in professional indemnity for architects and engineers 10%, lawyers 3% and treaty 4%.
Other significant rate increases were seen within our catastrophe-exposed classes: reinsurance 5% and property 6%.
Rate change on renewals in life, accident & health and marine were unchanged when compared to 2011 whilst political risks & contingency saw a 1% decrease.
Market conditions remain competitive across the portfolio.
Reinsurance purchased The amount the group spent on reinsurance in 2012 was $353.2m 2011: $338.5m.
Increases were seen primarily in the life, accident & health and property division.
In life, accident & health the increase was due to the group ceding 50% of the Australian PA binder, Australian Income Protection, to third parties, with a 100% share of the gross premiums.
This business was previously underwritten 50:50 direct between Beazley and others with no reinsurance arrangement.
Additional reinsurance was also purchased in property in 2012 where commercially beneficial terms were available to the group.
A similar increase was seen in gross premiums written in this division during the year.
Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: to enable the group to write large or lead lines on risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims and expenses to total net earned premium, a combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio has decreased in 2012 to 91% 2011: 99%.
This brings our combined ratio in line with the historic average, whilst 2011 was impacted by the cost of catastrophes.
It is worth pointing out that the calculation of the combined ratio for Beazley includes all claims and other costs to the group but excludes foreign exchange gains or losses.
We believe this represents the most transparent and useful measure of operating performance as it ensures that all of the costs of being in business are captured, whether directly linked to underwriting activity or not.
Claims Claims notications with the exception of superstorm Sandy were at normalised levels during 2012, with loss developments in line with our expectations.
Despite an active storm season in the North Alantic, we did not incur a significant loss until Sandy made landfall in October.
We estimate the cost of Sandy to be $90m to Beazley, based on market losses of $20bn-$25bn.
Beazley 40 Annual report 2012 Business review Surplus in net held reserves % % above actuarial estimate 10 5 0 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 Financial year Reserve releases Beazley has a consistent reserving philosophy with initial reserves being set to include risk margins that may be released over time as and when any uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range 5-10% above the actuarial estimate.
We continue to maintain a surplus in our reserves, this was 6.9% at the end of 2012 2011: 7.4%.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identication of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
During 2012 we were able to make the following prior year reserve adjustments across divisions, with the overall net impact being a release to the group.
2012 2011 $m $m Life, accident & health 0.5 4.5 Marine 27.7 39.9 Political risks & contingency 33.1 22.1 Property 6.2 20.2 Reinsurance 7.0 38.0 Specialty lines 51.5 61.8 7RWDO 126.0 186.5 Releases as a percentage of net earned premium 8.5% 13.5% Whilst reserve releases decreased slightly in specialty lines, this is nevertheless in line with our expectations and we continued to see satisfactory development of the business underwritten over the last ten years.
The releases in 2012 came mainly from the 2003 through 2006 underwriting years, reinforcing that they are exceptionally profitable.
The political risks & contingency reserve releases in 2012 were bolstered by positive outcomes on the 2005 and 2008 underwriting years.
Marine reserves continued to develop well, with the relatively benign 2010 and 2011 underwriting years dominating.
The reinsurance and property releases were dampened by 2011 underwriting year catastrophe reserve margins having been utilised for the cost of the events of 2011.

Beazley Annual report 2012 41 Business review Financial review Group performance continued Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased during 2012 to $563.5m from $517.3m in 2011.

As a percentage of net earned premium they remain between 21% and 22%.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with accounting standards.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identied as being directly related to underwriting activity eg underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
Administrative expenses comprise primarily personnel costs, IT costs, facilities costs, Lloyds central costs and other support costs.
These increased in 2012 due to performance linked remuneration in addition to general increases in line with growth in the business.
Investment performance Investment income for the year ended 31 December 2012 was $82.6m, or an annualised return of 2.0%, compared with $39.3m or 1.0% over the same period in 2011.
Our decision to further increase the allocation to investment-grade credit improved the overall investment return for the year as yields continued to come down, spreads tightened and the interest rate curve attened further.
Although markets were generally positive in 2012, investment conditions have remained challenging due to continued political risk in Europe and the US.
Initially the European sovereign debt crisis dominated market sentiment, before the focus eventually turned towards the scal cliff negotiations in the US that followed the re-election of the Obama administration in November.
It is unlikely that either of these issues will be fully resolved in the short-term, and consequently further volatility in financial markets can be expected in future.
We actively seek to avoid risks arising from peripheral sovereign debt as well as from the overall banking sector, and consequently our eurozone sovereign bond exposures are restricted to Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
The strategy continues to be implemented together with Falcon Money Management Limited, our associated company.
Our core portfolio, amounted to 90% of total investments and we reduced our allocation to core sovereign, supranational and agency debt whilst retaining elevated levels of cash and other short-term investments.
We have increased our allocations to US non-financial corporate and asset-backed credit in order to take advantage of the more attractive risk adjusted yield these assets offer, and maintain the balance of our investments in a diversied portfolio of capital growth assets.
Duration of the core portfolio as at the year end was 1.9 years 2011: 1.3 years with a yield to maturity of 1.0% 2011: 0.8%.

Tax Beazley is liable to corporation tax in a number of jurisdictions, notably the UK and Ireland.
Our effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate between the Irish and UK tax rates.
In 2012, the UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 25% to 23%.
This 2% reduction in the UK tax rate has been applied to our UK deferred tax liability brought forward.
This reduction in our deferred tax liability has offset our current year tax charge to create an effective tax rate of 14.6% for the year.
