Revenue for the Group was 1,041.1 million 2011: 742.6 million comprising 1,021.7 million of residential revenue 2011: 721.4 million, of which 2.1 million was from land sales 2011: 13.8 million, and 19.4 million of commercial revenue 2011: 21.2 million.
Residential revenue, excluding land sales, arose principally from the sale of 3,565 homes 2011: 2,544 in the year at an average selling price of 280,000 2011: 271,000.
During the year new homes were delivered across Berkeleys portfolio of developments including the major regeneration schemes at Woodberry Park, Kidbrooke Village and Royal Arsenal Riverside, higher value riverside schemes at Chelsea Creek, Battersea Reach and Kew Riverside, and housing schemes outside London at Queens Acre in Beaconseld, Kings Hill in Cirencester and Edenbrook in Fleet amongst others.
The increase in average selling price predominantly reects changes in the mix of homes delivered in the year compared to previous years.
Revenue from land sales comprises 2.1million 2011: 13.8 million which includes the disposal of one site in the year 2011: three.
19.4 million 2011: 21.2 million of revenue from commercial activities includes the sale of 54,000 sq ft of commercial space across a number of the Groups mixed-use developments.
The most significant of these were the development and sale of a hotel at Blackheath, a storage facility at Royal Arsenal Riverside and a Community Centre at Woodberry Park.
74 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Trading & Financial Review Trading & Financial Review PROFIT BEFORE TAX profit before tax increased by 78.6 million 57.7% to 214.8 million in the year.
This was due to a combination of five factors: million profit before tax: 2010 11 136.2 Increase in gross margin 86.3 Increase in overheads -26.2 Exceptional profit on disposal of subsidiary 30.7 Increase in net finance costs -7.9 Reduction in result from joint ventures -4.3 profit before tax: 2011 12 214.8 Berkeleys gross margin has increased by 86.3 million 41.2% in the year in line with the underlying revenue increase of 40.2% and a marginal increase in gross margin percentage from 0.2% to 28.4% since last year based on the mix of homes sold.
Overheads have increased by 26.2 million to 99.6 million, but reduced as a percentage of revenue from 9.9% to 9.6%, and so are in line with the growth of the business and also reect the first years charge under the 2011 LTIP.
Pre-exceptional operating margin of 18.8% compares with 18.3% last year, reecting both the underlying increase in gross margin and the lower percentage of operating costs expensed in the year.
The operating margin is at the top of the range of levels reported in recent periods.
On 30 September 2011 Berkeley sold its 51% equity interest in a company co-owned with Imperial College.
The company had developed the first phase of 452 postgraduate student bedrooms at its scheme in Clapham Junction in London, let to postgraduate students of Imperial College, and the second phase of 114 rooms is expected to be delivered in September 2012.
Berkeleys share of the proceeds of the sale of the company was 75.7 million and this resulted in an exceptional profit on disposal of 30.7 million.
Berkeleys share of the post-tax results of joint ventures was a loss of 2.2 million 2011: profit of 2.1 million which reects a combination of the timing of completions from St Edwards first scheme at Stanmore Place alongside investment in its delivery pipeline at 375 Kensington High Street and at 190 Strand.
Net finance costs have increased from 1.5 million to 9.4 million.
The key reason for this is the change from a net cash to a net debt position over the course of the year as a result of the continued investment in the business.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share increased in the year by 67.8% from 72.1 pence to 121.0 pence.
This increase is due to a combination of the 57.7% increase in profit before tax to 214.8 million, a decrease in the Groups effective tax rate from 31.1% to 26.1%, principally due to a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate, and a marginal reduction in the weighted average number of shares from 131,962,000 to 131,042,000.

Shareholder equity has increased by 170.4 million to 1,099.8 million, while capital employed increased by 265.9 million to 1,157.7 million, some 29.8% higher than at the start of the year.
Investment properties represent 612 properties developed by the Group 30 April 2011: 215 which are included in Berkeleys private rental fund and have increased by 54.9 million to 83.5 million 30 April 2011: 28.6 million at historic cost.
The Homes and Communities Agency has committed 12.5 million, classied as debt, to fund 358 of these properties 30 April 2011: 6.5 million on 100 properties.
The total number of properties expected to be held by the fund is 802, leaving a further 190 to complete of which 176 will be subject to 4.9 million of further funding from the Homes and Communities Agency, taking their total planned investment to 17.4 million over 534 properties.
Whilst it had originally been intended for the Group to hold some 896 properties, 94 have been marketed for sale opportunistically and so will no longer be held for investment.
Other non-current assets include 17.2 million of goodwill 30 April 2011: 17.2 million which arose on the acquisition of St James Group Ltd in November 2006, 11.6 million of property, plant and equipment 30 April 2011: 10.6 million, 46.5 million investment in joint ventures 30 April 2011: 38.7 million which has increased through 7.8 million of net investment in the year, and 25.0 million of deferred tax assets 30 April 2011: 18.9 million which have increased by 8.2 million in respect of timing difference offset by a 2.1 million reduction due to the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate.

During the year, the Group acquired 20 new sites in good locations across London and the South East, and invested in the planning, optimisation and delivery of current schemes as production levels have increased over the course of the year.
Trade and other receivables have increased from 96.7 million to 115.2 million due to a higher level of completions towards the end of the year.
Trade and other payables have increased by 54.9 million to 893.1 million 30.4 million non-current and 862.7 million current similarly reecting the growth of the business.
Included within trade creditors are 422.9 million of on account receipts 30 April 2011: 472.0, which, together with cash due on forward sales of 1,055.7 million at 30 April 2012 30 April 2011: 813.5 million, matches the majority of the increased investment in inventory and provides a significant hedge against market risk.
A net cash outow of 99.9 million in the year took the Group from a net cash position of 42.0 million at 30 April 2011 to a net debt position of 57.9 million at 30 April 2012.
Berkeley Annual Report 2012 77 Trading & Financial Review Key to this movement was the controlled investment in the business in the year through a 314.9 million net investment in working capital 2011: 345.0 million.
21.2% This included a 135.8 million net investment in land 2011: 207.4 million and 102.7 million in construction 2011: 151.7 million along with other working Return on equity capital increases of 76.4 million 2011: reduction of 14.1 million which included continued investment in the Groups rental fund properties in the year and other movements.
This increased investment in the business should be viewed in 525 conjunction with a 242.2 million increase in cash due on forward sales which underlines the way in which Berkeley manages balance sheet risk.
The cash ow reects the proceeds of 75.7 million from the sale of Berkeleys million 51% equity interest in the company co-owned with Imperial College, which gave New banking facilities rise to an exceptional profit on disposal of 30.7 million.
Following the disposal of this company, there is no longer a non-controlling interest at 30 April 2012.
At 30 April 2011, this represented Imperial Colleges 49% share in this subsidiary.
The Group paid tax of 53.7 million, compared to 32.6 million in 2011, which is in line with the growth of the business.
Non cash items and other movements, which principally relate to timing differences on interest receipts and payments and the effects of share based payments accounting, including the effect of the introduction of the 2011 LTIP in the year, are 21.2 million compared to 7.5 million last year.
Cash ows from nancing activities last year were an outow of 30.0 million arising from the acquisition of own shares during the course of the year.
There were no such purchases in 2012.
Combined with a 265.9 million increase in capital employed in the year, the net cash outow of 99.9 million has increased net assets from 933.8 million to 1,099.8 million at 30 April 2012.
This has led to an increase in net assets per share from 709.2 pence last year to 839.3 pence at 30 April 2012.
RETURN ON EQUITY Return on equity, a core performance target for Berkeley, was 21.2% in 2012 2011: 15.3%, reecting the strong trading performance reported, in the context of a controlled investment in balance sheet assets.
This increase has arisen from a 57.7% increase in profit before tax alongside a 13.5% increase in average equity for the year.
TAXATION The Groups policy is to pay the amount of tax legally due and to observe all applicable rules and regulations.
At the same time we have an obligation to maximise shareholder value and to manage financial and reputational risk.
This includes minimising and controlling our tax costs, as we look to do for all costs of our business.
Factors that may affect the Groups tax charge include changes in legislation, the impact of corporate activity restructuring, acquisitions, disposals, etc, the resolution of open tax issues from prior years and planning opportunities.
The Group makes provisions for potential tax liabilities that may arise, however the amount ultimately paid may differ from the amount accrued.
BANKING FACILITIES The Groups financial position today is further supported by the re-negotiation of the Groups banking facilities since the year end.
On 24 May 2012, Berkeley increased its committed corporate banking facilities from 450 million to 525 million, of which 250 million expires in April 2017 and 275 million in May 2017.
With 200 million of the Groups 450 million having been due to expire in November 2013, the new facilities effectively provide clarity of nancing at 525 million for five years through to April 2017.
In addition, Berkeley has a further 60 million of banking facilities in St Edward Homes, of which 3 million was utilised at the year end, if required, to finance the delivery of its schemes.
78 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Trading & Financial Review Trading & Financial Review JOINT VENTURES St Edward Homes is Berkeleys joint venture with Prudential, which is developing Stanmore Place and 375 Kensington High Street, and which also now plans to develop a scheme at 190 Strand in London.
During the year, 188 homes were sold at Stanmore Place at an average selling price of 170,000 2011: 164 homes at 251,000.
Berkeleys land bank includes some 1,658 plots in respect of St Edward Homes schemes 2011: 1,548 plots, and Berkeley continues to work with Prudential to identify further sites to which St Edward Homes can add value.
Investments accounted for using the equity method of 46.5 million 30 April 2011: 38.7 million relate to Berkeleys interest in these schemes.
FINANCIAL RISK The Group nances its operations by a combination of shareholders funds, non-controlling interest, deposits and on account receipts and borrowings where drawn.
As the Groups operations are in sterling there is no direct significant currency risk, and therefore the Groups main financial risks are primarily: Liquidity risk - the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Market credit risk - the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is comprised of the cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables held within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
Market interest rate risk - the risk that Group nancing activities are adversely affected by uctuations in market interest rates.
The Board approves treasury policy and senior management control day-to-day operations.
Relationships with banks and cash management are co-ordinated centrally.
The objectives of the treasury policy are to maintain an appropriate capital structure and in doing so manage the financial risks identied above.
The procedures for mitigation of the financial risks are set out in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.
OPERATING RISK All businesses are exposed to risk.
Indeed, alongside risk comes opportunity and it is how such risks are managed that determines the success of the Groups strategy and, ultimately, its performance and results.
Berkeleys strategy allows management to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, whilst taking advantage of opportunities as they arise in the short and medium-term.
Risk management is embedded in the organisation at operating company, divisional and Group levels, with different types of risk requiring different levels and types of management response.
The principal operating risks of the Group which have been considered by the Board include, but are not limited to, the risks as set out on pages 80 and 81.
The Internal Control section within the Corporate Governance report on pages 109 to 110 sets out the Groups overall framework for internal control, setting the context for the identication, control and monitoring of these and other risks faced by the Group.
