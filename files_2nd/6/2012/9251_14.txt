Operating margin for Performance Materials increased to 15.1% in 2012 2011, 14.1% and for Wireless Systems operating margin increased to 13.2% 2011, 12.2%.
profit Loss profit before tax from continuing operations was 45.1m 2011, 29.3m.
profit for the year after taxation and after discontinued operations was 46.5m 2011, loss of 119.0m.
Underlying profit Underlying profit before tax in the year was 60.7m 2011, 51.7m.
Underlying profit is dened as profit before tax, exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, the gain or loss on sale of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments, and acquisition transaction costs, as set out in note 14.

profits in the USA continue to be sheltered by amortised goodwill deductions, resulting from acquisitions.
An analysis of the total tax charge is given in note 11.

In addition there was an operating cash inow from discontinued operations of 12.3m.
Research and development Laird increased its investment in research and development in 2012.
Expenditure on research and development increased by 5.6m 18% to 36.6m amounting to 7.0% of revenue 2011, 6.3%.
A further step up in research and development is planned for 2013, which initially will slow the further improvement in operating margins that would be expected.
Treasury policies Laird has a centralised Treasury function, the objectives of which are to monitor and manage the financial risks of the Group and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet the requirements of the business.
Group Treasury is not intended to be a profit centre and operates within a framework of policies and procedures.
Lairds Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to assist in the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
All hedging is carried out centrally and speculative trading is specically prohibited by Group Treasury policy.
Interest rate risk Laird is exposed to interest rate risk as it holds borrowings on both a xed and oating basis.
Lairds policy for this risk is to optimise the mix of xed and oating rate borrowings using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage Lairds finance costs.
Credit and counterparty risk Lairds policy on counterparty risk management is to place cash deposits and other financial instruments with its relationship banks, all of which also provide credit facilities to Laird.
The level of exposure to each bank is continually monitored.
As at 31 December 2012 all cash and short-term deposits had a maturity of less than three months.
Foreign exchange management Laird aims to minimise its exposures to US Dollar transactional currency exposures by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
Laird aims to forward cover at least 75% of the unmatched cash ows on a quarterly basis.
39 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Financial review Finance Directors report Foreign currency borrowings are used partially to hedge the currencies of the Groups principal assets and cash ows.
Where foreign currency borrowings are in the same currency as investment in overseas assets they are treated as a hedge of the net investment.
Net borrowings and debt facilities Net borrowings were 106.8m 2011, 117.7m.
A cornerstone of Lairds financial planning is to ensure that the Group maintains committed loan finance which provides sufficient headroom above expected borrowing requirements and has a significant proportion with terms that exceed one year.
Laird has 235.0m 2011,235.0m of bilateral revolving credit facilities which do not expire until April 2016.
In addition, Laird has in issue $140.0m 86.1m of US Dollar Private Placement notes which have remaining terms of just under two years 2014, $97.0m, and four years 2016, $43.0m.
Covenants A key consideration for financial planning is to maintain sufficient headroom between borrowings and the ceiling set by the covenants.
Lairdsbank facilities and US Private Placement loan notes contain two principal financial covenants: net debt EBITDA earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and interest cover.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, net borrowings were 1.2 times EBITDA, 34% of the maximum permitted of 3.5 times.
Interest cover was 10.1 times against the minimum requirement of 3.0 times.
Thus, there was considerable financial headroom.
The expected headroom is routinely estimated against the covenants and the sensitivity to a number of alternative scenarios is tested to ensure ongoing compliance.
The Group does not anticipate approaching its covenant limits in the foreseeable future.
Currencies in 2012 Local currency exposures are balanced where possible but the Group operates a global business and this creates currency imbalances where operating and procurement costs may not be able to be matched with revenues in local currencies.
In 2012, circa 75% of revenues were negotiated in US Dollars.
With circa 40% of the cost base in US Dollars, there is a large US Dollar surplus.
Approximately 10% of revenues are negotiated in both Renminbi RMB and Euros.
In most currencies other than US Dollars and Euro, costs exceed revenues, the most significant being the RMB which accounts for approximately 40% of Lairds cost base.
This imbalance led to an adverse impact, in so far as the strengthening of the RMB may not be fully recovered in US Dollar selling prices.
In addition, there is a translation impact in converting profits into the Groups reporting currency Sterling : each US$0.01 appreciation against Sterling approximates to an annual increase in operating profit of 0.4m.
In 2012, on average through the year the US Dollar was stronger against Sterling than in 2011 and this increased profits on translation by 0.8m.
The majority of the Groups assets are held overseas and these are hedged in part by foreign currency loans.
Pensions There are 31 employees who are active members of dened benefit plans and approximately 1,600 deferred and current pensioners.
Thereis an overall dened benefit pension scheme deficit under IAS 19 of 1.5m at 31 December 2012.
At 31 December 2011, there was an overall surplus of 1.0m.
The principal driver of the year on year change resulting in a deficit was a reduction in the bond rate used to discount liabilities from 4.95% in 2011 to 4.4% in 2012, which contributed to the increase in the estimate of liabilities.
This was offset by an experience gain on liabilities as a result of using updated data from the formal triennial valuation carried out at 1 January 2012.
Shareholders funds Shareholders funds at the 2012 year-end were 440.9m 2011, 440.4m.
The reconciliation is set out in the Group statement of changes inequity.
Return on capital employed Return on capital employed underlying profit before interest and tax as a proportion of average shareholders funds plus net borrowings during the year was 12.4% in 2012 compared to 9.7% in 2011.
