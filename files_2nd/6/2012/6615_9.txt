A monthly process is operated to monitor inventory levels at wholesalers for any abnormal movements.
This process uses gross sales volumes, prescription volumes based on third party data sources and information received from key wholesalers.
The aim of this is to maintain inventories at a consistent level from year to year based on the pattern of consumption.
On this basis, US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines inventory levels at wholesalers and in other distribution channels at 31 December 2012 were estimated to amount to approximately one month of turnover.
This calculation uses third party information, the accuracy of which cannot be totally veried, but is believed to be sufciently reliable for this purpose.
