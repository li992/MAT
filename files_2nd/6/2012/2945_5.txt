Having this wide range ofskills and resources enables the Group to deliver fully integrated solutions for buildings andinfrastructure, from project finance through design and construction to lifetime asset management.
The Group has operations in the UK, Canada and the Middle East and North Africa, as described on pages 4 and 5.
Total revenue reduced in 2012 to 4.4 billion 2011: 5.1 billion, including revenue from JointVentures of 736.6 million 2011: 898.0 million, primarily because of the rescaling ofUKconstruction, which began in 2010 and was largely complete by the end of 2012.
Following the change in treatment of profit from the sale of equity investments in  projects, which contributed 13.2 million of profit in 2012 1 2011:11.5 million, total underlying profit from operations increased by two per cent to 2 232.4 million 2011: 227.4 million.

Revenue in support services showed a marginal improvement with the expected reduction inrevenue from Carillion Energy Services, due to contracts coming to an end, offset by organic growth in both the UK and Canada.
Despite a high level of bidding activity and the associated costs and ongoing competitive market pressures, operating performance in this segment remained strong, with underlying operating profit also marginally ahead as we maintained our operatingmargin at 5.2 per cent.
New order intake in 2012 remained very healthy, with a substantial number of new contracts and contract extensions across all the sectors and geographies in which we operate, including several notable successes.
In the UK, pressure on Local Authorities to reduce spending continues to create asubstantial pipeline of opportunities as more Authorities look to outsource services to reduce costsand increase efficiency.
In April 2012, Carillion was awarded a 10-year contract by Oxfordshire County Council to provide integrated property and facilities management services.
This contract, which was the first of its kind to be let in the UK, is initially expected to be worth up to 700 million, but this could potentially increase significantly as the contract is extendable to 20 years.
We also secured a 10-year strategic partnership with Lancashire County Council to deliver property services, initially worth up to 150 million, but again with the potential for this to increase substantially, as the contract provides for the scope of services to be expanded considerably.
In November 2012, Carillion achieved financial close on the first major energy services contract that implements the provisions of the UK Governments Green Deal legislation, namely an eight-year contract for Birmingham City Council potentially worth up to some 1.5 billion.
In Canada, we won new contracts and successfully re-bid contracts for highways maintenance worth 525 million.
In the Middle East, where we are seeing an increasing number of support services opportunities, we had two particularly notable successes, which together will nearly treble our support services revenue in the region a highways maintenance contract in Qatar worth 36 million over three years, our first contract of this kind in the region, and our appointment as the preferred bidder for a facilities management contract for Petroleum Development Oman worth some 75 million over the initial contract period of three years, which is extendable to eight years.
Consequently, notwithstanding the in-sourcing of two contracts by customers, the value ofoursupport services order book and probable orders was 13.1 billion at the year end 2011:12.9 billion.
This continues to provide good revenue visibility, which currently stands 2 In June 2012, the Ministry of Defence awarded at71 per cent of expected revenue for 2013 2011: 79 per cent for 2012.
We have also Carillion a five-year contract worth some maintained a strong pipeline of contract opportunities worth some 11.5 billion 2011: 45 million to provide facilities management 12.3billion, which supports our overall objective of delivering annual revenue growth services for the bases used by the United insupport services and our target of single digit growth in 2013.

Our integrated business model enables us to combine our capabilities in project finance, design, construction and life-time asset management, to win and deliver PPP projects in which we makeequity investments and for which we also secure long-term support services contracts andgood quality construction contracts.
These support services and construction services contractsare reported in our support services and construction services excluding the Middle East segments, respectively.
Carillion has led the market in recycling equity investments, namely selling investments after projects have passed from construction into the operational phase and reinvesting the proceeds in new projects.
Given the strength of our portfolio of financially closed projects and of our pipeline of project opportunities, we expect to continue recycling equity investments for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, and consistent with the treatment adopted by most of our industry, from 2012 onwards profit from selling PPP equity investments is being treated as part of underlying operating profit, rather than as non-operating profit.
Our portfolio of investments continued to perform well in 2012, in line with our target internal rate of return of 15 per cent.
During the year we sold our equity investments in seven projects the Cleadon Park Health Centre and the University of Hertfordshire, together with 90 per cent of our equity in the Durham, Nottingham, South Tyneside & Gateshead, Tameside and Wolverhampton Building Schools for the Future projects.
These sales generated total gross proceeds of 34.8 million, which reflected an average discount rate of seven per cent, and an operating profit of 13.2 million.
Revenue reduced in 2012 as a result of selling equity investments in 2011 and 2012.
Operating profit increased by eight per cent, because the 13.2 million of profit generated from equity sales in 2012 more than offset the equity returns no longer received from the investments sold.
In 2011, equity sales generated 11.5 million of operating profit and the previously reported operating profit for 2011 of 19.9 million has been restated as 31.4 million to reflect this change in treatment.
At 31 December 2012, we had a portfolio of 23 financially closed projects in which we had invested 101.3 million 2011: 96.0 million of equity, and in which we have commitments to invest a further 85.6 million.
The Directors valuation of existing investments in this portfolio at 31 December 2012, using a nine per cent discount rate, increased to 173 million 2011: 164 million.
The value of our order book plus probable orders was approximately 2.2 billion at 31 December 2012 2011: 2.8 billion, with the reduction on 2011 due to selling seven equity investments in 2012.
The outlook in this segment is positive, as our pipeline of contract opportunities has increased substantially to 1.6 billion 2011: 1.0 billion.
In the UK, we are shortlisted for two projects theRoyal Liverpool Hospital project, in which we could invest up to 25 million of equity, and onwhich a preferred bidder decision is expected in the first half of 2013, and the M8 motorway improvements project, in which we could also invest up to 20 million.
In Canada, which has a Carillion is an equity partner in the Special PPP programme with an estimated value of approximately C$60 billion, we are shortlisted for Purpose Company delivering the 3 billion three projects the Kingston Provident Care Centre and Hamilton Health Sciences, in Ontario, Royal School of Military Engineering Public and North Island Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia in which we could invest up to 20 Private Partnership project.
Furthermore, we aim to increase the number of projects for which we are shortlisted in delivering the construction of enhanced Canada to up to seven during 2013, which will be the largest number of PPP projects that we training facilities and accommodation for have ever bid concurrently.
In the UK, we expect the recent positive outcome of the Governments military personnel, together with new retail, review of private finance to lead to a new pipeline of opportunities, notably in the education and catering and leisure facilities.

As expected, full-year revenue reduced, despite a strong performance in the second-half of 2012 to deliver revenue of 272.0 million, which was significantly higher than first-half revenue of 201.6 million.
Substantial fluctuations in revenue between accounting periods are not unusual in the Middle East, because the timing of project awards can have a significant effect on revenue, given our strategy is to focus on large projects for a small number of financially robust customers, for whom quality and reliability are paramount.
Operating profit reduced, reflecting both lower revenue and a lower operating margin of 6.1 per cent 2011: 8.9 per cent, which is in line with the guidance we have been giving since 2010 that margins in this segment would reduce to around six per cent as negotiated contracts are replaced by contracts won through competitive tendering.
The operating margin in 2011 also benefited from favourable outturns on certain projects that reached completion in 2011 and this has not been repeated in 2012.
Although customer decisions on contract awards have been slower during 2012, we won a number of significant new contracts during the year.
Notable successes in 2012 included a 113million contract to build a mixed use development for the Oman Public Authority for Social Infrastructure, a 45 million infrastructure contract for EMAL Emirates Aluminium inAbu Dhabi, a 42 million contract to build the Sultan Qaboos Mosque at Nizwa for the OmanRoyal Court Affairs, a 40 million contract to construct Sidab Harbour for the Royal Oman Police and a 35 million contract for the Al Baleed Resort Company in Oman.
The value of Carillions share of the Middle East order book and probable orders was 0.8billion at the year end 2011: 1.0 billion, which reflects the effect of the slow down in contract awards.
Our pipeline of new contract opportunities of 11.4 billion 2011: 11.4 billion includes opportunities in all the countries in which we currently operate, namely the UAE AbuDhabi and Dubai, Oman, Qatar and Egypt, and also in Saudi Arabia.

Our performance in this segment has continued to benefit from the swift action we took in2010 to begin rescaling our UK business to ensure it remained aligned in size to the shrinkingUK construction market.
Revenue reduced, largely due to the effect of rescaling UKconstruction, but with operating profit increasing as a result of the margin improving to 5.6per cent 2011: 3.1 per cent.
The rescaling of our UK business has been achieved through tightening the criteria we use to select the contracts for which we bid in order to avoid low margin work and to focus increasingly on the delivery of integrated solutions for PPP projects and support services customers, and projects for other customers with whom we have long-term relationships.
In 2012, UK construction revenue was approximately 0.9 billion and we believe the process ofrescaling is now largely complete.
Our performance has continued to benefit from taking a highly selective approach to the contracts for which we bid, lower bid costs, a rigorous focus oncost management and positive settlements on contracts reaching completion.
Clearly, some of these benefits arise only because we have been rescaling our UK business.
But we believe our strategy has not only increased profitability during the period of rescaling, but created a stronger business, capable of delivering higher margins than the industry average, as we begin to target revenue growth going forward.
We won a number of significant new contracts in 2012, consistent with our selective approach.
In the UK, these included contracts for the Highways Agency worth around 250 million to Carillion, including two major projects that were allocated funding in the Governments pre-budget statement, namely the A1 M upgrade between Leeming and Barton and the A5-M1 link road scheme, which we are delivering with Joint Venture partners.
In addition, we secured a 45 million contract to reconfigure Pier 5 at Gatwick Airport, a 42 million contract for Argent in Manchester and Academy Schools contracts worth over 40 million.
Since the year end, Carillion has also been awarded a 115 million contract to upgrade the A465 in Wales.
As previously announced, we expected construction revenue in Canada to reduce and in 2012 itcontributed some 0.4 billion of revenue to this segment 2011: 0.5 billion.
In Canada, where we also apply strict contract selectivity criteria, a key element of our strategy for achieving strong medium-term growth is to win PPP projects.
New PPP programmes, worth in total some C$60 billion, were launched in Canada towards the end of 2011 and bidding on PPP projects that form part of these programmes is now well underway and we have already been shortlisted for three projects, with a construction value to Carillion of some 0.5 billion.
During 2013, we aim to increase the number of projects for which we are shortlisted to up to seven, aswe continue to believe the strength of our PPP offering will play a key part in enabling us to achieve our objective of doubling total revenue in Canada to around 1 billion, in the five year period from 2010 to 2015.
In 2012, Carillion was selected to deliver At the year end, we had orders and probable orders in this segment worth some 2.0 billion further construction work worth some 2011: 2.4 billion, with the reduction on 2011 primarily due to the rescaling of our UK 120 million for the Thameslink Programme, 2 business.
Revenue visibility for 2013 is currently 72 per cent 2011: 72 per cent for 2012. under Network Rails Multi Asset Framework Encouragingly, our pipeline of contract opportunities at 31 December 2012 increased to Agreement.
As a Delivery Partner to Network 10.7billion 2011: 8.4 billion, which not only includes significant opportunities in Canada, Rails Thameslink Team, Carillion is building but also opportunities in the UK, especially over the medium term.
In 2013 our target is to improvements to support the provision of deliver single digit revenue growth in this segment, with our operating margin remaining a reliable service throughout the above the industry average.

Non-recurring operating items The non-recurring operating charge of 2.6 million 2011: 42.8 million primarily related to apayment made tothe Carillion Energy Services Employee Share Scheme in lieu of Carillion dividends waived by the Eaga Partnership Trusts of 2.6 million.
The Eaga Partnership Trusts hold 3.9 per cent of Carillions issued share capital, which they acquired as a result of Carillions acquisition of Carillion Energy Services in 2011.
Non-operating items 1 The non-operating charge of 1.2 million 2011: 6.9 million comprised 0.9 million of costs relating to the acquisition of the Bouchier Group and 0.3 million of costs associated with the closure and disposal of small non-core businesses.
Net financial expense The Groups net financial expense of 17.7 million 2011: 3.9 million comprised the following items: a net expense of 21.5 million 2011: 14.0 million in respect of borrowings and other liabilities, with the increase compared to 2011 largely due to higher borrowings: a net interest charge in respect of defined benefit pension schemes of 3.6 million 2011: 3.2 million credit, with the movement due primarily to a reduction in the AA bond yield and interest received in respect of loans to PPP Joint Venture projects of 7.4 million 2011: 6.9 million.
Taxation 2 The underlying Group taxation charge of 23.5 million 2011: 27.8 million when combined with a taxation charge on Joint Ventures of 1.7 million 2011: 3.5 million, represented an 2 1 underlying effective tax rate of 12 per cent 2011: 14 per cent.
This is significantly below the UK standard rate of corporation tax of 24.5 per cent for 2012, because our profits in the Middle East are subject to zero or low rates of tax, agreement of certain historic tax issues with HM Revenue and Customs and because we utilise carried forward tax losses in the UK that were largely inherited with the acquisitions of Mowlem, Alfred McAlpine and Carillion Energy Services.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had 250 million of corporate tax losses 2011: 348 million that are available to reduce future tax payments.
Earnings per share 2 Underlying earnings per share reduced by six per cent to 43.0 pence, compared with the 1 restated figure for 2011 of 45.7 pence.
The weighted average number of shares in issue in2012 was 430.1 million 2011: 420.9 million, with the increase due to the full-year effect ofissuing 30.6 million of shares in respect of the acquisition of Carillion Energy Services in April2011.
Dividend Carillion has a progressive dividend policy that aims to increase the dividend per share broadly 2 in line with growth in underlying earnings per share, subject to the investment needs of the business.

Strong cash management remains a priority and this has been reflected in the Groups track record of consistently delivering cash-backed profit.
However, as expected, this was not the case in 2012, when cash flow from operations represented 42 per cent of underlying profit fromoperations.
This was primarily due to two previously announced reasons.
First, when weannounced our decision in 2010 to rescale our UK construction activities, we indicated that, while this would have significant overall benefits for the Group, it would also result in asubstantial outflow of working capital, some 80 million of which occurred in2012.
Second, as we indicated when presenting our 2011 results, net borrowing at 31December 2011was some 50 million lower than we expected, because we received substantial paymentsfrom customers close to the year end.
This resulted in a temporary reduction in netborrowing at 31 December 2011 that reversed early in 2012, addingsome 50 million totheoutflow of working capital in 2012.
Adjusting for these two factors, underlying cash flowfrom operations was 98 per cent of underlying profit from operations.
Deficit recovery payments to the Groups pension funds of 30.2 million remain in line with theagreement reached in 2010 with the Trustees of the Groups main defined benefit schemes.
The 28.6 million of rationalisation costs primarily relate to the integration of Carillion Energy Services.
Interest, tax and dividend payments of 87.2 million included higher interest and dividends payable due tothe acquisition of Carillion Energy Services.
Net capital expenditure of15.6 million included 18.3million of capital investment, net of proceeds received from disposals of 2.7 million.
Net payments of 32.6 million in respect ofacquisitions and disposals primarily comprised net equity investments in Joint Venturesof 20.1 million and Bouchier acquisition related payments of 10.1 million.
The above items, together with other payments of 8.8 million, resulted in a change in netborrowing of 105.1 million, leaving the Group with net borrowing of 155.8 million at31December 2012 2011: 50.7 million.

Financial statements Governance Our performance About us 32 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Operating and financial review continued There are three notable movements in the table on page 31.
First, the movement in inventories, receivables and payables, which reflected the movement in working capital described in the commentary on the summary cash flow statement on page 31.
Second, the increase in the Groups net retirement benefit liability, which was primarily due to a reduction in the AA bond yield, which is used as the discount rate in calculating retirement scheme obligations.
Third, the increase in average net borrowing, which is largely due to the working capital movement described in thecommentary on the summary cash flow statement on page 31.

Defined benefit pensions should not be offered to employees except where required under legislation or to meet the requirements of work-winning Where defined benefits need to be offered to meet legislative or work-winning requirements, business protocols are in place to manage the risk involved and to ensure that the risk and costs are fully factored into pricing Investment risks should be monitored and gradually reduced commensurate with a balanced approach to risk and cost.
In line with these policies, three of the Groups principal schemes, the Carillion Staff, Mowlem Staff and Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan, are closed to new entrants and members no longer accrue benefits for future service.
As noted above the total deficit included in the Groups balance sheet at 31 December 2012 inrelation to defined benefit schemes amounted to 351.0 million 2011: 305.8 million.
Theincrease in the net deficit since the end of 2011 is primarily due to a reduction in the AABond rate which is used as the discount rate to calculate scheme liabilities.
During 2012, discussions with the Trustees commenced in respect of valuations and revised funding arrangements for the Groups principal defined benefit schemes.
It is anticipated that the valuations and revised funding arrangements will be concluded during the course of 2013.
The Group has committed funding arrangements across all its defined benefit schemes which amount to around 34 million per annum, in the short term.
Each scheme has its own specific funding arrangement and these funding arrangements will be reviewed following subsequent valuations.

Operational and financial risk management The application of rigorous risk management policies and processes plays an essential role inCarillions success.
These policies and processes are firmly embedded in our culture and designed to identify, mitigate and manage strategic risks and those specific to individual businesses and contracts, including economic, social, environmental and ethical risks.
Our operational risk management policies and processes are described in more detail on pages 22and 23 of the Group Chief Executives review, together with a summary of the Groups principal risks and the measures we have taken to mitigate them.
Treasury policy and financial risk management The Group has a centralised Treasury function whose primary role is to manage funding, liquidity and financial risks.
In addition, Treasury sources and administers contract bond andguarantee facilities for the Group.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter intospeculative transactions.
The Board sets policies within which Treasury operates that ensurethe most effective financing of the Groups operations and limit exposure to financial risk.

Financial statements Governance Our performance About us 34 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Operating and financial review continued Counterparty risk The Group undertakes significant financial transactions only with counterparties that have strong credit ratings.
The limits and requirements in respect of such transactions are reviewed regularly by the Board of Carillion plc.
Country risk The Group has overseas activities in Canada, the Middle East, where our operations based in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman and Qatar, and in Egypt, in which we have one project that accounted for less than two per cent of the Groups total revenue in 2012.
Through our strategy of creating a well-balanced and geographically diversified business, weseek to minimise the political and socio-economic risks to our business.
We also seek to mitigate the risks attendant on our overseas activities by ensuring that we operate only where we can apply high standards of corporate governance and corporate social responsibility and byregularly repatriating profits and cash to the UK.
We have no operations in mainland Europe and therefore no direct exposure to the risks attendant on operating in eurozone countries.
Theoverseas countries in which we operate were largely unaffected by the global banking crisis, with the exception of Dubai, which has been supported by Abu Dhabi and is now showing signs of recovery, with increased levels of investment in infrastructure projects.
Ourstrategy in the Middle East and North Africa of focusing on a small number of financially robust customers has enabled our businesses in the region to maintain healthy operating cash flows and remain financially independent.
The risk of political instability in Canada is judged to be minimal, as Canada has a stable parliamentary democracy.
In the Middle East, we have deliberately based our activities in countries with a history of social stability and we have been unaffected by the unrest seen elsewhere in the Middle East.
Social unrest in Egypt affected the one project we have there, causing us to suspend construction work for a few weeks early in 2011, but since then work onthis project has continued normally.
While the potential for political unrest and conflict inthe Middle East and North Africa to escalate or to spread to countries so far unaffected remains a possibility, we believe our policy of focusing on countries with a history of stability, together with our rigorous corporate governance and financial management policies and processes, provides adequate mitigation against these risks.
Foreign exchange The Group hedges all significant currency transaction exposures using foreign exchange risk management techniques.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of exchange rate volatility, foreign currency net assets are hedged using matching currency loansequivalent to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value, where these assets exceed the equivalent of 10 million.
Profits arising within overseas subsidiaries are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
