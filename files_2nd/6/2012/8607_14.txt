Sainsburys continues to benefit from cash generated from operations, up 13.4 per cent year-on-year, facilitated in part by an overall improvement in working capital.
This cash continues to be invested in long-term return-enhancing growth opportunities.
During the year, core capital expenditure amounted to 1,240 million 2010 11: 1,138 million and we are pleased that the investments made over the past few years continue to deliver an expected return above our required hurdle rate.
In June 2009, we decided to accelerate our investment in new space taking advantage of the relatively low cost of land and higher availability at that time.
We have since established a strong property pipeline for future stores, targeting sales growth in areas where we can generate high returns, including those areas where we are under-represented in the market and across our convenience business.
Our increased investment in space over recent years has helped both our sales and property value grow, although new space has an initially dilutive impact on profits due to opening costs and the sales build up curve.
Having delivered the promised acceleration in space growth we will now return to space growth of around five per cent a year.
This will reduce our capital expenditure and improve our cash flow and our overall returns, as sales from these new stores mature.
