BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW OVERVIEW Revenues of 471.5m 2011: 418.8m were 12.6% higher than in the previous financial year to 31 March 2011: the pre-tax profit was 30.7m 2011: 27.5m.
The increase in revenue was achieved against a background of a particularly warm winter, and was primarily due to the increase in the number of services we provided compared with the previous year.
The improvement in pre-tax profitability of 11.8% was broadly in line with our increase in turnover, and reflects the costs associated with the sharp increase in our rate of organic growth over the course of the year.
Our balance sheet at the year end shows a net cash position of 0.9m.
The significant improvement since last year when we reported 13.1m of net borrowings was achieved despite the 6.6m cash purchase of Merit House in February 2012, and reflects the successful implementation of our new supply agreement with npower.
The increase in both the quantity and quality of new customers caused a rise of almost 4m in the net investment of our Customer Acquisition operating segment compared with the previous year.
We anticipate a further modest increase this year, as we maintain our current strong focus on growth.
Distribution costs increased by 2.7m reflecting higher bonuses and incentive payments to distributors resulting from the faster organic growth we experienced during the year, combined with higher residual income payments in line with our increased turnover.
Earnings per share increased by over 12% to a record level of 33.8p 2011: 30.1p and, in line with previous guidance and our strong cash generation, the Company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 17p 2011: 14p per share, making a total dividend of 27p 2011: 22p per share for the year.
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS The rate at which our customer management business is growing gathered pace over the course of the year, a continuation of the trend that started to develop during the preceding year: 70,000 NET GROWTH IN NUMBER OF SERVICES PROVIDED 60,000 50,000 40,000 30,000 20,000 10,000 0 Q1 FY11 Q2 FY11 Q3 FY11 Q4 FY11 Q1 FY12 Q2 FY12 Q3 FY12 Q4 FY12 21 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED This trend reflects the successful transformation of distributor activity towards gathering multi-utility home-owners, rather than the energy-only tenants who had started to become the dominant element amongst new customers by the summer of 2009.
All our core services are now seeing consistently strong monthly growth.
This progressive improvement in the quality of our customer base, with lower levels of delinquency and a steady increase in the average number of services being taken by each customer, has already resulted in a reduction in churn and can be expected to improve our bad debt experience in due course.
Revenues increased across all our services during the year, notwithstanding the impact of an exceptionally warm winter which reduced energy sales by approximately 30m compared with the level we would have expected to supply at seasonally normal temperatures.

Although the initial cost of acquiring a customer who takes at least four of our core services is considerably higher than for a household taking fewer services, our experience shows that the lifetime value of such customers more than compensates for the higher upfront cost we incur.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution costs, which primarily represent the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to distributors, increased by 2.7m to 16.0m 2011: 13.3m : this reflects an increase in the amount of residual income we paid broadly in line with the higher turnover we achieved, combined with higher bonus and incentive payments resulting from the significant increase in our organic growth compared with the previous year.
Bad debts of 9.3m 2011: 8.2m remained broadly stable as a percentage of sales, mainly due to the long tail in resolving the historic problems which became apparent in 2009 when we started to attract a disproportionate number of energy only tenants.
In the context of the weak economic environment and our high organic growth, we believe this represents a satisfactory outcome for the year.
Going forward, we anticipate that our bad debt will start to fall progressively as a percentage of future turnover, in line with the improving overall quality of our customer base.
2.5% DELINQUENT CUSTOMERS 2.0% 1.5% 1.0% 0.5% 0.0% Q2 FY11 Q3 FY11 Q4 FY11 Q1 FY12 Q2 FY12 Q3 FY12 Q4 FY12 Other administration costs also remained broadly stable, as we grew headcount aggressively in order to ensure we were appropriately resourced to manage the increasing number of customers joining us each month.
The average number of employees increased from 479 to 541, most of which took place in the second-half of the year: this increase in headcount of 12.9% is below the increase we saw during the year in the number of services we are providing, as we continue to enhance our systems to manage our growing customer base more effectively.
Costs associated with strengthening our senior management team led to an increase of 16% in personnel expenses for the year to 17.4m 2011: 15.0m.
23 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED We have successfully sub-let about 40% of the office space we vacated when we consolidated our operations in Network HQ around 12 months ago: the remainder of this space is being retained as a disaster recovery site pending the expiry of the leases in around 24 months time.
We have also re-let the car showroom premises which occupy the ground floor of our multi-storey car park, but this is subject to a rent-free period that will last until the start of our next financial year.
SHARE OPTION COSTS The operating profit is stated after share option expenses of 641,000 2011: 436,000.
These expenses relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 'Share based payments'.
TAXATION A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
The amount of corporation tax payable is 7.3m 2011: 6.8m.
The effective tax rate for the year was 23.7% 2011: 24.6%.
CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET There was a net cash inflow of 14.1m during the year, which was in line with management expectations.
The main factor behind this was the impact of the new energy supply arrangements with npower, and this is reflected on our balance sheet by the large increase in accrued expenses and deferred income.
The increase in non-current receivables of 2.6m mainly relates to our ongoing prepayment meter installation programme, and the consequent increase in prepayment meter debts which are not due to be recovered until after 12 months time.
Our year end cash balance would have been significantly higher had the Board not made the decision to purchase Merit House in February.
The costs of refurbishing this building will be met from a combination of cash flow and our agreed banking facilities.
The Group does not have a policy with respect to interest rate management, as it has no long-term debt funding requirements.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns, after allowing for the Companys working capital requirements.
