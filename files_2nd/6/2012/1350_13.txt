20 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Balance sheet Fixed assets Capital expenditure in the year was 476m 2011: 225m with 426m invested in the rental fleet 2011: 202m.
Expenditure on rental equipment was 89% of total capital expenditure with the balance relating to the delivery vehicle fleet, property improvements and computer equipment.
Capital expenditure by division was as follows: 2012 2011 Growth Maintenance Total Total Sunbelt in $m 295.9 300.3 596.2 295.0 Sunbelt in m 182.2 185.0 367.2 176.9 A-Plant 14.6 44.4 59.0 25.5 Total rental equipment 196.8 229.4 426.2 202.4 Delivery vehicles, property improvements and computers 50.2 22.4 Total additions 476.4 224.8 With good demand in the US, $296m of rental equipment capital expenditure was spent on growth while $300m was invested in replacement of existing fleet.
The growth proportion is estimated on the basis of the assumption that maintenance capital expenditure in any period is equal to the original cost of equipment sold.
The average age of the Groups serialised rental equipment, which constitutes the substantial majority of our fleet, at 30 April 2012 was 37 months 2011: 44 months weighted on a net book value basis.
Sunbelts fleet had an average age of 36 months 2011: 44 months while A-Plants fleet had an average age of 41 months 2011: 42 months.
Last years gross expenditure exceeded the 425m guidance provided with our third quarter results in March because we elected to bring forward into April deliveries originally scheduled for May.
As a result, our capital expenditure guidance for next year is now lowered to reflect those early deliveries with our current plan being for gross additions of around 450m.
The early deliveries do not impact the timing of when the expenditure will be paid for and accordingly we still expect net payments for capital expenditure of approximately 400m after disposal proceeds of approximately 100m.
This level of expenditure is consistent with our strategy at this stage in the cycle of investing in organic growth, whilst both fide-ageing our fleet and continuing to reduce our leverage.

Physical utilisation is time-based utilisation, which is calculated as the daily average of the original cost of equipment on rent as a percentage of the total value of equipment in the fleet at the measurement date and, in the year ended 30 April 2012, was 70% at Sunbelt 2011: 68% and 65% at A-Plant 2011: 69%.
At Sunbelt, physical utilisation is measured for equipment with an original cost in excess of $7,500 which comprised approximately 90% of its fleet at 30 April 2012.
Trade receivables Receivable days at 30 April were 44 days 2011: 46 days.
The bad debt charge for the year ended 30 April 2012 as a percentage of total turnover was 0.7% 2011: 0.8%.

Payment periods for purchases other than rental equipment vary between seven and 45 days and for rental equipment between 30 and 120 days.
