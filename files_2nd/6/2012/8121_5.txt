LightSquared revenue for 2012 was US$60.2m 2011: US$203.8m.
Excluding our LightSquared Operationally and financially, this has been one of the toughest Cooperation Agreement years for Inmarsat since we went public in 2005.
The reorganisation of our business into the vertical market focus and the continuing investment in Global Xpress, Alphasat and our products and services has placed huge challenges on our people and systems.
The economic backdrop, uncertainty over government spending programmes and intense, sometimes irrational, competition has made it extremely tough to win business and the impact of reduced revenues from LightSquared has meant that, for the first time in nine years, we are not able to report growth in revenue and EBITDA.
However, in our core underlying MSS business, we have shown a return to growth and, excluding LightSquared, the Global Xpress investment and non-recurring items, our underlying EBITDA is up on last year.
This is testimony to the underlying strength and resilience of our business model, and the launch of Global Xpress in 2013 will only enhance our ability to generate growth.
Overview Overall, Inmarsat recorded a solid performance during 2012, amidst continuing difficult market and economic conditions.
We saw growth returning to our core wholesale MSS business and have made good progress on both the operational and Rick Medlock commercial preparations for the launch of our Global Xpress Chief Financial Officer programme, including good initial take-up of the hybrid XpressLink maritime product.
We have continued to exercise tight control over both our operating costs and capital expenditures, and are therefore able, as promised, once again to increase our final dividend by 10% to a figure of 27.45 cents per share in line with our strategy of a sustainable dividend based on our normalised free cash flow.
Revenue growth of 2.5% in our core wholesale MSS business during 2012 was encouraging, although our total revenue fell year-on-year due to the significant reduction in revenue recognised from our Cooperation Agreement with LightSquared.
Maritime turned in a strong performance, where growth in usage and active users was maintained despite increasing some prices during the year.
The trend of migration from older services Inmarsat B, Mini M, Fleet 77 to FleetBroadband continues, and an increasing proportion of FleetBroadband revenues estimated at around 50% is now earned through contractually recurring subscription charges rather than through more variable usage-based payments.
In our Land Mobile segment, as expected, we saw a significant reduction in BGAN revenues due to reduced activity in Afghanistan, and an absence of events comparable with those which took place in North Africa and Japan in 2011.
We estimate that the impact of these factors on our wholesale revenue is a reduction of $30m year-on-year.
Whilst we have seen encouraging levels of activity in other regions during the year, this usage remains volatile.
Although our Aviation business has also been similarly 20 Inmarsat plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 2012 Operations Governance Financial statements affected by reduced traffic over Afghanistan, at the wholesale level At the end of 2012 we had more than 330 ships using our recently it has shown encouraging growth during the year, reflecting the launched XpressLink product, the hybrid Land Ku-band maritime growth in activations and usage of our SwiftBroadband service service which will transition customers to Global Xpress.
Whilst both in the business jet and commercial air transport segments.
we believe that the ships installing XpressLink primarily reflect Some of this growth reflects a switch out of lease contracts into increased market share rather than migration from L-band pay-as-you-go.
Revenue from Leases has reduced in 2012, in customers it should be noted that, to the extent that customers part due to transfers to demand-assigned usage, in part due to do transfer from L-band to the hybrid service, customer revenue customers migrating to new technologies, as well as planned on a ship-by-ship basis will largely migrate from our Inmarsat spectrum reallocations, following our Cooperation Agreement Global segment to our Inmarsat Solutions segment.
we continue to increase our focus on preparation for the launch of our Global Xpress services.
Wholesale MSS growth was however not matched in our Inmarsat Solutions business, and 2012 revenue was below that achieved in As I noted earlier, revenue and EBITDA fell in 2012 as a result 2011.
This is because Inmarsat Solutions is more exposed to both of decreased revenue from our Cooperation Agreement with Leasing and BGAN business which have shown a slow down over LightSquared.
This agreement was originally entered into in the period.
For 2012 Inmarsat Solutions market share was 39%, 2007, and set out arrangements through which Inmarsat agreed slightly lower than the 41% share for 2011. to reorganise and lease some of our L-band radio spectrum over North America to LightSquared in return for substantial Outside MSS, we have benefited from strong growth in our cash payments.

We therefore remain cautious in amended terms of the Cooperation Agreement are designed to respect of our outlook.
However, we remain confident in the ability allow LightSquared more time to secure regulatory consents that of our core new services, FleetBroadband, SwiftBroadband and may ultimately lead to the deployment of its ATC network in IsatPhone Pro, to continue to deliver growth.

As the new business units and US$11.2m, respectively.
continue to separately address wholesale and retail sales activities, the reorganisation has had no impact on our two primary reporting segments, Inmarsat Global and Inmarsat Solutions.
However, during the course of 2013 we expect to make changes to the presentation of our financial results, so that the revenue analysis for Inmarsat Solutions is more closely aligned to the business unit structure.
We expect these reporting changes to be implemented by the time of our first quarter Interim Management Statement.
We believe these changes will also be helpful to analysts and investors and allow for a better understanding of operational trends within our Inmarsat Solutions reporting segment.

Firstly, we have seen delays in purchase decision-making For 2012, profit before tax was US$293.6m, a decrease of for maritime VSAT systems, impacting the Ship Equip CGU.
The reduction is due We believe these delays are due to ship operators preferring to primarily to decreased revenues from our Cooperation Agreement wait for the launch of our GX services in order to compare GX with LightSquared and increased net operating costs, partially to existing VSAT alternatives.
Secondly, for the Stratos CGU offset by decreased net interest payable and a reduced there has been a decline in demand for certain products impairment charge during 2012. throughout 2012 resulting from reduced military activities in Afghanistan, reduced event-driven traffic and termination of some lease business.
The combination of these factors is expected to result in reduced operating profits at the Inmarsat Solutions level and have therefore been reflected in the revised forecasts, giving rise to the impairment of the Stratos and Ship Equip CGUs.

We have continued to see voice revenues being negatively impacted by product mix changes as users transition from our 350 13.5 161.3 older services to our FleetBroadband service where the price of 300 12.4 voice services is lower and also by the substitution effect of voice 118.3 11.1 10.1 usage moving to email and Voice Over IP, which we record as data 88.5 250 revenues.

During 2012, revenues from the land mobile sector were US$132.4m, a decrease of US$19.3m, or 12.7%, compared The growth of active terminals in the maritime sector is primarily with 2011. due to take-up of our FleetBroadband service, where we have seen active terminal numbers grow by 31% year-over-year.
This growth Revenues from data services in the land mobile sector during has been partially offset by the expected decline in active terminals 2012 were US$118.1m, a decrease of US$25.9m, or 18.0%, of older services such as Inmarsat B and Fleet, where users have compared with 2011.
This expected decline in revenues is due been migrating to our FleetBroadband service.
The growth of to the combination of troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and active terminals in the land mobile sector is predominantly due the comparative impact of significant event revenue in 2011. to our IsatPhone Pro service, which was introduced in 2010.

Growth in our maritime data revenues was primarily driven by remained strong and we ended the year with over 84,000 active pricing and service package changes implemented in January and subscribers, compared to approximately 43,000 at the beginning May 2012 and increased take-up and usage of our FleetBroadband of the year.
The increase in our installed subscriber base is driving terminals.
During the year we have seen significant migration of overall traffic growth and is the primary contributor to our voice end-users from usage-based pricing plans to subscription-based revenue growth.
In addition, our IsatPhone Pro revenues also plans with higher monthly fees and inclusive usage.
