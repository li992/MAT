62 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial Review Giacomo Baizini The financial results for 2012 reflect the subdued steel pricing environment, however we have managed to retain balance sheet flexibility and preserve our solid liquidity position.
While the business outlook for 2013 remains challenging we continue to focus on efficiency improvements and the optimisation of our asset portfolio.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Group on pages 102 to 167 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union and the presentation currency is US dollars.
Overview As a result of a general weakness in the market for steel and steelmaking raw materials, the Company recorded a net loss of US$335 million for 2012, compared to a net profit of US$453 million in 2011.
Gross profit deteriorated as falling prices affected revenue and we were also impacted by an impairment of US$413 million.
Our EBITDA decreased 31% to US$2,012 million in 2012.
Cash flow generation was utilised in the continuing investment to upgrade and maintain our operations, as well as to declare a final dividend for 2011 and an interim dividend for the first half of 2012.
Free cash flow for the year was positive, and we increased borrowings to prepare for the repayment of Rouble bonds and Eurobonds due in 2013.
As of 31 December 2012, the Company held cash and short-term deposits for a total of 1 US$2,064 million, compared to short-term debt of US$1,862 million.
As part of a strategic alignment of our asset base at the end of 2012, the Group decided to dispose of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel operations.
Accordingly these assets are accounted for as assets held for sale as at the year-end.
In March 2013 we announced the execution of a non-binding term sheet on sale of EVRAZ Highveld.
In January 2013 we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Raspadskaya coal company, which was mostly financed by equity, and via a US$202 million cash component payable in equal quarterly instalments ending on 15 January 2014.
In addition, in April 2013 we announced the acquisition of a 51% stake in Timir, a joint-venture with Alrosa, created for the development of large iron ore deposits in Yakutia, Russia for RUB4,950 million ca.

Steel sales volumes decreased only marginally from 15.5 million tonnes in 2011 to 15.3 million tonnes.
The reduction in revenues was due largely to a decrease in sales prices, in line with the general trend in steel pricing.
EVRAZ was also impacted by a poorer product mix during the year as steel from EVRAZ ZSMK was used for the production of lower margin billets because the rail mill modernisation programme halted rail production in April 2012.
As the EVRAZ ZSMK rail mill has been operational from 12 January 2013, and the ramp-up will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect an improved product mix during 2013.
In addition adverse market conditions impacted sales volumes of the Groups flat-rolled products in Europe.
1 Hereinafter debt and cash balances include the amounts held at operations that were classified as assets liabilities held for sale, which were separately presented in the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2012, and include US$70 million of cash and cash equivalents and US$79 million of debt.

The fall in prices and volumes of iron ore and coking coal had an adverse impact on EBITDA of the Mining segment.
Cost of revenues, expenses and results US$ million Relative Item 2012 2011 Change change % Cost of revenue 11,797 12,473 676 5.4 Gross profit 2,929 3,927 998 25.4 Selling and distribution costs 1,211 1,154 57 4.9 General and administrative expenses 860 921 61 6.6 Impairment of assets 413 104 309 297.1 Foreign exchange gains losses, net 41 269 310 115.2 Other operating income and expenses 161 157 4 2.5 profit from operations 243 1,860 1,617 86.9 Interest expense 645 708 63 8.9 Gain loss on financial assets and liabilities, net 164 355 519 146.2 Gain on disposal group classified as held for sale, net 114 8 106 1,325.0 Other non-operating gains losses, net 18 68 50 73.5 profit loss before tax 106 873 979 112.1 Income tax benefit expense 229 420 191 45.5 Net profit loss 335 453 788 174.0 Cost of revenue decreased by 5.4% to US$11,797 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of a number of factors.
Raw material costs decreased by 20% largely due to lower purchase prices for iron ore, coking coal and scrap.
The costs for semi-finished products fell by 39%, as more slabs were procured internally, for further re-rolling, as opposed to being purchased from third parties.
Expenditure on services decreased by US$9 million, as inflationary pressure was balanced by a 5% devaluation of the Rouble and through cost savings at many of our operations.
Goods for resale increased by 55% as EVRAZ Metal Inprom increased the purchase of third party products to satisfy customer demand.
Transportation costs increased by 7% following an increase in Russian railway tariffs and higher volumes of intragroup shipments of semi-products.
The 2012 labour cost increase is partially attributed to carryover effects of 2011 salary increases that were negotiated based on more favourable 2011 market conditions, however these were somewhat offset, at least in Russia, by the Rouble devaluation.
Total depreciation, depletion and amortisation amounted to US$1,259 million for 2012, compared to US$1,153 million for 2011.
The increase is due mainly to a larger depletion expense at Yuzhkuzbassugol following a revaluation of reserves in July 2011.
While higher reserves were recognised, the future development costs per tonne of coal are higher than previously estimated.
In 2012, management revised its mining plans to exclude some reserves that are not expected to be developed earlier than 2040-2070 and updated the reserves valuation accordingly.
This led to a minor reduction of reserve base and a significant decline in estimated future development costs used in the calculation of the depletion charge.
The amount of depreciation in cost of revenue was US$1,100 million for 2012.
64 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 We achieved a reduction in electricity costs of US$49 million through increased proprietary generation at EVRAZ ZSMK and lower consumption at our European operations due to reduced activity.
Natural gas expenditure was also slightly reduced as increases in prices were offset by devaluation of the local currencies, and reduced consumption volume as a result of lower level activity in Europe.
The large increase in other costs is mostly due to changes in finished goods inventory and work in progress, which increased by US$192 million in 2011, but decreased by US$53 million in 2012 due to destocking at the end of the year.
Breakdown of cost of revenue US$ million Relative Item 2012 2011 Change change % Cost of revenue 11,797 12,473 676 5 % Raw materials, incl.
This was slightly offset by a reduction in bad debt expense due to better cash collection from municipalities that are using heat and electricity produced by the Groups subsidiaries at respective locations.
General and administrative expenses declined in 2012 by 6.6% mainly due to a lower staff bonuses accrual, the one off effect of expenses related to the premium listing that were incurred in 2011 and significant cost saving initiatives implemented at EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium during the year.
In 2012, we had a significantly higher impairment charge of US$413 million than in the previous year.
US$356 million of this is attributed to the non-current assets of Evrazruda.
For more details please refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements.
Foreign exchange gains losses moved from a US$269 million gain in 2011 to a US$41 million loss in 2012.
This is in large part due to currency fluctuations on intragroup debt where the entities involved have different functional currencies.
IFRS does not have a notion of a Groups functional currency, therefore gains losses of one subsidiary do not have corresponding counterparts in another subsidiary and thus cannot be eliminated on consolidation.
For example this is the case between Russian subsidiaries with rouble functional currency and our non-Russian entities with other respective functional currencies.
Interest expense incurred by the Group has fallen steadily over the last two years as we have refinanced debt at lower interest rates.
Interest expense was US$645 million for 2012, compared to US$708 million for 2011.
Corporate Overview Strategy Operating Review Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements EVRAZ plc 65 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Gains on financial assets and liabilities for 2012 were US$164 million, and dominated by a gain of US$177 million on the change in fair value of derivatives currency and interest rate swaps for rouble bonds.
This is a significant reversal of the position in 2011 where a loss of US$110 million was incurred on the swaps alone.
In 2011 the loss on financial assets and liabilities also included the effect of a loss on early settlement of debt US$71 million and incentivised conversion of convertible bonds US$161 million, as described in more details in Notes 7 and 21 of the financial statements.
The Group recognised a US$83 million loss on reclassification of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium and EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel to assets held for sale.
This was more than offset by a gain realised by the sale of EvrazTrans, and together with the effect of other minor disposals, led to a US$ 114 million gain on assets classified as held for sale.
In 2012, the Company accrued an income tax expense of US$229 million, notwithstanding a loss before tax of US$106 million.
This was mostly due to losses at certain subsidiaries that could not be offset against profits of other subsidiaries, as well as the fact that some expenses are not deductible for tax purposes.
In 2012, the Company reported a US$335 million net loss, compared to a net profit of US$453 million in 2011.

In 2012, US$410 million of working capital was released as a result of lower average prices, but also as part of the continued focus on managing the Groups working capital.
In order to pre-finance the 2013 maturities of the put options on our 2013 rouble bonds, and of other bonds and notes, we deposited US$674 million at large Russian banks.
Capital expenditure was sustained at virtually the same level as in the previous year US$1,261 million in 2012 compared to US$1,281 million in 2011.
In 2012 made significant progress on many of the priority projects that we launched in 2010 2011, including the modernisation of the two rail mills in Russia, construction of Yerunakovskaya VIII coking coal mine, PCI for our Russian blast furnaces and construction of rolling mills at the south of Russia and in Kazakhstan.
Whilst many projects neared completion during the year investment started on new projects such as Mezhegey Phase I.
66 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Summary of capital expenditure for 2012 in millions of USD is as follows EVRAZ ZSMK rail 143 Launched after modernisation programme in January 2013, ramp-up to be completed mill modernisation by Q1 2014 Construction of 135 Production of 2.5 million tonnes of raw coking coal per annum.

This, in addition to smaller disposals, resulted in a net positive contribution to our cash flow of US$311 million.
During the course of 2012 we also received US$88 million of dividends and US$38 million of capital returned by Corber, the Groups joint venture, and in turn paid US$375 million to our shareholders in dividends.
We also continued to benefit from realised gains on the swaps for the rouble bonds that generated another US$81 million of cash.
We do not have any other significant hedging instruments.
The free cash flow for the Group was US$780 million in 2012. Financing and liquidity Debt maturities schedule, US$ million 1,904 2,000 Q4 1,769 Q3 1,600 1,448 1,384 Q2 1,200 1,039 Q1 800 642 excluding interest and lease payments and 400 including debt maturities of disposal groups 72 held for sale 0 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019-2023 We started 2012 with a total debt of US$7,245 million.
Due to the favourable situation in capital markets in the first half of 2012, we decided to pre-finance our large bond maturities coming due in March and April 2013, in order to pro-actively manage the liquidity risk.
To this end, in April 2012 we issued US$600 million of 5-year Eurobonds, and in December 2012 we issued US$250 million of ECP.
As a result of these actions, our total debt increased to US$8,248 million as at 31 December 2012, while net debt decreased by US$258 million from US$6,442 million at 31 December 2011 to US$6,184 million at 31 December 2012.
Interest expense accrued in respect of loans, bonds and notes was US$588 million for 2012, compared to US$649 million for 2011.
Given the uncertainty in our key ratios in the near term, we decided to approach our bank lenders to adjust some of our covenants.
In June 2012 we agreed with the lenders to amend the levels on the two key maintenance covenants in most of our bank debt, namely the covenants to maintain i maximum net leverage ratio ratio of net debt to 12-month consolidated EBITDA and ii minimum EBITDA interest cover ratio ratio of 12-month consolidated EBITDA to 12-month consolidated interest expense.
Both ratios are based on Evraz Group S. A. s, and not the whole Groups, consolidated financial statements.
The new levels were set at 3.5x and 3.0x respectively, at the same time the definition of interest expense was adjusted to take account of cash gains on hedging arrangements related to rouble bond issues.
On 31 December 2012, the net leverage ratio was 3.1x, and the EBITDA interest cover ratio was 4.0x.
In December 2012, we also successfully obtained the consent of the holders of our 2015 Eurobonds to remove the maintenance covenant from these bonds.
As a result, we do not have any maintenance test on any of our public debt, giving us added flexibility in case of market downturns negatively affecting our leverage.
Corporate Overview Strategy Operating Review Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements EVRAZ plc 67 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Our Eurobond covenants currently limit our ability to incur new debt at Evraz Group S. A. and its subsidiaries, but do not limit our ability to refinance the debt of Evraz Group S. A. or to raise new debt at EVRAZ plc.
In order to increase our financial flexibility, we have set up project financing in relation to the Mezhegey project Phase I.
The project entity is a subsidiary of EVRAZ plc, but not a subsidiary of Evraz Group S. A. so any utilisation of this financing is not subject to the restriction of the incurrence covenants of the Evraz Group S. A. Eurobonds.
As of 31 December 2012, we had US$5 million drawn under this facility.
Part of our bank loans continue to include covenants to maintain certain financial metrics related to profitability and leverage.
As of 31 December 2012 the outstanding amount of such loans was US$1,424 million.
Given the high volatility in the global steelmaking industry, we continue to closely monitor and proactively address any potential issues of future compliance with covenants associated with Companys financial indebtedness.
Our cash and deposits on 31 December 2012 of US$2,064 million compared to a short-term debt of US$1,862 million gives us confidence in our financial position.
Dividends Based on the results of the first half of 2012 we declared an interim dividend of 11 cents per share.
Due to the deterioration in the market environment, and consequently our performance, in the second half of 2012, the Directors have recommended to pay no final dividend for 2012.
