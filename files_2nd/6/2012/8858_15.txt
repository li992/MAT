We will continue to invest in capital expenditure in our businesses across the world and in research and should help to reduce the groups effective tax rate further.

Therefore, whilst further improvements in the groups ROIC may be possible, our objective is to maintain the groups the line R&D credit regime with effect from 1st April 2013 will increase the groups reported effective tax rate on underlying profit.

Net debt 454.2 639.4 The groups cash generation has also been strong.
As a result of this strong performance the board has carried out a review of the groups balance sheet structure.
The outlook for the group remains strong and we believe that it has ample resources to fund forecast capital expenditure and a further increase in research and development.
The board is, therefore, recommending a special dividend to shareholders of 100.0 pence per share, which represents a total payment of approximately 212 million.
The special dividend will be accompanied by a share consolidation.
The consolidation factor will be announced to shareholders in the annual general meeting circular on 20th June 2012.
In order to enable the groups objective of delivering long term growth to its shareholders, it is imperative that the company has sufficient funds to invest in capital expenditure, research and development and appropriate acquisitions whilst at the same time maintaining a balance sheet structure that safeguards the groups financial strength through economic cycles.
The group is subject to potentially large working capital swings as business activity changes.
In particular, Emission Control Technologies has a substantial working capital requirement as business activity increases.
These swings can be accentuated by volatility in precious metal prices.
As a result of these factors, it is appropriate to run the business with a modest amount of debt.
We believe that a net debt including post tax pension deficits to EBITDA ratio of around 1.5 to 2.0 times is appropriate for the group over the longer term.
If the special dividend is approved by shareholders, the net debt including post tax pension deficits to EBITDA ratio for the year ended 31st March 2012 would have been, on a pro forma basis, 1.3 times.
The company will also, as required, have discussions with the UK pension schemes Trustees regarding this return of capital as part of the current actuarial valuation.
