Annual Report and Accounts 2012 17 Financial Review continued Shareholder Tax The actual tax rate for each year is impacted by stock market related timing differences and one off effects such as the change in corporation tax rate.
Therefore, to assist shareholders, the table below provides a high level analysis of shareholder tax, and a more detailed analysis is included in Note 8 to the financial statements.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Million Million Expected shareholder tax 33.7 29.6 Market related tax effects 4.0 20.3 Other tax adjustments 2.0 0.6 Corporation tax rate change 8.2 7.0 Actual shareholder tax 27.5 2.9 Expected shareholder tax rate 25.0% 27.0% Actual shareholder tax rate 20.4% 2.6% The expected shareholder tax principally reflects the current corporation tax rate applicable to profits in the year, and will vary from year to year depending upon the emergence of profit between the different tax regimes which apply to the St. Jamess Place Group companies.
There has been a small change this year to reassign 5.1 million of expected tax effect as being market related, which we believe will give a more useful and consistent analysis going forward.
More detail is included in Note 8 to the financial statements.
The market related tax effects and other tax adjustments will typically be small.
However, the lower investment markets in 2011 resulted in a large negative market related tax effect in that year.
The impact of the corporation tax rate change on deferred tax has reduced the tax charge in both years.
The impact on shareholder tax in 2011 reflects a reduction of 2% in the corporation tax rate, from 27% to 25%.
The impact in 2012 reflects a 2% reduction from 25% to 23% which will be the tax rate from April 2013.
The overall impact of all of the above effects is to increase the tax charge on an IFRS basis to 27.5 million 2011: 2.9 million.
IFRS Profit after Tax The following additional analysis of the IFRS profit after tax result identifies the different contributions from the business in-force at the start of the year, and the new business added during the year.
It starts from the cash result, which can be found on pages 23 to 25.
New Year Ended 31 December 2012 Notes In-Force Business Total Million Million Million Cash result 1 152.2 60.5 91.7 DIR amortisation 2 93.6 5.8 99.4 DAC amortisation 3 74.7 5.8 80.5 PVIF amortisation 4 2.4 2.4 DIR on new business 2 155.9 155.9 DAC on new business 3 155.0 155.0 Share options 5 5.4 5.4 IFRS deferred tax impacts 6 8.3 8.3 Other IFRS 7 5.3 5.3 Corporation tax rate change 8 8.2 8.2 IFRS profit after tax 168.5 61.4 107.1 18 St. Jamess Place plc Registered No.

This reflects the increased cash result arising from the greater income from the higher funds under management.
However this is largely offset by the increase in the effective tax rate, reflected in this analysis by the difference in contribution from deferred tax.
The loss associated with acquiring new business for the year was 61.4 million 2011:53.3million loss and should be viewed as an investment for future profits.
The increase in the cost of new business reflected higher expenses in the year, particularly development expenses and the increased cost of the FSCS levy.
In 2013 we expect to see some change in this breakdown of the IFRS profit after tax result, as a result of the introduction of the adviser charging rules.
However the overall impact of the changes is expected to be small.
These figures are explained in the analysis of the post-tax cash result in Section 3.
DIR: IFRS requires any initial profit which arises on new business either through an initial charge or surrender penalty to be deferred at the outset and then amortised over the life of the associated product or the surrender penalty period.
This required treatment gives rise to two adjustments to arrive at the IFRS result.
a The amortisation of the opening deferred income, which increases profit for the period, was 93.6million 2011: 82.9 million in the current year.
The release in a particular year will depend upon the value of DIR at the start of the year and the remaining life of the policies to which the DIR relates or the remaining surrender penalty period.
In 2012 there was a modification to the outstanding surrender penalty position which increased the level of cash profits resulting in a 1.7 million reduction in the amortisation of the DIR in the year, from the expected level of 95.3 million.
The expected release for 2013 is 113.8 million.
b The deferral of the initial profit associated with new business sales reduced the IFRS result by 155.9 million in 2012 2011: 135.7 million.
The deferral of profit in any particular year will be dependent upon the level of new business.
In addition, the modification noted above has resulted in an increase in the DIR on new business in the year by nearly 8 million.
DAC: Specific new business acquisition expenses are required to be deferred in the year they arise and then amortised in future years over the life of the policies to which the costs relate.
The treatment of these acquisition expenses gives rise to two adjustments in the IFRS result.
a The amortisation of the opening DAC, which reduces profit for the period, was 74.7 million 2011: 64.6 million in the current year.
The charge in a particular period will depend upon the value of the DAC at the start of the year and the remaining life of the policies to which the DAC relates.
The expected amortisation charge for 2013 is 84.8 million.
b The deferral of the specific acquisition costs, which were incurred in the current period, increased IFRS profits by 155 million 2011: 144.8 million.
The deferral of expenses in any particular year will be dependent upon the level of the acquisition costs which themselves will be determined by the level of new business.
PVIF: The IFRS balance sheet includes an asset representing purchased value of in-force PVIF.
This asset is amortised over the remaining life of the policies associated with this asset.
The amortisation charge for the year was 2.4 million 2011: 2.8 million.
The charge for 2013 is expected to be 2.5 million.
Share options: this figure is the notional cost that is associated with the various share option schemes.
IFRS deferred tax: Under IFRS a deferred tax asset is established for future tax benefits that are expected to emerge.
This is not recognised in the cash result.
The significant change between the two years reflects the establishment of an additional tax asset in respect of excess E from the tax calculation for the life business in the prior year, and the utilisation of this asset in the current year.
Both years also benefit from an expected small underlying positive contribution, also related to taxation in the life business.
Other IFRS: This item reflects a number of other adjustments from the cash result.
For instance, the cash result reflects the regulatory solvency requirement to hold prudent actuarial reserves, but these are not held in the IFRS result.
Therefore movements in these reserves generally related to movements in the stock markets will impact the cash result but are reversed in the IFRS.
There will be a small impact, either positive or negative, depending upon stock market movements, in future years.
Corporation tax rate change: the above adjustments are all shown net of deferred tax rates prevailing at the end of each year, and this 8.2 million 2011: 7.0 million reflects the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the change in the tax rate from 25% to 23%.

This should have a positive impact on the future cash result.
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 25 Financial Review continued This investment in new business will generate income in the future that should significantly exceed the cost of investment and therefore provide positive returns for shareholders.

Capital Position The capital position of the Group, calculated on the regulatory basis solvency net assets and allowing for the regulatory solvency requirement, is shown in the table below.
The Group continues to be capitalised well in excess of regulatory solvency requirements, and the assets are invested prudently in cash, AAA rated money market funds and UK government securities.
Comparison with previous valuations would show that the Group solvency position has remained stable despite market volatility, reflecting the low appetite for market, credit and liquidity risks in relation to solvency.

We are not intending to change our approach of investing in UK Government Gilts following the recent credit downgrade of the UK.
Solvency II We are well advanced in our preparation for the adoption of the new EU Solvency II requirements, and to minimise unnecessary expense arising from the delayed implementation we are re-aligning our processes to reflect the expected new rules as far as possible.
We expect to be able to manage any period of dual running with minimal cost.
As noted previously, we dont believe the Group will be adversely impacted by the new requirements and we expect to see a reduction in the total capital we are required to hold for regulatory purposes.
Share Options Maturity At 31 December 2012 there were 12.5 million share options outstanding under the various share option schemes which, if exercised, will provide up to 34.0 million 2011: 49.1 million, of future capital for the Company.

These costs are met from corresponding policy margins and any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not directly impact the profitability of the Company.
The reduction in investment expenses in recent years reflects the consolidation of our investment approach resulting in a move towards our insurance business funds investing through our unit trusts.
As a result, the investment expenses within those unit trusts that have been invested into by our insurance funds, are no longer explicitly reported, which results in a reduction in the reported investment expense in the year of change.
The other new business related costs, such as sales force incentivisation, vary with the level of sales determined on our internal measure.
As production rises or falls these costs will move in the corresponding direction.
Establishment costs are the running costs of the Groups infrastructure and are relatively fixed in nature in the short term, although they are subject to inflationary increases.
These costs will increase as the infrastructure expands to manage the higher number of existing clients and the growth in the Partnership.
The growth in establishment expenses during the year was 7.8%, above our original expectations of 5% as a result of increased costs associated with the high level of Partner recruitment in the year.
Development costs represent the expenditure associated with a significant development in our investment proposition together with the costs associated with regulatory change.
The development expenses were 10.3 million during 2012 and we expect further costs in 2013 of 5.3 million.
The FSA FSCS costs represent the fees payable to the FSA of 5.1 million 2011: 4.5 million together with our required contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of 6.9 million 2011: 3.5 million.
Contribution from third party product sales reflects the net income received from wealth management sales of 0.9 million 2011: 3.5 million, sales of group pension products of 7.8 million 2011: 1.5 million and sales through the Protection Panel of 12.7 million 2011: 8.5 million.
During the current year, 3.6 million of software development costs have been capitalised as an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38.
This asset will be amortised over the following four years.

03183415 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information Movement in Funds Under Management The table below shows the movement in the funds under management of the Group during the reporting period.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Billion Billion Opening funds under management 28.5 27.0 New money invested 5.6 5.2 Investment return 3.0 1.8 37.1 30.4 Regular withdrawals maturities 0.7 0.5 Surrenders part surrenders 1.6 1.4 Closing funds under management 34.8 28.5 Implied surrender rate as % of average funds under management 4.9% 5.2% Net inflow of funds 3.35 3.21 Net inflow as % of opening funds under management 11.8% 11.9% Shareholders will be pleased to note that the continued strong retention of funds under management, together with the level of new money invested, provides for net inflow of funds of 3.35 billion, slightly higher than the prior year.
This net inflow represents 11.8% 2011: 11.9% of opening funds under management and can be viewed as the organic growth in funds.
Noted below is an explanation of regular withdrawals, maturities and surrenders: The regular withdrawals represent those amounts selected by clients which are paid out by way of periodic income.
The withdrawals have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Maturities are those sums paid out where the plan has reached the selected maturity date e. g. retirement date.
The expected maturities have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Surrenders and part surrenders are those amounts where clients have chosen to withdraw money from their plan.
Surrenders are assumed to occur in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit based on actual experience, updated on an annual basis, by plan duration and the age of the client.
The implied surrender rate shown in the table above is very much a simple average and reflects only recent experience.
Whilst it could be compared with the long-term assumptions underlying the calculation of the embedded value, it should not be assumed that small movements in this rate will result in a change to the long-term embedded value assumptions.
