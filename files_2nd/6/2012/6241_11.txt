The 28.2% increase in cost of sales was mainly due to the rise in adjusted production cost to US$576.2 million, an increase of 37.4%, Allcomparisons refer to 2012 gures which resulted from a combination of factors including: i costs compared to 2011, unless otherwise associated with the new Noche Buena gold mine and the first full year of production at Saucito: ii increased volumes of ore processed at all noted.

The cost of sales was also impacted by higher depreciation resulting mainly from the temporarily higher depletion factor at Noche Buena and Saucito and from the increased asset base.
Exploration expenses increased over the prior year as part of our strategy to grow the Groups resource base.
Cash ow generated by our operations and the Silverstream Contract, combined with a healthy cash position, enabled the Company to allocate capital to plant and equipment and to pay shareholder dividends.
