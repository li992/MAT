Pensions We operate a defined benefit pension scheme for people John Davis employed in the UK before 1 October 2001.
The pension deficit Chief Financial Officer for this scheme declined from 40 million last year to 27 million at 31 March 2007.
This decline is largely the result of changes in the corporate and government bond yields that are the benchmarks for determining certain key assumptions that we use to value our liabilities as required by IFRSs.
We discuss the sensitivity of these assumptions on page 40.
For the people employed in the UK after 30 September 2001 and employees in the US and Spain, we do not have pension plans where we have to record a net asset or net liability.
