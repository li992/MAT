14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 32 FINANCIAL REVIEW Overall, Group profit before tax increased almost four-fold to 69.0 million, from 17.6 million in 2006.
Excluding non-trading exceptional items, operating profit totalled 72.1 million 2006: 46.3 million.
Non-trading exceptional items totalled a net credit of 10.5 million in the period 2006: charges of 18.6 million.
This included an 8.5 million profit on the sale of Maltby colliery in February 2007.
This was lower than originally anticipated, with the reduction in the pensions deficit in the year being reflected in a reduced surplus on disposal on the transfer of pension entitlements at Maltby.
Also included in non-trading exceptional items was 2.0 million credit of rationalisation, closure and other costs 2006: charges of 18.6 million.
These benefited from the net release of 8.8 million of provisions following agreement with HM Revenue & Customs HMRC on the treatment of tax deductions arising on redundancies.
Earnings per share increased by 412% to 59.9 pence 2006: 11.7 pence.
This includes the effect of a 25.0 million deferred tax credit, after recognising the deferred tax asset relating to the Groups accumulated trading losses.
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding this tax credit, were 44.0 pence 2006: 11.7 pence.
Financing costs and funding Net finance costs have increased by 41% to 14.2 million 2006: 10.1 million.
This includes the cost of the mark-to-market adjustment on interest rate swaps of 1.9 million 2006: gain of 0.6 million.
We have applied hedge accounting from 1 January 2008 and this will minimise the volatility of the swaps on our income statement going forward.
Excluding the change in fair value of interest rate swaps, net finance costs have increased by 15% to 12.3 million reflecting the higher level of drawn debt 2006: 10.7 million.
On average, interest rates on our current facilities are approximately 98% fixed at approximately 7% interest per annum.
Also included in Group financing costs is a charge for the unwinding of discounts in relation to the provisions in the balance sheet of 3.9 million 2006: 4.6 million.
The Group currently has 194.3 million of borrowing facilities and a further 13.9 million outstanding on finance leases.
The borrowing facilities comprise a revolving credit facility of 52.0 million secured on property and working capital, 136.4 million secured on property and 5.9 million on surface mining plant.
The average maturity of the facilities was 2.9 years 2006: 2.2 years.
The Group has cash deposits which are held by our captive insurance company against insurance claims and similarly ring-fenced funds held on behalf of the Coal Authority predominantly securing surface damage claims resulting from mining.
These totalled 25.7 million and 23.4 million respectively at 31 December 2007 2006: 19.6 and 22.7 million.
These deposits together with property assets with a value of 9.9 million 2006: 13.9 million were secured against liabilities of 18.9 million and 16.4 million respectively.
Gearing at the year end has been reduced as a result of the increase in our property asset values recognised on the balance sheet.
The gross debt less unrestricted cash to equity ratio improved to 23% 2006: 28%.
Tax The Group paid no corporation tax in 2007 2006: nil.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had trading losses of 264.0 million with a tax value of 74.0 million 2006: 41.5 million available to offset against future profits in the mining business and gross timing differences with a tax value of 6.9 million 2006: 33.1 million.
The net deficit on the balance sheet in respect of retirement provisions also represents a tax timing difference of 20.5 million 2006: 35.8 million.
The Group has recognised, at 31 December 2007, a deferred tax asset of 36.0 million 2006: 35.7 million.
The Group continues to take a prudent view of deferred tax asset, given the nature of the business and its historic 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 33 performance.
A deferred tax credit of 25.0 million has been recognised in the income statement, however, offsetting a corresponding charge to reserves, reflecting the ascription of the asset at the year end in part to trading losses and other timing differences and in part to pension liabilities.
The Group has in excess of 380 million of capital losses which can be offset against profits arising on disposals of properties currently held by the Group.
These capital losses are sufficient to offset the vast majority of the deferred tax liability which would otherwise be required in respect of the Investment Properties leaving a small deferred tax liability which has been recognised in the financial statements of 0.8 million 2006: 1.2 million.

This is mainly due to interest and financing costs of 13.2 million.
The cash outflow from investing activities was 3.1 million.
This is mainly attributable to purchase of operating property, plant and equipment of 23.0 million offset by the proceeds on disposal of Maltby of 21.5 million.
Balance Sheet The net assets of the Group increased by 114.1 million to 358.2 million.
The increase in net assets is mainly due to the increase in our investment portfolio valuation and a reduction in retirement benefit obligations.
Significant movements in the balance sheet relate mainly to Investment Properties, provisions and retirement benefit obligations.
The increase in Investment Property has been discussed within the Harworth Estates section.
Provisions The provisions outstanding at 31 December were as follows: 2007 2006 m m i Employer and public liabilities 18.9 19.9 Surface damage 16.4 19.8 ii Claims 1.5 iii Restoration and closure costs of surface mines 54.6 51.8 iv Restoration and closure costs of deep mines: shaft treatment and pit top 12.2 17.6 spoil heaps 3.2 4.2 pumping costs 6.3 6.6 Ground groundwater contamination 6.5 9.8 v Redundancy 4.1 16.0 122.2 147.2 33 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 34 i Employer and public liabilities and surface damage provisions Provisions are made for current and estimated obligations in respect of claims made by employees and contractors relating to accident or disease as a result of the business activities of the Group.
This is managed by our captive insurance Company, Harworth Insurance Company Limited, a UK-based FSA registered Company.
As at 31 December 2007, it held 25.7 million of cash deposits and 3.3 million of property assets to meet 18.9 million of liabilities.
Surface damage provision relates to the Groups liability to compensate for subsidence damage arising essentially from past deep mining operations.
Claims can be lodged by the public up to 6 years after the date of the relevant damage.
The estimate is based on historical claims experience, following a detailed assessment of the nature of damage foreseen.
The reduction in surface damage provisions is in line with the reduction in number of operating mines within the Group.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had 23.4 million of ring-fenced deposits and 6.6 million of property secured to meet these liabilities.
ii Claims Outstanding claims associated with surface mine sites contracted out to third parties have largely been settled during the year.
iii Surface mines Restoration and rehabilitation provisions represent the expected cost of the reinstatement of the site including overburden and soil, discounted for the time value of money.
This provision is created, and an equal and opposite non-current asset is created, when coaling commences.
Along with other pre-coaling expenses, this asset is written off in proportion to the expected recoverable reserves of the mine.
Expenditures for restoration and rehabilitation are offset against the provisions as incurred.
The unwinding of the discount for the time value of money is included within the finance cost.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had a non-current asset of 20.1 million 2006: 9.7 million, relating to both expenditure on pre-coaling and similar expenses and the recognition of the provision for restoration and rehabilitation liabilities on sites that had started coaling.
At the same date, provisions for restoration and rehabilitation totalled 54.6 million 2006: 51.8 million.
In future the average working surface mine site is likely to be smaller than those worked in the past, reflecting both the available sites and planning issues.
There will be a significant unwinding of the balance sheet provisions in respect of the last remaining large sites Maidens Hall and Stobswood.
Mining on these sites has lasted over 11 and 17 years respectively, and there remains a cost of 37.6 million to restore these sites, of which 26.5 million will be carried out over the next 2 years with the balance being utilised over the next 5 years.
iv Deep mines We maintain provisions in respect of the costs of restoring our deep mines to the required standard and planning conditions.
The amount provided represents the discounted net present value of the expected costs.
Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included within the finance costs for the year.
The provision can be broken down into ongoing and closed mines.
m Ongoing mines 19.7 Closed mines 8.5 28.2 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 9 4 08 14:18 Page 35 70 per cent of deep mines provision relates to our 4 ongoing mines which will be utilised after the point of closure.
Of the closed mines provision, we expect to utilise 1.8 million in 2008 and 1.9 million in 2009, predominantly the costs in respect of Harworth and Rossington collieries.
The remaining balance of 4.8 million will be utilised from 2010. v Redundancy Provisions Redundancy provisions are created when the decision to make the redundancies has been made and communicated, usually through the representatives of the workforce.
We expect to utilise all the redundancy provisions in 2008.
Retirement Benefit Obligations The defined benefit pension and retirement schemes comprise 2 funded Industry Wide Schemes and an unfunded concessionary fuel scheme.
The Group has a deficit of 73.2 million 2006: 120.5 million on these schemes which are closed to new entrants but are required to be open for future service.
All new employees who joined after the privatisation in 1994 are eligible to join defined contribution schemes.
This includes an unfunded concessionary fuel scheme with a liability of 23.4 million 2006: 24.7 million.
All of these schemes are valued annually by our independent actuaries, the Government Actuarys Department.
The schemes have been valued under International Accounting Standard 19 IAS 19, using the projected unit method and discounting future scheme liabilities on the basis of AA-rated corporate bond yields of over 15 years.
The discount rate used, net of inflation, was 2.5% 2006: 2.0%.
Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations, using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuations for this purpose were at 31 December 2003 and we are currently in the process of finalising the 2006 triennial valuations.
Movements in the schemes in 2007 are set out below: Concessionary Pension Fuel Total m m m 1 January 2007 95.8 24.7 120.5 Expected return on assets 22.9 22.9 Interest on deficit 22.0 1.2 23.2 Net actuarial gains 36.2 1.3 37.5 Effect of curtailment or settlement 2.4 0.9 3.3 Contributions paid less current service cost 6.5 0.3 6.8 31 December 2007 49.8 23.4 73.2 Including Blenkinsopp pension scheme.
The deficit reduction of 47.3 million comprises: Net actuarial gains of 37.5 million 2006: 11.6 million arising mainly from estimated higher than previously expected asset returns.
The gains are treated as reserve movements and reported in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
Additional payments to the pension scheme of 6.8 million 2006: 6.4 million representing the net difference between employer contributions payments made of 20.0 million 2006: 21.0 million and the actuarys calculation of the costs of benefits accrued in the year.
Gains from curtailments and settlements of 3.3 million 2006: 4.3 million due to redundancies, the sale of Maltby colliery, and other scheme leavers.
These are reported in the income statement as non-trading exceptional items.
Details relating to the pension scheme, as presented in the 2007 annual report and the most recent actuarial valuation, are shown in note 23 to the financial DAVID BROCKSOM, statements.
