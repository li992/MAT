32 Serco Group plc Business review Finance review Finance review Andrew Jenner, Finance Director Serco continued to grow strongly in 2007 with another double-digit increase in revenue.
At the same time, we successfully increased our margins and free cash flow and further strengthened our balance sheet.
Business review Finance review Serco Group plc 33 1.
Financial performance Sercos income statement for the year is summarised in Figure 1 below.
This includes the results of joint ventures which are proportionately consolidated.
As announced in our 2007 interim results, we have adopted a new pro forma profit measure, profit before tax and amortisation of acquired intangibles Adjusted profit before tax.
Figure 1 also shows Adjusted earnings per share, which is calculated before the amortisation of acquired intangibles.
For 2006, the adjusted measures also exclude the gain on sale of our PFI investments of 11.4m.
Figure 1: Income statement Year ended 31 December 2007 2006 Increase m m Revenue 2,810.7 2,548.2 10.3% Gross profit 406.2 365.7 11.1% Administrative expenses 264.2 242.9 Adjusted operating profit 142.0 122.8 15.6% Investment revenue and finance costs 18.8 17.8 Adjusted profit before tax 123.2 105.0 17.3% Amortisation of acquired intangibles 8.6 9.0 Gain on sale of PFI investments 11.4 Profit before tax 114.6 107.4 6.7% Tax 32.2 27.9 Profit for the year 82.4 79.5 3.6% Effective tax rate 28.1% 26.0% Adjusted earnings per share 18.57p 15.92p 16.6% Earnings per share 16.98p 16.62p 2.2% Dividend per share 4.25p 3.60p 18.1% 1.1 Revenue Revenue grew by 10.3% to 2,810.7m, benefiting from the growth of existing contracts and the contribution of new wins.
1.2 Gross margin Gross margin the average contract margin across our portfolio was 14.5%, a small increase on 2006.
1.3 Investment revenue and finance costs Investment revenue and finance costs totalled a net cost of 18.8m 2006: 17.8m.
In December 2006, we sold a number of our PFI investments to Infrastructure Investors Limited.
The loss of net interest income from these investments was largely offset by the increase in net interest income from our retirement benefit obligations.
1.4 Adjusted profit before tax Adjusted profit before tax was 123.2m, an increase of 17.3%.
This represented a margin of 4.4%, up from 4.1% last year.
34 Serco Group plc Business review Finance review 1.5 Gain on sale of PFI investments 2006 included an 11.4m one-off gain on the sale of PFI investments.
The sale was 2 part of our creation of a strategic PFI investment partnership with I.
There was no corresponding gain in 2007.
1.6 Profit before tax Profit before tax increased by 6.7% to 114.6m.
Profit before tax excluding the gain on sale in 2006 was up by 19.4%.
1.7 Tax The tax charge of 32.2m 2006: 27.9m represents an effective rate of 28.1%, compared with 26.0% in 2006.
The underlying rate in 2006 was 29.1% before the gain on sale of the PFI investments.
The decrease in the underlying rate is primarily due to the mix of taxable profits.
1.8 Earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS rose by 16.6% to 18.57p.
EPS and Adjusted EPS are calculated on an average share base of 482.4m during the period 2006: 471.2m.
The increase in the average share base resulted from the exercise of employees share options.
2. Dividend Sercos policy is to increase the total dividend each year broadly in line with the increase in underlying earnings.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 3.02p per share, representing an increase on the 2006 final dividend of 18.4% and bringing the total dividend for the year to 4.25p, growth of 18.1%.
The final dividend will be paid on 21 May to shareholders on the register on 7 March.
Cash flow The Group generated a free cash inflow of 97.6m 2006: 85.4m, an increase of 14.3%.
Figure 2 analyses the cash flow.
As in previous years, we have designed the analysis to show the true cash performance of the Group the cash flows generated by subsidiaries plus the dividends received from joint ventures.
It therefore differs from the consolidated cash flow on page 75, which proportionately consolidates the cash flows of joint ventures.
The adjustment line in Figure 2 reconciles the movement in Group cash to the consolidated cash flow.
Business review Finance review Serco Group plc 35 Figure 2: Cash flow Year ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Operating profit excluding joint ventures 92.2 87.9 Non cash items 52.1 35.0 Group EBITDA 144.3 122.9 Working capital movement 4.7 2.1 Group operating cash flow 139.6 120.8 Interest 25.6 10.6 Tax 5.4 6.7 Expenditure on tangible and intangible assets 47.9 47.7 Dividends from joint ventures 36.9 29.6 Group free cash flow 97.6 85.4 Disposal of joint ventures 3.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries 7.4 Cash received on sale of PFI investments 76.5 Cash disposed of and transaction costs on sale of PFIs 58.3 Other financing 71.0 98.6 Special pension contribution 51.0 19.0 Dividends paid 17.9 14.5 Group net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 46.4 28.5 Adjustment to include joint venture cash impacts 6.7 10.3 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 39.7 18.2 Note: Group EBITDA is earnings from subsidiaries excluding joint ventures before interest, tax, depreciation, intangible amortisation and other non cash items 3.1 Group operating cash flow Group operating cash flow of 139.6m 2006: 120.8m reflects a conversion of Group EBITDA into cash of 97% 2006: 98%.
This was a strong cash performance, given the level of organic growth in the business.
3.2 Interest Net interest paid was 25.6m, compared to 10.6m in 2006.
The increase is mainly due to lower cash interest receipts after the disposal of PFI investments in December 2006.
Cash tax is below the equivalent tax charge in the income statement.
This reflects timing differences and the availability of tax relief on the special pension contributions of 19m in December 2006 and 51m in January 2007.
3.4 Expenditure on tangible and intangible assets Expenditure on tangible and intangible assets in the year was 47.9m 2006: 47.7m.
This represents 2.2% of revenue excluding joint ventures 2006: 2.5%.
Expenditure in 2007 included the completion of the roll-out of our SAP system in the UK.
3.5 Dividends from joint ventures Dividends received from joint ventures totalled 36.9m 2006: 29.6m, a conversion rate of 100% 2006: 87% of joint ventures profit after tax and minority interest, excluding costs allocated by Group.
Going forward, we expect conversion in the range of 80-90%.
36 Serco Group plc Business review Finance review 3.6 Other financing The movement in other financing resulted from repayments of our loans and the maturing of one of our private placements in December 2007 for 43.2m.
Net debt Figure 3 analyses Sercos net debt.
Figure 3: Net debt At 31 December 2007 2006 m m Group cash and cash equivalents 138.1 177.8 Group loans 263.3 334.4 Group obligations under finance leases 12.7 15.3 Group recourse net debt 137.9 171.9 Joint venture recourse net cash 34.9 28.2 Total recourse net debt 103.0 143.7 Group non recourse debt 59.3 62.2 Total net debt 162.3 205.9 4.1 Group recourse net debt Group recourse net debt decreased from 171.9m to 137.9m, due to the cash flows generated by the business.
Included within Group recourse net debt is 11.9m 2006: 10.6m of encumbered cash.
This is cash of PFI and other project companies securing credit obligations and customer advance payments.
4.2 Group non recourse debt The Group's debt is non recourse if no Group company other than the relevant borrower such as a special purpose company for a PFI has an obligation to repay the debt under a guarantee or other arrangement.
The debt is excluded from all of our credit agreements and other covenant calculations, and therefore has no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Group non recourse debt reduced by 2.9m to 59.3m during the year, due to scheduled repayments.
The non recourse debt relates to the Kilmarnock prison contract and our Driver Examination Services contract in Canada.
Pensions At 31 December 2007, the net liability included in the balance sheet arising from our defined benefit pension scheme obligations was 52.2m 2006: 120.0m.

Each type has its own accounting treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards.
These are: Non contract specific schemes which do not relate to specific contracts or franchises.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss for the period to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense the SORIE Reimbursable schemes where we have a right of full cost reimbursement and therefore include both the pension scheme deficit and offsetting reimbursable rights debtor in the balance sheet Not certain to be reimbursable schemes relating to specific contracts or franchises, where the deficit will pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss on our share of the deficit for the period to the SORIE, recognise a recoverable intangible asset on the balance sheet at the start of the contract or franchise and amortise the intangible asset to the income statement over the contract or franchise life.
Serco has limited commercial risk in relation to the contract specific schemes, due to either the right of cost reimbursement or because the deficit will pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
Among our non contract specific schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
The reduction in the deficit reflects the movement in bond yields and the action we have taken to ensure appropriate funding for the scheme, including the special pension contribution of 51m in January 2007.
Figure 5 shows the sensitivity of the liabilities of our pension schemes to changes in discount rates and to adjustments in the actuarial assumptions for the rate of inflation, members salary increases and life expectancies.

Treasury The Groups principal debt finance consists of a 400m bank credit facility comprising a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility.
At 31 December 2007 we had 141m 31 December 2006: 163m outstanding on the term loans and the revolving facility was undrawn.
Interest is charged at a rate of 45 basis points over LIBOR on borrowings under the facility.
The facility is unsecured and matures in December 2009.
Serco has also issued loan notes under two private placements.
The first private placement, for 43.2m, matured in December 2007 and was fully repaid.
The second, for 117.0m, amortises evenly from 2011 to 2015.
