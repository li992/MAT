Accordingly the Group has loans in the same currencies as the capital employed in the Groups main overseas operations.
From time to time, the Group uses cross currency swap instruments to also convert the currency of the Groups borrowings to such functional currencies.
Interest rate risk management The Group finances its operation through a mix of retained profits and borrowings.
To reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the Groups borrowings, the Groups policy is to have fixed rate debt equal to at least 50% of its borrowings.
Accordingly, the Group may contract with major financial institutions for interest rate swap agreements, where the Group agrees to exchange the difference between a fixed interest rate and a variable interest rate, as applied to a notional principal amount.
