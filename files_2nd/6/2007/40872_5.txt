Pr ior to conversion, all the joint venture agreements, most of which had been put in place some years earlier, were reviewed.
As a result of this review a number of the agreements were renegotiated million million to ensure that, in future, performance fees from joint ventures, which are non-REITable profits, are REIT conversion charge 10.9 received annually rather than every five years or on the disposal of an asset.
The aim is that, as far as Deferred taxation released 22.3 possible, non-REITable profits are not affected in any one year by large one-off performance fees earned over a number of years.
Under the renegotiated agreements 6.7million of performance fees Impact on taxation charge in income statement 11.4 from these joint ventures have been agreed as payable to the Group at 31 March 2007 increasing this years profit by a net 3.3million.

As a result, which, together with debt and other net liabilities, including the 2% REIT conversion charge of 2.6million, in order to ensure that the Group was not exposed to unknown legislation, the Agora and Radial had a fair value on acquisition of 116.6million for an overall purchase price after costs of 116.7million.

Recurring profits include a The return on capital uses a slightly different base from that used in previous years as the introduction of IFRS net 3.3million of performance fees as a result of the renegotiation of the joint venture asset management accounting, which records unrealised fair value movements through the income statement coupled with the agreements.
Non-recurring losses of 6.5million 2006: 12.2million profit include an 8.7million cost of Groups decision, prior to 31 March 2007, to convert to a REIT from 1 April 2007, means that the income reorganising the Groups debt and a 1.6million cost of reorganising the Groups structure.
The other significant statement and shareholders funds reports reflect very similar results to the Groups previously calculated adjusted components were a reduction of 18.3million in net gains from fair value adjustments revaluation increases in return and shareholders triple net asset funds.
Therefore, it now makes sense to use the results amended only assets at 52.7million and the contribution of a full years results from the asset management businesses for the for any remaining deferred tax and fair value movements, whilst accepting the need to take account of one off AIF and Apia Funds.
The following summarises the key aspects of these results.
items such as the goodwill adjustment incorporated in last years calculation.
This year however, because of REIT conversion, there are still a number of adjustments required as shown in the table below.
Recurring profit 31 March 2007 31 March 2006 Return: million million 31 March 2007 31 March 2006 million million Property investment and other income 23.1 28.6 i Net contribution from joint ventures 4.4 5.5 Profit for the year 69.4 74.4 Net income from fund asset management activities 4.4 2.2 notes: ii Head office costs 1.6 8.0 i This includes 0.8million Deferred tax arising on fair value gains during the year 7.5 9.2 of profits from the AIF fund Net interest payable 12.2 12.4 Change in fair value of fixed rate debt, net of tax 5.8 0.9 management business whilst it was owned through Industrial Funds 18.1 15.9 Limited as a 50% joint venture.

Adjusted total return for the year 63.9 85.0 A straight comparison between the returns from each of the above activities is difficult because Head Office Equity shareholders funds at start of year 350.6 272.1 costs were not reallocated across the various activities in 2006.
However, a best estimate would apportion 3million of the costs against property investment, 1.3million against fund asset management and 1.6million Return on equity shareholders funds 19.8% 27.3% against the joint ventures.
Taking this into account the profit from property investment and other income fell by Adjusted return on equity shareholders funds 18.2% 31.2% 2.5million as rental income fell by some 2.7million despite the portfolio increasing by a net 106million, including 170million of acquisitions, to 462million.
This apparent anomaly is due to the fact that The return on equity shareholders funds was 19.8% 2006: 27.3% and the adjusted shareholders return, which 130million of the purchases were acquired via JSRE in mid-March 2007 whilst the majority of the 70million includes the elimination of REIT conversion, was 18.2% this year.
The main reason for this reduced return is that of disposals occurred much earlier in the year.
The rent roll as at 31 March 2007 was 24.5million March 2006 fair value gains in the Groups wholly owned portfolio and joint ventures are some 28million lower than in 21.2million.
In addition, property costs increased by 1.1million, due to increased costs on rent renewals 2006 when the Group had also made realised gains of 17.7million on assets sold out of the Ashtenne acquisition.
and new lettings, a significant element of this being surrender premiums paid on lease terminations, together Another significant element of the return this year has been the reduction in the fair value of debt.
This is due with a rise in void costs.
Other income is up 1.1million to 6.2million including 6million received from to the rise in interest rates in the second half of the year which impacted on the value of fixed rate debt and on the Groups investments in the AIF and Apia funds compared to 3.8million in 2006 when the Group had only hedging instruments taken out on debt.
In particular, this benefited hedges in the joint ventures, where there are held these investments for part of the year.
Using an annualised comparison for 2006, the income received from circa 357million of interest rate swaps and caps at rates of 4.6% or below and a further 245million at between these investments showed a year on year growth of 12%.
The decline in income from other sources is mainly 4.6% and 5%.

This is a direct Income statement result of the renegotiation of the management agreements with the Agora Max, Agora and Radial joint 31 March 2007 31 March 2006 ventures reported in the section on conversion to a REIT above.
The net effect of this is that the Groups million million recurring profit is 3.3million higher this year.
