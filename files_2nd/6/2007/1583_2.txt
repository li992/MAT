Financial Review for the year ended 31 December 2007 The following financial review includes certain financial information extracted without adjustment from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
This financial information is a summary and you should read the entire Annual Report carefully.
Operating Results Revenues for 2007 totalled $343.4 million, up 37% from $250.7 million in 2006.
Sales were positively impacted in 2007 by organic growth, together with the partial-year impact of the ZANTAZ acquisition during 2007.
These results reflect our ongoing strategy focussed on licensing of our core IDOL software and pre-configured applications.
Cost of revenues excluding amortisation of purchased intangibles in 2007 totalled $39.1 million, up 66% from $23.6 million in 2006.
The increase from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the change in the revenue mix following the ZANTAZ acquisition, including the introduction of hosted revenues which historically have attracted a higher cost of revenues compared to traditional licence sales.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased according to plan in the second half of 2007 following the acquisition of ZANTAZ.
Amortization of purchased intangibles arise in connection with acquisitions.
Amortization of purchased intangibles in 2007 totalled $13.0 million, up 63% from $8.0 million in 2006.
The increase is primarily attributable to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in connection with the ZANTAZ acquisition.
Gross profit in 2007 totalled $291.3 million, up 33% from $219.1 million in 2006, commensurate with the increase in revenues but also affected by the cost trends discussed above.
Gross margins decreased in the middle of 2007 following the acquisition of ZANTAZ in July 2007, but increased as planned following the completion of the integration of ZANTAZ and the transition of the core ZANTAZ business to higher margin sales.
Research and development expenses in 2007 totalled $62.3 million, up 21% from $51.7 million in 2006.
The increase in research and development expenses from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to increased headcount and associated expenses, both from increased investment in the companys core technology together with new investment arising from the ZANTAZ acquisition.
Sales and marketing expenses totalled $104.4 million in 2007, up 21% from $86.4 million in 2006.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to increased advertising, additional headcount and an increase in sales commissions due to an increase in sales and a change in the geographic and size-of-transaction mix, all of which also increased with the expansion of the group in 2007.
General and administrative expenses totalled $32.5 million in 2007, up 32% from $24.7 million in 2006.
The increase in general and administrative expenses from 2006 to 2007 was due to an increase in headcount and legal, accounting and tax advice necessitated by the enlarged group.
Post-acquisition restructuring costs totalled $1.8 million in 2007, versus $nil in 2006.
Such costs were non-recurring costs associated with the acquisition of ZANTAZ.
Loss on foreign exchange totalled $0.6 million in 2007, compared to $0.4 million in 2006.
The charge arises as a result of movements in foreign currencies against the functional currency of the relevant operating company.
This results in transactions being settled at different amounts to the foreign currency asset or liabilities carrying value.
Profit from operations totalled $88.6 million in 2007, up 60% from $55.5 million in 2006.
The increase in profit from operations from 2006 to 2007 reflects an increase in revenues from 2006 to 2007 offset by cost increases discussed above.
The operational gearing of the company is such that the increased revenues of 37% have resulted in an increase in profit from operations of 60%.
Impairment of investments during 2007 totalled $1.0 million, compared to $0.3 million in 2006.
In 2007 the company wrote off an investment in a privately held company and in 2006 the company partially wrote down a different investment.
Interest income totalled $6.9 million in 2007, up 89% from $3.7 million in 2006.
Interest income in 2007 was impacted by higher average cash balances during 2007 than 2006.
Interest payable totalled $2.4 million in 2007, down 7% from $2.6 million in 2006.
The bank loan was renegotiated as part of the ZANTAZ acquisition and a lower interest rate is being paid compared to 2006.
Profit before tax totalled $91.4 million in 2007, up 62% from $56.3 million in 2006.
The increase in profit before tax reflects an increase in revenues from 2006 to 2007 offset by smaller increases in costs discussed above.
Income tax charges totalled $29.0 million in 2007, up 68% from $17.2 million in 2006.
Effective income tax rates increased slightly from an effective group tax rate of 30.6% in 2006 to an effective rate of 31.8% in 2007.
This increase is due to the increased contribution from US operations where the tax rate is higher.
Net profit totalled $62.3 million in 2007, up 59% from $39.1 million in 2006.
Basic and diluted earnings per share was at a record level of $0.31 and $0.30 per share respectively in 2007, an increase of 48% and 43% from $0.21 for both measures in 2006.

Cash generated by operations totalled $83.1 million in 2007, an increase of 77% from $46.9 million in 2006.

Net cash provided by financing activities totalled $284.8 million in 2007, up from $31.3 million in 2006.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was primarily the result of two share placements, providing net proceeds of $284 million, together with the proceeds of employee share option exercises, offset by a net repayment of the companys bank loans.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was generated by proceeds of employee share option exercises offset by repayments of the companys bank loan.

At 31 December 2007 the company had remaining bank debt of $47.9 million, up from $32.6 at 31 December 2006.

Other Balance Sheet Items Goodwill has increased from $415.8 million at 31 December 2006 to $820.1 million at 31 December 2007.
The increase relates primarily to the acquisitions of ZANTAZ and Meridio.

Property, plant and equipment was at $28.8 million at 31 December 2007, compared to $6.2 million at the end of 2006.
The acquisition of ZANTAZ included a material amount of fixed assets related to its hosted business.
Additions of $11.3 million 2006: $1.5 million were offset by depreciation charges of $8.7 million 2006: $4.2 million.
Equity and other investments increased by $16.2 million to $20.0 million.
The increase is mainly attributable to the demerger of the blinkx business in May 2007.

Trade and other payables increased to $41.0 million at 31 December 2007 from $21.6 million at the end of 2006.
The increase is attributable to the acquisitions of ZANTAZ and Meridio.
Tax liabilities of $21.0 million at 31 December 2007 are up from $2.4 million from the end of 2006, driven by the increased profitability of the group.
Deferred revenue increased to $97.9 million at 31 December 2007 from $52.5 million at the end of 2006.
The increase is a combination of a significant increase in license business, offset by a reduction in services business which traditionally has greater deferred revenue and the acquisitions of ZANTAZ and Meridio.
Key Events During 2007 the company continued to establish its core technology as the standard for automating the handling of all forms of unstructured information.
Towards this end the companys investment in research and development continued to deliver returns with strong organic growth across the company together with contributions from recent acquisitions.
The acquisition of ZANTAZ was also significant during the year.
Autonomy Corporation plc 6 Financial Review for the year ended 31 December 2007 Key Risks The key risks to which the business is exposed are summarized as follows: Our business depends on our core technology, currently marketed under the brand IDOL Server, and our strategy has been, and for the foreseeable future will continue to be, to concentrate our efforts on developing and marketing software based on our proprietary technology.
Technology which significantly competes with the companys technology, or material legal claims against our technology, would present a material risk to the company.
Expenditures increasing without a commensurate increase in revenues, and rapid changes in market conditions, could result in poor operating results.
The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact revenues and gross margins.
The return of unfavorable economic and market conditions.
Our reliance on sales of our products by third parties such as value added resellers makes it difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.
Our ability to expand sales through indirect sellers.
The continued service of our executive directors.
The hiring and retention of qualified personnel.
Errors or defects in our products, which could negatively affect our revenues and the market acceptance of our products and increase our costs.
Problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions.
Claims by others that we infringe on their intellectual property rights.
The companys policies applicable to employees addressing key business risks, including financial, communications, whistle blowing and health and safety, are made available through policy manuals and the companys intranet site.
The processes to identify and manage the key risks to the success of the company are an integral part of the internal control environment.
Such processes, in addition to those discussed above, include strategic planning, appointing highly skilled managers with accountability, regular monitoring of performance and setting and communicating high standards and targets for ethics, safety and health.
Key Performance Indicators The company has several key performance measures used internally to monitor and challenge performance and to assist investment decisions.
The slight overall decrease in gross margins during 2007 reflects the impact of a change in the revenue mix following the ZANTAZ acquisition, including the introduction of hosted revenues which historically have attracted a higher cost of revenues compared to traditional licence sales.
Gross margins increased according to plan in the second half of 2007 following the acquisition of ZANTAZ.
Movement in cash balances during the year primarily reflects use of cash for acquisitions, and during the year cash flow from operations was strong.
The increase in operating margins is a reflection of significantly increased revenue, due to a combination of strong organic growth and the partial-year impact of acquisitions, versus the companys relatively fixed cost-base.
