Financial Review Raglan Inuit community members near Xstrata Nickels Raglan operation, northern Quebec Xstrata plc Annual Report 2007 | 41 Basis of presentation of financial information Financial information is presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union.
The reporting currency of Xstrata plc is US dollars.
Unless indicated to the contrary, revenue, earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA and earnings before interest and taxation EBIT are reported in the Financial and Operating Review before exceptional items.
Exceptional items are significant items of income and expense which, due to their nature or expected infrequency, are presented separately in the income statement.
Unless otherwise indicated, all data and commentary in the Financial and Operating Reviews exclude the Xstrata Aluminum operations which were sold during the first half of the year and exceptional items.
All dollar and cent figures provided refer to US dollars and cents.
EBIT of $8.8 billion was 53% higher than the statutory result for 2006, benefiting from a full year of earnings from Xstrata Nickel, the enlarged Xstrata Copper and Xstrata Zinc businesses and the Tintaya copper operation which was acquired in June 2006.
Xstrata Coals earnings similarly benefited from a full years earnings from the Cerrejn coal operation following the acquisition of a one-third stake in March 2006.
To facilitate comparison on a like-for-like basis, pro forma comparative figures for 2006 have been prepared.
These assume that the acquisition of the Falconbridge, Tintaya and Cerrejn operations were made on 1 January 2006.
Unless otherwise stated, prior year figures in the remainder of the report are stated on a pro forma basis.
Robust commodity prices and record production at Xstratas coal, nickel, ferrochrome, platinum and zinc mining operations, coupled with a strong second half performance at the copper operations, boosted revenue by 12% compared to pro forma results for 2006.
Volume growth contributed $249 million to EBIT, which rose by 8% to $8.8 billion.
EBITDA increased by 7% to $10.9 billion or $11.3 billion including discontinued and exceptional items.
The beneficial impact of higher commodity prices period-on-period across Xstratas businesses, with the exception of coking coal and vanadium, added over $1.3 billion to EBIT during the period.
Real cost savings of $253 million were achieved across every commodity business, despite ongoing significant cost pressures in the mining industry.
Real cost savings were achieved as a result of new lower cost production coming on stream at the Rolleston and Wollombi coal operations and Lion ferrochrome smelting complex, higher by-product revenues and recoveries at Xstrata Zinc and operational efficiencies at Minera Alumbrera and the Australian copper operations.
The impact of mining industry inflation and CPI continued to weigh heavily on the industry, trimming EBIT by a total of $481 million.
In particular, further price increases were experienced in South Africa, Argentina and Chile, primarily for energy, fuel and contractor labour.
Profits were also negatively impacted by the weaker US dollar against most of Xstratas operating currencies, reducing earnings by $457 million.
Higher demurrage charges from Xstratas Australian coal operations impacted 2007 EBIT by an additional $58 million over the charges in 2006.
EBIT Variances $m Total EBIT 31.12.06 pro forma 8,132 Sales price 1,312 Volumes 249 Unit cost real 253 Unit cost CPI inflation 246 Unit cost mining industry inflation 235 Unit cost foreign exchange 457 Demurrage 58 Corporate social involvement expenditure 33 Other income and expenses 70 Depreciation and amortisation excluding foreign exchange 55 EBIT 31.12.07 statutory 8,792 Net of commodity price linked costs, treatment and refining charges Xstrata plc Annual Report 2007 | 43 Other expenses include higher long-term incentive plan costs due to the increase in Xstratas share price, together with acquisition-related and start-up costs in respect of Eland Platinum.
These negative impacts were partially offset by head office synergies achieved from the integration of Falconbridge which realised approximately $77 million of cost savings in the first full year of ownership, against the original target of $75 million per annum.
Corporate social involvement expenditure rose by $33 million compared to pro forma EBIT in 2006 to $102 million as programmes to support community initiatives were extended across the former Falconbridge business during 2007.

Average LME copper prices continued to rise period-on-period, supported by robust emerging market demand on the one hand and ongoing supply disruptions on the other.
A very tight nickel market resulted in a rapid rise in prices early in 2007, peaking in May at a record nominal high, before falling back later in the year.
Nonetheless, nickel prices are well above historical averages and the fundamentals of the market remain strong.
Lead prices rose strongly through the year, reaching a peak in October.
While prices have subsequently softened, they remain at very high levels by historical standards.
Zinc prices remained stable period-on-period.
The decrease in received coking coal prices followed a 15% decline in the base term price for coking coal contract prices settled at the end of 2006.
Spot coking coal prices are currently at record levels with trades being settled above $300 per tonne and expectations for the 2008-09 contract year are for a significant increase over 2007-08 levels.
This situation reflects strong demand growth from steel producers and continued supply bottlenecks across the industry.
During the period, received thermal coal prices benefited from strong demand, with China becoming a net importer of energy coal, slowing and lower quality supply growth from Indonesia, together with ongoing infrastructure constraints in Australia and South Africa.
Thermal coal prices rose steeply in the final quarter and with spot prices soaring to well in excess of $130 per tonne, significant price increases are being forecast in respect of 2008 contract settlements.
The European base price has risen further in the first quarter to $1.21 per pound, driven by continued strong demand from the stainless steel sector.
Xstratas major operating currency exposures are in respect of the movements of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and South African rand against the US dollar.
While the rand weakened marginally against the dollar, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar strengthened materially, impacting earnings by an additional $457 million compared to 2006.

Higher taxes from profits earned in high tax jurisdictions, particularly in the locations of the nickel operations, were partly offset by the recently announced reduction in the Canadian corporate tax rate and a number of one-off deductions relating to the Falconbridge acquisition.
Minority interests decreased, predominantly due to the commencement of full royalty payments to our local partners at Alumbrera during the period.

During the period, Xstrata completed acquisitions of some $2.1 billion, as outlined below.
In addition, during weak market conditions in the third quarter, 1% of the issued share capital was opportunistically purchased by Batiss Investments for $518 million under the Groups equity capital management programme.
Despite these cash outflows, robust cash generation from operations enabled the Group to reduce net debt by $1.6 billion in 2007.
In March, the Group received proceeds of $1,120 million from the disposal of Noranda Aluminum, comprising the aluminium assets acquired through the Falconbridge acquisition.

Gearing defined as net debt to net debt plus equity fell from 41% to 32% at the end of the year.
Cash tax payments of approximately $2,965 million were made in 2007, reflecting the settlement of tax liabilities outstanding from the Falconbridge operations and Xstratas own operations for the full twelve months to December 2006 and including certain additional payments in respect of tax years that predated Xstratas acquisition of Falconbridge.
In 2007, all of the remaining outstanding 3.95% convertible bonds due in 2010 were converted into Xstrata shares by 4 April, resulting in a $202 million reduction in debt.
A further tranche of $375 million of 4% convertible bonds due in 2017 remain outstanding and relate to the convertible bond issued to Brookfield in part payment for a 20% stake in Falconbridge in August 2005.
The Group continued to diversify its sources of funding during the year, commencing with an inaugural multi-tranche Euro bond offering, which raised 1 billion in June 2007.
Combined with continuing strong operational cash flows, this allowed the final $9.5 billion tranche of bank debt associated with the Falconbridge acquisition to be refinanced.
A new 5 year syndicated bank loan of $4.68 billion was signed in July 2007 on significantly improved terms and conditions.
In November, a second US bond offering was successfully completed, with the issue of a $500 million 30 year bond, which further lengthened the Groups average debt maturity profile.
Further committed bank bridging facilities totalling $3.5 billion have been secured prior to year end, to fund the acquisitions of Jubilee Mines and Resource Pacific.

Higher prices similarly led to an increase in inventories which was partially offset by the positive impact of the nickel distribution agreement with Glencore, which significantly reduced working capital requirements.
The increase in payables reflects the ongoing inflationary environment and the increased scale and scope of the operations.
Treasury Management and Financial Instruments The majority of the Groups revenue streams are denominated in US dollars.
The Group seeks to source debt capital in US dollars directly or by borrowing in other currencies and swapping them into US dollars.
Currency cash flow hedging may be used to reduce the Groups short-term exposure to fluctuations in the US dollar against local currencies.
The unrealised mark-to-market gain at 31 December 2007 was $1 million.
Currency hedging gains reflected in the income statement for 2007 amounted to $23 million.
The Group did not enter into any strategic, long-term base metals hedging contracts in the period.
The unrealised mark-to-market loss on coal and gold hedges at 31 December 2007 for contracts maturing in 2008 was $192 million, based on the forward curve at that date.
Consolidated Capital Expenditure During 2007, Xstrata continued to invest significant capital in initiatives which, while sustaining in nature, will further improve the cost profile, efficiency and lives of its operations.
Sustaining capital expenditure rose to $1.5 billion, including significant expenditure to improve the safety, environmental performance and efficiency of the former Falconbridge operations.
Expenditure on expansionary growth projects also ramped up in 2007 to $1.4 billion, as a number of greenfield and brownfield projects were progressed across every commodity business.
Xstrata Nickels Nickel Rim South mine in the Sudbury basin and the major greenfield Koniambo project in New Caledonia both incurred substantial expenditure in 2007.
Nickel Rim South is due to commence production in 2009 and the sinking of both the main production and ventilation shafts was completed in early 2008.
Xstrata Coal continued to invest in its significant portfolio of growth projects in New South Wales, Australia including the newly acquired Anvil Hill project and the Blakefield, Mount Owen and Liddell expansions.
In Queensland, work began on the pre-feasibility study for the Wandoan project, which will ultimately deliver in excess of 15 million tonnes per annum of export thermal coal.
In South Africa, the Goedgevonden project is reaching peak expenditure, as production ramps up to 6.7 million tonnes of thermal coal annually, further improving the cost profile of the South African coal operations.

The business continues to advance and prioritise its industry-leading portfolio of greenfield projects and in this regard, substantial further investment was made in Las Bambas, El Morro and El Pachn in South America and Tampakan in the Philippines.
On 5 December 2007, Xstrata Copper and engineering, construction and project management company Bechtel joined forces in a strategic alliance, which will facilitate the timely and cost effective development of Xstrata Coppers project pipeline.
The Group also invested in low cost brownfield zinc growth projects including the further expansion of the zinc-lead concentrator at Mount Isa and the McArthur River open pit development.
Further investment was made in the Perseverance mine in Canada, where the development schedule has been accelerated to take advantage of robust zinc demand.
The project is due to commence production in mid 2008 and will produce 228,000 tonnes per annum of zinc concentrate and 35,000 tonnes of copper concentrate.
Xstrata Alloys successfully completed within budget the Bokamoso pelletising and sintering plant, further development of the Project Lion ferrochrome smelting complex and the ramp-up of the Mototolo platinum group metals joint venture.
Acquisitions and disposals During the year, Xstrata continued to extend and improve its portfolio of assets through targeted acquisitions and the disposal of the noncore aluminium division, acquired in 2006 as part of the Falconbridge transaction.
In addition to acquisitions of coal assets in New South Wales, the Group made a significant investment in platinum through the acquisition of Eland Platinum mines and broadened further its growth portfolio of copper assets by exercising its option in the Tampakan project in the Philippines.
In early 2008, the acquisitions of Jubilee Mines, a Western Australian nickel producer and Resource Pacific, a New South Wales coal producer were successfully completed.
Tampakan In December 2006, Xstrata Copper exercised its option to acquire 62.5% of Sagittarius Mines Inc, the holder of the Tampakan copper-gold project in the Philippines, for $47 million.
Xstrata Copper assumed management control on 30 March 2007.
Frieda River In January 2007, Xstrata Copper exercised an option to obtain a 73.7% interest in the Frieda River copper-gold porphyry in Papua New Guinea in a joint venture with Highlands Pacific 16.4% and Japans OMRD 19.9%.

Austral Coal Limited On 28 December 2007, the Group completed the acquisition of Austral Coal Limited Austral, at a total cost of $542 million.
Austral owns the Tahmoor underground coking coal operation in the Southern Coalfields of New South Wales, Australia.
The Tahmoor acquisition contributes significantly to Xstratas growing coking coal production.
Cumnock Coal Limited On 10 September 2007, the Group acquired the remaining 16% of Cumnock Coal Limited which it did not previously own, for $22 million and subsequently sold a 10% joint venture stake in the operation to Itochu Coal Resources Pty Limited on 21 December 2007.
Eland On 14 November 2007, the Group acquired 100% of Eland Platinum Holdings Limited Eland.
Eland was previously listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange and held a 65% interest in Eland Platinum Mines Pty Limited which owns the Elandsfontein platinum project.
The Group also acquired an additional 9% interest in the Elandsfontein platinum project increasing the Groups interest in the project to 74%.
The total cost of the acquisition was $1,113 million.
Jubilee On 31 January 2008, Xstrata Nickel declared its AUD3.1 billion $2.9 billion takeover offer for Jubilee Mines Jubilee unconditional and its price of AUD23 per share final.
Xstrata Nickel assumed management control of Jubilee on 4 February 2008, establishing Xstrata Nickel Australasia as a new operating division.
On 22 February, Xstrata Nickel declared an interest of 97% in Jubilee Mines and proceeded to compulsorily acquire the remainder of the shares.
