Financial review | group performance The group has reported record profits of 138.5m, a 60% increase on 2006.
This is achieved despite increasing competition in underwriting markets and volatility in investment returns.

Gross premiums written During 2007, gross premiums written rose by 5% to 780.5m.
This growth was achieved despite the 4% devaluation of the US dollar in 2007 and 4% reduction in insurance renewal rates.
Around 70% of our business is written in US dollars hence the importance of this exchange rate.
The main reasons for the increase in premiums were the growth in the US operations, which wrote $175.2m of premiums in 2007 2006: $68.9m, together with the increase in the groups ownership of the combined syndicates, which rose to 81% in 2007 from 78% in 2006.

As well as protecting us from exceptional events it also enables us to hold lower levels of capital to support the business.
We continue to write 51% 2006: 48% of gross premiums through our largest team specialty lines.
Figures 20 to 23 show the composition of our portfolio in 2007, across types of insurance, settlement terms, classes of business and geographical regions.
Reinsurance Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: To minimise the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: To provide lead line capabilities to our underwriters: and As a way of managing capital.
In 2007, reinsurance costs decreased by 24.9% to 128.3m.
As a percentage of the gross premiums written, it fell from 22.9% to 16.4% during the year.
This was largely the result of two decisions the group made around its appetite to retain risks.
Firstly, in the specialty lines business we rebalanced the proportional treaty arrangements by taking on a larger share of the risks.
Secondly, in the treaty reinsurance business we re-underwrote the account in 2007 to be less reliant on the third party reinsurance market.
Combined ratio The groups combined ratio remained at 88% in 2007.
Within this the claims ratio reduced from 53% to 50%, while the expenses ratio increased from 35% to 38% in 2007.
Claims The claims ratio decreased from 53% to 50% in 2007.
This arose due to two principal factors: Releases of claims reserves held in the short tail accounts, particularly against catastrophe type risks, following benign claims activity mainly from the 2006 underwriting year: and Releases from our specialty lines account reduced the claims ratio by 5.4% 2006: 3.5%.
As the business has matured over the past five years, we have gradually been able to increase the levels of reserve releases across all classes of business.
This is illustrated in Figure 24, which highlights the steady increases in release together with the benefit attributed to the claims ratio in each year.
We found 2007 to be a quiet year in terms of claims activity.
There were a small number of events which caused modest claims in the early to mid-part of 2007.
Windstorm Kyrill caused losses across a wide area in Europe in January.
The UK oods in the summer, rstly in Yorkshire and parts of Northern England and then the west of England, caused losses within the UK homeowners insurance account.
All these events were contained within the reserves established for anticipated losses.

As was demonstrated in the late 1990s, Beazley has limited appetite for professional liability risks within the financial institution sector.
This has remained the case and whilst the number of sub-prime related cases as reported recently by Advisen is approaching 200, the number of claims to Beazley arising out of those cases remains a single gure amount.
As such, we currently expect that our exposure will remain within our reserves and we do not anticipate a change to our reserving philosophy.
Our underwriters and claims managers are skilled at measuring, predicting, diversifying and mitigating the risks to Beazley.
2006 catastrophe reserves We were able to release 15.6m in 2007 in respect of claims reserves held at the end of 2006 for potential catastrophes.
We were unable to release these reserves at the end of 2006 because at that stage we were still on risk for a number of policies we covered.
These releases were in the reinsurance 5.2m, property 5.3m, and marine energy 5.1m accounts.
Total releases from the short tail accounts, where claims are settled within two years of the policy period expiring, totalled 30.7m.
The table on page 96 sets out in which accounts these claims releases originated, but as you will notice, all lines of business reported favourable adjustments.
The reserving approach in these accounts remains consistent with prior years.
We take a conservative view of the unexpired policies within portfolios, only making releases once a substantial part of the account has expired.
Specialty lines claims reserve releases The specialty lines claims reserves continued to develop well in 2007 enabling us to release a further 33.4m during the year 2006: 18.0m.
We have consistently adopted a cautious approach towards reserving in this business.
The nature of these claims is that for the majority of classes of business the corridor of uncertainty surrounding potential losses is wide in the first three years of development following the premium being written.
As we gain more certainty in years four and five, we have a better view as to where claims are likely to settle and we can adjust reserves accordingly.
Across all underwriting years the ultimate claims reserves we were holding have reduced during 2007, enabling these releases.
This can be seen in the loss development tables within the notes to the accounts page 94.
These show loss ratios at various points in time after one year, after two years, after three years, at the end of 2006, and current.
These tables also give the size of release made by underwriting year.
The majority of the releases come from the earlier years 25.5m relating to the 2004 underwriting year and prior.
Expenses The expenses ratio has been restated in 2007, and for 2006 comparatives so that it includes all costs.
We believe that by including all costs within the ratio, this is a fairer representation.
The expense ratio has increased by 3% to 38% in 2007.
This was largely due to the growth in the US operation and increased profit related variable compensation.
In the US we have increased the number of people employed from 111 to 153.
As the business is in a start-up phase where costs are currently growing faster than premiums being written, this has an adverse impact on our expenses ratio.
The first few years of building the US operation have involved a number of one-off costs such as information technology IT development on underwriting systems and facilities costs in establishing new ofces.
It is likely that certain of these costs, such as IT, will continue into 2008 as we search out more efficient, longer term IT platforms to support the business.
It was always known that building ofces on the ground in the US would 24 www.
com m be a more expensive approach than running a pure Lloyds operation.
The reward for this spend will come from the quality and type of business we are able to write i. e. business that would not come to Lloyds.
These benets wont be seen initially, however, but rather are investments for the future.
Employee numbers In 2007 we continued to build the business through growth in talent, particularly in the US.
By the end of 2007 we had 153 people in the US 2006: 111, of which 53 were underwriters and a further 18 were claims managers.
In the UK the headcount levels stabilised in line with the premiums being written.
The largest growth areas were in specialty lines in the US and support staff in the US both in response to the increased premiums and volumes being written.
The claims team within specialty lines also increased from 25 to 35 people in line with our service strategy around claims highlighted in Andrew Beazleys section in this report.

Despite this, investment income grew to 64.9m 2006: 48.3m, providing a return of 4.9% 2006: 4.9%.
During the first half of 2007, strong economic growth globally, together with rising commodity prices, continued to provide upward pressure on interest rates as ination concerns mounted.
However, the effect of monetary tightening and the escalating crisis stemming from increasing defaults in the sub-prime sector in the US caused a collapse in confidence in financial assets during the second half, as multi-billion dollar write-downs were announced by leading banks and investment houses.
This particularly exhibited itself in the sharp increase in money market spreads over ofcial rates as money market funding dried up.
Central banks reacted to the increasing strains in the financial system by reducing rates and injecting funds, but this did not prevent credit spreads, even of high quality assets, from widening sharply in the second half.
However, for the group, the high quality of our xed income portfolios largely insulated our returns.
At 31 December 2007 the weighted average duration of our bond and cash portfolio was one year.
The groups investments in alternative assets and equities added to the investment returns.
Hedge funds achieved a return of 7.5%.
Meanwhile, the groups equity investments achieved a return of 7.7%.

These are all AAA-rated, asset-backed securities and comprised only 1% of group assets as of 31 December 2007.
The group does not permit investment in collateralised debt obligations CDOs.
All these securities have been consistently marked-to-market throughout the year.
We remain comfortable with the overall position of the groups investment portfolios, and anticipate that during 2008 some of the spread widening that has dampened xed income returns in 2007 may reverse as the current credit concerns are worked through.
We continue to look for opportunities to enhance returns while limiting volatility of the overall portfolio, both through investment in diverse asset classes and by utilising managers with different skill sets.
To this end we have appointed a new manager, BlackRock Investment Management, to manage a portion of the sterling xed income assets from January 2008.
For regulatory and legal reasons, certain trust funds and deposits are required to be managed centrally by Lloyds on behalf of the syndicates.
These funds are invested in high-grade, xed income securities and their performance is detailed separately in the table below.
The group maintains funds in cash for various operational purposes.
The majority of these cash balances are invested in money market funds.
The table below highlights the returns received by currency and by investment type.

The groups cash and investment balance grew during 2007 mainly due to additional underwriting of syndicate 2623 in 2007 and a benign two years for major claims.
Figure 25 highlights the growth in investment balances over the past five years.
Foreign exchange dierences arising on non-monetary items In 2007 the impact of the foreign exchange adjustment on non-monetary items is a credit to our income statement of 8.2m 2006: a charge of 9.4m.
Non-monetary items include unearned premium reserves, reinsurers share of unearned premium reserves, and deferred acquisition costs.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, these balances are carried at historic exchange rates, while monetary items are translated at closing rates.
This imbalance creates volatility in our accounts which cannot be hedged as the mismatch is not monetary in nature.
In 2007, the historic US dollar rates applicable to the non-monetary balances are weaker relative to sterling than the closing dollar exchange rate applied.
This has a positive effect on net assets as the non-monetary net liability is valued lower than when using the closing rate.

The total balance on intangibles increased by 6.8m in 2007 to 28.7m as a result of both the acquisition of Sapphire Blue, a US-based MGA that writes medical malpractice insurance and the capitalisation of additional IT expenditure in 2007.
The IT capitalisation relates mainly to building the large commercial property underwriting platform in the US, ongoing development of the specialty lines underwriting platform in the US, and development of systems to better manage claims processes.
Our accounting policy is to depreciate these items over their useful economic life three years.

A breakdown of the growth in the portfolio, by asset type, is set out in Figure 26.
The groups strategy is to use a number of specialists to manage its portfolios in order to diversify manager risk and to give us access to different investment styles and skill sets.

Insurance receivables Insurance receivables represent broker balances receivable in respect of premiums we have written.
During 2007, broker balances decreased by 15% to 199.9m.
We continue to outsource the collection of our premium broker balances to JMD Specialist Insurance Services Limited, which operates within the Lloyds market as specialist credit controllers.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims 280.4m, and the unearned premiums reserve on reinsurance 72.9m.
Of the recoveries from our reinsurers, 89.1m is in respect of claims paid or reported to us, and a further 191.3 is an actuarial estimate of the recoveries on claims not yet reported.
These assets are managed through: Minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria e. g. minimum net assets, minimum A rating by Standard & Poors S&P when initially selected.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs. medium tail.
Figure 27 shows the prole based on S&P rating of these assets at the end of 2006: Timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and Regular monitoring of outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2007 we had provided 5.7m 2006: 4.8m in respect of our reinsurance recoveries.

The largest items included in the balance are: Deferred acquisition costs 82.0m : Deferred tax assets, either against UK or US taxes paid 4.5m : and profit commissions receivable from syndicate 623 7.6m.
Insurance liabilities Insurance liabilities of 1,471.9m consist of two main elements: unearned premiums reserve UPR and gross insurance claims.
Our unearned premiums reserve UPR has increased by 7.0% in 2007 to 384.3m, mainly due to increased premiums written.
The bulk of the UPR relates to the current year.
Current indicators are that this is profitable and will earn through to the income statement in 2008.
Gross insurance claims are made up of claims which have been notied to us but not yet paid and an estimate of incurred but not yet reported claims IBNR.
These are estimated by both the underwriter and the syndicate actuary through the quarterly peer review process, a description of which is included in note 23.
Gross insurance claims increased by 26% in 2007 to 1,087.6m mainly due to the increase in business written.
Borrowings The group utilises two long-term debt facilities: In 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured xed rate debt that is payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
The initial interest rate payable is 7.25%: and An $18m subordinated debt facility raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the US interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and callable in 2009.
At the time of the 150m bond issue we entered into a derivative transaction, whereby we matched our investment and currency risk by swapping the sterling xed rate loan into the equivalent of: 108m of oating rate sterling loans: and $80m of oating rate US dollar loans.
These items have been accounted for using hedge accounting for both the oating rate and currency elements of the transaction.
In addition to these borrowings we operate a 50m syndicated short-term banking facility, managed through Lloyds TSB.
The facility was successfully renegotiated for two years in November 2007.
Currency profit hedging We minimise our currency exposure to the US dollar, which represents the groups largest currency risk, by estimating US dollar profits each year and selling a proportion each month.
By the end of each year we aim for US dollar exposure to be minimal.
At the end of 2007 we had 67.8m of US dollar net assets, which mainly relates to our investment in the US.
In 2007, the group sold $332m at an average exchange rate of 2.00 2006: 1.88.
We also sell year-end unhedged profits for the second largest currency exposure, Euros, once a year.
Beazley Annual Report 2007 29 Financial review | capital position The group has several requirements for capital: 1.
To support underwriting at Lloyds through syndicate 2623.
This is based on the groups individual capital assessment.
This may be provided in the form of either the groups cash and investments or debt facilities: 2.
To support underwriting in Beazley Insurance Company, Inc. in the US: and 3.
To make small acquisitions, such as the Sapphire Blue acquisition in 2007, of insurance companies or MGAs whose strategic goals are aligned with our own.
Our funding comes from a variety of sources: 1.
398.6m comes from shareholders funds i. e. net assets.
Of this balance, 113.3m is unavailable to the group because it relates to intangible assets, xed assets or undistributable syndicate profits: 2.
150m was raised in 2006 through a tier 2 subordinated debt issue: 3.
An $18m subordinated long-term debt with a maturity in 2034: and 4.
An undrawn banking facility of 50m provided by a syndicate of banks led by Lloyds TSB.
In November 2007 we announced a rolling on-market share buyback programme to repurchase up to 5% of the companys issued share capital, representing approximately 30m.
By the end of 2007, 5.1m representing 0.9% of the companys shares had been repurchased.
The special dividend of 4.0p per share will distribute an additional 14.5m.

Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that ICAs are consistent across the market.
In order to determine the ICA, we made significant investment in both models and process: We use sophisticated mathematical models that reect the key risks in the business allowing for probability of occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and The ICA process is embedded so that the teams can see the direct and objective link between underwriting decisions and the capital allocated to that team.
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward prole of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
The ICA has increased from 292m to 306m which reects changes in the amount and mix of business in the plan, the impact of falling rates, and the positive development of claims reserves from prior years.
