Regulation Our business is subject to regulation and we face increasing regulation with respect to the transmission of our satellite signals.
The provision of our mobile satellite communication services in some countries could cause us to incur additional costs, could expose us to fines and could limit our ability to provide services in some countries.
Competition Although Inmarsat is a market leader in Mobile Satellite Services, there is increasing competition both from existing mobile satellite operators as well as xed satellite service operators who are seeking to enter our markets, particularly maritime and aeronautical.
1 Outlook for Inmarsat Core We believe our business will continue to deliver good growth in 2008 and beyond.
The rate at which we are adding customers and terminals for key growth services has retained a steady momentum throughout 2007 and supports our continued growth.
Trading conditions in our maritime, land mobile and aeronautical sectors remain positive, although we expect our leasing business to be at in 2008.
We expect our cost base to be impacted by the devaluation of the US dollar that occurred in 2007 and which has fed through to a deterioration in the average rate at which we have hedged our 2008 Sterling operating costs from US$1.81 in 2007 to US$2.01.
We expect our cash capital expenditure in 2008 will be in a range of US$210.0m to US$230.0m excluding deferred satellite payments and capitalised operating costs.
Our 2008 capital expenditure forecast reects incremental launch costs for an accelerated launch of our third Inmarsat-4 satellite, the start of manufacturing costs for the Alphasat project, and spend related to the addition of further redundancy at our new Satellite Access Station in Hawaii.
Furthermore, we have committed to certain additional costs in relation to the network and the modernisation of equipment for our Satellite Phone Services.
