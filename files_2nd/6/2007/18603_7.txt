STRATEGY 40 GRAINGER PLC Annual report and accounts 2007 financial review Evolution of the application of IFRS and a review of our accounts by the Financial Reporting Review Panel has caused us to reconsider the suitability of certain of our accounting policies, in particular the classication of marketrented residential assets which were transferred to G:res1 during the year ended 30 September 2006.
In full agreement with our auditors, these assets have been reclassied as investment assets rather than trading assets with effect from 1 October 2005 and a prior year adjustment has been made accordingly.
The effect has been to remove a revaluation surplus of 23.5m taken through the income statement in 2006 and instead take it through retained earnings at 1 October 2005 net of tax of 7.0m.
This adjustment has no effect on the key indicator of market value, namely net asset value, and has no implications for the economics or cash generation of the business.
An added benefit is that by removing the one-off revaluation surplus taken to profit in 2006, the disclosed income statements for 2006 and 2007 are far more directly comparable.
We have also taken this opportunity to reclassify an immaterial balance of equity release home reversion assets to ensure consistent presentation.
Full details of the adjustment are given in note 1 b to the financial statements on pages 81 and 82.

The denitions of these measures are consistent with Gross NAV and Triple NAV as described and shown in the table above.
This denition of Gross NAV requires us to take out any adjustments for deferred tax and changes in the fair value of derivatives as calculated under IFRS.
NNNAV requires certain of these adjustments to be reinstated and in addition a deduction is made for contingent tax which is calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the full inherent gains at the balance sheet date.
