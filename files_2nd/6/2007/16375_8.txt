Investors should be aware that their introduction to the following section, in order to explain the application may vary in practice and therefore these measures relevance of the above measures.
At the end of this section we may not be fully comparable between companies.
In particular: summarise the impact on Total Shareholder Return TSR which is a key metric.
We recognise that the usefulness of UFCF and ROIC as indicators of investment value is limited, as such measures Measures of long-term value creation are based on historical information: Unilevers ambition for the creation of value for shareholders is measured by Total Shareholder Return over a rolling three-year UFCF and ROIC measures are not intended to be a substitute period compared with a peer group of 20 other international for, or superior to, GAAP measures in the financial statements: consumer goods companies.
The fact that ROIC is a ratio inherently limits its use, and Unilever believes that the contribution of the business to this management uses ROIC only for the purposes discussed above.
objective can best be measured and communicated to investors The relevance and use of net profit for the year being the through the following measures: most relevant comparable GAAP measure is clearly more pervasive: and The delivery, over time, of Ungeared Free Cash Flow UFCF, which expresses the translation of profit into cash, and thus UFCF is not the residual cash available to pay dividends but longer-term economic value: and represents cash generated by the business and broadly available to the providers of finance, both debt and equity.
The development, over time, of Return on Invested Capital ROIC, which expresses the returns generated on capital invested in the Group.
Unilever communicates progress against these measures annually, and management remuneration is aligned with these objectives.
The UFCF over a three-year period is incorporated as a performance element of Unilevers management incentive scheme.
Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2007 29 Report of the Directors continued Financial Review continued Ungeared free cash ow UFCF UFCF expresses the generation of profit by the business and how this is translated into cash, and thus economic value.
It is therefore not used as a liquidity measure within Unilever.
The movement in UFCF is used by Unilever to measure progress against our longer-term value creation goals as outlined to investors.
UFCF is cash ow from group operating activities, less net capital expenditure, less charges to operating profit for share-based compensation and pensions, and less tax adjusted to reect an ungeared position and, in 2006, for the impact on profit on sales of frozen foods businesses, but before the nancing of pensions.
The reconciliation of UFCF to the GAAP measures net profit and cash ow from operating activities is shown below.
The tax charge used in determining UFCF can be either the income statement tax charge or the actual cash taxes paid.
Our consistently applied denition uses the income statement tax charge in order to eliminate the impact of volatility due to the variable timing of payments around the year end.
For 2006 the income statement tax charge on this basis was materially impacted by the tax effect of non-cash charges for the provision for preference shares and certain other non-cash items.
UFCF for 2007 based on actual cash tax paid would have been 3.6 billion 2006: 4.5 billion: 2005: 3.7 billion.

The progression of ROIC is used by Unilever to measure progress against our longer-term value creation goals outlined to investors.
ROIC is profit after tax but excluding net interest on net debt and impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets both net of tax, divided by average invested capital for the year.
Invested capital is the sum of property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent investments, software and nite-lived intangible assets, working capital, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at gross book value and cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves under an earlier accounting policy.
The reconciliation of ROIC to the GAAP measure net profit is shown below.
There were no disposals of discontinued operations in 2007: the impact of such disposals in 2006 and 2005 was 1.2 billion and 0.5 billion respectively.
ROIC is based on total business profit, including profit on such disposals.
