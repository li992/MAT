Group borrowings are principally denominated in sterling and mostly subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
The Group has in place interest rate caps and swaps which limit interest rate risk on approximately one third of Group borrowings.
The weighted average duration to maturity of these instruments is a little over two years.
Liquidity risk The Group seeks to maintain sufficient facilities to ensure that it has access to funding to meet current and anticipated future funding requirements determined from budgets and medium-term plans.
The Group has access to committed borrowing facilities of 250 million.
Of this total, 225 million is in the form of a syndicated revolving credit facility which expires in 2011.
The balance is a bilateral arrangement expiring in 2012.
Total facilities are sufficient to meet forecast borrowing requirements for at least the next two years.
