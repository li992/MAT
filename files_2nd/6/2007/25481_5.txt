Financial review Investec delivered a solid set of results driven by strong performances from our balanced portfolio of businesses.
This commentary and analysis of our financial results for the year ended 31 March 2007 provides an overview of our financial performance relative to the groups results for the year ended 31 March 2006.
Further detail on the performance of our business divisions is provided in the Divisional Review section of this report.
The commentary and analysis are based on our consolidated financial results presented in accordance with IFRS denominated in Pounds Sterling.
The financial information discussed below is based on the period under review, and may not necessarily reflect the financial condition or results of the operations of the group going forward.
Prior to 2005 the numbers are reported in terms of UK SA GAAP and thereafter in terms of IFRS.
Historical EPS numbers have been adjusted for the 5:1 share split that took place on 4 September 2006.
Overview of the year An overview of Investecs key income drivers Investec provides a wide range of financial products and services to a niche client base in three principal markets, the UK, South Africa and Australia.
Investec is organised as a network comprising five principal business divisions: Private Client Activities, Capital Markets, Investment Banking, Asset Management and Property Activities.
In addition, our head office provides certain group-wide integrating functions such as Risk Management, Information Technology, Finance, Investor Relations, Marketing, Human Resources and Organisational Development.
It is also responsible for our central funding and other activities, such as our Trade Finance operations.
There are therefore a number of key income drivers for our business which are discussed below.

Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk factors.
Overview of the year Risks relating to the markets in which Investec operates Due to the nature of our businesses, we have been and will continue to be affected by changes in a number of macro-economic fundamentals.
These include the condition of worldwide financial markets, general economic cycles, levels of exchange and interest rates, and inflation, in particular in the UK, South Africa and Australia, where the group derives most of its profit as well as, to a lesser extent, the US and Europe.
Fluctuations in exchange rates Our reporting currency is Pounds Sterling.
Certain of our operations are conducted by entities outside the UK.
The results of operations and the financial condition of our individual companies are reported in the local currencies in which they are domiciled, including Rands, Australian Dollars, Euros, and US Dollars.
These results will then be translated into Pounds Sterling at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our combined consolidated financial statements.
In the case of the income statements, the weighted average rate for the relevant period is applied and, in the case of the balance sheets, the relevant closing rate is used.
The table below sets out the movements in relevant exchange rates against Pounds Sterling over the reporting period.
These rates are indicative only and are not necessarily the rates at which the relevant currencies were converted into Pounds Sterling, for the purposes of preparation of our combined consolidated financial statements.
Currency per 1.00 31 March 2007 31 March 2006 Year end Average Year end Average South African Rand 14.20 13.38 10.72 11.43 Australian Dollar 2.42 2.47 2.44 2.37 Euro 1.47 1.47 1.43 1.47 US Dollar 1.96 1.90 1.74 1.78 Source: Datastream 14 Exchange rates between local currencies and Pounds Sterling have fluctuated over the year.
The most significant impact arises from the depreciation of the Rand.
The average exchange rate over the year has depreciated by 17.1% and the closing rate has depreciated by 32.4% since 31 March 2006.
Notwithstanding, the depreciation of the Rand we have posted a solid increase in earnings as a result of a very strong performance from our UK and Australian operations which recorded an increase in net profit after tax, before goodwill and non-operating items of 55.5% and 71.4%, respectively.
The following table provides an analysis of the impact of the Rand depreciation on our reported numbers: Results as Currency neutral reported at results at 31 March 2007 31 March 2007 Southern African operating profit '000 268 673 319 724 Southern African profit after tax '000 195 735 232 832 Total group operating profit before tax '000 466 585 517 636 Adjusted earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 300 704 333 001 Adjusted EPS pence 53.3 59.1 Total assets 'million 26 300 31 095 Before goodwill and non-operating items.
For balance sheet items we have assumed that the Rand: Pound Sterling closing exchange rate has remained neutral since 31 March 2006.
For income statement items we have used the average Rand:Pound Sterling exchange rate that was applied in the prior year, i. e. 11.43.
Fluctuations in interest rates The shape of the yield curve, the time lag between changes in interest rates applicable to assets and liabilities, and the volatility of interest rates in each of our principal geographic markets can affect our net interest income, principal transactions generated by the Interest Rate and Forex desks and fees in our Capital Markets division.
As a matter of policy, we do not take on material unhedged, long-dated interest rate positions.
The table on the following page sets out movements in certain interest rates, affecting our businesses over the reporting period.

Also included are facility arrangement fees, corporate finance fees and similar items that are transactional in nature and therefore create more erratic income streams, offset by fees and commissions payable which predominantly comprise brokerage payable, banking fees and similar charges.
Net fees and commissions increased by 19.4% to 521.5 million 2006: 436.9 million benefiting from increased transactional activity and higher assets under management.

Income from principal transactions decreased marginally by 0.2% to 245.5 million 2006: 246.1 million.
Our Growth and Acquisition Finance, Principal Finance securitisation and Capital Markets lending divisions delivered a strong performance.
This result was offset by a relatively weaker performance from some of the underlying investments in the Direct Investments, UK Private Equity, Property and Central Funding divisions.

The current year's figure includes Investec's 47.1% share of the directors' estimate of the post-tax profit of Rensburg Sheppards plc for the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007.
In the prior year, Rensburg Sheppards plc was accounted for as an associate with effect from 6 May 2005.

After administration expenses, a profit of 1.6 million 2006: 11.5 million was generated from assurance activities, which represents the residual earnings from the businesses that were retained.
'000 31 March 31 March Variance % Change 2007 2006 Investment income on Assurance Activities 36 821 141 559 104 738 74.0% Premiums and reinsurance recoveries on insurance contracts 80 542 164 631 84 089 51.1% Claims and reinsurance premiums on insurance business 111 492 293 135 181 643 62.0% Net income on assurance activities 5 871 13 055 7 184 55.0% 18 Other operating income Other operating income amounts to 49.7 million 2006: 2.7 million.
The operating results of two investments held within the Private Equity portfolio have been consolidated with the respective income and expenses reflected in other operating income and administration expenses.
These investments generated a net loss after tax and minority interest of 2.3 million.
Any realisation of these investments in excess of their carrying values will be recognised as income from principal transactions.
The two investments are Global Ethanol Holdings Limited and Idatech LLC see page 204 for further information.
Impairment losses on loans and advances Impairment losses on loans and advances increased by 80.5% to 16.5 million 2006: 9.2 million.
The 2006 year included recoveries of approximately 6.5 million and we have seen a moderate increase in impairment losses in the 2007 year in line with growth in advances.
The percentage of gross defaults to loans and advances has increased from 0.9% to 1.2%.
Total impairment coverage as a percentage of net defaults gross defaults net of security remains highly satisfactory at 137.9% 2006: 141.4%.

Variable remuneration increased by 31.2% to 205.8 million due to increased profitability.
Other operating expenses excluding variable remuneration increased by 18.1% to 474.9 million largely as a result of an increase in headcount in certain of the businesses in line with our growth initiatives, an increase in costs associated with complying with new and forthcoming regulatory requirements, an investment in product development and IT infrastructure and the consolidation of two private equity investments resulting in an additional 25 million of costs.
We achieved our target of operating expenses to total operating income of less than 65% with the ratio increasing marginally from 58.7% to 59.0%.

Investec is of the view that EPS is best reflected by adjusting for earnings that are attributed to equity instruments other than ordinary shares on an accrual basis and therefore adjusts the paid dividend on such instruments to accrued in arriving at adjusted EPS.
On 4 September 2006 the group implemented a 5:1 share split of Investec plc and Investec Limited shares.

Interim and final dividends will be declared and proposed in accordance with the above policy.
Overview of the year 21.9 124.0 25.2 150.0 25.4 10.7 17.9 10.8 20.8 11.6 26.9 13.4 41.9 18.2 53.3 xx 23.0 Balance sheet analysis Since 31 March 2006 total shareholders' equity including minority interests increased by 21.3% to 1.8 billion largely as a result of the issue of 131.2 million of non-redeemable, non-cumulative, non-participating preference shares by Investec plc and increased retained earnings offset partially by negative foreign currency adjustments.
Net asset value per share increased from 182.2 pence to 216.0 pence, and net tangible asset value per share which excludes goodwill and intangible assets increased from 148.9 pence to 178.6 pence.
The return on adjusted average shareholders' equity inclusive of compulsorily convertible instruments increased from 25.5% to 26.1%, meeting our target of greater than 20%.
Investec plc and Investec Limited have capital adequacy ratios well in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements.
The capital adequacy of Investec plc applying UK Financial Services Authority rules to its capital base is 24.7% 31 March 2006: 17.7%.
The capital adequacy of Investec Limited applying South African Reserve Bank rules to its capital base is 14.7% 31 March 2006: 16.3%.

ROE - an assessment of economic capital utilised In order to assess the return on economic capital utilised, the group believes that certain adjustments should be made to the income statement analysis and balance sheet analysis as reflected under IFRS.
The group believes that these adjustments are necessary as they reflect the actual utilisation of capital and return thereon, notwithstanding accounting conventions.
The methodology applied in assessing the utilisation of the group's economic capital is as follows: A notional return on capital net of the cost of subordinated debt and preference shares which is managed and borne in the 25 centre is allocated from Group Services and Other Activities to the business segments based on their total capital utilisation.
Shareholders' equity is increased to reflect permanent capital which is reflected under subordinated debt.

29 Overview of the year Net tangible asset value per share In calculating net tangible asset value per share we assume that all previously issued Compulsory Convertible Debentures CCD's are treated as equity.
Under IFRS however, a portion of these CCD's are treated as debt and not included in shareholders equity.
As a result, adjustments must be made to the shareholder base which would more appropriately reflect their permanent capital nature.
