2.1 Safety In addition to providing reliable services, we seek to ensure the safety of our passengers, staff and others.
Health and safety matters are discussed on page 17 of this Annual Report.
Safety is monitored in various ways, including through a range of KPIs.
Three of the more important KPIs are reported below.
Disposed businesses are excluded from the safety KPIs.
The safety KPIs were as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 April 2007 30 April 2006 Target UK Bus number of blameworthy accidents per 33.2 33.8 1 million miles travelled US number of blameworthy accidents per 1 To decrease each year 12.0 13.5 million miles travelled ultimate target is zero South West Trains workforce lost time injuries 1.8 1.5 per 1,000 staff 3.5.
2.2 Profitability The Group seeks to increase long-term value to its shareholders.
While the Group aims to take a long-term perspective on shareholder value, it also monitors the financial performance of each of its businesses in the shorter term.
For the Group as a whole, the key measure of short-term financial performance is earnings per share, before exceptional items and intangible asset expenses Adjusted EPS.
Adjusted EPS is calculated based on the profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude exceptional items and intangible asset expenses divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares ranking for dividend during the relevant period.
Adjusted EPS was as follows: Year ended 30 April 2007 2006 2005 pence pence pence Target Adjusted EPS To increase in excess of inflation 11.7p 10.6p 9.5p 3.5.
2.3 Organic growth A key element underpinning the Groups strategy is to deliver organic growth in revenue.
The following measures of organic growth are monitored in respect of the Groups three divisions: UK Bus growth in passenger journeys measured as the percentage increase in the number of passenger journeys relative to the equivalent period in the previous year.
Rail growth in passenger miles measured as the percentage increase in the number of miles travelled by passengers relative to the equivalent period in the previous year.
North America growth in constant currency revenue from continuing operations excluding closed units measured as the percentage increase in revenue relative to the equivalent period in the previous year.
The measures vary by division reflecting differences in the underlying business for example, not all passenger revenue in North America is determined on a per passenger basis.
Throughout this Annual Report, references to passenger volume growth for UK Bus or Rail businesses mean growth determined on the basis set out here.
All of these growth KPIs involve a degree of estimation in respect of passenger volumes and are normalised to exclude businesses that have not been held by the Group for the whole of both periods.
The organic growth KPIs were as follows: Year ended 30 April 2007 Year ended 30 April 2006 Growth % Growth % Target UK Bus passenger journeys 6.6% 2.1% UK Rail passenger miles South West Trains Positive growth 8.9% 1.3% VRG - West Coast each year 11.1% 21.3% VRG - CrossCountry 11.0% 4.3% North America revenue 9.1% 11.0% page 6 page 6 | Stagecoach | Stagecoach Group plc Group plc 59983 StCoachRep1to38 5 7 07 19:31 Page 7 3.5.
2.4 Service delivery We aim to provide a reliable service to support our organic growth strategy.
Our measures of service delivery include: UK Bus reliability measured as the percentage of planned miles to be operated that were operated, adjusted to exclude the discontinued London operations.
Rail punctuality measured on the basis of the DfTs Public Performance Measure moving annual average being the percentage of trains that arrive at their final destination within 5 minutes or 10 minutes for inter-city services of their scheduled arrival time having called at all scheduled stations.
Due to the nature of the North American business, there is no single measure of service delivery for the North American division as a whole.
2.5 Staff retention As noted on page 16, the Groups most important resource is its employees.
We monitor staff turnover which is measured as the number of employees who left the Group other than through business disposals during the period as a proportion of the total average employees during the period.
Staff turnover for the last three years in our continuing businesses was as follows: Year ended 30 April 2007 2006 2005 % %% Target UK Bus staff turnover 23.3% 22.7% 28.1% UK Rail staff turnover To South West Trains decrease 10.9% 8.8% 10.7% VRG each year 5.8% 6.2% 7.7% North America staff turnover 21.2% 21.9% 24.0% Stagecoach Stagecoach Group plc | Group plc | page 7 page 7 59983 StCoachRep1to38 5 7 07 19:31 Page 8 Operating and Financial Review 3.6 Overview of financial results Stagecoach Group has produced an excellent set of results for the year ended 30 April 2007.
