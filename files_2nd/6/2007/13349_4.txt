The Gr oupended the year withnet debt of 76.6m compar ed to 47.
Non-trading items The full year results include a net non-trading charge of 0.7m before taxation.
This consists of the following items: A provision of 1.7m against the carrying valueof the Groups investment in Living V entures as previously announced and detailed in the Interim Results for 2007.
Acredit of 1.0m recognised in respect of outstanding loannoteinterest received from Living V entures at the time of the sale of the Living Room business in June 2007 as alsopreviously announced and detailed in the Interim Results.

19% Financing In December 2007 the Group completed new financing arrangements.
This consists of Increaseinfree cashflow a new committed 120mfacility for five years until December 2012.
In all respects this is on terms at least as good as the previous facilities.
The Group alsohas interest ratehedging instruments in place tofix interest costs on a significant proportion of the overall net debt position.
A further 25m is fixed at 4.92% until January 2011.
The Groupis thereforein a strong financialposition with substantialhead room against covenants and available facilities, which will enable us tomaintain the new site development programme.
Balance sheet and key financial ratios T otal Groupnet assets increased in the year from 65.2m to 77.
The detail of this movement is set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The main movements are anincreaseof 29m, representing the retained profits for the year, less dividend payments of 12.2m and a 7.
2m charge to reserves in respect of the acquisition of shares for the employee benefit trust.
The key financial ratios during the year were as follows: Covenant 2007 2006 12.
1x EBIT interest cover 12.1x 12.0x EBIT interest cover EBITDA interest cover 4x 17.0x 17.
1x Fixed charge cover 2.4x 2.3x Balance sheet gearing 99% 73% Net debt EBITDA 3x 1.13x 0.85x Compared to banking covenants under the new facility arrangement, wehave substantial head room.
In terms of financialgearing, given that the Groups business is primarily lease based, the key ratio wefocus on is fixed charge cover.
For the year this was 2.4 times, broadly in line with the level in the previous year.
Taxation The total taxation for the year on ordinary activities is 13.6m as follows: 2007 2006 NonNonTrading trading T otal Trading trading T otal Corporation tax 12.5 0.3 12.8 9.8 1.3 8.5 Deferred tax 2.3 1.5 0.8 2.5 0.22.7 T otal 14.8 1.2 13.6 12.3 1.1 11.2 The underlying normalised tax rateon trading activities excluding unrelieved associate losses was 33.5% 2006: 34.1%.
The reduction in the rateof corporation tax from 30% to 28% announced in the 2007 Budget only comes in toeffect from April 2008, and has thereforehadnoimpact on the current year underlying charge.
The non-trading credit of 1.2m arises primarily as a result of revaluing the year end deferred tax balance at the new rateof 28%, in line with accounting guidance.
