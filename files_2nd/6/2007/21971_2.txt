REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS FINANCIAL REVIEW Please see cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 106.
Introduction The financial results for the 2007 and 2006 financial years reect the continued strong growth in new wave services as we drive value from transforming the business.
Our results reect the continuing transformation of our business operations and markets in an environment where the pace of change is accelerating.
We are driving the change by providing our customers with new technology and services with greater capabilities and lower cost.
The focus on delivering the strategy continued and the groups performance benefited from the growth in new wave activities, such as networked IT services and broadband, and our continued cost efficiency programmes.
Our global networked IT services business has grown and our global capabilities have been strengthened by the successful acquisitions of INS and Counterpane in the 2007 financial year and Radianz and Atlanet in the 2006 financial year.
The acquisitions of PlusNet and dabs.
com in the 2007 financial year have also strengthened our online sales and service capabilities as well as helping us to provide our customers with the most that broadband can offer.
In this Financial review the commentary is focused principally on the trading results of the group before specic items, a non GAAP measure.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and we believe allows a meaningful comparison to be made of the trading results of the group during the period under review.
The directors believe that the presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups financial performance as specic items are significant one-off or unusual in nature and have little predictive value.
Specic items are therefore analysed and discussed separately from the line of business results in this Financial review.
The following table shows the summarised income statement and includes a reconciliation of the key financial performance measures before and after specic items and is discussed further in this Financial review.
The operating results by line of business are discussed in addition to the overall group results as we believe the activities and markets they serve are distinct and this analysis provides a greater degree of insight to investors.
