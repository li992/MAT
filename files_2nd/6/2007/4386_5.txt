fiNaNCial REviEW Dana delivered another year of record financial performance in 2007, through a combination of strong production growth and a 44% improvement in cash generated from operations, facilitated by the Groups continued unhedged exposure to the strong commodity price environment.
in addition, the group delivered a reserves replacement ratio of 316%: successfully completed two major acquisitions and finalised two financings thereby significantly enhancing the Companys financial capability.
Overall, 2007 proved an extremely rewarding year, which delivered a robust set of financial results.
28 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2007 rEVENuE Annualised average, working interest production for the year was 30,514 boepd 2006: 22,285 boepd, with 89% delivered from Europe 2006: 93%.
The Norwegian and Egyptian acquisitions contributed only for the second half and final quarter of the year respectively, so based on the full year Norway delivered 6.3% and Egypt 7.3% of total production.
Liquids accounted for 80% of total production 2006: 84% with 20% from gas.
The Group realised the following average prices per working interest barrel of oil equivalent for hydrocarbon sales during the year: 2007 2007 2007 2007 2006 UK Norway Egypt Total Total Realised price per crude barrel sold $70.88 $80.77 $81.98 $72.40 $61.48 Brent average during ownership period $72.45 $81.24 $88.44 Realised gas price per therm 35.5p 25.3p 35.2p 24.3p NBP average price per therm during ownership period 29.3p 38.3p Revenue per boe $56.99 $95.53 $38.05 $56.03 $48.78 2006 UKCS sales prices only Differences from the average Brent price represent the timings of actual liftings and the premia or discount to Brent at which our equity crude is sold.
"Realised gas prices represent a blended average of gas sold under long-term contract from the Group's older established gas fields, and uncontracted gas from the new Cavendish field, which came onstream in the second half of 2007 and where gas is sold on a ""day-ahead"" basis."
The UK and Norway revenue per boe metrics reflect the composite effect of the above sales, adjusted for crude inventory movements, associated gas production and tariff and other income received.
In Egypt, the revenue per boe reflects the Group's entitlement under the production sharing concession regime.
Consequently, the combination of increased production and higher overall realisations per barrel led to revenue increasing to a record level of 311.5 million 2006: 215.3 million, an increase of 45%.
