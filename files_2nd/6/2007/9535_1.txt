02 Financial Review Introduction The financial information presented has been prepared on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as those used to prepare the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2006.
Analysis of results Income Statement A comparison of the 2007 total operating profit with the prior year is set out below: $m Total operating profit 2006 842 Less profit on sale of houses 2006 special 12 Underlying operating profit 2006 830 PGM price 345 PGM volume 303 PGM mix 28 Base metals 52 Cost changes after foreign exchange benefit 100 Underlying operating profit 2007 796 Sale of houses, pension refund and impairment loss 2007 special 2 Total operating profit 2007 794 The 2006 total operating profit of $842 million benefited from $12 million of gains arising on the disposal of company housing and therefore underlying operating profit for 2006 was $830 million.
The metal markets have continued to strengthen in 2007 for both PGMs and base metals.
The average price per PGM ounce has increased 23% to $1,196 per ounce resulting in an additional $345 million of profit generated.
This year has, however, been a challenging one in terms of production for a number of reasons including the Number One furnace being out of action for quarter two, lower concentrator recoveries and industrial action towards the end of the year.
In addition, a decision was taken not to sell semi-finished product at the year end as part of a strategy to achieve more steady state production flows.
As a result of these factors PGM sales were down by nearly 309,000 ounces and operating profit was adversely affected by $303 million.
In addition the PGM mix was unfavourable with the proportion of highly priced Rhodium ounces falling from 7.5% to 7.0% of the ounces sold.
Base metal revenues were up $52 million entirely driven by Nickel for which volume was up 15% and price up 47%.
After other cost changes of $100 million, which are explained in more detail below, the resulting underlying operating profit was $796 million, down 4% on the prior year.
Total operating profit for 2007 was $794 million after allowing for a number of small special gains and losses.
Other cost changes increase decrease: $m Safety, health, environment and community 28 Exploration, development and marketing 16 Shared services and support functions 19 Productive costs 67 Toll fees 18 Royalties 7 Share-based payments 18 Depreciation and amortisation 6 Foreign exchange 79 100 We recognise the vital role we have in caring for our employees both within the work environment and in the wider community and have spent an incremental $28 million this year.
Safety has remained a major area of focus and we have invested in both training programmes and equipment.
We have run a major AIDS HIV testing programme and nearly 14,000 employees have been tested and know their status.
The anti-retroviral programme to support employees has been extended and the general medical scheme has been improved.
The Company has also developed a major learning programme to improve basic educational skills, including literacy, of the workforce.
In 2007, on average some 500 employees were enrolled on the course and this is expanding to 750 in 2008.
The business has also been strengthened in the year through other forward-looking investments.
Our exploration expenditure has increased by more than 50%.
We have also increased our marketing spend with particular focus in the jewellery sector and we are investing in development programmes with pre-feasibility projects for metallurgical expansion and Limpopo.
Costs of shared services and other functions which support the business have also been increased this year.
In part this reflects recognition that these areas need to be expanded to cope with a more complex environment.
IT costs, for example, have 2007 Annual Report Lonmin Plc Financial Review 03 increased reflecting the costs of operating new ERP and metallurgical systems.
The Human Capital function is being expanded to enhance capabilities in areas such as labour welfare and labour relations.
The Group also recognised in the year that strategic and production planning needed to be enhanced and is developing and broadening this function.
Productive costs increased by some $67 million in the period.
This principally arose from inflationary pressures in the mining sector in South Africa.
However, some other factors were at play.
Opencast contracting costs increased driven by increases in UG2 ore content.
Ore transport costs increased due to the production shifts across the property.
Also the business experienced higher levels of labour absenteeism which necessitated increased staff numbers and resulted in lower productivity.
A number of other specific areas impacted costs.
Outside toll-refining was utilised to process some 12% of our metallurgical production as a direct result of the smelter burn through and this resulted in some $18 million of charges.
The increase in profits derived from the Eastern side of the property due to higher tonnes mined has led to an increase in royalties of $7 million.
Furthermore, the cost of share-based payments increased by $18 million, driven by a number of factors including the impact of the 11 increase in share price on cash-settled schemes, the impact of accelerated vesting and the new co-investment plan.
Foreign exchange has been a strong positive factor with costs benefiting $79 million due to an 8% weaker Rand against the Dollar in 2007.
The Rand has, however, appreciated considerably at the start of 2008 and, if continued, this will have a significantly adverse effect on 2008 reported costs in Dollar terms.
The C1 cost per PGM ounce sold net of by-product credits on own production from the Marikana operations amounted to R3,165 for 2007 compared with R2,441 for 2006, an increase of 30% despite the benefit of improved base metal credits up from R400 oz to R762 oz.
Rand costs incurred on C1 ounces increased by 13%.
The C1 cost per ounce increased significantly due to high levels of fixed costs being spread over fewer ounces as sales of C1 ounces fell by 18%.
Further details of unit costs analysis can be found in the operating statistics table within the Annual Review.
Summary of net finance costs 2007 2006 $m $m Net interest charges 29 36 Capitalised interest 23 16 Prior years capitalised interest adjustment 21 Movement in fair value of embedded derivative of convertible bond 104 227 Other 3 2 Net finance expenses 107 228 Net interest charges have fallen by $7 million due to a lower average net debt versus the prior year and therefore interest cover has strengthened to 27.4 times 2006 23.1 times.
Capitalised interest for the period has increased to $23 million of which $13 million relates to the acquisition funding of the Akanani asset.
A key change in the year has been the redemption of the convertible bonds following the notice issued by the Company in November 2006.
Movements in fair value of the embedded derivative have been recognised to the point of conversion resulting in a lower charge at $104 million in the period.
Net finance expenses in 2007 were, therefore, $107 million compared with $228 million in 2006.
Profit before tax amounted to $705 million in 2007 compared with $633 million in 2006 reflecting the operating profit decrease of $48 million which was more than offset by the improvement in net finance expenses.
The 2007 tax charge was $297 million compared with $202 million in 2006.
The corporate tax rate in South Africa has remained at 29% during the year.
The effective tax rate, excluding the effects of exchange and special items, was 31% compared with 34% last year.
The key reason for the reduction is the overseas taxes on dividends which fell by $29 million reflecting lower levels of dividends remitted in the year by subsidiaries.
This is largely a timing difference which is expected to reverse in 2008 although the rate on such remissions has been reduced from 12.5% to 10.0% with effect from 1 October 2007.
The overall tax charge includes a debit of $51 million on the translation adjustment of the current and deferred tax balances resulting from the 12% appreciation of the closing Rand Dollar exchange rates at the respective year ends.
Profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders amounted to $314 million 2006 $313 million and earnings per share were 205.1 cents compared with 219.5 cents in 2006.
Underlying earnings per share, being earnings excluding special items, amounted to 295.9 cents 2006 312.1 cents.
Balance sheet A reconciliation of the movement in equity shareholders funds is given below.
$m Equity shareholders funds 2006 1,089 Total recognised income 392 Conversion of the convertible bonds 587 Other share issues 70 Dividends 171 Other 1 Equity shareholders funds 2007 1,968 04 Financial Review Equity interests were $1,968 million at 30 September 2007 compared with $1,089 million at 30 September 2006.
The total recognised income attributable to equity shareholders of Lonmin Plc for the year was $392 million.
The conversion of the convertible bonds into equity generated $216 million of share capital and share premium as well as the reversal of $371 million of fair value adjustments previously charged to the income statement.
Further share capital and premium of $70 million was generated by the issuance of shares under option schemes for $33 million and through an equity investment by the IFC.
Dividend payments in the period totalled $171 million made up of $85 million for the 2006 final and $86 million for the 2007 interim dividend.
On 26 January 2007 the Group acquired 94% of AfriOre Limited with a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares by 16 February 2007.
Total consideration paid was $413 million against net assets acquired under Group accounting policies of $15 million.
This has, therefore, resulted in the recognition of $611 million of exploration and evaluation assets, $73 million of goodwill, a deferred tax liability of $173 million and the minority interest share of the fair value of $113 million as required by IFRS.
Net debt amounted to $375 million at 30 September 2007 with the components being bank loans of $596 million, offset by cash net of overdrafts of $221 million.
Net debt has reduced in the period from $458 million with the net cash outflows of $137 million being offset by the conversion of the convertible bonds.
Gearing was 15% compared with 27% at 30 September 2006, calculated on net borrowings attributable to the Group divided by those attributable net borrowings and the equity interests outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Cash flow The following table summarises the main components of the cash flow during the year: 2007 2006 $m $m Operating profit 794 842 Depreciation and amortisation 87 81 Change in working capital 81 202 Other 21 1 Cash flow from operations 983 722 Interest and finance costs 25 31 Tax 266 185 Trading cash flow 692 506 Capital expenditure 276 182 Proceeds from asset held for sale 5 28 Dividends paid to minority 41 62 Free cash flow 380 290 Acquisitions 393 14 Financial investments 21 36 Shares issued 68 15 Equity dividends paid 171 124 Cash inflow outflow 137 131 Opening net debt 458 585 Bond conversion 213 Exchange 7 4 Closing net debt 375 458 Trading cash flow cents per share 452.0c 354.9c Free cash flow cents per share 248.2c 203.4c Despite the fall in operating profit, cash flow from operations for 2007 was $983 million, a 36% increase on last years figure of $722 million.
This was mainly due to an inflow on working capital of $81 million compared with an outflow of $202 million last year.
The large outflow in 2006 was as a result of an increase of $249 million in debtors due to concentrate sales at the end of the year.
During this year, there has been a $58 million decrease in debtors.
After interest and finance costs of $25 million and tax payments of $266 million, trading cash flow amounted to $692 million in 2007 against $506 million in 2006, with trading cash flow per share of 452.0 cents in 2007 against 354.9 cents in 2006.
Capital expenditure of $276 million was incurred during the year, up $94 million on the prior year.
This was, however, lower than the $300 million expected and most of this shortfall relates to timing differences which will flow into 2008.
Free cash flow amounted to $380 million with free cash flow per share at 248.2 cents 2006 203.4 cents.
Acquisitions of $393 million in 2007 represented the purchase of AfriOre Limited as described above net of $20 million cash acquired.
Proceeds from shares issued were up $53 million as, in addition to shares issued in respect of share schemes, a $35 million equity investment was made by the IFC which was at a 5% discount to market price.
After equity dividends paid of $171 million, the cash outflow during 2007 was $137 million and net debt amounted to $375 million at 30 September 2007.
2007 Annual Report Lonmin Plc Financial Review 05 Dividends As dividends are now accounted for on a cash basis under IFRS, the dividend shown in the accounts represents the 2006 final of 55 cents and the 2007 interim of 55 cents making a total of 110 cents for the year.
In addition the Board recommends a final 2007 dividend of 60 cents 2006 55 cents.
Financial risk management The Groups reporting currency remains the US Dollar and the share capital of the Company is based in US Dollars.
The Groups business is mining and it does not undertake trading activity in financial instruments.
Interest rate risk Monetary assets and liabilities are subject to the risk of movements in interest rates.
The borrowings at 30 September 2007 comprised $296 million of borrowings in the UK, of which $237 million was drawn under an acquisition facility on the purchase of AfriOre and, in South Africa, a long-term bank loan of $300 million was drawn together with an overdraft of $1 million.
Cash deposits represented balances of $12 million in the UK and $210 million in South Africa.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk measures the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due and, therefore, its ability to continue trading.
The Groups policy on overall liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient committed facilities in place which, when combined with available cash resources, are sufficient to meet the funding requirements in the foreseeable future.
At the 2007 year end, the Group had $1,450 million of committed facilities in place of which $596 million were drawn down.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises when movements in exchange rates, particularly the US Dollar against the South African Rand, affect the transactions the Group enters into, reported profits and net assets.
Most of the Groups operations are based in South Africa and the majority of the revenue stream is in US Dollars.
However, the bulk of the Groups costs, and taxes, are in Rand.
Most of the cash held in South Africa is in US Dollars and is normally remitted to the UK on a regular basis.
Short-term working capital facilities required in South Africa are drawn primarily in US Dollars.
Fluctuations in the Rand to US Dollar exchange rate can have a significant impact on the Groups results.
A strengthening of the Rand against the US Dollar has an adverse effect on profits due to the majority of costs being denominated in Rand.
The approximate effect on the Groups results of a 10% movement in the Rand to US Dollar 2007 year average exchange rate would be as follows: EBIT $83m Profit for the year $48m EPS cents 31.4c These sensitivities are based on 2007 prices, costs and volumes and assume all other variables remain constant.
They are estimated calculations only.
Commodity price risk Commodities are traded on worldwide commodities markets and are subject to price fluctuations.
Therefore, the prices obtained are dependent upon the prevailing market prices.
Any change in prices will have a direct effect on the Groups trading results.
Forward sales are undertaken where the Board determines that it is in the Groups interest to hedge a proportion of future cash flows.
The Group has undertaken a limited number of forwards on Nickel and Copper by-product sales as disclosed in note 21 to the financial statements.
The approximate effects on the Groups results of a 10% movement in the 2007 year average market prices for Platinum Pt, Palladium Pd, Rhodium Rh and Nickel Ni would be as follows: Pt Pd Rh Ni EBIT $96m $12m $60m $14m Profit for the year $56m $7m $35m $8m EPS cents 36.5c 4.6c 22.7c 5.4c The above sensitivities are based on 2007 volumes and assume all other variables remain constant.
Fiscal risk Changes in governmental fiscal policy in the territories in which the Group operates will impact on Group profitability.
In South Africa the Government has been drafting and debating a Royalty Bill which will come into effect on 1 May 2009.
As currently drafted this Bill would see a royalty based on revenue with a rate of 3% for refined Platinum Group Metals.
