In June 2007, the Company raised US$555 million before expenses through a placing of 133 million units, each consisting of three ordinary shares and one warrant, at a price per unit of 2.10.
A further US$20 million was raised through a placement of 17.1 million ordinary shares with IFC.
In addition, IFC was granted an option to subscribe for a further 17.1 million ordinary shares at an exercise price of 0.74.
In December 2007, the Company raised US$64 million before expenses through a placing of 42.75 million ordinary shares at a price per share of 0.75.
In prior periods, the Company had determined that its functional currency was United States dollars US Dollars or US$.
During the year, the Company raised a significant amount of funds by way of a placing of ordinary shares and warrants in the UK market.
Not only are these denominated in Great Britain pounds GB pounds or with dividends payable in GB pounds, but they also represent a strategic decision to raise funding in GB pounds on this occasion.
Accordingly the Directors found it necessary to reconsider the Companys functional currency and, as a consequence, have determined that the functional currency of the Company has changed to GB pounds.
The accounts continue to be presented in US Dollars to aid comparison with other global mining companies.
Results of Operations The Group made a loss before tax for the year of US$1.9 million, compared to a loss from continuing operations in 2006 of US$2.6 million.
The Group recognised revenue from operations of US$4.9 million during the year, representing revenue generated from our engineering services company, Giproruda, based in St Petersburg.

Costs totalling US$4.0 million were incurred in connection with the Company listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in October 2007.
As no new ordinary shares or warrants were issued at the time of listing, these costs have been recognised in the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Administration expenses have increased as expected, from US$7.3 million to US$21.5 million primarily due to an increase in salary costs, other consultancy costs, rent and general overheads in connection with the expansion of the Groups activities.

Investment Revenues Income from investments and cash balances has increased from US$5.0 million in 2006 to US$21.5 million in 2007 due to the amount of cash available for earning interest following the share placings in June and December 2007.
This figure includes a net exchange gain of US$2.5 million 2006: US$0.3 million.

Acquisition of Assets The Group completed a number of asset acquisitions during the year.
These acquisitions are described in further detail in note 38 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Olekminsky Rudnik In January 2007, the Group acquired at a cost of US$11 million the 26% interest in Olekminsky Rudnik that it did not already own, taking its interest in the Kuranakh project to 100%.
KS GOK On 4 April 2007, the Company notified Philotus Holdings Limited Philotus that it wanted to exercise the option to purchase the 50% interest in KS GOK it did not already own.
Following the receipt of FAS approval for this exercise, on 9 August 2007 the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in KS GOK, in consideration for the issue of 123.8 million ordinary shares to Philotus, taking its total interest in KS GOK to 100%.
The cost of the net assets acquired at this date was considered to be the fair value determined as at 20 April 2007, this being the date of the settlement of the deferred consideration outstanding with respect to the acquisition of the first 50% controlling interest in KS GOK, which closely followed the date the Company served notice to Philotus in respect of the exercise of the option to acquire the remaining 50% interest.
The total consideration payable for this 50% interest was US$149.3 million.
Following the completion of the asset acquisition in August 2007, the difference between the cost of the net assets acquired, determined as at 20 April 2007, and the fair value of the purchase consideration, has been recognised in equity.
Garinskoye On 24 September 2007, Aricom UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aricom, subscribed for ordinary shares in Lapwing Limited Lapwing, the company holding the licence to develop the Garinskoye iron ore deposit in the Amur region of Russia.
At the time of this subscription, Aricom UK expected to obtain a 60% ownership interest in Lapwing, and additional subscriptions were required to be made by Aricom UKs co-Shareholders at the same price.
There were expected to be four further Shareholders in Lapwing, namely Olis with 25% and three other Shareholders with the remaining 15% the Additional Holders.
The Additional Holders did not subscribe for any additional shares and consequently their interest in Lapwing was diluted to a total of 0.52% with Aricom UK holding 70.22% and Olis holding 29.26%.
Consideration for the acquisition of this asset was the settlement of a loan issued by the Group to Lapwing for 20.22 million, in exchange for 20,220,000 shares at 1 each in Lapwing.
Aricom UK also acquired for a premium of US$19.7 million an option to purchase a further 25% interest in Lapwin.
This option was terminated in December 2007 and the original terms varied under an agreement dated 13 December 2007 as amended to acquire Olis 29.26% interest in Lapwing the Acquisition Agreement.
This acquisition was subject to Aricom Shareholders approval.
Subsequent to the year end the Shareholders approval was obtained for the acquisition of the 29.26% minority interest in Lapwing held by Olis.
The total purchase consideration for this acquisition was US$122.3 million, and taking into account the further 0.1% minority interest in Lapwing acquired by the Group subsequent to the year end, takes the Groups total investment in Lapwing, and the Garinskoye deposit, to 99.58%.
These events are further described in note 46 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Acquisition of a Subsidiary In May 2007, the Groups acquisition of a 68.49% interest in Giproruda, a highly respected engineering company based in St Petersburg, was approved by the FAS.
A cash consideration of US$8.1 million was paid and transfer of ownership was effected on 8 June 2007.
Due to a restriction in voting rights, Giproruda was recognised as an associate between 8 June and 12 July 2007.
On 13 July 2007, the Group obtained the full voting rights in respect of its 68.49% interest in Giproruda after a mandatory offer to minority Shareholders was made in accordance with Russian legislation.
The mandatory offer to Shareholders lapsed on 21 September 2007.
A total of 2,073 shares were tendered under the offer, at a total cost of US$232,000.

uk Financial Review continued Cash Flows The net cash outflow from operating activities for 2007 was US$12.9 million 2006: US$8.5 million, reflecting increased costs associated with the Groups commencement of mining activities at Kuranakh, and costs associated with the further development of the other projects.
The increase in costs was partially offset by increased income earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments, which rose by US$12 million 2006: US$4.5 million.
Net cash used in investing activities was US$281.8 million 2006: US$65.0 million, including amounts of US$47.3 million paid to acquire the Groups interest in the Garinskoye deposit, loans advanced of US$69.2 million and capital expenditure of US$76.7 million 2006: US$32.6 million.

The Group expects to renew discussions on project finance in 2008.
Interim Results As a consequence of the decision that the functional currency of the Company had changed to GB pounds in the first half of 2007, the interim results for the six months to 30 June 2007 will be restated.
The restated loss for the six months will be increased to be US$4.0 million higher than previously reported due to certain exchange losses now being reflected in the profit and loss account.
Events After the Balance Sheet Date Subsequent to year end the Group acquired a further 29.36% interest in the Garinskoye deposit.
This acquisition is further described above under Acquisition of assets and in note 46 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Going Concern Basis After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
