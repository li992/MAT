Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2007 33 Financial Review continued Financing The Groups financial strategy is to maintain an optimal gearing ratio to ensure that shareholders benefit from maximum leveraged returns.
The Group seeks to finance its property investments with long-term debt facilities that reect the long-term nature of its property investments and on which the interest rates have been xed by utilising a mixture of xed rate debt and oating rate debt with matching interest rate swap agreements.
Mapeley seeks to finance new outsourcing contracts in line with this strategy at up to 80% Loan To Value LTV.
Purchases of direct investment properties are nanced on a similar basis but initially using a short-term revolving facility for 100% of purchase costs.
This is subsequently renanced at up to 80% LTV.
The Group strives to eliminate the effect of interest rate uctuations on its earnings and in order to achieve this, hedges its anticipated long-term financial liabilities using interest rate swaps or xed rate debt at the earliest opportunity, normally on the purchase of a property.
Although the Group has arrangements in place that hedge its interest rate exposure on substantially all of its borrowings, not all of these arrangements are eligible for hedge accounting.
Bank loans At 31 December 2007, 1,496.0million had been drawn under the Groups loan facilities 31 December 2006: 1,278.3million.
The Group drew down funds of 221.0million in the period and repaid loans of 3.3million following the disposal of properties.
Amounts drawn down are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 Facility Interest terms m m Term loan under HMRC portfolio facility Fixed rate loan 173.0 176.0 Term loan under Abbey portfolio facility Variable rate loan with 100% matching interest rate swap 454.6 455.0 Acquisition term loan Fixed rate loan 170.9 170.9 Term loan under Beta portfolio facility Fixed rate loan 208.6 208.6 Term loan under Gamma portfolio facility Fixed rate loan 231.3 231.3 Revolving Delta acquisition facility Variable rate loan with associated interest rate swaps 257.6 36.5 1,496.0 1,278.3 At 31 December 2007 swaps with a notional value of 257.6 were in place against the Delta revolving facility 31 December 2006: 20.7 million.
Renancing The Group has continued to finance the acquisition of direct property investments using its three-year 400.0million revolving facility the Delta Acquisition facility.
At 31 December 2007 257.6million was drawn down under this facility.
The facility expires in April 2008 and is therefore held within current liabilities.
This facility has since been renanced with a 152million seven year term loan, a 60million loan repayable in April 2009 and cash from within the business.
Further details on this is given in note17 to the financial statements.
