IG Group Holdings plc 19 Group Operating and Financial Review Report and Financial Statements 2007 Nature, objectives and strategies continued Expanding the Groups international reach The Group continues to expand its non-UK client base and, in the year ended 31 May 2007, revenue from non-UK clients grew to 21% of total revenue 2006 17%.
It now has offices in Australia, Singapore and Germany together with an Italian desk based in London.
The Group will continue to explore the feasibility of other branches or offices where local regulation and market conditions are suitable.
In particular, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which comes into force in November 2007, will facilitate the Groups entry into further European markets and the Group plans to open offices in Spain and France in the coming year.
In addition the Group continues to extend the range of third parties who introduce clients to the Group and this is an effective way of establishing a presence for the Groups regulated financial business in territories which do not merit the establishment of a local office.
The Group has multi-lingual websites for its CFD and sports fixed odds businesses and will continue to offer an increasing range of languages in order to further widen its global reach.
Continuing to deliver product and technological innovation The Group recognises the benefits it has experienced as a result of the introduction of innovative products such as binary bets and extrabet and the introduction of market leading dealing platforms.
This culture of innovation is one which the Group intends to maintain in order to continue to be at the forefront of the market in terms of product offering and technology platforms.

The directors have assessed that the following key performance indicators, together with revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share, are the most effective measures of progress towards achieving the Groups strategies and as such towards fulfilling the Companys business objectives.
2007 2006 Financial Number of clients dealing 34,483 24,709 Average revenue per client 3,184 3,251 Number of accounts opened 23,785 18,377 Number of accounts dealing for the first time 15,809 12,287 Sport Number of clients dealing 19,905 10,268 Number of accounts opened 16,437 3,969 Number of accounts dealing for the first time 12,013 2,796 Volatility of daily revenue Coefficient of variability at 31 May 0.46 0.56 Average for the year 0.53 0.48 Highest in year 0.73 0.56 Lowest in year 0.36 0.38 Number of clients dealing Revenue is determined to a significant extent by the number of clients dealing.
The number of financial clients dealing increased by 40% compared with the previous year.
The most marked increase was in the number of CFD clients dealing, reflecting growth driven by an increase in introduced business and expansion of the non-UK client base.
The number of clients financial betting increased by 21% over the previous year.
The number of sports clients dealing directly with IG increased by 94% compared with the previous year.
This number excludes those clients dealing on exchanges for which client numbers are unavailable.
The growth in sport in the year was due in part to the launch of the Groups fixed odds offering, extrabet.
Average revenue per financial client Average revenue per financial client represents the total revenue divided by the number of clients dealing.
This varies significantly for different products and geographies and the overall average reflects changes in the business mix during the year.
Average revenue per financial client reduced slightly from the previous year.
Higher average revenues in the UK were offset by lower average revenues elsewhere in the world.
In particular, CFD clients in the Asia Pacific and Rest of World segments are more retail in nature and represent a newer client base for which average revenues are significantly lower than for UK CFD clients.
The average revenue for financial betting clients was consistent with the previous year.
Average revenue per sport client The average revenue for sport clients cannot be accurately measured as the number of clients betting on exchanges cannot be determined.
IG Group Holdings plc 22 Report and Financial Statements 2007 Group Operating and Financial Review Key performance indicators continued Number of accounts opened and dealing for the first time Over the long term the growth of IGs client base is a key driver of revenue growth.
The number of accounts opened and the number of accounts dealing for the first time therefore provide leading indicators of future prospects.
New financial accounts were favourably impacted by the introduction of TradeSense, recruitment of introducers and the promotion of L2 during the year.
Sport account numbers benefited in the early part of the year from the football World Cup.
Volatility of daily revenue The coefficient of variability of daily revenue is a statistical measure of the volatility of the Groups revenue from day to day.
The Group calculates this as the 60 day standard deviation of daily revenues divided by the 60 day mean.
Over recent years the coefficient of variability has fallen significantly as the Group has sought to reduce the volatility of its revenues and hence improve the quality of earnings.
The directors consider that the levels of coefficient of variability seen throughout the year ended 31 May 2007 represent an acceptable balance between the cost of hedging and volatility of income.
EBITDA and EBITDA margin EBITDA represents earnings before exceptional administrative costs, depreciation, amortisation charges, amounts written off property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, taxation, interest payable on debt and interest receivable on corporate cash balances but includes interest receivable on clients balances less interest payable to clients.
The net interest receivable on client balances is considered to be part of the normal operating activities of the Group and is therefore included in EBITDA.
EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.
The Groups capital structure changed significantly in September 2003 when the Company raised significant debt and preference shares in order to finance the purchase of IG Group plc by IG Group Holdings plc.
This acquisition gave rise to significant goodwill.
The Groups capital structure changed again in May 2005 when this debt and preference shares were repaid at the time of the Companys initial public offering IPO.
As a result of these changes in capital structure, profit measures such as profit before or after tax do not fully reflect the underlying financial performance of the business over time.
The Group therefore utilises EBITDA as a primary profit measure.
The Group seeks to achieve rapid growth in EBITDA, and bonuses for most staff other than directors of the Company are linked to EBITDA.
2007 2006 000 000 Operating profit 59,202 44,070 Net interest on client balances 6,559 5,034 Depreciation 3,513 2,205 Amortisation 856 1,318 Amounts written off property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 221 2 EBITDA 70,351 52,629 EBITDA margin 57.7% 58.9% EBITDA for the year reached 70.4m which represents an increase of 34% from the previous year.
EBITDA margin reduced slightly in the year under review to 57.7% from 58.9%.
This was primarily due to investment for future growth and in particular investment in IT capability and infrastructure.
IG Group Holdings plc 23 Group Operating and Financial Review Report and Financial Statements 2007 Key performance indicators continued Earnings per share The Group seeks to maximise the growth in earnings per share over time in order to maximise shareholder value.
The Groups long term incentive plans LTIPs and directors bonuses are linked to growth in earnings per share.
Further details of LTIPs and directors bonuses are set out in the directors remuneration report and note 25 to the financial statements.
Diluted earnings per share were 14.52p compared with 10.88p in the previous year, an increase of 33.5%.
The directors consider that the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the years ended 31 May 2005 and prior do not fully reflect changes in the Groups capital structure referred to above.
In order to facilitate comparison of performance over the periods to 31 May 2005, normalised earnings per share was established.
Normalised earnings per share were not calculated for the year ended 31 May 2006 or subsequently.
Normalised earnings per share represents earnings adjusted for normalising items, divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue and to be issued, adjusted for normalising items.
Normalising adjustments to earnings comprise the impact, net of tax, of exceptional administrative costs, interest and charges on debt finance, redeemable preference share interest payable and tax items relating to the financing structure.
Normalising adjustments to the number of shares comprise the impact of restating the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue prior to a subdivision and re-designation on 31 May 2005 to the equivalent weighted average ordinary shares in issue in the period and treating the issue of new ordinary shares at the time of the Companys flotation as if it had taken place prior to 1 June 2002.
Employees The Groups continued growth is highly dependent upon attracting and retaining high calibre employees.
The Group pays performance related bonuses to all staff and has made awards under Long Term Incentive Plans LTIPs to key personnel.
In addition, the opportunity to acquire shares under a Share Incentive Plan SIP has been made available to all UK staff which rewards employees for past performance and helps to retain them in the future.
The Group provides a range of benefits to all of its employees, including pension contributions, private health cover and contributions towards health club membership.
The average number of employees in the Group increased in the year from 312 to 404.
Of these, the vast majority are based in the UK, with 29 staff based in Australia, 6 based in the Singapore office, and 6 based in the German office which was established during the year.
The Group aims to provide a challenging and rewarding working environment and staff turnover has been low.
A significant proportion of the employment cost consists of performance related bonuses and commissions which vary according to revenue, profitability or earnings per share growth.
These increased by 12% compared with the previous year.
Performance related bonuses for the majority of staff are awarded on a discretionary basis while commissions are calculated according to an agreed formula.
Inclusive of national insurance and pension costs, employment costs comprise: 2007 2006 000 000 Fixed employment costs 20,229 15,326 Performance related bonuses and commissions 9,747 8,695 Share based payment schemes 1,842 1,696 31,818 25,717 IG Group Holdings plc 24 Report and Financial Statements 2007 Group Operating and Financial Review Financial position Property, plant and equipment The Group continues to invest heavily in technology in order to enhance its capacity and resilience which are critical to the success of the business.
Additions during the year amounted to 7.8m compared with 2.7m in the previous year and include the fit-out of additional office space in London, Melbourne and two data centres.
Depreciation charged in the year amounted to 3.5m 2006 2.2m.
Intangible fixed assets Goodwill, which has mainly arisen on the acquisition of IG Group plc and its subsidiaries, amounts to 106.2m.
This has been capitalised and under the provisions of IFRS is subject to an annual impairment review.
There were no impairment write offs in the year.
Development expenditure and software and licences purchased during the year amounted to 1.4m 2006 0.5m.
Amortisation charged in the year amounted 0.9m 2006 1.3m.
Working capital 2007 2006 000 000 Amounts due from brokers 345,076 121,857 Amounts due from clients 7,552 5,254 Amounts due to clients 726,144 285,635 Net amounts due to clients 718,592 280,381 Cash and cash equivalents 484,556 247,277 Loan notes - 92 Redeemable preference shares 40 40 Net funds 484,516 247,145 Amounts due to and from clients include unrealised profits losses on clients open positions, profits losses on closed positions as well as the cash balance on clients accounts.
The Group hedges the vast majority of clients open positions in the financials business and amounts due from brokers represent cash or treasury bills placed with counterparties in order to provide initial and variation margin to support these positions.
These elements of working capital have increased significantly in the year under review reflecting higher levels of client activity and movement in markets.
The Group only offers credit to a minority of clients.
The charge for impairment of trade receivables amounts due from brokers and clients is established where there is objective evidence of non-collectability.
Reference is made to an aged profile of debt and the provision is subject to management review.
The charge for the year was approximately 1.2% of revenue 2006 1.6%.
The Group continues to pursue outstanding debts vigorously.
IG Group Holdings plc 25 Group Operating and Financial Review Report and Financial Statements 2007 Financial position continued Cash flow Cash and cash equivalents increased by 237.3m over the previous year because of the significant and profitable expansion of the business during the year and the substantial inflow of client money.
This reflected increased client activity and growth in client open positions, the majority of which was covered by cash margins which were reflected in the movement in trade receivables and payables.
Excluding these, net cash inflow for the year was 20.9m after significant cash outflows of 26.1m for taxation 2006 0.1m : 19.7m for dividends 2006 4.9m and capital expenditure of 7.8m 2006 2.7m.
The Group holds client money on account in segregated bank accounts which at the year end amounted to 391.3m compared with 199.2m in the previous year.

Own shares held in Employee Benefit Trusts were purchased in satisfaction of the SIP award made during the year.
The remaining loan notes were redeemed on 31 July 2006. Dividend policy As explained in the Chairmans Statement the Company has increased the dividend payout proportion from 50% to approximately 60% of earnings.
This policy will be kept under review, but the Company intends to pay out a similar proportion of earnings in the future.
During the year the Company paid an interim dividend of 2.00p per share amounting to 6.6m.
The final dividend for 2007 proposed for approval by shareholders at the AGM is 6.50p per share which will amount to 21.3m taking the total dividends for the year to 27.9m.
This represents a dividend cover of 1.72.
IG Group Holdings plc 26 Report and Financial Statements 2007 Group Operating and Financial Review Regulatory capital Two of the Groups UK operating subsidiaries are regulated by the FSA.
The FSA imposes a minimum level of regulatory capital which must be retained by each Company and also an overall level of regulatory capital which must be maintained by the Group.
At 31 May 2007 the Group had an overall consolidated regulatory capital surplus of approximately 44m 2006 30m.
