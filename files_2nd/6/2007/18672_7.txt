Financial Review Consolidated Income Statement Profits Profits before tax increased to 60.1m 2006: 57.1m with higher development profits, an increased contribution from the Companys joint ventures and lower net finance costs exceeding the reduction in trading profits and gains on investment properties.
Adjusted profits before tax, which excludes the gains on sale and revaluation of investment properties, increased to 19.5m 2006: 13.6m.
Profits after tax and minority interest increased to 52.1m 2006: 47.4m.
Rental income Net rental income for the year fell to 14.8m 2006: 16.5m reflecting, for a second year, the sale of let investment and trading properties and their replacement with vacant or partially let properties with refurbishment and rental growth prospects.
During the year 46m of investment properties, yielding 2.1m of rental income, were sold.
29m was used to add to the investment portfolio, principally through the refurbishment of existing properties, and 42m was used to purchase sites and properties to be re-developed.
Together these currently produce a passing rent of 1.0m.
Rent reviews and new lettings, net of lease expiries and rent free periods, added rental income of 1.6m on the remaining portfolio.
Rental costs fell from 3.6m to 3.3m, as vacant space at refurbished properties began to be let.
Trading and other profits Trading profits of 2.1m were down on last year 2006: 13.4m and arose from the sale of a number of properties at Nottingham, Curtain Road London EC2 and in Glasgow.
Development profits The development programme produced profits at the retail schemes at Weston-super-Mare, Luton and Nottingham, office schemes at Ropemaker Place London EC2, Chertsey and Hailsham and industrial office schemes in Oxford and Cambridge.

The revaluation surplus for the year was 33.2m 2006: 35.7m.
Finance costs and finance income Increases in interest rates on higher levels of debt during most of the year led to an increase in interest costs.

Finance income earned on cash deposits remained constant at 1.3m 2006: 1.3m.
