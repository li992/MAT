The Groups policy is to hedge forward foreign exchange contracts as soon as commitment has been given to the underlying transaction.

Any gains or losses on the translation of these balance sheets into Sterling are recorded in reserves against the gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings that are effective as net investment hedges.
