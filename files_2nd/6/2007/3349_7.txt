Business and financial review Financial review Trading results for the year A detailed review of the trading results for the year is set out in the Chairmans statement, Chief Executives statement and the business reviews of ESAB and Howden.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share were 82.7 pence 2006: 74.4 pence.
However, we believe that adjusted earnings per share provide a better indication of Charters underlying business performance.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 24.4 per cent to 84.7 pence 2006: 68.1 pence and were derived from basic earnings per share as set out below.

Previously actuarial gains and losses below a certain threshold were not recognised and those above this threshold were only recognised prospectively over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
The classification of the income statement charge has been changed such that the expected return on the schemes assets and interest on the schemes liabilities are now included within net financing costs.
Previously these items were included in arriving at operating profit.
These changes have been implemented with effect from 1 January 2007 and the 2006 comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The Directors consider these changes align Charter more closely with general UK accounting practice under IFRS.
The impact of these changes on 2006 is shown in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
An analysis of the increase in operating profit by business segment is set out below: 2006 m Welding and cutting 3.2 Air and gas handling 1.0 Central operations 2.8 Increase in operating profit 1.4 There is no adjustment to the net financing charge in 2006, as the expected return on the schemes assets was equal to the interest on the schemes liabilities.
The restatement has increased adjusted earnings per share by 0.9 pence to 68.1 pence for the year ended 31 December 2006.
Net financing credit charge The net financing credit, before retranslation of intercompany loan balances, of 4.1 million 2006: 4.6 million charge comprised interest income of 6.1 million and a net credit from retirement benefit obligations of 2.3 million offset by interest payable of 3.8 million and the unwinding of discounts on provisions of 0.5 million.
24 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 Taxation In 2007, the total tax on profit on ordinary activities was 33.3 million 2006: 16.9 million, which comprised: 2007 2006 m m Current tax charge UK 1.0 3.4 overseas 39.3 28.7 40.3 32.1 Deferred tax credit UK 2.6 1.8 overseas 5.0 3.2 Tax charge before taxation on gains on intercompany loans and exceptional tax credit 32.7 27.1 Taxation on net gains on retranslation of intercompany loan balances overseas 0.6 0.3 Exceptional deferred tax credit North America 10.5 Tax charge 33.3 16.9 The tax charge of 33.3 million compares with tax paid in the year of 35.9 million.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 18.4 per cent 2006: 19.4 per cent, calculated as follows: 2006 2007 restated 1 m m Profit before tax 178.1 146.0 Add deduct adjustments: amortisation of acquired intangibles and goodwill 0.5 net losses gains on retranslation of intercompany loan balances 2.5 0.2 share of post tax profits of associates 3.2 5.8 177.9 140.0 Tax charge before taxation on adjustments above and exceptional tax credit in 2006 32.8 27.1 Adjusted effective tax rate 18.4% 19.4% 1 the 2006 comparatives have been restated to reflect the change in accounting for post employment benefits The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate in the year was largely a consequence of increasing profits being generated in low tax jurisdictions such as China and Eastern Europe but also reflects the recognition and utilisation of previously unrecognised brought forward tax losses.
The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to remain around the level seen in 2007 in the short term.
Acquisitions In line with our strategy, during the year Charter made a number of acquisitions, details of which are set out in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
The impact of acquisitions on the 2007 results was to increase Welding, cutting and automation sales and operating profit by 16.7 million and 4.5 million respectively.
In 2007, the annual sales and operating profits of the businesses acquired were 48.0 million and 12.0 million respectively.
Charter plc Annual Report 2007 25 Business and financial review Financial review continued Currency Charters results are sensitive to movements in exchange rates.
The translation impact of exchange rate movements on segmental sales and operating profits in 2007 is set out below: Underlying 2006 movement Translated at constant at 2007 exchange exchange Currency 2007 rates rates fluctuations 2006 m m m m m Sales Welding, cutting & automation 970.8 158.3 812.5 15.9 828.4 Air & gas handling 480.3 62.8 417.5 12.0 429.5 Total 1,451.1 221.1 1,230.0 27.9 1,257.9 Operating profit Welding, cutting & automation 126.6 24.7 101.9 0.2 102.1 Air & gas handling 57.6 8.6 49.0 1.3 50.3 Air & gas handling sale of property 4.8 4.8 4.8 Central operations 10.9 1.7 12.6 12.6 Total 173.3 30.2 143.1 1.5 144.6 Trading results and cash flow of overseas operations have been converted into sterling at average rates of exchange whereas the balance sheets were converted at year-end rates.

The principal components of this increase were the profit for the year attributable to Charter shareholders of 137.8 million, the reduction in retirement benefit obligations of 11.9 million and net translation exchange gains of 25.1 million.
As at 31 December 2007, the total equity attributable to minority interests increased to 27.6 million 2006: 10.3 million largely as a result of the minority interest in ESAB India Limited, which arose following that company becoming a subsidiary in September 2007.
The minority interests that are significant are the 30 per cent interest in Howden Hua Engineering Co Limited, the 45 per cent interest in Howden Africa Holdings Limited and the 44 per cent interest in ESAB India Limited.
As at 31 December 2007, the Company had net retirement benefit obligations of 76.6 million.
This sum represents 18.0 per cent of equity shareholders funds as at that date compared with 44.2 per cent as at 31 December 2006.
Working capital has grown by 29.4 million to 193.4 million, an increase of 17.9%.
However, as a percentage of sales, working capital has remained fairly constant at around 13 per cent.
Included within trade and other receivables are amounts receivable under construction contracts of 55.7 million 2006: 38.4 million.
Included within trade and other payables are amounts payable under construction contracts of 82.2 million 2006: 53.6 million.
Retirement benefit obligations As shown in the table below, the net obligation in respect of pensions and other post retirement benefits fell by 32.2 million in the year to 76.6 million.

The majority of the 32.2 million reduction in the net retirement benefit obligation arose as a result of actuarial gains due to increasing interest rates, which caused the present value of liabilities to fall, and cash contributions of 19.5 million.

The amount spent on acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of 26.2 million related to the increased shareholding in ESAB India and acquisitions in Argentina, Bulgaria, South Africa and Germany, together with 1.0 million in respect of prior year acquisitions.
Free cash flow for the year was 67.4 million compared with 65.7 million in 2006, despite investing a net 47.3 million 2006: 14.7 million on capital expenditure and development costs, net of disposal proceeds.

Charter plc Annual Report 2007 29 Business and financial review Financial review continued Cash and borrowings As at 31 December 2007, cash balances were 118.5 million 2006: 62.3 million, of which the majority was held in the UK, with the balance held overseas for local working capital purposes or pending dividend payments.
Of the cash held overseas, 3.3 million 2006: 4.5 million is retained as cash collateral in connection with certain local trading practices or banking facilities.
The credit status of institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
As at 31 December 2007, gross borrowings were 30.3 million 2006: 19.2 million.
In certain instances, borrowings are denominated in the currencies of the Companys net investments overseas which provides a hedge against currency fluctuations.
Gains and losses arising from borrowings or forward exchange contracts which are used to hedge foreign currency exposures are recognised as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes in equity until the items being hedged have impacted on the income statement.
Charters central treasury department is responsible for ensuring the availability of suitable and sufficient borrowing and other financing facilities.
In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks, liquidity risks and balance sheet foreign exchange translation risks.
Foreign exchange transaction exposures are generally managed by operating subsidiaries within strict guidelines and controls established by the management of their parent companies and overseen by the central treasury department.
It is the Companys policy not to hedge profit and loss account translation exposures.
Contingent liabilities Details of contingent liabilities are set out in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Significant accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the accounting policies set out in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Applying accounting policies requires the use of certain judgments, assumptions and estimates.
The following accounting policies have been identified as being the most significant and where there is most risk of a material adjustment to the carrying value of Charters assets and liabilities within the next financial year: goodwill impairment construction contracts deferred tax warranty and legal liabilities retirement benefits.
Risks and uncertainties Charter, both directly and through ESAB and Howden, is exposed to a wide variety of markets and geographies and seeks to manage the risks and uncertainties which arise from this.
In certain instances and where it is cost-effective to do so, exposures can be transferred to third parties, for example through insurance or through currency hedging.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by Charter, and the ways in which they are being managed, are set out below.
Economic recession Economic recession in a particular region may be created by internal factors, such as declining consumer expenditure, or external factors, such as changes in exchange rates.
Both ESAB and Howden have improved their operating efficiencies and the geographic spread of their businesses, each of which should assist in protecting their overall profitability even if an economic recession were to lead to falling sales volumes and product prices in a particular country or region.
In response to the recent high demand for its products globally, Howden has increased its capacity principally through the extensive use of sub-contractors.
In the event that market conditions change, Howden should be able to reduce this capacity without incurring significant costs.
ESAB has moved large amounts of its manufacturing capacity to low cost areas.
Actions of competitors ESAB and Howden both operate in competitive markets and are exposed to market behaviour such as aggressive pricing by a low cost manufacturer looking to enter a new market.
As set out in the business and financial review, both businesses have established strong market positions through technological leadership, strong brands and through providing cost-effective solutions to their customers needs.
These positions are being maintained through measures such as continued expenditure on research and development, the lean manufacturing initiative and customer service.
30 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 Competitor action may result initially in reductions in profit, although these are more likely to be specific to particular product areas or geographies.
The businesses strong market positions will assist them in maintaining their longer term performance.
Foreign exchange: transaction risk Transaction risk arises from product being manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another.
In ESAB, manufacturing tends to be relatively close to the end-user, which naturally reduces currency exposures.
The principal exposures which arise do so on account of manufacturing of product in Central Europe and Sweden which is exported to the euro-zone.
ESABs policy is not to hedge currency exposures unless they relate to a significant specific contract, as customer prices, particularly for consumables, are generally able to be changed at relatively short notice to reflect cost changes.
In relation to Howden, exposure is principally in relation to the US dollar and pegged currencies such as the Chinese yuan.
Howden substantially covers forward its committed trading exposures.
Foreign exchange: translation risk Translation risk arises from the profits and net assets of non-UK businesses being translated into a sterling value which depends upon the exchange rate.
Apart from Howdens operations in Scotland and Northern Ireland, ESABs head office and its own headquarters, Charter has minimal operations in the UK.
The largest single profit translation exposures are in relation to the US dollar and the euro.
It is Charters policy not to hedge profit translation exposures: this may give rise to unexpected fluctuations in Charters reported profit.
The Company has significant investments in overseas operations: as a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the consolidated balance sheet.
In certain circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet exposures.
Gains and losses arising on such hedges are recognised as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes in equity until the items being hedged have impacted on the income statement.
Litigation Charter, ESAB and Howden are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of their business.
Certain comments on current litigation are set out in the Chairmans statement and further details are contained in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Pension risk There are various post retirement benefit schemes in place within Charter, ESAB and Howden.
The assets held by the various schemes are invested by the trustees primarily in equities and bonds.
A level of contributions payable by the Company, ESAB and Howden into the schemes has been agreed with respective trustees.
The Companys liabilities in respect of retirement benefits are subject to movements in long-term interest rates and changes in life expectancy.
The Companys net retirement benefit obligation is also subject to movements in the value of assets held by the schemes, which are principally shares and bonds.
Future cash contributions by the Company to the schemes will also depend on other factors, such as the outcome of negotiations with the pension trustees and changes in legislation.
Raw material prices Most products manufactured by ESAB and Howden contain steel or other metals whose prices are determined on world markets and can fluctuate significantly.
This risk is addressed by the use of long-term contracts with suppliers where available and appropriate and, subject to market conditions and other factors, the passing through to customers of increases in underlying costs.
Internal controls Charter has in place a system of internal controls covering its own activities and those of ESAB and Howden.
These controls are essential for the effective management of such geographically diverse businesses.
The Companys Audit Committee has been delegated formal responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
A failure of the system of internal controls could have a material impact on the Company.
