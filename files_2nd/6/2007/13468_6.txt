Following a company wide strategic review of the combined Rio Tinto and Alcan assets, on 26 November 2007 the intention to divest the Engineered Products business was also announced.
INTEGRATION OF ALCAN Rio Tintos offer for Alcan on 12 July 2007 aimed at after tax synergies of US$600 million per annum by the end of 2009.
Within the parameters of relevant takeover regulations, intensive and cooperative integration efforts were made between 12 July and 23 November 2007 which resulted in an increase in the targeted after tax synergies to US$940 million per annum by the end of 2009.
A rigorous and comprehensive integration plan is being progressively executed and is overseen by an Integration Steering Committee and an Integration Management Office.

associated lease liability, except where these are recognised as a consequence of business combinations.
Underlying earnings On creation of a closure provision, for instance, there is no effect The Group presents Underlying earnings as an additional measure on accounting or taxable profit because the cost is capitalised.
As a to provide greater understanding of the underlying business result, the initial recognition rules would appear to prevent the performance of its operations.
The adjustments made to net recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of the provision and of earnings to arrive at underlying earnings are explained above in the a deferred tax liability in respect of the related capitalised amount.
The temporary differences will reverse in future periods as the closure asset is depreciated and when tax deductible payments are made that are charged against the provision.
Paragraph 22 of IAS 12 extends the initial recognition rules to the reversal of temporary differences on assets and liabilities to which the initial recognition rules apply.
Therefore, deferred tax is not recognised on the changes in the carrying amount of the asset which result from depreciation or from the changes in the provision resulting from expenditure.
When tax relief on expenditure is received this will be credited to the income statement as part of the current tax charge.
The unwind of the discount applied in establishing the present value of the closure costs does affect accounting profit.
Therefore, this unwinding of discount results in the recognition of deferred tax assets.
The application of this initial recognition exemption has given rise to diversity in practice: some companies do provide for deferred tax on closure cost provisions and the related capitalised amounts.
Deferred tax accounting on initial recognition is currently the subject of an IASB FASB convergence project which may at some future time require the Group to change this aspect of its deferred tax accounting policy.
If the Group were to provide for deferred tax on closure costs and finance leases under EU IFRS the benefit to underlying and net earnings would have been US$21 million 2006: US$9 million and to equity would have been US$185 million 2006: US$127 million.
US deferred tax potentially recoverable The Groups US tax group has alternative minimum tax credits and temporary differences that have the potential to reduce tax charges in future years.
These possible tax assets totalled US$182 million at 31 December 2007 2006: US162 million.
Of these, US$119 million were recognised as deferred tax assets 2006: US$97 million, leaving US$63 million 2006: US$65 million unrecognised, as recovery was not considered probable.
During 2006, updated projections of future taxable profits for the operations that form part of Rio Tintos US tax group resulted in the recognition of previously unrecognised possible tax assets of $335 million.
Recoveries are dependent on future commodity prices, costs, financing arrangements and business developments in future years.
During 2007, principally as a result of high commodity prices, US$170 million of these possible tax assets were utilised 2006: US$140 million.
Exploration Under the Groups accounting policy, exploration and evaluation expenditure is not capitalised until the point is reached at which there is a high degree of confidence in the projects viability and it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
The carrying values of exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed twice per annum by management and the results of these reviews are reported to the Audit committee.
