Financial review The following review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes on pages 88 to 181 of this Annual Report.
Overview Shire plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as either Shire or the Group has the strategic goal to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician.
Shire focuses its business on ADHD, human genetic therapies HGT, gastrointestinal GI and renal diseases.
The structure is sufficiently flexible to allow Shire to target new therapeutic areas to the extent opportunities arise through acquisitions.
Shires inlicensing, merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection either in the US or Europe.
Shire believes that a carefully selected portfolio of products with relatively small-scale sales forces will deliver strong results.
On April 19, 2007 consistent with its stated focus on the growing ADHD market, Shire completed the acquisition of New River Pharmaceuticals Inc. New River allowing Shire full ownership and control of VYVANSE.
Substantially all of the Groups revenues, expenditures, operating profits or losses and net assets are attributable to the research and development R&D, manufacture, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two operating segments: Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT.
Revenues are derived primarily from two sources - sales of the Groups own products and royalties where Shire has out-licensed products to third parties : 89% 2006: 85% of total revenues are derived from product sales, of which 76% 2006: 77% is within the Specialty Pharmaceuticals segment and 13% 2006: 8% is within Human Genetic Therapies segment: and 10% of total revenues are derived from royalties 2006: 14%.
Shires strategic objectives are set using a balanced scorecard approach.
Objectives are also set at the business, functional and therapeutic area levels and are aligned with the Groupwide strategic and operational objectives.
The Group therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management.
Key performance indicators KPIs are used to measure achievement of the objectives.
Strategic objectives are categorized into fields - financial, customers, people & capabilities and operational excellence.
For 2007, Shires corporate objectives included: defined levels of revenue growth: target sales and contributions for core products: execution of defined therapeutic area strategic and operational plans: drug application filing and launch targets for new products: product in-licensing targets: expand Shires geographic presence in key emerging markets: completion of out-licensing projects: implementation of an effective leadership development program: and maintenance of robust risk management practices including internal controls.
The markets in which the Group conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated.
The health care industry is experiencing: pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs: increased R&D costs as development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators: challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers: low cost generic drugs entering the market on expiration of patent protection: and higher marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns and competition for market share.
Shires strategy to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry-wide competitive pressures.
This strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas: 7 Financial review continued Markets Historically, Shires portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the North American market.
With the acquisition of Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. TKT in 2005, Shire substantially increased its presence in Europe and thereby diversified the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market.
Through the TKT acquisition, Shire acquired ELAPRASE global rights, REPLAGAL which is presently sold only outside the US and DYNEPO to which the Group has exclusive marketing rights outside the US.
In addition, 2007 saw the European launches of MEZAVANT and the continued roll out of XAGRID and FOSRENOL in Europe.
For 2007, sales outside North America represented approximately 24% of total net product sales 2006: 21% and Shire expects this upward trend to continue in 2008.
Shires late stage development pipeline contains a number of products with rights outside of the US, including VYVANSE, DAYTRANA, Velaglucerase alfa acquired as part of the TKT acquisition, SPD550, PLICERA and AMIGAL.
Shires continued expansion in Europe will be driven by the development of products with patent protection in both the North American and European markets wherever possible.
Europe should see: the continued roll out of MEZAVANT: and the launch of DAYTRANA.
In 2008 and 2009, the US should see: the launch of VYVANSE for adult patients: the launch of INTUNIV: and the launch of FOSRENOL in the stage 4 CKD market.
This program of new product launches will require significant investment in advertising, promotional spend and in some cases, additional sales representatives leading to an increase in overall selling, general and administrative SG&A costs for 2008, although SG&A costs are expected to fall as a proportion of product sales.
The specialist nature of HGT products means that relatively low SG&A and sales infrastructure investment is required, making them ideal products for Shire to launch into new markets.
Shire will continue to consider launching products in new markets where entry barriers are low.
In markets outside North America and Europe where products require significant SG&A and infrastructure investment, Shire will continue to seek out-licensing partners.
In 2007 both REPLAGAL and ELAPRASE were launched in Japan, in partnership with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd. and Genzyme Corporation, respectively.
R&D Over the last four years Shire has focused its R&D efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas, which meet the needs of the specialist physician.
The Group has also concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for its later-stage pipeline products within its core therapeutic areas.
Evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the Groups development pipeline over the last four years.
Since January 2004, eight products have received regulatory approval in the US including DAYTRANA and ELAPRASE in 2006, LIALDA in January 2007 and VYVANSE in February 2007 and four in Europe including ELAPRASE and MEZAVANT in January 2007, the Group has another three products in registration in the US including VYVANSE for adult patients and INTUNIV and DAYTRANA in registration in the EU and Canada.
Shires strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile.
Shires acquisition of TKT was driven, in part, by the comparatively low risk of developing protein replacement therapies for genetic disease compared to other drug discovery approaches.
R&D costs in 2008 will include expenditure on Phase 3 b and Phase 4 studies to support recently launched products in the Specialty Pharmaceutical business, and the development of new projects in both the Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT businesses.
8 Financial review continued Patents and Market Exclusivity The loss or expiration of patent protection or market exclusivity with respect to any of the Groups major products could have a material adverse effect on future revenues and net income as generic manufacturers may produce similar drugs and generally be able to sell the Groups drugs at a lower price as their costs of development are significantly lower than Shires.
The Group anticipates that there will be one or more generic competitors of ADDERALL XR in the ADHD market beginning April 2009.
ADDERALL XR is, in revenue terms, Shires most significant product representing 42% of total revenues 2006: 48%.
The Group expects that sales of VYVANSE will partially offset any decline in sales of ADDERALL XR and that VYVANSE prescriptions will come from a number of sources, including patients who are new to ADHD treatment, patients who previously were taking ADDERALL XR, and patients who were taking another ADHD medication.
However, there is a risk that the Group may not be able to transition patients successfully from ADDERALL XR or other ADHD medications to VYVANSE.
Shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its ADDERALL XR patents and the patents for certain other products.
These are discussed in more detail in Note 36.
In consequence of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or market exclusivity, Shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in-licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long-term patent protection and market exclusivity.
Business Development The Group remains active in seeking out opportunities to acquire new products or companies that fit its business strategy, its existing therapeutic areas or are in complementary therapeutic areas.
During 2007 Shire: acquired New River, allowing the Group to capture the full economic value of VYVANSE, and gain control of the future development and commercialization of this product: and in-licensed rights to JUVISTA worldwide with the exception of EU member states : rights to AMIGAL, PLICERA and AT2220, three Pharmacological chaperone compounds for Lysosomal Storage Disorders LSDs in markets outside the US: SPD550 for GI disorders in markets outside the US and Japan: and exclusive development rights to SPD487 ATS for ADHD.
As part of its strategy of focusing on drugs with long term patent protection in its core therapeutic areas, the Group continued its disposal program of non-core assets, including in 2007: the sale of a portfolio of products, including SOLARAZE and VANIQA to Almirall: and the sale of EQUETRO and transfer of all post approval study commitments to Validus Pharmaceuticals Inc. Shire also licensed its residual rights for the US and Canada for the investigational HIV compound, SPD754 also known as apricitabine, to the Australian biotechnology company Avexa Limited Avexa on January 23, 2007.
Product Highlights VYVANSE Approved by the FDA for use in the pediatric population in February 2007 and launched in the US in July 2007 dosage strengths 30mg, 50mg and 70mg.
On December 10, 2007 the FDA approved three additional dosage strengths 20mg, 40mg and 60mg which will be available in retail pharmacies in the US in the second quarter of 2008.
These additional strengths are designed to increase dosing flexibility.
9 Financial review continued By March 7, 2008 VYVANSE had achieved a US ADHD market share of 6.5%.
o Launch tracking in line with other blockbuster Central Nervous System drug launches.
o Over 50% 23,000 of high volume physicians prescribing.
o Coupons are now less than 15% total prescriptions.
DAYTRANA Sales for 2007 were up 156% to $64.2 million 2006: $25.1 million.
On January 9, 2008 the FDA issued a Warning Letter to Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. Noven which related to Novens manufacture of DAYTRANA.
Further regulatory action could result if FDAs concerns are not satisfied fully.
Noven submitted a response to the FDA on January 30, 2008 and the FDA responded on March 14, 2008 indicating that Novens responses appear to be satisfactory.
It is expected that the FDA will perform a follow-up FDA inspection of Novens manufacturing plant to ensure compliance.
LIALDA MEZAVANT LIALDA the only once-daily oral formulation of mesalamine was approved by the FDA in January 2007 and launched in the US in March 2007, acquiring 8.0% share of the US oral mesalamine market at December 31, 2007.
Shires share of the US oral mesalamine market from LIALDA and PENTASA combined was 26.0% at February 8, 2008.
The product was launched in the UK in November 2007 as MEZAVANT XL, with further launches planned in the EU in 2008.
It was launched in Canada on January 28, 2008 as MEZAVANT.
FOSRENOL International launches continued and FOSRENOL is now available in 25 countries with worldwide sales of $102.2 million in 2007 2006: $44.8 million.
DYNEPO DYNEPO is the first and only  agent produced in a human cell line.
The product has been launched in several EU countries and sales for 2007 were $14.2 million.
ELAPRASE On February 11, 2008 ELAPRASE was approved for commercial sale by the Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk.
ELAPRASE is now approved in 38 countries worldwide and sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $181.8 million 2006: $23.6 million.
In October 2007 ELAPRASE was launched in Japan, with sales and distribution managed by Genzyme Corporation.
Shire's gross profit on the arrangement equates to an effective royalty of approximately 25% to 30%, but revenues will be recorded in product sales.
REPLAGAL REPLAGAL is now approved in 41 countries and sales for 2007 were up 22% to $143.9 million 2006: $117.7 million.
10 Financial review continued In February 2007 REPLAGAL was approved and launched in Japan through Shires partner Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd.
Similar to ELAPRASE Shire will recognize revenues into product sales.
Pipeline highlights Shire has expanded its product pipeline by in-licensing the following drug compounds and technologies in 2007: JUVISTA o In August 2007 Shire acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize JUVISTA worldwide with the exception of EU member states from Renovo Limited Renovo.
JUVISTA, being investigated for the reduction of scarring in connection with surgery, is in late Phase 2 development.
o Nine Phase 2 efficacy trials for JUVISTA have now been reported of which seven demonstrated statistically significant efficacy.
Phase 2 clinical trials in multiple other surgery types are ongoing and are expected to report during 2008 and 2009.
Pharmacological chaperone compounds for Lysosomal Storage Disorders LSDs - In November 2007 Shire in-licensed from Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Amicus the rights to three compounds in markets outside the US: o AMIGAL for Fabry disease Phase 2 has been granted orphan drug status by both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency EMEA, providing it with up to 7 years and 10 years market exclusivity in the US and EU, respectively.
o PLICERA for Gaucher disease Phase 2 has been granted orphan drug status by both the FDA and the EMEA, providing it with up to 7 years and 10 years market exclusivity in the US and EU, respectively.
o AT2220 for Pompe disease is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials.
SPD550 for GI disorders - In December 2007 Shire licensed rights to SPD550 also known as AT- 1001, in markets outside of the US and Japan, from Alba Therapeutics Corporation Alba.
SPD550 is Albas lead inhibitor of barrier dysfunction in various GI disorders and is currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of Celiac disease.
SPD487 Amphetamine transdermal system ATS - ADHD - In June 2007 Shire acquired exclusive development rights to ATS following completion of early development work by Noven.
During 2007 Shire paid $147.8 million recorded as intangible assets for the in-licensing of the above products comprising $75.0 million to Renovo, $50.0 million to Amicus, $16.4 million to Alba and $6.4 million to Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. Shire also made a $50.0 million equity investment in Renovo Group plc.
Existing pipeline developments: VYVANSE for ADHD in adult patients o In September 2007, the FDA accepted the filing of a supplemental New Drug Application for VYVANSE for the treatment of ADHD in adult patients.
The Prescriptions Drug User Fee Act PDUFA action date is April 28, 2008. o On October 25, 2007 Shire released results from the Phase 3 clinical trials in adults.
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-week study with dose escalation in 414 adults aged 18 to 11 Financial review continued 55 years, treatment with VYVANSE at all doses studied 30mg, 50mg, 70mg was significantly more effective than placebo.
o Adults represent the fastest growing and potentially the largest segment of the ADHD market with a total of 9.9 million patients of which 7.5 million are untreated.
DAYTRANA ADHD - Regulatory submissions were filed for approval of the product with Health Canada on November 29, 2007 and with the Netherlands, as a reference state for approval in the EU via the decentralized procedure, in December 19, 2007.
The preliminary assessment report is expected on or about April 10, 2008.
INTUNIV previously known as SPD503 - ADHD - A non-stimulant non-scheduled'' compound for the treatment of ADHD.
In June 2007 Shire received an approvable letter from the FDA for INTUNIV.
Shire is in discussions with the FDA regarding additional clinical work which is designed to enhance the label.
While the precise timing of the approval of INTUNIV is unknown, we now anticipate that launch will occur in H2 2009.
SPD465 ADHD In May 2007 Shire received an approvable letter from the FDA.
Shire is not currently taking any steps to move this product towards approval.
On October 16, 2007 the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee recommended the use of phosphate binders, including FOSRENOL, to treat hyperphosphatemia in CKD stage 4 patients.
Shire is working closely with the FDA to explore the regulatory pathway to approval for use in pre-dialysis patients.
LIALDA MEZAVANT Phase 3 worldwide clinical trials investigating the use of the product for the treatment of diverticulitis, a colonic disease, were initiated in 2007.
ELAPRASE for Hunter syndrome patients with significant central nervous system symptoms In December 2007 Shire completed all pre-clinical work and filed an Investigational New Drug IND application.
The IND was accepted by the FDA on January 23, 2008.
Velaglucerase alfa - Gaucher disease A worldwide Phase 3 clinical program was initiated in 2007 and is ongoing.
It is anticipated that this development program will support filing of Velaglucerase alfa from H2 2009.
Whilst a number of preclinical products are underway in early stage development, Shire has discontinued the following projects: SPD491 a platelet lowering agent, SPD493 formerly known as Valrocemide, SPD500 Tissue protective cytokine technology and NRP290 a pain product acquired with the New River acquisition.
Business Highlights SPD754 Apricitabine HIV Shire licensed its residual rights for the US and Canada for the investigational HIV compound to Avexa on January 23, 2007.
In return Shire received an upfront cash payment of $10 million and Avexa shares valued at approximately $3 million.
In April 2007 Shire completed the acquisition of New River by way of a short-form merger for $64 per share, or approximately $2.6 billion, partly funded by a private equity placing of $0.9 billion in February 2007.
In May 2007 Shire issued $1.1 billion principal amount of convertible bonds due 2014.
The proceeds of the bonds were used by Shire to repay borrowings under its bank facilities previously drawn to partially fund the acquisition of New River.
Product divestments in December 2007 Shire completed the sale of a portfolio of non-core products, including SOLARAZE and VANIQA to Laboratorios Almirall S. A. Almirall for a cash consideration of $209.6 million, net of $2.2 million of costs associated with the transfer of product rights.
During 12 Financial review continued the year Shire also received cash consideration of $24.8 million from the sale of other non-core products.
Legal settlements o In October 2007, all parties to the 2003 TKT class action securities lawsuit relating to REPLAGAL reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter, subject to court approval, for $50.0 million.
Shire will contribute $27.0 million toward the settlement recognized within SG&A costs and its insurance companies will contribute the remaining $23.0 million.
o In November 2007 Shire agreed to pay Applied Research Systems Holding N. V and Serono S. A. Serono $12.0 million for a fully-paid, worldwide, non-exclusive license to Serono's patents related to gene-activation, including the US Patent No.
Seronos infringement suit against the Group in the Massachusettss District Court was subsequently dismissed.
Results of operations under IFRS For the year to December 31, 2007 the Groups total revenues increased by 36% to $2,436.3 million, compared to $1,796.5 million in 2006.
Net income for the year to December 31, 2007 was $82.4 million compared to $56.2 million in 2006.
The results for 2007 include impairment charges in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets totaling $390.5 million 2006: $273.0 million and gains on the sale of product rights of $102.9 million 2006: $63.0 million.

The source of this data is IMS Health, December 2007.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals ADDERALL XR - ADHD As a result of the launch of VYVANSE in July 2007 ADDERALL XRs average share of the US ADHD market for 2007 fell to 25.5% 2006: 26.1%.
US prescriptions for ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2007 increased by 3% compared to the same period in 2006 due to a 6% growth in the US ADHD market offset by the 0.6% fall in average market share.
Sales of ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2007 were $1,030.9 million, an increase of 19% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $863.6 million.
Product sales growth was higher than prescription growth due primarily to price increases in January and October 2007.
14 Financial review continued As previously disclosed, the United States Federal Trade Commission FTC informed Shire on October 3, 2006 that it was reviewing the ADDERALL XR patent litigation settlement agreement between Shire and Barr.
On June 22, 2007, the Group received a civil investigative demand requesting that it provides information to the FTC relating to its settlement with Barr and its earlier settlement with Impax Laboratories, Inc. Shire Group is cooperating fully with this investigation and believes that the settlements are in compliance with all applicable laws.
Patent litigation proceedings relating to ADDERALL XR are on-going.
See Note 36 for further detail.
VYVANSE - ADHD VYVANSE was launched in the US market in July 2007 and at December 31, 2007 its market share had reached 5.2% average annual market share 1.8%.
Product sales of $76.5 million for the year to December 31, 2007 were net of $42 million sales deductions, primarily coupons, wholesaler discounts and rebates, which are expected over time to be approximately 28% of product sales before sales deductions.
All initial launch stocks of VYVANSE totaling $57.8 million were recognized into revenue during the year to December 31, 2007.
DAYTRANA - ADHD Product sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $64.2 million 2006: $25.1 million.
DAYTRANAs average share of the US ADHD market increased to 2.1% in 2007 compared to 0.8% in 2006 DAYTRANA was launched in June 2006.
US prescriptions of DAYTRANA for the year to December 31, 2007 over 2006 benefited from a full year of demand, 6% growth in the US ADHD market and higher market share.
For the six month period to December 31, 2007 prescriptions of DAYTRANA were up 31% compared to the same period in 2006.
During September 2007 Shire announced a voluntary market withdrawal of a limited quantity of DAYTRANA patches following feedback from patients and caregivers who had experienced difficulty in removing the release liner.
Patches are now being manufactured using an enhanced process, which Shire believes offers improved ease of use when peeling off the release liner.
On January 9, 2008 the FDA issued a warning letter to Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. Noven, which related to Novens manufacture of DAYTRANA.
Further regulatory action could result if the FDAs concerns are not satisfied fully.
Noven submitted a response to the FDA on January 30, 2008.
The addition of VYVANSE combined with ADDERALL XR and DAYTRANAs market share helped Shire grow its total share of the US ADHD market to 31.1% at December 31, 2007 compared to 28.0% at December 31, 2006.
Shire has the leading portfolio of products in the US ADHD market.
PENTASA Ulcerative colitis US prescriptions of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2007 were up 3% compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to a 4% increase in the US oral mesalamine prescription market, offset by a 0.1% decrease in PENTASAs average market share from 17.3% in 2006 to 17.2% in 2007.
Sales of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2007 were $176.4 million, an increase of 28% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $137.8 million.
Sales growth is higher than prescription growth primarily due to restocking to normal levels in 2007 and the impact of price increases in November 2006 and August 2007.
LIALDA MEZAVANT Ulcerative colitis Shire launched LIALDA in the US oral mesalamine market in March 2007, and by December 31, 2007 LIALDA had reached a market share of 8.0% average annual market share 3.9%.
LIALDAs product sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $50.5 million.
All initial launch stocks of LIALDA totaling $34.3 million were recognized into revenue during the year to December 31, 2007.
The product was launched in the UK in November 2007, Canada in January 2008 and further launches are planned in the EU during 2008, subject to the successful conclusion of pricing and reimbursement negotiations.
In the UK and Ireland the product will be called MEZAVANT XL and Shire plans to market the product in most other EU countries as MEZAVANT.
15 Financial review continued Since the launch of LIALDA in March 2007, PENTASA and LIALDAs combined share of the US oral mesalamine prescription market had grown to 24.9% as at December 31, 2007, up from 17.6% as at December 31, 2006.
FOSRENOL - Hyperphosphatemia FOSRENOL has now been launched in 25 countries and global sales totaled $102.2 million for the year to December 31, 2007 2006: $44.8 million.
Outside the US, FOSRENOL has now been launched in Germany, France, UK, Italy and Spain in January 2008 and a number of other countries.
Sales of FOSRENOL outside the US for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $40.1 million compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $4.6 million.
US sales of FOSRENOL for the year to December 31, 2007 were up 54% to $62.1 million compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $40.2 million.
FOSRENOLs average market share of the US phosphate binder market increased from 8.5% in 2006 to 8.6% in 2007.
The increase in product sales is due to a small wholesaler stocking increase in 2007 compared to significant wholesaler fide-stocking of initial launch stocks in 2006, the continued shift to the 1 gram strength tablet launched in 2006, partially offset by higher sales deductions in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 relating to a one-off provision made in 2007 for returns of the 750 gram dose.
DYNEPO Anemia associated with CKD DYNEPO was launched in March 2007 in Germany and later in the year in the UK, France, Italy and Ireland with sales for 2007 reaching $14.2 million.
CARBATROL - Epilepsy US prescriptions for CARBATROL for the year to December 31, 2007 were down 5% compared to the same period in 2006.
This was primarily due to a comparable decline in the US extended release carbamazepine prescription market: CARBATROLs average market share remained constant.
Sales of CARBATROL for the year to December 31, 2007 were $72.3 million, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $68.3 million.
Product sales increased despite the decrease in prescriptions, due to a sales price increase in April 2007 and restocking to normal levels, partially offset by higher sales deductions.
Patent litigation proceedings relating to CARBATROL are ongoing.
See Note 36 fore further detail.
XAGRID - Thrombocythemia Sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $66.8 million, an increase of 25% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $53.3 million.
Expressed in transaction currencies XAGRID is primarily sold in Euros and Pounds sterling, sales increased by 15% due to growth in many of Shires existing markets, with exchange rate movements against the US dollar accounting for the remaining 10% increase.
Human Genetic Therapies REPLAGAL Fabry disease Sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $143.9 million, an increase of 22% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $117.7 million.
Expressed in transaction currencies REPLAGAL is primarily sold in Euros and Pounds sterling sales increased by 13% due to higher unit sales in Europe and Canada and the continued roll out of REPLAGAL to new countries, including those in Latin America, with REPLAGAL now approved in 41 countries including Japan.
Exchange rate movements against the US dollar accounted for the remaining 9% increase in sales.
ELAPRASE Hunter syndrome Sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $181.8 million 2006: $23.6 million.
Sales growth in 2007 was driven primarily by a full year of sales in the US ELAPRASE was launched in the US in August 2006, sales in Europe ELAPRASE was launched in several European markets in the first half of 2007, and pre-approval sales in several Latin American markets.
ELAPRASE was approved for sale and marketing in Japan in October 2007 and is now approved for marketing and commercial distribution in 38 countries worldwide.
16 Financial review continued Foreign exchange effect Revenues reported in US dollars include the impact of translating sales made in local currency primarily Euros and Pounds sterling into US dollars.
The table below shows the effect of foreign exchange translations on the revenue growth of the key affected products as well as the underlying performance of those products in their local currency: 2007 sales Impact of growth in 2007 sales translation 2007 sales in local growth in to US US dollars currency US dollars dollars $M % % % XAGRID - sales in Euros 42.2 19 29 10 - sales in Pounds sterling 24.6 9 18 9 REPLAGAL - sales in Euros 82.5 7 17 10 - sales in Pounds sterling 25.2 14 24 10 CALCICHEW sales in Pounds sterling 48.8 10 19 9 REMINYL and REMINYL XL sales in 28.8 35 46 11 Pounds sterling Royalties Royalty revenue increased by 2% to $247.2 million for the year to December 31, 2007 2006: $242.9 million.
Excluding favorable foreign exchange movements of 4%, there has been a decline of 8% compared to the same period in 2006.
Shire receives royalties from GSK on worldwide 3TC sales.
GSKs worldwide sales of 3TC for the year to December 31, 2007 were $1,110 million, a decrease of 2% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $1,138 million, but a decrease of approximately 7% on a constant exchange rate basis.
While the nucleoside analogue market for HIV has continued to grow, competitive pressures such as new entrants to the market and products in competing markets have increased leading to a decline in 3TC sales.
In 2007 generic drug companies filed ANDAs seeking approval for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, ZEFFIX and EPZICOM in the US.
Pursuant to the GSK Shire license for lamivudine products, GSK has the right to 17 Financial review continued enforce the licensed patents.
In November 2007 GSK filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Teva in the US District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of one of the patents relating to COMBIVIR.
The patent, which covers the combination of AZT and lamivudine to treat HIV, expires in May 2012.
Teva had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Applications ANDA with the FDA with a certification of invalidity, unenforceability and non-infringement of that combination patent.
Teva did not challenge two other patents relating to COMBIVIR that expire in 2010 and 2016.
The case is in its early stages.
ZEFFIX Royalties from sales of ZEFFIX for the year to December 31, 2007 were $41.0 million, an increase of 18% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $34.8 million.
The impact of foreign exchange movements has contributed 8% to the reported growth: excluding favorable foreign exchange movements there has been an increase of 10% compared to the same period in 2006.
Shire receives royalties from GSK on worldwide ZEFFIX sales.
GSKs worldwide sales of ZEFFIX for the year to December 31, 2007 were $341 million, an increase of 13% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $301 million.
This increase was mainly due to strong growth in the Chinese market and favorable foreign exchange rate movements.
OTHER Other royalties are primarily in respect of REMINYL and REMINYL XL known as RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER in the US, a product marketed worldwide excluding the UK and the Republic of Ireland by Janssen Pharmaceutical N. V. Janssen, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson.
Shire has the exclusive marketing rights in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Barr and other companies have filed ANDA with the FDA for generic versions of RAZADYNE.
Janssen and Synaptech Inc. Synaptech have filed lawsuits against some of those ANDA filers.
A trial was held during the week of May 21, 2007.
No decision from the court has been issued to date.
Janssen and Synaptech filed lawsuits against Barr and Sandoz Inc. Sandoz for infringement of their patent rights relating to RAZADYNE ER as a result of Barr and Sandoz filing ANDAs with the FDA for generic versions of RAZADYNE ER.
No court dates have been set.
Cost of sales For the year to December 31, 2007 the cost of sales was 14% of product sales 2006: 16%.
The cost of sales for REPLAGAL in 2006 included a $47.0 million 3% of product sales adjustment in respect of inventories acquired through the acquisition of TKT.
Excluding the impact of this fair value adjustment, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales in 2006 was 13% in 2006.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales in 2007 over 2006 was primarily due to a shift in product mix resulting from increased sales of launched products, which had lower margins than existing products, and the write-off of inventory following the voluntary market withdrawal of a limited quantity of DAYTRANA patches.
For the year to December 31, 2007 cost of sales included a charge of $5.3 million for share based compensation 2006: $2.0 million which included a $2.1 million cumulative catch up charge 2006: $nil in respect of the 2005 option awards, for further information see SG&A below.
Research and development R&D expenditure increased to $775.2 million for the year to December 31, 2007 36% of product sales, up from $295.8 million in the year to December 31, 2006 19% of product sales.
The increase in R&D expenditure during the year to December 31, 2007 primarily relates to the following: i a non-cash charge of $100.0 million recognized on the effective settlement of Shires preexisting relationship with New River.
This charge represents the write-off of capitalized upfront and milestone payments made by Shire prior to the acquisition of New River.
This charge is presented within R&D as at the time of the New River acquisition VYVANSE, 18 Financial review continued although approved by the FDA, had not yet received the final scheduling classification from the Drug Enforcement Agency DEA and was therefore not available for commercial sale.
Further details in respect of this charge are included in Note 12 of the Financial Statements: and ii an intangible asset impairment charge for the year to December 31, 2007 of $256.4 million 2006: $nil of which $205.0 million 2006: $nil relates to capitalized in-process R&D IPR&D for DYNEPO primarily the oncology indication, as the Group considers it unlikely that it will pursue the indication for commercialization.
See Note 18 for further detail.
Excluding these intangible asset impairment charges of $256.4 million and the $100.0 million charge on the effective settlement of the pre-existing relationship with New River and the $256.4 million intangible asset impairment, R&D expenditure in the year to December 31, 2007 was $418.8 million or 19% of product sales 2006: $295.8 million an increase of $123.0 million.
The increase in R&D expenditure in 2007 was due to Phase 3 b and Phase 4 studies to support new product launches: the continuation of Phase 3 trials on velaglucerase alfa GA-GCB : the development of the Womens Health franchise and JUVISTA: the pre-clinical development of three HGT projects and the newly in-licensed products from Amicus and Alba.
For the year to December 31, 2007 R&D included a charge of $16.6 million 2006: $3.9 million for share based compensation which included a $4.6 million 2006: $nil cumulative catch up charge in respect of 2005 option awards, for further information see SG&A below.
Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses SG&A expenses increased from $1,219.9 million 79% of product sales in the year to December 31, 2006 to $1,381.1 million in 2007 64% of product sales, an increase of 13%, which is less than the product sales increase of 41%.

Excluding depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, SG&A costs increased by 26% to $1,041.4 million 2006: $829.4 million, and represented 48% of product sales 2006: 54%.
The increase in SG&A expenses was expected, with additional expenditure required for: An increase in the ADHD sales force to promote VYVANSE: The cost of the new GI sales force in the US: The advertising, promotional and marketing spend to support the launches of VYVANSE, LIALDA and ELAPRASE: and A net charge of $17.0 million in respect of legal settlements, being a charge of $27.0 million for settlement of the TKT purported securities fraud class action shareholder suit relating to 19 Financial review continued REPLAGAL, partially offset by a $10.0 million release of existing legal provisions 1% of product sales.
The depreciation charge within SG&A for the year to December 31, 2007 was $47.3 million 2006: $36.0 million, which in 2007 included property, plant and equipment write-downs of $1.8 million 2006: $0.5 million.
Amortization charges, including the amortization on acquired products, were $147.3 million for the year to December 31, 2007 2006: $81.5 million, the increased charge is primarily due to the amortization of DAYTRANA, ELAPRASE, DYNEPO and VYVANSE intangible assets following the product launches in June 2006, August 2006, March 2007 and July 2007 respectively.
Intangible asset impairment charges within SG&A for the year to December 31, 2007 were $0.4 million 2006: $1.1 million.
Impairment charges relating to goodwill for the year to December 31, 2007 were $133.7 million 2006: $271.9 million related to the goodwill arising on the acquisition of BioChem Pharma Inc. Depreciation, amortization and impairment charges also include an adjustment to goodwill of $11.0 million 2006: $nil in respect of the prior year acquisition of Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. For the year to December 31, 2007 SG&A included a charge of $51.7 million for share based compensation 2006: $14.6 million, which included a $22.5 million cumulative catch up charge 2006: $nil in respect of 2005 option awards.
The catch-up charge relates to options issued by Shire in 2005 under the 2000 Executive Scheme.
This charge arises as a result of the strong growth in revenue and profits as determined under US GAAP which the Group generated in the fourth quarter of 2007.
This growth has in turn caused the Group to revise its original assumptions on which the IFRS 2 charge was based.
Gain on sale of product rights For the year to December 31, 2007 Shire recognized gains of $102.9 million on the sale of non-core products.
Shire received $209.6 million net of transaction costs of $2.2 million from Almirall for a portfolio of noncore products comprising the dermatology products SOLARAZE and VANIQA and six non-promoted products across a range of indications which were sold by Shire primarily in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Ireland.
This sale will realize a total gain of $109.7 million, of which $89.9 million was recognized during Q4 2007.
The remaining gain of $19.8 million will be recognized in 2008 when the relevant consents are obtained.
Shire received $24.8 million on the sale of other non-core products, realizing a total gain of $17.2 million, of which $13.0 million was recognized during 2007.
The remaining deferred gain of $4.2 million relating to these disposals is expected to be recognized in 2008 on the transfer of marketing authorizations.
During the year to December 31, 2006 Shire recognized a gain of $63.0 million on the disposal of ADDERALL to Duramed.
Investment revenues For the year to December 31, 2007 Shire received investment revenues of $50.6 million 2006: $50.5 million.
Investment revenues primarily relate to interest received on cash balances.
Included in 2006 was interest of $6.5 million received from IDB Biomedical Inc. IDB on repayment of injectable flu development drawings arising on the disposal of the vaccines business in 2004.
Excluding this one-off item, investment revenues in 2007 are higher than in 2006 due to slightly higher average cash balances and higher average US Dollar interest rates.
Finance costs For the year to December 31, 2007 the Group incurred finance costs of $93.1 million 2006: $27.0 million.
The increase in finance costs in 2007 from 2006 follows the acquisition of New River which was partly funded by $1.3 billion of term loans, utilized under Shires $2.3 billion banking facility see Note 22.
These term loans were subsequently partially repaid using the proceeds from Shires 2.75% convertible bond issued in May 2007.
The remaining $200 million of the term loans was also repaid 20 Financial review continued during the year to December 31, 2007.
Finance costs for the year to December 31, 2007 included an $11.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs following the repayment of these term loans.
Finance costs relating to the convertible bonds, representing interest expense based upon the stated coupon of the bonds, amortized discount and issue costs totaled $43.6 million for the year to December 31, 2007.
In the years to December 31, 2007 and 2006 finance costs included a provision for interest, which may be awarded by the Court in respect of amounts due to those ex-TKT shareholders who have requested appraisal of the acquisition consideration payable for their TKT shares.
A trial date for the appraisal rights litigation has been set for May 12, 2008.
Further information on this litigation is included in Note 36.

See Note 22 for further details.
Share of post tax profit from associates and joint ventures The Groups share of profit from its associates and joint ventures totaled $1.8 million for the year to December 31, 2007 2006: $5.8 million.
This comprised earnings of $6.5 million from the 50% share of the anti-viral commercialization partnership with GSK in Canada 2006: $6.2 million, offset by losses of $4.7 million being the Groups share of losses in the GeneChem, AgeChem and EGS Healthcare Funds 2006: losses of $0.5 million.
Taxation The effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2007 was -162% 2006: 88%.
In 2007 and 2006 the Group recorded impairment charges in respect of goodwill relating to the acquisition of BioChem Pharma Inc. of $133.7 million 2006: $271.9 million : no tax deduction is available on this goodwill impairment.
Excluding the goodwill impairment the effective tax rate is -31%, 2006: 28%.
This negative tax rate in the year to December 31, 2007 of 31% has resulted from the release of deferred tax liabilities following other intangible asset impairment charges recognized in 2007 and the variation in the mix of profits from the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Additionally, the tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 has benefited from a reduced charge in respect of tax contingencies of $34.0 million 2006: $187.0 million and an increase in favorable permanent differences, relating to R&D tax credits and the tax effect of the gain on disposal of product rights.
These benefits were partially offset by the adverse impact of the movement in deferred taxes not recognized of $7.0 million 2006: $91.0 million favorable.
A full reconciliation of the effective tax rate for 2007 to the UK statutory tax rate of 30% is given in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
21 Financial review continued Discontinued operations During the year to December 31, 2006 the gain on disposal of discontinued operations totaled $40.6 million.
During 2006, ID Biomedical Corporation IDB repaid $70.6 million, being the injectable flu development tranche of the $100.0 million development loan facility provided to IDB as part of their acquisition of Shires vaccine business.
The repayment followed GSKs acquisition of IDB, after which IDB was provided with resources by GSK to fund the early repayment of the injectable flu tranche.
The $29.4 million pipeline development tranche of the loan facility is still outstanding.
At the time of the disposal, a provision of $70.0 million was charged to discontinued operations on the basis that there was no certainty of recovery of this amount.
The $70.0 million provision was allocated against all of the pipeline development tranche $29.4 million and against $40.6 million of the $70.6 million injectable flu development tranche.
Accordingly, a gain on disposition of discontinued operations of $40.6 million 2005: $3.1 million was recognized on repayment of the loan by IDB.
The repayment of the $70.6 million injectable flu tranche had no tax effect.
Liquidity and capital resources General The Groups funding requirements depend on a number of factors, including its development programs: corporate, business and product acquisitions: the level of resources required for the expansion of manufacturing and marketing capabilities as the product base expands: increases in accounts receivable and inventory which may arise as sales levels increase: competitive and technological developments: the timing and cost of obtaining required regulatory approvals for new products: the timing and quantum of milestone payments on collaborative projects: the timing and quantum of tax and dividend payments: the timing and quantum of purchases of the Companys shares in the market to satisfy option exercises and the continuing cash generated from sales of Shires key products.
An important part of Shires business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available.
The Group intends to defend its intellectual property and as a result may need cash for funding the cost of litigation.
The Group ordinarily finances its activities through cash generated from operating activities, credit facilities, private and public offerings of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals.
Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 On May 9, 2007 Shire plc issued $1,100 million in principal amount of 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 and convertible into fully paid ordinary shares of Shire plc of par value 0.05 each the Bonds.

The Bonds are repayable in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the Company to settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the Final Maturity Date and following exercise of the Put Option, by delivery of the underlying Shire plc ordinary shares and a cash top-up amount.
The Bonds are convertible into Shire plc ordinary shares during the conversion period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier of: i the close of business on the date falling fourteen days prior to the Final Maturity Date: ii if the Bonds have been called for redemption by the Company, the close of business fourteen days before the date fixed for redemption: iii the close of business on the day prior to a Bond holder giving notice of redemption in accordance with the conditions: and iv the giving of notice by the trustee that the Bonds are accelerated by reason of the occurrence of an event of default.
Upon conversion, the Bond holder is entitled to receive Shire plc ordinary shares at the initial conversion price of $33.5879 per Shire plc ordinary share, subject to adjustment as outlined below, being 2,977.26265 shares per $100,000 denomination.

The fair values of the liability component and the equity component were determined at issuance of the Bonds.
The fair value of the liability component $886.1 million was calculated using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond.
The residual amount of $195.6 million, representing the value of the equity conversion option, is included in shareholders equity as a separate reserve.
Multicurrency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement In connection with the acquisition of New River, Shire entered into a Multicurrency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement the Facilities Agreement with ABN AMRO Bank N. V. Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Limited and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc the Arrangers on February 20, 2007.
The Facilities Agreement comprised three credit facilities: i a committed multicurrency five year term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $1,000 million Term Loan A, ii a committed multicurrency 364 day term with a further 364 day extension option loan facility in an aggregate amount of $300 million Term Loan B and iii a committed five year revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount of $1,000 million the RCF and, together with Term Loan A and Term Loan B, the Facilities.
Shire plc has agreed to act as guarantor for any of its subsidiaries that borrow under the Facilities Agreement.
On April 18, 2007 Shire fully utilized Term Loan A of $1,000 million and Term Loan B of $300 million to partially fund the acquisition of New River.
In May 2007 Shire issued $1,100 million principal amount of the Bonds.
The proceeds of the issue were used to repay and cancel $800 million of Term Loan A and all of Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Facilities Agreement.
The remaining $200 million drawn down under Term Loan A was repaid on June 29, 2007.
The RCF has not been utilized.
On July 19, 2007 Shire entered into a syndication and amendment agreement in relation to the Facilities Agreement the Amended Facilities Agreement, which increased the RCF to an aggregate amount of $1,200 million, amended the covenant relating to the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA and syndicated the RCF.
The RCF, which includes a $250 million swingline facility, may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on February 20, 2012.
The availability of loans under the RCF is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of any defaults thereunder and the accuracy in all material respects of Shires representations and warranties contained therein.
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the RCF for each interest period, as determined by the Company, is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin initially set at 0.80 per cent per annum until delivery of the compliance certificate for the year ending December 31, 2007 and thereafter ranging from 0.40 to 0.80 per cent per annum, depending on the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA and LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period.
Shire also pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35 per cent per annum of the applicable margin.
23 Financial review continued The Amended Facilities Agreement includes requirements that i Shires ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as defined in the Amended Facilities Agreement does not exceed 3.5 to 1 for either the 12 month period ending December 31 or June 30 unless Shire has exercised its option which is subject to certain conditions to increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive testing dates: and ii that the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest as defined in the Facilities Agreement must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for either the 12 month period ending December 31 or June 30, and iii additional limitations on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness, making of loans, giving of guarantees and granting security over assets.
Upon a change of control of Shire plc or upon the occurrence of an event of default and the expiration of any applicable cure period, the total commitments under the Facilities may be canceled and or all or part of the loans, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding may become immediately due and payable.
Events of default under the Amended Facilities Agreement include: i non-payment of any amounts due under the Facilities: ii failure to satisfy any financial covenants: iii material misrepresentation in any of the finance documents: iv failure to pay, or certain other defaults under other financial indebtedness: v certain insolvency events or proceedings: vi material adverse changes in the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the group: vii certain US Employee Retirement Income Security Act breaches which would have a material adverse effect: viii if it becomes illegal for Shire or any of its subsidiaries that are parties to the Amended Facility Agreement to perform their obligations or ix if Shire or any subsidiary of Shire which is party to the Amended Facility Agreement repudiates the Amended Facility Agreement or any Finance Document as defined in the Amended Facility Agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Company paid $14.5 million for the arrangement of the Facilities of which $9.4 million has been amortized in the year to December 31, 2007 including $7.9 million written off following repayment of Term Loan A and Term Loan B.
The remaining arrangement costs of $5.1 million, which relate to the RCF, have been deferred and are being amortized over the estimated term of the facility $1.2 million within Trade and other receivables and $3.9 million within Other receivables non-current.
New River 3.5% Convertibles Subordinated Notes due 2013 During July 2006, New River issued $137.8 million of 3.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2013 the Notes.
Prior to the acquisition of New River during April 2007, the Notes were convertible according to their terms following the New River share price having exceeded predetermined levels.
Following Shires acquisition of New River, the Notes also became convertible as a result of the change of control of New River, entitling Note holders to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate if the Notes were tendered for conversion prior to May 17, 2007.
All of the outstanding Notes were tendered for conversion in the period between the acquisition date and May 17, 2007 and were settled at a value of $279.4 million which equates to the fair value of the Notes.
Equity financing On February 20, 2007 Shire plc raised $877.3 million net of associated issue costs through the private placement of 42.9 million new ordinary shares to certain institutional investors at a price of 1075 pence per share.
The newly issued shares represented approximately 8.4 per cent of Shire plc's issued ordinary share capital prior to the placing.
The terms of the issue were fixed on February 20, 2007 and the closing market price on that day was 1175 pence.
The funds were raised using a cash box structure, with the cash box being a company established specially for the purposes of the placing.
A cash box structure enabled the Company to obtain merger relief on the issue of the placing shares, which relieves the Company for the requirement to credit any amount paid up in excess of the nominal value of the share premium account.
The Company transferred the excess value net of issue costs of $873.0 million which is distributable from the merger reserve to retained earnings.
24 Financial review continued New River financing On April 19, 2007 Shire completed the acquisition of New River.
The total cost of the acquisition of approximately $2.6 billion was funded by: net proceeds of $877.3 million from the private placement, utilization of Term Loan A of $1,000 million and Term Loan B of $300 million, with the balance coming from Shires pre-acquisition cash resources.
Term Loan A and Term Loan B have subsequently been repaid from the issue proceeds of Shire plcs 2.75% Convertible bonds $1,100 million and Shires own cash resources $200 million.
Following Shire's acquisition of New River and the issue of the Bonds, the Group's liquidity profile has changed significantly.
Shire anticipates that its operating cash flow together with available cash and cash equivalents and the above mentioned RCF facility will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future operating expenses, the remaining costs associated with the acquisition of TKT, capital expenditures and debt service and lease obligations as they become due over the next twelve months.
In addition to the RCF the Group has uncommitted facilities totaling $21.9m which were unutilised as at 31 December 2007.
If the Group decides to acquire other businesses, it expects to fund these acquisitions from existing cash resources, the RCF discussed above and possibly through new borrowings and the issue of new equity, if necessary.
Sources and uses of cash The following table provides an analysis of the Groups gross and net debt cash funds excluding restricted cash as at December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 December 31, $M $M Cash and cash equivalents 762.5 1,126.9 Shire 2.75% Convertible bonds 910.2 - Finance lease liabilities 12.6 10.4 Total debt 922.8 10.4 Net debt cash funds 160.3 1,116.5 Cash flow activity Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to December 31, 2007 was $567.0 million, up $2.0 million 2006: $565.0 million.
During 2007 the Group increased operating cash flows before movements in working capital by $291.3 million over 2006.
However these increases were offset by increases to working capital, primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 over 2006, and the launch of VYVANSE, LIALDA and DYNEPO earlier in 2007 which is driving increases in accounts receivable and inventory.
Net cash used in investing activities was $2,556.1 million in the year to December 31, 2007, includes expenditure on the acquisition of New River of $2,458.6 million and associated acquisition expenses of $61.0 million: purchases of long term investments of $63.2 million which includes expenditure of $50.0 million on an equity investment in Renovo : purchases of property, plant and equipment of $93.7 million and purchases of intangible assets of $223.0 million.
These investing out flows were partially offset by $234.4 million received as proceeds deposits for the sale of certain product rights, interest received of $52.5 million and $55.8 million received on maturity of New Rivers short term investments.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment included $36.0 million on IT projects at the Wayne, Pennsylvania US headquarters: $10.7 million on IT at the Basingstoke, UK, headquarters: $8.2 million on construction work at Shires manufacturing facility at Owings Mills, Maryland: and $35.1 million and $3.7 million on leasehold improvements and IT equipment, respectively at Shires site in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
25 Financial review continued Capital expenditure on intangible assets included $75.0 million up-front payments to Renovo for JUVISTA, $50.0 million to Amicus for PLICERA, AMIGAL and AT2220, $50.0 million of sales milestones to Noven for DAYTRANA, $16.4 million to Alba for SPD550 and software purchases of $23.6 million, principally on IT projects at the Wayne, Pennsylvania headquarters.
Net cash used in investing activities was $54.5 million in the year to December 31, 2006.
This included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $68.7 million, intangibles of $173.6 million and long-term investments of $9.8 million respectively, offset by proceeds from sale of the ADDERALL product rights for $63.0 million, proceeds from loans repaid by IDB of $70.6 million and interest received on cash balances of $47.2 million.
Capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets included $8.0 million on building improvements and $8.2 million on IT at the Basingstoke, UK, headquarters: $9.9 million on construction work at Shires manufacturing facility at Owings Mills, Maryland: and $8.8 million and $12.0 on leasehold improvements and IT equipment, respectively at Shires site in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Capital expenditure on intangible assets included $50.0 million paid to Noven on the approval of DAYTRANA, $50 million paid to New River in respect of VYVANSE milestones, other product and milestone payments of $33.2 million and software purchases, principally $32.2 million on IT projects at the Wayne, Pennsylvania US headquarters.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,618.7 million for the year to December 31, 2007.
On April 18, 2007 the Group fully utilized Term Loan A of $1,000 million and Term Loan B of $300 million to partially fund the acquisition of New River, which, as described above, have subsequently been repaid in the period.
Shire incurred $14.5 million of arrangement costs in respect of these facilities in the year to December 31, 2007.
In May 2007 Shire issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014.
The net proceeds of the issue of the Bonds were $1.1 billion with associated issue costs of $18.3 million.
On February 20, 2007 Shire plc raised $877.3 million, net of associated costs, through the private placement of 42.9 million new ordinary shares to certain institutional investors at a price of 1075 pence per share.
In addition, Shire plc received $12.9 million from the exercise of warrants and $30.3 million from the exercise of stock options, made payments to acquire treasury stock of $186.0 million, paid a dividend of $41.3 million and made payments in respect of finance leases of $4.1 million.
Shire also paid $279.4 million to holders of New Rivers 3.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2013 and received $141.8 million from Merrill Lynch in settlement of a purchased call option entered into by New River prior to the acquisition in April 2007.
Net cash used in financing activities was $48.0 million for the year to December 31, 2006.
This was primarily due to the cost to purchase treasury shares of $92.0 million and dividend payments of $32.4 million, offset by inflows of $82.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options.
Outstanding letters of credit As at December 31, 2007, the Group had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the amount of $23.2 million, this includes a letter of credit with Barclays Bank plc in the amount of $14.2 million providing security on the recoverability of insurance claims and with Bank of America in the amount of $7.7 million, providing security on the payment of lease obligations.
26 Financial review continued Cash Requirements As at December 31, 2007, the Groups cash requirements for contractual obligations and long-term liabilities reflected on the Balance Sheet were as follows: Payments due by period Less than More than Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years $M $M $M $M $M i Long-term debt obligations 1,296.7 30.3 60.5 60.5 1,145.4 ii Finance Leases 12.6 4.7 7.9 - - iii Operating leases obligations 223.5 32.0 54.0 41.3 96.2 iv Purchase obligations 296.6 227.1 58.4 11.1 - Other long-term liabilities reflected v vi on the Balance Sheet 857.8 516.5 341.3 - - Total 2,687.2 810.6 522.1 112.9 1,241.6 i Shires $1,100 million principal amount of 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 issued in May 2007 and the interest on the convertible bonds has been included based on the contractual payment dates.
The principal amount of $1,100 million has been included within payments due in more than 5 years based on the Final Maturity Date of the convertible bonds.
The bondholders have the option to redeem the convertible bonds at the principal amount in May 2012 and the Group has the option to call the bonds subject to certain conditions after May 2012. ii The Group has entered into certain finance leases in respect of motor vehicles.
iii The Group leases certain land, facilities, and certain equipment under operating leases expiring through 2025. iv Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, investments or services including clinical trials, contract manufacturing and capital equipment that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
Shire expects to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations.
v The liability to dissenting shareholders is included within the payments due in less than one year.
As at December 31, 2007 the Group recorded a liability of $419.9 million based on the merger consideration of $37 per share for the 11.3 million shares outstanding at that time plus a provision for interest of $60.3 million that may be awarded by the Court.
For every $1 increase decrease in the merger consideration applicable to those TKT shareholders who have asserted appraisal rights, the total estimated purchase price would increase decrease by approximately $11.3 million vi The liability for tax contingencies and associated interest and penalties of $377.1 million is included within payments due in less than one year of $56.3 million and payments due in one to three years of $320.8 million.
The contractual obligations table above does not include payments yet to fall due upon the occurrence of certain milestones and other contractual commitments.
The most significant payments are as follows: i Alba Therapeutics Corporation On December 14, 2007 Shire acquired worldwide rights to SPD550 formerly known as AT-1001, in markets outside of the US and Japan, from Alba.
SPD550 is Albas lead inhibitor of barrier dysfunction in various gastrointestinal disorders that is currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of Celiac disease.
Shire paid an upfront license fee of $25.0 million of which $16.4 million has been capitalized as an intangible asset and $8.7 million expensed as R&D during 2007 and will pay further development and sales milestones up to a maximum of $300 million.
Shire will also pay tiered royalties on net sales of the product.
Tiered royalty rates will be single or double digit dependent on annual net sales.
Alba and Shire have formed a joint development committee to monitor R&D activities for SPD550.
Alba 27 Financial review continued will fund all development until SPD550 has completed Proof of Concept, which is expected to be in the first half of 2009, after which Shire and Alba will share equally development costs under a joint development plan.
ii Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. On November 7, 2007 Shire licensed from Amicus the rights to three pharmacological chaperone compounds in markets outside of the US: AMIGAL for Fabry disease Phase 2, PLICERA for Gaucher disease Phase 2 and AT2220 for Pompe disease Phase 1.
Shire paid Amicus an upfront license fee of $50.0 million capitalized as an intangible asset, and will pay further development and sales based milestones to a maximum of $390 million.
Shire will also pay tiered, double digit, royalties on net sales of the products.
Shire and Amicus will pursue a joint development program toward market approval in the US and Europe: expenses for this program will be shared equally.
iii JUVISTA On June 19, 2007 Shire signed an agreement with Renovo to develop and commercialize JUVISTA, Renovos novel drug candidate in late Phase 2 development.
JUVISTA is being studied for the reduction of scarring in connection with surgery.
Under the terms of the agreement Shire has the exclusive right to commercialize JUVISTA worldwide, with the exception of EU member states.
Following the expiration of the Hart Scott-Rodino HSR waiting period on August 10, 2007, Shire paid Renovo $75.0 million capitalized as an intangible asset and made an equity investment in Renovo of $50 million at a subscription price of 2 per share, representing 6.5% of Renovos share capital immediately after the issue.
In addition, Shire will pay Renovo $25 million on the filing of JUVISTA with the FDA: up to $150 million on FDA approval: royalties on net sales of JUVISTA: and up to $525 million on the achievement of very significant sales targets.
Shire will bear the cost of clinical trials designed specifically for obtaining US regulatory approval.
Renovo will bear the costs of clinical trials designed specifically for obtaining EU regulatory approval.
Shire and Renovo will share equally the costs of conducting global clinical trials that are designed for obtaining both US and EU regulatory approvals.
iv DAYTRANA In connection with the Groups acquisition in 2003 from Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Noven of the worldwide sales and marketing rights to DAYTRANA, Shire paid $50 million to Noven in the year to December 31, 2007 as a result of reaching sales milestones, of which $25 million was accrued at December 31, 2006.
These amounts have been capitalized within other intangible assets and will be amortized over approximately ten years.
Shire has a further obligation to pay Noven $25 million, contingent on future sales performance.
v Womens Health Products In September 2006 Shire and Duramed entered into an agreement pursuant to which it acquired rights to SEASONIQUE, another oral product and a number of products using Durameds transvaginal ring technology.
Shire has the right to market these products in a number of markets outside of North America, including the larger European markets.
Under this agreement, Shire will reimburse Duramed for US development expenses incurred going forward up to a maximum of $140 million over eight years from September 2006.
US development expenditure reimbursement for the year to December 31, 2007 totaled $15.9 million.
At December 31, 2007 the maximum future reimbursement for Duramed incurred US development expenditure was $121.6 million.
Shire is separately responsible for development costs in its licensed territories.
vi Other R&D and sales milestones In addition to the commitments set out in i to iv, at December 31, 2007 the Group had commitments payable on achievement of specified milestones and fees payable for products under development inlicensed from third parties of $5.3 million 2006: $75.6 million.
28 Financial review continued Business Risk Management The Group has adopted a risk management strategy designed to identify, assess and manage the significant risks that it faces.
While the Group aims to identify and manage such risks, no risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss.
Set out below are the key risk factors, associated with the business, that have been identified through the Groups approach to risk management.
Some of these risk factors are specific to the Group, and others are more generally applicable to the pharmaceutical industry in which the Group operates.
The Group considers that these risk factors apply equally and, therefore, these risks should all be carefully considered before any investment is made in the Company.
RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE GROUPS BUSINESS VYVANSE and the Groups other new products may not be a commercial success.
The commercial success of the Groups new products will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians, patients and other key decision-makers, as well as the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals, the scope of marketing approvals as reflected in the products label, the countries in which such approvals are obtained, the authorization of price and reimbursement in those countries where price and reimbursement is negotiated, and safety, efficacy, convenience and cost-effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products.
In particular, Shire anticipates that there will be one or more generic competitors of ADDERALL XR in the ADHD market beginning April 2009.
The Group may not be able to transition patients successfully from ADDERALL XR or other ADHD medications to VYVANSE, especially if any or all of the following occur: if physicians who are comfortable with an existing product are unwilling to prescribe a new product in its place: if patients who are comfortable with an existing product do not wish to take a new product in its place: if parents or caregivers who are comfortable with an existing product do not want their children to take a new product in its place: if third-party payers are unwilling to pay for a new product: if the sales and marketing efforts behind VYVANSE are not effective in positioning VYVANSE and differentiating it from ADDERALL XR: if the FDA approved label for VYVANSE is not seen as significantly differentiating VYVANSE from currently marketed treatments for ADHD: if competitive products are genericised and the impact on the market negatively affects the prescribing of branded treatments for ADHD: if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the product not seen in clinical trials that impact the physicians willingness to prescribe VYVANSE: if issues arise from clinical trials being conducted for post marketing purposes or for registration in another country or regulatory agencies in one country act in a way that causes concern for prescribers or patients in another country: or if the supply of amphetamine salts is restricted due to DEA quota restrictions or because of issues experienced in the supply chain by Shire or third party agents.
29 Financial review continued Further, if VYVANSE is not a commercial success, Shire will not experience the anticipated economic benefits from VYVANSE or from its acquisition of New River.
If the Group is unable to commercialize VYVANSE or any other new product successfully, there may be an adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
Any decrease in the combined sales of VYVANSE and ADDERALL XR will significantly reduce revenues and earnings In 2007, sales of VYVANSE and ADDERALL XR were $1,107.4 million, representing approximately 45% of the Group's revenues.
Any factors that decrease the combined sales of VYVANSE and ADDERALL XR could significantly reduce revenue and earnings and have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations.
These include: development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals, including generic versions of ADDERALL XR which the Group anticipates will be in the market from April 2009: issues impacting the production of VYVANSE or ADDERALL XR or the supply of amphetamine salts including but not limited to the ability to get sufficient quota from the DEA: technological advances including the approval of new competing products for ADHD treatments : loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent the Group's patents See Note 36 : changes in reimbursement policies of third-party payers: government action intervention: marketing or pricing actions by competitors: public opinion towards ADHD treatments: any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention: product liability claims: and changes in prescription-writing practices.
Any decrease in the sales of 3TC could significantly reduce earnings The Group receives royalties from GSK on the worldwide sales of 3TC.
In 2007, the Group's royalty income relating to 3TC sales was $145.3 million.
This income stream generates a larger proportion of net income relative to the Group's own product sales as there are minimal costs associated with this income.
Any factors that decrease sales of 3TC by GSK could significantly reduce the Group's earnings.
These include: development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals, including generic versions: loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents see Note 36 : reduction in the production of 3TC: technological advances: government action intervention: marketing or pricing actions by GSK's competitors: any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention: 30 Financial review continued public opinion towards AIDS treatments: and product liability claims.
The failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, or an adequate level of reimbursement, by third-party payers in a timely manner for certain of the Group's products may impact future revenues and earnings The Group's revenues are partly dependent on the level of reimbursement provided to the Group by governmental reimbursement schemes for pharmaceutical products.
Changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the Group's sales, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the cost of treatment established by health care providers, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations are under downward pressure and this, in turn, could impact on the prices at which the Group can sell its products.
The market for pharmaceutical products could be significantly influenced by the following, which could result in lower prices for the Group's products and or a reduced demand for the Group's products: the ongoing trend toward managed health care, particularly in the United States: legislative proposals to reform health care and government insurance programs in many of the Group's markets: or price controls and non-reimbursement of new and highly priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established.
In particular, the prices for certain of the Group's products when commercialized, including, in particular, products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases such as REPLAGAL and ELAPRASE, may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products.
The Group may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for its products, including those that are likely to have a high annual cost of therapy.
The failure to obtain and maintain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect revenues and earnings.
Parallel importation occurs when an importer finds a cheaper price for a product or equivalent product on the world market and imports that product from the lower price jurisdiction to the higher price jurisdiction.
If the parallel importation of lower priced drugs is permitted in the United States, it could have the effect of reducing sales of equivalent drugs in the United States.
To the extent that parallel importation increases, the Group may receive less revenue and earnings from its commercialized products.
The parallel importation of prescription drugs is relatively common within the EU.
A disruption to the product supply chain may result in the Group being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the Group being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis The Group has its own manufacturing capability for certain products and has also entered into supply agreements with third party contract manufacturers.
In the event of either the Group's failure or the failure of any third party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards often referred to as Current Good Manufacturing Standards or cGMP in the countries in which the Group intends to sell or have its products sold, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
The Group dual-sources certain key products and or active ingredients.
However, the Group currently relies on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of DAYTRANA, DYNEPO, ELAPRASE, LIALDA, PENTASA, REMINYL and XAGRID and relies on a single active ingredient source for each of DYNEPO, ELAPRASE, FOSRENOL, REMINYL, REPLAGAL and XAGRID.
In the event of financial failure of a third party contract manufacturer, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
This could have a material adverse affect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations.
31 Financial review continued There is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms, or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements.
The Group is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements The development and approval of the Group's products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities.
As the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications, regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the marketing approval.
The need to qualify a new supplier could delay the Group's development and commercialization efforts.
The Group uses bovine-derived serum sourced from New Zealand and North America in the manufacturing processes for REPLAGAL and ELAPRASE.
The discovery of additional cattle in North America or the discovery of cattle in New Zealand with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on these products, or prohibit the Group from using these products at all in such countries.
The actions of certain customers can affect the Group's ability to sell or market products profitably, as well as impact net sales and growth comparisons A small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the United States and European markets.
In 2007, for example, approximately 85% of the Group's product sales were attributable to three customers: McKesson Corp. Cardinal Health, Inc. and Amerisource Bergen Corp.
In the event of financial failure of any of these customers, the Group may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues and earnings.
In addition, the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred.
Consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels, or otherwise reduce purchases of the Group's products.
Such actions could have an adverse effect on the Group's revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
A significant portion of the Groups Specialty Pharmaceutical product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the United States and Europe.
Consequently, product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers.
These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions, or other factors.
In addition, a significant portion of the Group's revenues for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are concentrated with a small number of customers.
Changes in the buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations.
INDUSTRY SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS The actions of governments, industry regulators and the economic environments in which the Group operates may adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products profitably Changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry, in any country in which the Group conducts its business, may adversely impact the Group's sales, financial condition and results of operations.
In particular, changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation.
Changes in the general economic conditions in any of the Group's major markets may also affect the Group's sales, financial condition and results of operations.
The introduction of new products by competitors may impact future revenues The manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive.
Many of the Group's competitors are large, well-known pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources.
Companies with more resources and larger R&D expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications.
They may also be more successful than the Group in acquiring or licensing new products for development and commercialization.
If any product that competes with one of the Group's principal drugs is approved, the Group's sales of that drug could fall.
32 Financial review continued The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change.
The Group's products could, therefore, be rendered obsolete or uneconomic, through the development of new products, technological advances in manufacturing or production by its competitors.
If the Group's projects or clinical trials for the development of products are unsuccessful, its products will not receive authorization for manufacture and sale Due to the complexity of the formulation and development of pharmaceuticals, the Group cannot be certain that it or its collaborative partners will successfully complete the development of new products, or, if successful, that such products will be commercially viable.
Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development, the Group or its collaborative partners must demonstrate through clinical and other studies that the product is of appropriate quality and is safe and effective for the claimed use.
Clinical trials of any product under development may not demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy required to result in an approvable or a marketable product.
Failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product.
In addition, regulatory authorities in Europe, the United States, Canada and other countries may require additional studies, which could result in a increased costs and significant development delays, or b termination of a project if it would no longer be economically viable.
The completion rate of clinical trials is dependent upon, among other factors, obtaining adequate clinical supplies and recruiting patients.
Delays in patient enrolment in clinical trials may also result in increased costs and program delays.
Additional delays can occur in instances in which the Group shares control over the planning and execution of product development with collaborative partners.
The Group cannot be certain that, if clinical trials are completed, either the Group or its collaborative partners will file for, or receive, required authorisations to manufacture and or market potential products in a timely manner.
If the Group is unable to meet the requirements of regulators in relation to a particular product, it may be unable to develop the product or obtain or retain the necessary marketing approvals Drug companies are required to obtain regulatory approval before manufacturing and marketing most drug products.
Regulatory approval is generally based on the results of: quality testing chemistry, manufacturing and controls : non-clinical testing: and clinical testing.
The clinical development, manufacture, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive regulation, including separate regulation by each member state of the EU, the EMEA itself and federal, state and local regulation in the United States.
Unanticipated legislative and other regulatory actions and developments concerning various aspects of the Group's operations and products may restrict its ability to sell one or more of its products or to sell those products at a profit.
The generation of data is regulated and any generated data is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
Required regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all.
In addition, other regulatory requirements for any such proposed products may not be met.
Even if the Group obtains regulatory approvals, the terms of any product approval, including labeling, may be more restrictive than desired and could affect the marketability of its products.
Regulatory authorities also have the power amongst other things, to: revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products: require the recall of products that fail to meet regulatory requirements: and close manufacturing plants that do not operate in conformity with cGMP and or other regulatory requirements or approvals.
Such delays or actions could affect the Group's ability to manufacture and sell its products.
33 Financial review continued The failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue The Group enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing.
In these partnerships, the Group is dependent on its partner to deliver results.
While these partnerships are supported by contracts, the Group does not exercise direct control.
If a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties, the Group may suffer a delay in the development, a delay in the approval or a reduction in sales or royalties of a product.
The failure to secure new products or compounds for development, either through in-licensing, acquisition or internal research and development efforts, may have an adverse impact on the Group's future results The Group's future results will depend, to a significant extent, upon its ability to in-license, acquire or develop new products or compounds.
The Group also expends significant resources on research and development.
The failure to in-license or acquire new products or compounds, on a commercially viable basis, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position.
The failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the Group's revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
The Group may fail to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business The Group's success depends upon its ability and the ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights.
Where possible, the Group's strategy is to register intellectual property rights, such as patents and trademarks.
The Group also relies variously on trade secrets, unpatented knowhow and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain its competitive position.
Patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the Group have been granted, or are pending in various countries, including the United States, Canada, major European countries and Japan.
The Group intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the Group.
However, patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the Group's products or technologies or processes for formulating or manufacturing similar or functionally equivalent products.
The Group's patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn.
The Group cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to protect the Group's products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by third parties.
In the regular course of business, the Group is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.
See Note 36 for details of current patent litigation.
Additionally, the Group's products, or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may now, or in the future, infringe the patent rights of third parties.
It is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or sale of the Group's products.
If third parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology, it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the Group or its strategic partners from developing, manufacturing or selling its products.
The Group may need to obtain licences for intellectual property rights from others to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licences on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
In addition, any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable.
The Group also relies on trade secrets and other un-patented proprietary information, which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors and partners.
These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the Group with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
If the Group's employees, scientific consultants or partners develop 34 Financial review continued inventions or processes that may be applicable to the Group's products under development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the Group's property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers.
Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the Group's proprietary rights.
The failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection, for any reason, could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the Group's product sales.
The Group has filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with its products in various countries including the United States and countries in Europe and Latin America and intends to trademark new product names as new products are developed.
In addition, with respect to certain products, the Group relies on the trademarks of third parties.
These trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the Group or the third parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks.
The Group's inability or the inability of these third parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the Group's trademarks and dilute their value.
If a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side effects, this could result in damage to the Group's reputation, the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the Group Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of the Group's products, or those of its competitors, could have an adverse effect on the Group's ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products.
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims, product recalls, litigation and associated adverse publicity.
The cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited.
A successful product liability claim against the Group could require the Group to pay a substantial monetary award.
If, in the absence of adequate insurance coverage, the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defence of such a claim, it could become insolvent.
Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms.
Although the Group carries product liability insurance, this coverage may not be adequate.
In addition, it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will be available.
