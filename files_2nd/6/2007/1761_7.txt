strategy has resulted in the Group currently being well positioned to withstand the credit crisis in the bank and capital markets.
The Group had cash and short-term investments at 31 December 2007 of 3,226m 2006 3,603m.
This, together with an undrawn committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 1.5bn which is syndicated amongst the Groups core relationship banks, is available to meet any general corporate funding requirement.
The RCF provides standby funding for the Groups US Commercial Paper programme which is not currently utilised.
The RCF was contracted originally for five years until 2010.
However, it has been extended by two one-year extension agreements until 2012, although the available amount for the final year has been reduced from 1.5bn to 1.3bn.
The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year.
Since the start of the credit crisis in the summer of 2007, the Group has adopted a more conservative approach to the investment of its surplus cash, with money market deposits being placed with relatively stronger financial institutions for shorter periods.
Bank counterparty credit risk is monitored closely on a systematic and ongoing basis, taking account of the size of the institution, its credit rating and its credit default swap price.
Generally, excluding the impact of acquisition or disposal financing, the net cash debt of the Group is driven by operational performance, the level of receipts on the major contracts and the performance of the equity accounted investments.
Historically, the net cash debt position of the Group is usually at its best at the year end.
Insurance The Group operates a policy of partial self-insurance, with the majority of cover placed in the external market.
The Group continues to monitor its insurance arrangements to ensure the quality and adequacy of cover.

Intangible assets In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3, goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in equity accounted investments.
IFRS 3 also requires the identification of other acquired intangible assets.
The techniques used to value these intangible assets are in line with internationally used models but do require the use of estimates which may differ from actual outcomes.
Future results are impacted by the amortisation period adopted for these items and, potentially, any differences between estimated and actual circumstances related to individual intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
The impairment review calculations require the use of estimates related to the future profitability and cash-generating ability of the acquired business.
Additional details concerning the Groups treatment of intangible assets and impairment reviews are given in note 1 to the Group accounts.
Regional Aircraft valuations The Group holds a number of regional aircraft on its balance sheet.
These aircraft are leased to airline operators.
In addition, the Group has provided residual value guarantees RVGs in respect of certain regional aircraft sold.
The aircraft held on balance sheet are subject to regular impairment testing.
During the year the anticipated aircraft values were reassessed to a value based on their contracted rental inflows plus a residual value determined by the aircraft type and age.
Provisions related to the RVGs are measured as the difference between amounts payable to customers and the estimated fair value of the aircraft.
The estimated fair value of those aircraft is made on the same basis as for the aircraft held on balance sheet.
Much of the leasing business was underpinned by the Groups Financial Risk Insurance Programme, which makes good shortfalls in actual lease income against originally estimated future income for a 15-year period from 1998 to 2013.
Since 2006, BAE Systems and certain of the reinsurers have been in dispute over several areas of the policy.
During 2007, agreement was reached with almost all the reinsurers and settlements have been paid by them based on the net present value of estimated future claims.
Arbitration proceedings now continue with only one reinsurer.
Additional details concerning these arrangements are contained in the Risk management and principal risks section on page 49 of this report.
