pRofiT BefoRe TAX Profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2007 was 110.4 million compared with 792.4 million for 2006.
The reduction resulted principally from the lower revaluation gains for the investment portfolio in 2007.
Adjusted profit before tax, analysed in the table below, was 117.3 million, an increase of 22.8 million, or 24.1% on the previous year.

neT RenTAl income For the year ended 31 December 2007, net rental income was 275.7 million compared with 237.4 million in the previous year.
Just over half of the increase was due to a full years contribution from the recent development at Bishops Square.
The balance arose principally from lettings, rent reviews in the UK and indexation in France.
Our investment portfolio delivered a like-for-like increase in net rental income of 7.4%, as shown in the tables below and opposite.
In 2007, rent receivable of 18.2 million has been accrued and allocated to rent-free periods.
Net rental income of 2.9 million was related to retail occupiers turnover whilst shopping centre car parks generated net income of 7.8 million in 2007. like-for-like net rental inCoMe analysis for the year ended 31 December 2007 Properties owned Total net throughout rental 2006 7 Acquisitions Disposals Developments income m m m m m United Kingdom Retail 106.7 19.9 7.2 2.6 136.4 Office 36.3 2.2 26.0 64.5 Total United Kingdom 143.0 22.1 7.2 28.6 200.9 Continental Europe France 68.6 0.4 0.2 2.6 71.4 Germany 1.2 1.2 Total Continental Europe 68.6 0.4 0.2 3.8 72.6 Group Retail 161.0 20.3 7.0 3.9 192.2 Office 50.6 2.2 28.5 81.3 Total investment portfolio 211.6 22.5 7.0 32.4 273.5 Income from developments and other sources not analysed above 2.2 2.2 Total portfolio 213.8 22.5 7.0 32.4 275.7 046 Annual Report 2007 like-for-like net rental inCoMe analysis for the year ended 31 December 2006 Properties owned Total net throughout rental 2006 7 Acquisitions Disposals Developments Exchange income m m m m m m United Kingdom Retail 103.5 6.7 20.2 2.0 132.4 Office 30.6 1.4 6.6 38.6 Total United Kingdom 134.1 6.7 21.6 8.6 171.0 Continental Europe France 63.0 0.1 2.1 0.3 64.7 Germany 0.3 0.1 0.2 Total Continental Europe 63.0 0.2 2.0 0.3 64.9 Group Retail 153.9 6.7 20.4 1.7 0.3 182.4 Office 43.2 1.4 8.9 53.5 Total investment portfolio 197.1 6.7 21.8 10.6 0.3 235.9 Income from developments and other sources not analysed above 1.5 1.5 Total portfolio 198.6 6.7 21.8 10.6 0.3 237.4 ADminisTRATion eXpenses Administration expenses totalled 41.2 million in 2007 compared with 36.1 million in 2006.
The increase was primarily accounted for by increased staffing and performance-related remuneration, which together accounted for 3.3 million of the increase.
neT finAnce cosTs For the year ended 31 December 2007, net finance costs, excluding the change in fair value of derivatives and bond redemption costs, increased by 10.4 million to 117.2 million.
Higher interest rates and the cost of funding the first two instalments of the REIT conversion charge were partly offset by the savings achieved from the early redemption of the 10.75% 2013 bonds.
Interest of 27.6 million relating to the development programme was capitalised during the year.
The majority related to the retail developments at Cabot Circus, Bristol and Highcross, Leicester.
The average cost of borrowing in 2007 was 5.9% and interest cover was 1.9 times compared with 1.8 times the previous year.
TAX Since becoming a UK REIT at the beginning of 2007, Hammerson has been exempt from corporation tax on its UK property income and on capital gains on disposals of UK investment properties.
The initial effects of the UK REIT election were accounted for in the 2006 accounts.
UK REIT status and the SIIC exemption of our French business mean that, in future, the current tax charge should be minimal.
However, the sale of our interest in 9 place Vendme, the only French property outside the SIIC regime, crystallised a tax liability of 17.7 million.
The related deferred tax provision of 28.7 million has been released.
DiViDenD The Board is proposing a final dividend of 15.3 pence per share.
It is intended that 7.7 pence per share will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, and the remainder of 7.6 pence per share paid as a normal dividend.
Together with the interim dividend of 12 pence, this makes a total of 27.3 pence per share for the year, representing an increase of 25.9% over the total dividend for 2006.
Annual Report 2007 047 Section financiaL Review continued My eight years at hammerson have allowed me to make the most of my professional and language skills: after working as an executive assistant to two senior directors, I was offered the opportunity to specialise in human resources.
One of my main focuses is employee training and development.
Franoise Couteiro Human Resources co-ordinator, Hammerson france When I joined hammerson in 2001, I was entering an industry which had little history in strong consumer marketing.
Thats why it was so rewarding to see a project like our shopping centre loyalty scheme get started: we were breaking new ground and it was very exciting.
Thomas Havas marketing Deputy Director, Hammerson france 048 Annual Report 2007 cAsH flow For the year ended 31 December 2007, there was a cash outflow from operating activities of 29 million compared with an inflow of 6 million in 2006.
Increased interest payments and the payment of two UK REIT entry charge instalments totalling 50 million more than offset increased rental income.
In 2007, disposals raised 537 million whilst capital expenditure and acquisitions amounted to 543 million.
The latter figure excludes an accrual for the acquisition of the leasehold interest in Bishops Square and the acquisition of Ravenshead Retail Park which was part financed by an issue of approximately five million shares at a price of 15.76 per share.
After the net cash inflow from financing activities of 35 million, there was a net decrease in cash and deposits for the year of 12 million.
BAlAnce sHeeT In the Half-Year Report for the six months to 30 June 2007, we reported net asset value per share, calculated in accordance with EPRA recommendations, of 16.35, representing an increase of 1.35 or 9.0% during the half-year.
Since that time the decline in property values has reduced net asset value per share by 0.90 or 5.5% to 15.45 at 31 December 2007.
Accordingly there was an increase for the year of 0.45 or 3.0%.
If the bond redemption costs of 28.3 million are excluded, the increase in adjusted net asset value per share for 2007 as a whole would have been 0.55, or 3.7%.
The tables below show how net asset value is calculated and the components of the movement in the year.
During the year, we purchased 1.45 million of the Companys own shares in the open market for 16.8 million, representing an average price of 11.59 per share.
The shares are held in treasury.
