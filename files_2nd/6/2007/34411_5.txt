9 Financial Review continued The Company raises finance at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
It uses interest rate derivatives on a non-speculative basis to manage its exposure to floating rate debt in order to protect it against adverse interest rate movements and also to reduce the level of fixed rate debt when it considers that it can benefit from falls in short term interest rates.
It does not operate with any pre-determined ratios of fixed to floating rate debt but management constantly review the interest rate profile against existing and forecast market conditions.
The hedging strategies used in the joint ventures are subject to the agreement of the joint venture partners and the banks who provide the finance.
The market value of our net debt as at the end of 2007 was 790.6m compared with a book value of 804.1m.
This reduction of 13.5m compares with an excess figure of 5.2m at the end of 2006 and is equivalent to 5p per share.
This amount is not recognised in the balance sheet unlike the change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
