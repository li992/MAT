The principal factors are LOSS as follows:  The UK Life & Pensions loss of 71 m 2006: 46m profit was impacted negatively by widening of corporate bond spreads and other one-off items:  The International Life & Pensions profit of 26m 2006: 70m was down from last year primarily because 2006 included one-off credits:  The return on shareholder funds has increased to 71m 2006: 53m due to an increase in the value of funds under management and a 0.75% increase in assumed longer-term rates of return:  Income from the IFA businesses acquired during the year was offset by costs relating to the development of the Wrap platform, now terminated:  Asset Management underlying profit of 78m 2006: 89m has fallen due to higher F&C operating expenses:  Principal reserving changes and one-off items are 135 m negative, contrasting with the large positives in 2006.
The 2007 items are principally due to expense assumption changes and a review of the estimated amortisation profile of deferred acquisition costs following implementation of PS06 14 reserving changes.
In comparison 2006 reserving changes were due to the basis and reserving changes for morbidity on protection business and PS06 14 changes.
IFRS LOSS BEFORE The IFRS loss before tax from continuing operations is 113 m compared with a profit of 491m in TAX FROM 2006.
This measure takes into account actual investment returns achieved during the year, the impacts CONTINUING of non-recurring items and amortisation relating to acquisitions.
It is also shown gross of policyholder OPERATIONS tax and minority interests.
The total dividend for 2007 of 8.00 pence per share represents a 2% increase.
This is covered more than four times by distributable reserves in the Company and in FPLP.

This is a consequence of a review of our DAC amortisation for protection business following PS06 14 reserving changes.
We have accelerated the amortisation of this DAC because of the earlier recognition of margins.
As a result of this, together with higher pensions sales, new business strain has increased from 102 m to 125 m. In-force surplus has increased slightly to 184m.
The widening of corporate bond spreads on assets primarily backing annuities has had an adverse 90m impact on IFRS profit.
This arises because prudent valuation rules prevent the annuity liabilities from being valued in line with the currently high yields on the matching assets.
The matching assets are marked to market.
These assets are generally held to maturity and this adverse impact will be recovered over time unless there are asset defaults.
In addition, one-off items of 40 m include an injection of 22m into policyholder funds and arises from a review of unit-linked fund charges on first adoption of the ABI best practice guide.
In 2006 one-off items of 33 m included a reduction in the value of DAC.

qxd 1 4 08 20:39 Page 30 REVIEW OF THE YEAR FINANCIAL KPI SUMMARY EXECUTIVE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT CHANGE IN STRATEGY EXPLAINED FINANCIAL KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Protection sales are 5% down measured on the APE basis.
Both the cash strain and the in-force surplus have been significantly reduced by the implementation of PS06 14 and the consequent creation of negative reserves.
Pensions APE sales increased by 24%, which has caused the higher cash strain.
The cash in-force surplus has increased due to the impact of increases in fund values on management charges.
The surplus grows at a greater rate than the growth in funds under management because of the gearing effect caused by mainly fixed maintenance expense levels.
Annuity APE sales increased by 7%.
Cash generation was slightly lower at 15m with the effects of reinsuring the post-demutualisation in-force annuity book being largely offset by lower new business strain arising from interest rate movements.
Savings & investments APE sales fell by 27%.
The savings & investments cash strain is at a similar level to 2006 through a reduction in future cash flows recognised.
The increase in the With-Profits Fund surplus is driven by higher bonus costs, due to higher maturities, and higher management charges, more than offsetting the run-off of the business.
Following implementation of PS06 14 reserving changes, margins now emerge at commencement such that there is effectively no deferral of protection acquisition costs.
This change has been reflected as from 1 January 2007.
The deferred acquisition costs for pensions and savings & investments business reflects the relative level of new business written in the year.
The amortisation over the year is carried out on a straight-line basis for investment business and in line with the run-off in value of in-force business on an EEV basis for all other categories of business.

FPI new business strain has increased primarily due to increased volumes and changes in the mix of new business.
The FPI in-force surplus in 2006 included a 15m misclassification relating to PS06 14 benefit.
The one-off item in 2007 represents an adjustment to remove reserves no longer required.
The 2006 one-offs were mainly in respect of changes in actuarial funding in FPI.

Firstly FPI sales on the APE basis have increased by 60% since 2006.
Secondly, a special offer was launched in April 2007 on Premier, a regular premium savings product, offering enhanced allocation, resulting in increased strain.
Thirdly, increased commission levels reflected the success of the German pension offering.
FPI in-force surplus has decreased because, as discussed earlier, the 2006 comparative included a misclassification of 15m.
Lombard sales have decreased by 5% but new business strain has not reduced proportionately because of fixed acquisition expenses.
Lombard in-force surplus has increased in line with funds under management.
The significant increase in new regular premium business within FPI resulted in a corresponding increase in the actuarial funding adjustment.
The increase in DAC reflects the levels of business written.
FPI new business volumes, particularly on regular premium business, increased substantially.
Taken together, DAC and IFRS adjustments largely offset the increased cash strain.
Lombard new business volumes fell slightly compared to 2006.
RETURN ON Longer-term investment return has increased from 53m to 71m because of a 16% increase in the LIFE & PENSIONS weighted average value of Life & Pensions shareholder assets during the year from 1,046m in 2006 SHAREHOLDER to 1,219m in 2007 and a 75 basis points increase in assumed rates of return.
The investment return FUNDS on the corporate shareholder assets is included in Corporate items.
The longer-term investment return rates assumed were: equities 8.00% 2006: 7.25%, gilts 5.00% 2006: 4.25% and other fixed interest 5.50% 2006: 4.75%.
For 2008, these rates of return will be unchanged.
OTHER UK LIFE Other UK Life & Pensions net income of nil 2006: nil includes profits from the Sesame and Pantheon & PENSIONS Financial IFA businesses of 12m and 2m respectively which were acquired during the year and have NET INCOME performed in line with expectations.
The above results reflect seven months trading since the dates of acquisition.
Sesame includes a 2m credit relating to the one-off release of a provision.
These were offset by 14m costs incurred developing a Wrap platform.
This development has now been terminated.

Net fund outflows were 9.0 bn, offset by 8.5bn positive movements due to the impact of rising markets and positive exchange variances.
The net outflows included 5.1 bn insurance, 2.9 bn institutional, 1.3 bn sub-advisory, offset by retail inflows.
Net revenue has increased by 7%, mainly due to performance fees, which more than doubled to 21m.
Revenue margin, measured as management fee income divided by average funds under management, has increased from 22 basis points in 2006 to 23 basis points in 2007.
In part this reflects the loss of low fee mandates, but also reflects progress towards generating new business in higher margin areas.
Operating expenses, excluding certain share scheme costs, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and restructuring costs, increased by 16%.
During the year headcount rose by 138, with 81 arising from the transfer of staff on termination of the Mellon outsourcing agreement, and the remainder representing an investment in the business to support the enhanced product range and distribution plans.
IT and operational costs also increased as a result of significant project costs associated with changes to the operating platform, both through the reintegration of the Mellon back office and the introduction of a new front office Decision, Risk and Dealing system.
As a consequence operating margin has fallen from 36.5% to 30.9%, and underlying profit has decreased by 12%.
F&C launched its three-year plan last year, focused on targeting specialist areas and higher margin products to foster profitable organic growth.
Good overall progress has been made in executing the first year of the plan.
The focus of 2008 will be distribution, with a number of initiatives in place to extend its reach into new territories in Europe and beyond.

This has a one-off 112 m impact on IFRS profits as a result of increasing reserves to allow for the increased future costs and acceleration of amortisation of DAC.
In 2007 we implemented the second phase of PS06 14 Prudential Changes for Insurers.
This lowered mathematical reserves resulting in a further one-off acceleration in the emergence of cash.
However, the corresponding reduction in DAC, together with a review of the estimated amortisation profile, led to a one-off impact on IFRS profits of 34 m. In 2008 we will reorganise our operations to allow recognition of further reserve reductions as a result of PS06 14, to deliver a final one-off cash acceleration of approximately 100m.
The corresponding reduction in DAC is expected to leave IFRS profits broadly unchanged in this respect.
The reinsurance of the post-demutualisation annuity portfolio, implemented in the first half of 2007, has had a beneficial impact on cash and a positive impact on IFRS profits of 11m in line with expectations.
The IFRS impact is lower than the cash benefit as more value had been recognised in earlier years under IFRS.

The main factors are:  Short-term investment fluctuations represent the differences between actual and expected investment market returns.
The charge of 78 m reflects falls in fixed income security values offset by increases in equity values.
 Non-recurring items include 34m compensation received net of costs in respect of the aborted merger with Resolution plc, 15m credit in respect of the release of provisions less 11 m other items.
 There is no impairment charge required in respect of F&Cs acquired intangible assets.
The charge in 2006 related to the write down in value of management contracts following fund outflows notified in the year.
 Within the calculation of the underlying IFRS result, STICS is accounted for as debt to reflect the economic reality.
However, IFRS rules require that STICS should be accounted for as equity in calculating IFRS profit before tax and consequently STICS interest is added back and treated as an appropriation of profit.
 Policyholder tax is excluded from the underlying result as it is not attributable to shareholders.
The decrease compared to 2006 is due to lower property and equity gains.
The linked property gains are 283m lower and the linked life equity gains are 239m lower compared to 2006.
 Returns on Group controlled funds attributable to third parties mainly reflects the 47% minority interest in F&C Commercial Property Trust.
