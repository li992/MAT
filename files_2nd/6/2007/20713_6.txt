Under the Basel II capital regime we are required to hold a specific amount of capital, and do not have a specific capital ratio target as under Basel I.

We continue to hold capital over and above our regulatory requirements and are not planning a share buyback programme in 2008.
Given the increased volatility in capital requirements under Basel II, we aim to increase the difference between our capital resources and our regulatory capital requirement during 2008, as a prudent measure and to give greater flexibility in the current market.
