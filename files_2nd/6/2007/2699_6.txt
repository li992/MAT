The tax regulations are highly complex and whilst we aim to ensure the estimates of tax assets and liabilities that are recorded are accurate, the process of agreeing tax liabilities with the tax authorities can take several years and there may be instances where the process of agreeing tax liabilities requires adjustments to be made to estimates previously recorded.
