Financial covenants At the year end we complied with all our financial covenants.
The most important covenants relate to the interest cover ratio ICR which should not fall below a certain level.
This level ranges from 100% to 160% depending on the characteristics of the portfolio.
We also have covenants relating to the Loan to Value ratio, LTV covenants which must not be allowed to rise above a certain level.
Our LTV covenants were met without difficulty at the year end.
Fund debt The three Funds each have their own financial covenants.
More significant than the bank covenants however, is the desire of the institutional investors who invest in our Funds to limit leverage to 60% LTV in the case of The Mall and Junction funds and 70% in the case of X-Leisure.
Further decreases in asset values will put pressure on these covenants.
The funds have a number of options including realisation of assets to ensure they remain within the agreed covenants.
The Mall Fund has issued 1.4 billion in Mall bonds, which have an ICR covenant at 130% but no direct LTV covenant.
The ICR is currently 170-180%, comfortably over the limit.
The interest rate on these bonds is advantageous in current market conditions, and it is a priority not to breach any of the covenants associated with it.
