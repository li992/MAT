Tony Durrant 12 Finance Director FINANCIAL REVIEW Operating profit Economic environment 2007 was another year of record oil and gas commodity prices, approaching US$100 per $ million 250 barrel bbl towards the end of the year.
The Brent oil price, which began the year at US$60.1 bbl, averaged US$72.7 bbl, reaching a peak of US$95.8 bbl during November.
Gas 200 prices worldwide were also boosted according to the degree of linkage with crude oil.
The early part of 2008 has seen increased volatility in commodity prices.
The fragile health of the 150 global economy has put downward pressure on average 2008 prices but this has been more than offset by supply concerns and average 2008 prices are currently above US$90 bbl.
100 The sustained period of stronger commodity prices and increased industry activity levels 50 have put further pressure on both operating and development costs.
Rig rates and other drilling service costs are at historically high levels.
Shortages of experienced staff and 0 longer lead times for development equipment added further cost pressures on the industry.
2005 2006 2007 The industry is responding to cost and availability issues by optimising the use of available resources, innovative resource-sharing and focussing on fast track development solutions.
Income statement Production levels in 2007, on a working interest basis, averaged 35,750 boepd compared to 33,000 boepd in 2006.
On an entitlement basis, which allows for additional government take under the terms of our PSCs, production was 31,450 boepd 2006: 28,900 boepd.
Realised oil prices averaged US$72.3 bbl compared with US$64.9 bbl in the previous year.
Gas production averaged 135 mmscfd 23,500 boepd during the year, or approximately 66 per cent of total production.
Average gas prices for the group were US$5.60 per thousand standard cubic feet mscf 2006: US$5.11 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, which are linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil HSFO, have moved broadly in line with crude pricing, averaging US$11.30 mscf 2006: US$9.43 mscf during the year.
Following the groups decision to terminate discussions with a preferred bidder, the financial results for Mauritanian operations are no longer required to be presented separately.
The corresponding amounts for 2006 have been re-presented accordingly.
During the year, the group also restructured its business in Pakistan by fide-merging interests from the Premier-KUFPEC Pakistan joint venture and now fully consolidates its share of operations in Pakistan.
This restructuring had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Total sales revenue from all operations was 44 per cent higher than 2006 at US$578.2 million 2006: US$402.2 million as a result of higher production and commodity prices.
Cost of sales was US$267.5 million 2006: US$179.2 million after including a cost of US$26.8 million for inventory acquired with the Scott field acquisition.
The year-end inventory position moved from a stock overlift to an underlift position, driven by the timing of liftings around each year-end, and resulted in a charge to cost of sales of US$27.3 million 2006: credit of US$22.4 million.
After excluding the effect of inventory movements, underlying unit operating costs were higher at US$9.0 per barrel of oil equivalent boe 2006: US$7.1 boe due to one-off cost increases in Indonesia and increased production from the Scott field in the North Sea.
Unit amortisation amounted to US$8.2 boe 2006: US$7.9 boe.
Exploration expense and pre-licence exploration costs amounted to US$65.3 million 2006: US$21.8 million and US$8.3 million 2006: US$21.8 million respectively, after taking into account a US$25.7 million write-down of costs in Guinea Bissau.
Administrative costs were stable at US$17.7 million 2006: US$16.8 million.
This included a charge of US$4.7 million 2006: US$5.7 million in respect of current year and future provisions for long-term incentive plans.
Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements PERFORMANCE 13 Total sales revenue from all operations was 44 per cent higher than 2006 at US$578.2 million 2006: US$402.2 million as a result of higher production and commodity prices.

Finance charges net of interest income totalled US$7.5 million 2006: US$4.0 million.

This included a significant non-cash item relating to mark to market revaluation of the group's oil and gas hedges totalling US$64.9 million pre-tax.
Such accounting losses arise as oil and gas prices increase, however, given the current range of spot and forward prices it is not expected that the hedging programme will have any material cash flow impact on the group.
The tax charge totalled US$108.0 million 2006: US$89.0 million due to underlying higher taxable profits.
Basic earnings per share amounted to 47.6 cents 2006: 82.6 cents.

Premier Oil plc 2007 Annual Report and Financial Statements 14 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Net cash debt Hedging and risk management The Boards policy remains to lock in oil and gas price floors for a portion of expected $ million 100 future production at a level which protects the cash flow of the group and the business plan.
Such floors are purchased for cash or by selling calls at a ceiling price when market 80 conditions are considered favourable.
All transactions are matched as closely as possible 60 with expected cash flows to the group: no speculative transactions are undertaken.
40 During 2007 zero cost collar oil hedges for a further 2.4 mmbbls were entered into by 20 extending the maturity of the collars to the end of 2012.
This increased the average floor price from US$38.55 bbl to US$39.3 bbl whilst maintaining the cap at US$100.0 bbl.
0 During 2007 hedges for 1.8 mmbbls matured for which no cash settlement under the terms -20 of the collars was made.
At the end of 2007 a four and a half-year physical off-take -40 agreement for the sale of certain oil production was entered into with effect from 1 July 2005 2006 2007 2008.
This agreement for 8.1 mmbbls incorporates the parameters of existing oil collars and effectively replaces the equivalent amount of hedging.
In addition, zero cost collars for a further 150,000 metric tonnes mt of HSFO were entered into which raised the average floor price from US$245 mt to US$250 mt whilst maintaining the cap at US$500 mt.
During 2007 hedges for 120,000 mt matured for which a small payment under the terms of the hedges was made during the year.
At the end of 2007, a total of 642,000 mt of HSFO was hedged approximately 120,000 mt per annum representing approximately one third of Indonesian gas production, until June 2013.
Under International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS zero cost collar hedges are required to be marked to market at the balance sheet date.
The aggregate valuation is a US$65.2 million liability 2006: US$0.3 million liability generating a US$64.9 million non-cash pre-tax charge in the 2007 income statement.
The entry into the physical off-take agreement for oil production from 1 July 2008 will reduce the volatility of mark to market revaluations on the income statement.
The existing US$37.9 million provision in respect of oil hedges will be written back to the income statement over the life of these hedges.
Since the group now reports in US dollars, exchange rate exposures relate only to Sterling receipts and expenditures, which are hedged in dollar terms on a short-term basis.
The group recorded a loss of US$0.4 million on such hedging at year-end.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits, AAA managed liquidity funds and A1 P1 commercial paper subject to Board approved limits.
The group undertakes an insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with its exploration and production activities.
In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields.
