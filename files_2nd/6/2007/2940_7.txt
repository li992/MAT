We have made two changes to the way we report our financial results and how we group together activities of a similar type and risk profile in order to make it easier to value our earnings on a consistent basis.
Previously, we reported our results in three segments support services, investments and construction services.
We now report our activities in four segments support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East construction services and construction services excluding the Middle East.
Our Middle East construction activities, which were previously included within construction services, are now being reported separately, because of their higher margins and lower risk profile compared with construction services in the UK.
In addition, to provide greater clarity, the investments segment has been re-named Public Private Partnership projects, but there has been no change to the results we report in this segment, namely the equity returns on our investments in Public Private Partnership projects.
