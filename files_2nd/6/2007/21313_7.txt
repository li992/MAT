Business review 1 Tier 1 Capital Ratio Capital requirements are part of the regulatory framework governing how banks and depository institutions are managed.
Capital ratios measure the percentage of a banks capital to its risk weighted assets.
Tier 1 capital is defined by the FSA and consists largely of shareholders funds.
Barclays operates a centralised capital management model, considering both regulatory and economic capital.
Decisions on the allocation of capital resources, conducted as part of the strategic planning review, are based on a number of factors including returns on economic and regulatory capital.
The Groups capital management activities seek to maximise shareholder value by optimising the level and mix of its capital resources.
The Groups capital management objectives are to: Support the Groups AA credit rating.
Maintain sufficient capital resources to support the Groups risk appetite and economic capital requirements.
Maintain sufficient capital resources to meet the FSAs minimum regulatory capital requirements and the US Federal Reserve Banks requirements that a financial holding company be well capitalised.
Ensure locally regulated subsidiaries can meet their minimum capital requirements.
The key measure the Group uses to assess its capital strength is the Tier 1 capital ratio which represents Tier 1 capital compared to risk weighted assets.
The Group targets a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.25%.
Employee engagement Employee opinion surveys are used extensively across the Group to provide leaders with valuable insight to employee views.
This is important because research has consistently shown that committed people are a crucial factor in achieving great customer service and excellent business performance.

Barclays Commercial Bank total assets increased 10% to 65.9bn 2005: 59.9bn reflecting good growth across short, medium and long term lending products.
Risk weighted assets increased 6% to 50.0bn 2005: 47.1bn, reflecting asset growth and increased regulatory netting.
Barclaycard total assets increased 10% to 20.1bn 2005: 18.2bn driven by growth in lending balances in the international businesses and FirstPlus.
Risk weighted assets increased 25% to 17.0bn 2005: 13.6bn, primarily reflecting the increase in total assets and lower securitised balances.
International Retail and Commercial Banking-excluding Absa total assets increased 12% to 38.2bn 2005: 34.0bn mainly reflecting increases in mortgage and other lending.
Risk weighted assets remained flat at 20.1bn 2005: 20.2bn, with balance sheet growth offset by the sale of FirstCaribbean International Bank.

Risk weighted assets remained flat at 20.7bn 2005: 20.8bn.
This reflects very strong growth in Rand terms offset by a 21% decline in the value of the Rand.
In Rand terms assets grew 31% to R417bn 2005: R319bn and risk weighted assets grew 25% to R284bn 2005: R227bn due to strong growth in mortgage lending along with growth in corporate lending.
Barclays Capital total assets increased 9% to 657.9bn 2005: 601.2bn.
This reflected continued expansion of the business with growth in reverse repurchase agreements, debt securities and traded equity securities.
Risk weighted assets increased 18% to 137.6bn 2005: 116.7bn in line with risk, driven by the growth in equity derivatives, credit derivatives and fixed income.

The Groups authority to buy-back equity shares was renewed at the 2007 AGM.
Risk weighted assets are a function of risk weights applied to the Groups assets using calculations developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
Basel I At 31st December 2007, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 7.8% and the risk asset ratio was 12.1%.
From 31st December 2006, total net capital resources rose 7.9bn and risk weighted assets increased 55.6bn.
Tier 1 capital rose 4.4bn, including 2.3bn arising from profits attributable to equity holders of the parent net of dividends paid.
Minority interests within Tier 1 capital increased 2.7bn primarily due to the issuance of reserve capital instruments and preference shares.
The deduction for goodwill and intangible assets increased by 1.1bn.
Tier 2 capital increased 3.1bn mainly as a result of an increase of 3.0bn of dated loan capital.
Basel II Under Basel II, effective from 1st January 2008, the Group has been granted approval by the FSA to adopt the advanced approaches to credit and operational risk management.
Pillar 1 risk weighted assets will be generated using the Groups risk models.
Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements under Basel II are Pillar 1 risk weighted assets multiplied by 8%, the internationally agreed minimum ratio.
Under Pillar 2 of Basel II, the Group is subject to an overall regulatory capital requirement expressed in terms based on individual capital guidance ICG received from the FSA.
The ICG imposes additional capital requirements in excess of Pillar 1 minimum capital requirements.
Barclays received its ICG from the FSA in December 2007.
Risk weighted assets calculated on a Basel II basis are broadly in line with risk weighted assets calculated on a Basel I basis.
A reduction in credit and counterparty risk weighted assets of 31.5bn more than offset the identification of capital equivalent risk weighted assets of 28.4bn attributable to operational risk.
The reduced risk weighted assets attributable to credit risk were mainly driven by recognition of the low risk profile of first charge residential mortgages in UK Retail Banking and Absa and the use of internal models to assess exposures to counterparty risk in the trading book.
These were partially offset by higher counterparty risk weightings in emerging markets and greater recognition of undrawn commitments.
Compared to Basel I, deductions from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital under Basel II include additional amounts relating to expected loss and securitisations.
For advanced portfolios, any excess of expected loss over impairment allowances is deducted half from Tier 1 and half from Tier 2 capital.
Deductions relating to securitisation transactions, which are made from total capital under Basel I, are deducted half from Tier 1 and half from Tier 2 capital under Basel II.
For portfolios treated under the standardised approach, the inclusion of collectively assessed impairment allowances in Tier 2 capital remains the same under Basel II.
Collectively assessed impairment allowances against exposures treated under Basel II advanced approaches are not eligible for direct inclusion in Tier 2 capital.
Short-term borrowings include deposits from banks, commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit.

Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical impairment review.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
