The aggregate gross assets of the schemes at 30 April 2007 were 737.9 million and the gross liabilities at 30 April 2007, calculated under IAS 19, were 756.5 million, resulting in the recognition of a gross balance sheet deficit of 18.6 million 30 April 2006: 50.3 million, a net deficit of 13.0 million 30 April 2006: 35.3 million after the establishment of a deferred tax asset of 5.6 million 30 April 2006: 15.0 million.
