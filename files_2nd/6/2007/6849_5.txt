covered below, we anticipate being able to put an OpCo PropCo structure, with a joint venture partner, into place during the GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006 07 14 FINANCIAL REVIEW current financial year, subject to favourable market conditions.
The proceeds will be used to return further funds to shareholders or fund further acquisitions.
We have also worked closely with our banking partners to put into place a 5-year bank borrowing facility of 550m which not only demonstrates the confidence the eight banks have in Greene King but also gives a reduction in rates against our existing syndicated facility.
At the end of the year, our net debt of 1,435.5m was higher by 188.8m over the same time last year.
Without the investment in Hardys & Hansons plc and the share buy-backs, net debt would have been reduced by 120.9m.
Capital efficiency With the agreed net debt EBITDA covenants and fixed charge cover, we continue to be able to financially support the business strategy and growth with the strength and flexibility of the balance sheet, to the extent that our fixed charge cover at year end is too conservative at 2.8 times.
We therefore intend to move towards a fixed charge cover of 2.3 times, over the next twelve to eighteen months.
We will return up to 100m of the funds generated to shareholders by way of share buy-back, in addition to the 28m already returned in the new financial year.
The balance will be available for a combination of organic investment, further acquisitions and further share buy-backs.
Pensions The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, open to all new employees and a number of defined benefit schemes, which are all closed to new entrants.
The net pension liability now stands at 40.2m 50.2m last year.
Summary We are pleased with another year of strong growth operationally and financially, and have continued to invest in and grow both our core business and acquisitions as well as to harvest profitable assets.
Long term financing at competitive rates, combined with our healthy operational cash flows, asset backed business model and strong, flexible balance sheet, gives us both options and confidence in the future and the opportunity to return funds to shareholders, in what will no doubt be a big year of transition for the industry.
