Cash flow In addition to the substantial investments in business development described above, debt at 31 December 2007 was temporarily increased by 28m as a result of payments made to Wickes suppliers on the 53rd Monday of the year.
Despite this and a higher level of trade and rebate debtors, the Group has generated 304m of cash from operations 2006: 323m, a decrease of 6.0%.
Adjusted free cash flow, calculated before exceptional property disposals, the extra supplier payment run, expansionary capital expenditure, special pension contributions and dividends was 157.8m note 35, 27.1% lower than 2006.
As a result of the turbulence in credit markets increasing LIBOR rates, the Group rolled its debt, and therefore paid interest, on a weekly rather than 6 monthly basis for most of the second half of the year.
As a result, when combined with the effect of higher debt and higher interest rates, interest payments were 13.5m higher in 2007, than in 2006.
We indicated last year that we intended to increase capital expenditure significantly to grow the Groups brands.
