Overall growth of 16% was made up of an 11% increase in total premium, a 34% rise in other revenue predominantly ancillary income and Confused.
com revenue and a 69% increase in investment return after a disappointing investment year in 2006.
Net revenue in the income statement increased by 17% to 364m.
Balumba providing all the European figures above contributed 2% of total Group turnover.
60% of the total is underwritten by Great Lakes Reinsurance UK Plc a subsidiary of Munich Re under a long term co-insurance arrangement.
The remaining 17.5% is ceded to two reinsurers Swiss Re, 10.0% and Partner Re, 7.5%.
The nature of the co-insurance arrangement is such that 60% of all motor premium and claims for the 2007 year accrues directly to Great Lakes and does not appear in the Groups income statement.
Similarly, Great Lakes reimburses the Group for its proportional share of expenses.
The Group also retains 35% of the risks generated by Balumba in Spain and AdmiralDirekt in Germany, with 65% being reinsured.
In 2008, the share of the UK motor underwriting retained increases to 27.5% as Great Lakes share declines by the 5% set out in the revised co-insurance arrangement.
Underwriting results Total premiums increased by around 11% to 631m from 567m Balumba accounted for around 14m of this total having written less than 1m in 2006.
The total number of vehicles insured excluding Gladiator rose by around 15% to 1.43m from 1.24m.
Balumba grew its customer count from around 2,000 to 47,000 at the end of the year.
Vehicle growth exceeded premium growth due in part to lower average premiums in Spain and also in the UK due to mix effects.
As noted above, German motor risks sold in the latter part of 2007 do not incept until 2008 and are not included in the premium or results.
Premium rate rises of around 4% have been implemented in the UK and data suggests similar increases have been seen across the market.
Net insurance premium revenue fell marginally to 142m - due to the decrease in the proportion of UK premium retained.
The overall loss ratio improved to 68% - four points down from the 72% reported in 2006.
The UK motor ratio improved significantly to 67% from 72%.
Balumbas reported loss ratio in its first full year of trading is 141%.
Positive development of prior year reserves continued, and the 2007 result includes releases of almost 30m up from 21m last year improving the loss ratio by around 21 percentage points.
The pure year loss ratio including Balumba declined to 88% from 86% in 2006.
The UK expense ratio was 16.7%, up 1 percentage point on the previous year primarily as a result of lower average premiums resulting from changes in the mix of the portfolio.
When the Balumba figures are included, the Group expense ratio totals 17.7%.
The expense ratio is reconciled to the figures included in the income statement in note 9 below, whilst the underwriting result is reconciled later in this review.
As a consequence, the Groups combined ratio improved by two points to 85% 87% in 2006.
Taken together with the increase in premiums, this resulted in a 32% rise in underwriting profits, to 37.5m from 28.4m.
Part VII transfer During November 2007, the Group completed the transfer of the remaining liabilities of Syndicate 2004 through which the Group underwrote UK private motor insurance from 2000 to 2002 into one of its active insurers - Admiral Insurance Company Limited.
Whilst the transfer has a number of advantages in terms of simplifying Group structure and administrative requirements, the transfer has not had a material financial impact on the results in 2007.
3m ADMIRAL GROUP plc 17 Profit commission The Group earns profit commission through its co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements.
The amount receivable is dependent on the volume and profitability of the insurance business, measured by reference to loss and expense ratios.
Around 20.4m was recognised in 2007, which is 0.5m higher than 2006, although as reported last year, the 2006 total included 2.0m relating to earlier year contracts 0.5m in 2007.
The reinsurance contracts entered into with Munich Re in Spain and Germany also have profit commission clauses, though these require the underwriting results to move into cumulative profitability before any commission will be earned.

Gross UK ancillary income per average active vehicle was 69 for both years, with no notable change in the component elements.
Balumba has also been successful in selling ancillary products, with income per policy sold of around 45.
In a highly competitive market, Gladiator grew market share by increasing its customer base by 44% to 62,000.
This was partly as a result of new distribution through price comparison sites, and partly the result of improved conversion from a larger and more comprehensive panel.
Gladiator offered 230,000 quotes in 2007, up 68% on last year.
Increased investment in new business growth meant that Gladiators net margin reduced to 27% from 34% in 2006.
com profit 36,727 23,080 Confused enjoyed another year of significant growth in 2007.

Home insurance quotes increased by almost 80% to 0.9m from 0.5m, whilst Confused also gave 0.5m travel insurance quotes up substantially from just over 0.1m last year.
As noted in the Chief Executives statement, Confused faced a significant increase in the level of competition in the motor insurance price comparison market during 2007.
In spite of this, Confused maintained its position as market leader.

Management are pleased with the development of the business, which has grown ahead of plan and is well positioned to continue to grow market share and move towards profitability.
The European figures above show Balumba made a loss of around 0.7m in the year the net effect of the underwriting loss, offset by ancillary profits.
AdmiralDirekt launched successfully in Cologne, Germany during October, just under one year after Balumba.
The German market brings new challenges, not least the large proportion of motor policies that incept 1 January.

Earnings per share EPS Earnings per share rose 22% to 48.6p from 39.8p in 2006.

ADMIRAL GROUP plc 19 Investments and cash The Group invests its insurance funds in three AAA-rated sterling liquidity funds, which have performed very consistently in 2007.

The funds target a 7-day LIBID return with capital security and low volatility and they continue to achieve this.

Total investment return and interest income was 24.6m up substantially from the 14.5m earned last year.
