productivity 1. k 1 6. k represents how productive fee earners are in the business and is calculated by gross profit per dividing the gross profit for the year by the average number of fee earners and fee earner directors.
the higher the number, the higher their productivity.
productivity is a function of the rate of investment in new fee earners, the impact of pricing and the general conditions of the recruitment market.

support staff the movement this year demonstrates faster growth in fee earners in relation to ratio support staff.
Debtor days 8 represents the length of time the company receives payments from its debtors.

the decrease in productivity is as a result of the large increase in headcount particularly in the second half of the year, as new fee earners can take a number of months to become fully productive.
Debtor days have increased largely as a result of a greater proportion of receivables being in Continental europe where our debtor days are generally higher than in the uK.
the ratio of fee earners to support staff has increased as a result of continued efficiencies arising from our effective use of technology and economies of scale.
