Cautionary statement about forward looking statements The Annual Report and Financial Statements contain certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial position, results of operations and business of the Group.
Examples of forward looking statements include those regarding ore reserve and mineral resource estimates, anticipated production or construction commencement dates, costs, outputs, demand, trends in commodity prices, growth opportunities and productive lives of assets or similar factors.
The words intend, aim, project, anticipate, estimate, plan, believe, expect, may, should, will, continue, or similar expressions, commonly identify such forward looking statements.
Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are beyond the Groups control.
For example, future ore reserves will be based in part on long term price assumptions that may vary significantly from current levels.
These may materially affect the timing and feasibility of particular developments.
Other factors include the ability to produce and transport products profitably, demand for products, the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, activities by governmental authorities, such as changes in taxation or regulation, and political uncertainty.
Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, actual results could be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward looking statements which speak only as at the date of this report.
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Group does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.
The Group cannot guarantee that its forward looking statements will not differ materially from actual results.
