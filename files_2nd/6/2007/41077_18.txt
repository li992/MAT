Following the transfer, the Groups gearing at 30 June 2006 reduced to 62%.
At 31 December 2006 the Group converted to a REIT.
This gave rise to a number of major changes: Appropriation of income m the Group no longer attracted tax liabilities on its rental earnings and capital gains: 70 Profit before tax the Groups provision for deferred tax of 141.3m at 30 September 60 Net Interest 2006 was eliminated: Admin Expenses 50 Direct Costs 40 a current tax liability of 18.8m arising from the conversion charge 30 of 2% of the value of the Groups portfolio at 31 December 2006 20 arose.
This tax liability is payable in July 2007.
Your Board 10 considered that, had the Group not converted to a REIT, it was 0 likely that a substantial proportion of this sum would have been 03 04 05 06 07 payable over 2007 and 2008 anyway due to both mainstream tax on the Groups profits and capital gains tax liability arising from sales that were anticipated over this period.

At the same time, net asset value has B Offices and Studios 7% increased due to the net movement in these provisions.
The Group C Business Centres 74% has always reported both Trading Earnings per Share which are based on the cash trading performance of the business and B eliminates the impact of valuation surpluses and their related tax adjustments and Adjusted Net Asset Value which excludes deferred C tax provisions.
These provide a more meaningful guide to performance in the period although Adjusted Net Asset Value carries the 18.8m 11p per share conversion tax charge which is an exceptional liability arising from conversion.
During the year, interest rates have risen with LIBOR moving from 4.61% to 5.62% peaking at 5.63% and averaging 5.09% over the year.

This result was assisted by the Groups conversion 192.3m 49% to 582.6m due mainly to the valuation surplus for to a REIT which resulted in the net release of 101.5m deferred tax the year of 95.3m 55 pence per share which this year as a REIT provisions during the year.

Profits before tax at 112.5m were down on last year 2006: 149.0m.
The reduction arose principally from a lower valuation surplus for the Investment properties at 1,001.6m are 47.6m up on 2006 2006: year at 95.3m 2006: 131.3m.
Acquisitions and improvements for the year totalled on pre-valuation values and was driven principally by rental Valuation by investment tenure improvements.
As such, it was a good result.
Trading profits before tax at 10.2m were also reduced from last years level 2006: 15.1m.
The contributory factors to this, as noted above, were higher interest A C A Freehold 89% B rates overall and, aligned to this, the negative contribution from B Long Leasehold 7% C Part Freehold recent acquisitions.

Profit before tax included a 4.4m contribution from profits on disposals 2006: 3.4m.
Details of disposals are given on page 85.
This profit arose mainly from the disposal of the portfolio of properties to the newly formed joint venture with Glebe.
In accordance with accounting convention, only 50% of this profit has been recognised at this stage.
The other 50% will be recognised if and when the assets transferred are disposed of by the joint venture and the profit realised.

At the trading level, the reduction in earnings per share at 6.4p 2006: 7.1p of 10% was substantially less than the reduction in profits B before tax again due to a tax credit of 0.5m for the year.
This credit was attributable in part to REIT conversion, with no tax charge for the C 4th quarter, and partly due to balancing capital allowances on disposals.
Taxation Overall a net tax credit of 80.9m was recorded for the year.
This credit has arisen principally from the net deferred tax released on conversion to a REIT and may be analysed as: 102.1m, with disposals totalling 149.5m leaving a net reduction in m investment property of 47.4m which, when applied to the 95.3m Current Tax: valuation surplus, reduced the net increase to 47.6m.
Tax charge for the year 2.2 Prior year adjustment 0.4 The improvement in net worth arises principally from the 166.9m REIT conversion charge 18.8 reduction in non-current liabilities.
101.5m of this arose from the Deferred tax: net release of deferred tax liability on conversion to a REIT, referred Net provision released 101.5 to earlier, with a further 65.4m arising from reductions in longer term borrowings.
In turn 19.5m of this borrowing reduction arose 80.9 from the reclassification of the Groups debenture stock as a current liability.
