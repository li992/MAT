OPER OPERA ATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW TING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS Northern Rocks core business is secured residential lending, which comprises over 90% by value of total loans to customers.
The balance of our loans to customers includes a portfolio of personal unsecured loans and a small portfolio of secured commercial loans.
OVERVIEW OF 2007 During the first half of 2007, Northern Rocks operational performance was in line with our previously stated strategic targets, with asset growth of 12.4% over the six months to 30 June 2007.
Margin pressure was experienced in the first half of 2007, due in large part to the prevailing interest rate environment.
Increases in Bank Base Rate had a negative impact on net interest income, as the mortgage market was slow to reflect interest rate increases in product pricing.
Increases in money market and swap rates also had a negative impact on our financial performance due to the timing of our hedge transactions for fixed rate mortgages.
As a result we changed our policy on hedging such interest rate risk by accelerating the timing of transacting the hedges to reduce the future exposure to this risk.
On 27 June 2007 we revised downward our profit guidance.
Northern Rock raised 12.1 billion in aggregate in the first half of 2007 to support our growth through the four funding channels of wholesale funding, securitisations, covered bond issues and retail deposits.
We also sold the first tranche of our commercial secured loans in June 2007 to Lehman Commercial Mortgage Conduit Limited, with further tranches sold in the second half of the year.
These transactions provided additional funding for secured residential lending amounting to 1.46 billion.
As at 30 June 2007 around 75% of Northern Rocks total funding was sourced from the non-retail money markets with 53.8 billion of our total non-retail funding balances of 80.5 billion, i. e. two thirds, raised from securitisations and covered bonds.
Concerns about credit exposure in financial markets began to surface in the summer of 2007 and credit spreads the cost of credit increased.
The announcement by a major US investment bank of difficulties in one of its investment conduits and subsequent similar announcements by other banks led to a serious disruption in the medium term funding markets on 9 August 2007.
This quickly led to severe restrictions in the liquidity of the short term wholesale markets.
Despite these restrictions during August and early September 2007, we continued to fund in the short dated wholesale markets and maintained significant balances of liquid assets whilst we, together with our advisers, sought to find a solution to likely funding difficulties should the markets not recover.
Such a solution included discussions with interested parties about the sale of the Company.
In the week commencing 10 September 2007, despite the fact that we continued to raise funds at shorter durations, the general tightening of longer term liquidity and the closure of the securitisation and medium term markets meant it was necessary to arrange a facility in case such markets failed to reopen.
Therefore we approached the Bank of England for a liquidity support facility which was provided at a premium rate of interest.
In the days that followed the grant of the Bank of England loan facility, there were significant withdrawals by Northern Rocks retail depositors reflecting customers concerns as to the security of their savings.
Although we had liquid resources totalling 5.9 billion in early September 2007, in addition to the treasury investment portfolio, the substantial amount of retail deposits withdrawn, together with the impact of maturing wholesale funding, contributed to Northern Rock having to draw on the Bank of England facility.
On 17 September 2007, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that, should it be necessary, arrangements would be put in place to guarantee all existing deposits in Northern Rock during the current instability in the financial markets, which significantly slowed the level of customer withdrawals.
The guarantee arrangements were clarified and extended by HM Treasury on 20 and 21 September, 9 October and 18 December 2007 to include all unsecured retail products, all uncollateralised and unsubordinated wholesale deposits and wholesale borrowings, all payment obligations under any uncollateralised derivative transactions and all obligations of the Company to make payments on the repurchase of mortgages under the documentation for the Granite securitisation programme.
In order to minimise any unfair commercial advantage to the Company, Northern Rock has agreed to pay a fee to HM Treasury for the guarantee arrangements.
In the weeks following the initial announcement of the HM Treasury guarantee arrangements, Northern Rocks level of retail deposits stabilised.
As a result of the significant diminution of our retail deposits and our inability to raise sufficient new finance in the interbank and wholesale markets, lending activities have been significantly reduced with effect from the last quarter in 2007.
Our need to fund at higher rates than average spreads on existing liabilities had a substantial impact on margins on new and existing business.
The Bank of England facility has also supported operating cash flows and the repayment of maturing non-retail liabilities.
25 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued STRATEGIC REVIEW Following the events of September 2007, we engaged in a strategic review process with our advisers, having consulted with the Tripartite Authorities comprising the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and HM Treasury acting in their respective capacities, to look at a range of options for the business: these included proposals put forward by both the Board and third parties.
All of the proposals would have required substantial continuing support from HM Treasury and the Bank of England in the medium term.
At the beginning of February 2008 both the Company and a third party submitted proposals to the Tripartite Authorities.
On 17 February 2008, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the Government had decided to take Northern Rock into a period of temporary public ownership.
The necessary legislation for this was passed so that the Ordinary, Preference and Foundation Shares of Northern Rock were transferred to the Treasury Solicitor on 22 February 2008.
An independent valuer appointed by HM Treasury will determine the level of any compensation payable to shareholders.
TEMPORARY PUBLIC OWNERSHIP The objectives of the Tripartite Authorities in providing the liquidity support facilities and guarantee arrangements and in taking the Company into temporary public ownership are to: Protect taxpayers Maintain wider financial stability Protect consumers As a consequence, the Companys previous annual strategic targets of asset growth of 20% 5%, growth in underlying profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 20% 5% and return on equity of 20% 25% are no longer appropriate.
The Companys prime objectives now are: The repayment of the Bank of England debt The release of HM Treasury guarantee arrangements A successful return to the private sector To meet these objectives, whilst complying with European State aid rules including compensatory measures and in light of market conditions, it will be necessary to restructure our business and significantly reduce the size of the Groups balance sheet.
This will be achieved principally through redemptions from existing loan books, whereas previously asset growth was supported by our strong customer retention policy.
Where appropriate, asset disposals will also be considered in order to accelerate repayment of the Bank of England debt.
New mortgage lending will be significantly reduced compared with historic levels and will be balanced with funding generated in the retail and non-retail funding markets.
In 2008, we have stopped offering our Together range of loans, which comprised a combined secured and unsecured loan aimed particularly at first time buyers, and have withdrawn from new personal unsecured lending.
This revised lending strategy will further focus our capabilities and infrastructure on our core business of secured residential lending, to enable a viable business to emerge in the future following repayment of the Bank of England debt.
Pricing and credit criteria for new lending will be set to appropriately manage volumes, profitability and credit risk.
Prior to the Groups liquidity problems, growth was supported by funding from the securitisation, covered bond, wholesale and retail deposit markets.
Going forward, it is intended that the mix of funding will change with a target balance of 50% from retail deposits and 50% from non-retail funding over the next three to four years, as retail balances recover and non-retail balances mature.
It is intended that our retail deposit balances will recover gradually on an annual basis but that our market share of balances during the restructuring period will remain below our previous historic peak.
Retail deposits will continue to be available in branches, online and by post.
We intend to retain our offshore Guernsey and Ireland retail operations but will close our small Danish branch.
The Northern Rock brand will be retained.
The revised strategy and business model require a period of stabilisation and restructuring.
As the Bank of England debt is repaid there will be significant contraction in the balance sheet over the next two to three years, with a rebalancing of our funding profile.
Over the next four years we will also seek release from the guarantee arrangements to depositors provided by HM Treasury.
EMPLOYEES Northern Rock values its reputation as a caring employer and has always sought to attract and retain high calibre employees.
Opportunities for training are given a high priority to ensure that all individuals can contribute to their own career development.
This approach extends itself to the fair treatment of people with disabilities in relation to their recruitment, training and development.
26 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Restructuring the organisation and its operations to meet the revised objectives of the business will result in lower staffing levels.
The final outcome will, however, depend upon the evolution of the business in light of market and economic developments.
The Company is committed to doing all it can to communicate openly with staff and to provide the best possible support during the restructuring process.
We will work closely with UNITE and other employee representatives to reduce staff numbers in a fair and considered manner.
Outplacement services will be provided to help affected staff find alternative employment, working closely with local agencies including One NorthEast.
As an integral part of our commitment to provide appropriate reward and retention strategies for employees, Northern Rock had in place a number of share based plans see note 8 to the Accounts.
Following the Companys move into temporary public ownership, these plans have been cancelled.
It is intended that a company-wide incentive scheme will be introduced for all staff, linked to the achievement of revised business objectives.
2007 OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE LENDING Total gross lending in 2007 was 32,251 million 2006 32,989 million, with total net lending of 12,211 million 2006 16,621 million.
At the start of 2008 the pipeline of business was significantly lower than at the start of 2007 due to our reduced appetite for new business given funding constraints described above.
Closing balances are stated including fair value adjustments.
At 31 December 2007, 92.2% by value of our loans to customers were residential secured loans 31 December 2006 89.8%, 0.3% commercial secured loans 31 December 2006 1.8% and 7.5% within our personal unsecured portfolios 31 December 2006 8.4%.
In the second half of 2007 our residential and unsecured lending volumes reduced reflecting funding conditions.
This resulted in negative net lending in the fourth quarter of 2007, following the rundown of the half year pipeline and as a result of the active steps we took to reduce retention of maturing loans.
The low level of growth of personal unsecured assets reflects lower levels of new unsecured lending and redemptions from the book.
The reduction in commercial balances reflects the assets which were sold to Lehman Commercial Mortgage Conduit Limited during 2007.
27 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued RESIDENTIAL UK MARKET The UK residential lending market remained buoyant during most of 2007 resulting in gross lending for the year of 364 billion, an increase of 6% over the 345 billion seen in 2006.
During the year, lending associated with house moving represented around 60%, with 40% driven by remortgage activity.
UK residential net lending in 2007 at 108 billion represented a small decrease of 2% 2006 110 billion.
RESIDENTIAL NORTHERN ROCK PERFORMANCE In 2007 gross residential lending was 29,494 million 2006 28,972 million and net residential lending was 13,306 million 2006 15,090 million.
The following analysis of mortgage lending is based on total gross lending in each year.
2007 2006 %% Type of lending Fixed rate long term over 2 years 17 23 Fixed rate short term up to and including 2 years 43 33 Discount 45 Together 27 31 Lifetime 11 Buy to Let 87 Type of customer First time buyer 20 24 Next time buyer 48 44 Remortgage 32 32 Geographic spread North 12 14 Scotland Northern Ireland 10 10 Midlands 22 26 South 56 50 The average Loan to Value LTV ratio of new lending in 2007 increased to 79% 2006 78%.
New lending at or below 90% LTV reduced slightly to 77% 2006 78% of completions.
The average indexed LTV representing the current loan balances as a percentage of updated property valuations of our mortgage book at the year end remained at 60%.
New lending continued to be geographically spread across the UK.
Our Lifetime mortgage portfolio comprising products aimed at homeowners aged 60 and over who wish to utilise equity in their homes to enhance their lifestyle was sold to JP Morgan in January 2008 at a premium of 2.25% to the balance sheet value.
The proceeds of this sale of approximately 2.2 billion were used to reduce the level of the facility with the Bank of England.
In February 2008 we withdrew the Together products from our new loan product range in line with other mortgage lenders.
28 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued UNSECURED Our personal unsecured credit portfolios comprise the unsecured element of Together lending and standalone unsecured loans not linked to a residential mortgage.
An analysis of lending volumes on the separate elements of our unsecured portfolios is shown in the following table: Standalone Together Unsecured Unsecured Total m m m 2007 Full Year Gross 1,492 1,020 2,512 Net 241 416 175 Closing balances 3,980 3,371 7,351 2007 2nd Half Gross 391 417 808 Net 473 94 379 Closing balances 3,980 3,371 7,351 2007 1st Half Gross 1,101 603 1,704 Net 232 322 554 Closing balances 4,497 3,332 7,829 2006 Full Year Gross 2,332 1,262 3,594 Net 782 709 1,491 Closing balances 4,221 3,056 7,277 Standalone unsecured gross lending slowed in line with our reduced lending appetite.
Net lending was negative as the portfolio matured and redemptions and repayments increased.
Volumes of new Together unsecured lending were broadly in line with the growth of Together mortgage lending with the unsecured element being 14% of combined Together advances 2006 15%.
In February 2008 we withdrew the Together products from our new loan product range and in March 2008 we discontinued offering new standalone unsecured lending products.
As a consequence, these unsecured loan portfolios will run-off over time.
COMMERCIAL Following the adoption of Basle II and the higher capital requirements for commercial loans compared with residential loans, Northern Rock decided to sell the majority of our commercial loan portfolio to Lehman Commercial Mortgage Conduit Limited.
This was achieved in three tranches between June and October 2007 at a premium of just over 1%, raising cash of 1.46 billion in total.
Following these sales, the remaining commercial loan portfolio amounted to 0.3 billion at 31 December 2007 2006 1.6 billion.
TREASURY INVESTMENTS Treasury investments represented 7.3% of Northern Rocks balance sheet at the end of 2007.
Holdings of capital notes before impairments in Structured Investment Vehicles SIVs totalled 327 million at 31 December 2007.
These SIV investments are classified as loans and receivables and are carried at cost but are subject to a test for impairment.
The Companys SIV investments have been assessed on a case by case basis including whether committed funding is in place.
Following this assessment and taking into account the net asset value NAV of each SIV, an impairment charge of 232.2 million has been made in relation to this investment portfolio, which is reflected in the current year financial statements.
The Companys portfolio of US$ collateralised debt obligations CDOs, before impairments, amounted to 195.5 million at the end of December 2007.
An impairment provision of 178.3 million has been made against this portfolio at the end of the year.
In addition, a mark to market reduction in value of this portfolio of 11.2 million has been recorded within the available for sale AFS reserve.
A review of our other AFS assets has been undertaken, and while these have seen market price falls, these falls are considered to be due to widening credit spreads and liquidity shortages rather than the performance of the underlying assets.
Consequently, no provision for impairment is considered necessary against this portfolio.
The fair value of AFS assets in total are recorded on the balance sheet at 6.0 billion.
29 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued FUNDING Northern Rock traditionally had four funding arms comprising wholesale funding, securitisation, covered bonds and retail deposits.
Since the arrangement of the loan facility with the Bank of England in September 2007, Northern Rock has primarily depended on this source of funding to meet retail deposit outflows, contractual maturities in the non-retail books and net lending.
Flows of each funding channel and closing balances are shown in the following table: Retail Wholesale Securitisation Covered Bonds m m m m 2007 Full Year Net flow 12,168 11,695 1,283 2,194 Closing balances 10,469 11,472 43,070 8,938 2007 2nd Half Net flow 13,902 14,204 4,349 Closing balances 10,469 11,472 43,070 8,938 2007 1st Half Net flow 1,734 2,509 5,632 2,194 Closing balances 24,350 26,710 45,698 8,105 2006 Full Year Net flow 2,527 2,876 10,628 2,733 Closing balances 22,631 24,240 40,226 6,202 Note: Net flow represents net cash flows excluding fair value adjustments.
At 31 December 2007, Northern Rock had borrowed 26.9 billion from the Bank of England under the loan facility described above.
RETAIL Retail funding comprised a full year net outflow of funds of 12.2 billion, compared with a net inflow of 1.7 billion in the first half of the year and net inflow in 2006 of 2.5 billion.
Closing retail balances comprised: 2007 2006 m m Branch accounts 3,035 5,573 Postal accounts 4,351 10,201 Internet accounts 1,531 2,225 Offshore accounts 1,088 3,614 Telephone accounts 181 527 Legal & General branded accounts 283 491 Total retail balances 10,469 22,631 During the first half of the year, new retail funding was largely into our Silver Savings accounts which are available online, via post and through our branch network and Fixed Rate bonds.
In March 2008, we announced our intention to close our retail funding operation in Denmark.
Northern Rocks offshore retail funding operations in Ireland and Guernsey remain in place.
30 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued WHOLESALE During the first half of the year we raised a net 2.5 billion of wholesale funding, including 2.0 billion medium term wholesale funds from the US and Europe.
This included US$2.0 billion senior debt issued to domestic US investors and 1.0 billion raised from a benchmark senior debt issue targeted at European investors.
The second half of the year saw substantial outflows of wholesale funds, as maturing loans and deposits were not renewed.
This resulted in a full year net outflow of 11.7 billion.
Our current credit ratings following temporary public ownership are set out in the following table: Standard & Poors Moodys FitchIBCA Short term A1 P1 F1 Long term A positive outlook A2 watch developing A stable outlook SECURITISATION Securitisation is the process whereby Northern Rock, through the Granite programme, is able to raise wholesale funding secured on a segregated pool of mortgage assets.
These assets are held in special purpose entities SPEs set up for this purpose, which are fully consolidated in Northern Rocks financial statements.
Northern Rock retains an economic interest in the SPEs through a combination of subordinated loans and profit retained in the SPEs.
The mortgages which are used are broadly representative of Northern Rocks total mortgage book and the Company does not provide any credit support to the SPEs by removing any loans in arrears from them.
Borrowings secured on this pool of mortgages may not be repaid from any source other than the proceeds of those mortgages within the pool.
In order to maintain this funding structure, Northern Rock periodically sells further mortgages to the SPEs when necessary.
During the first half of 2007, two residential mortgage-backed issues were completed raising 10.7 billion gross 2006 17.8 billion and 5.6 billion net 2006 10.6 billion through our Granite vehicles.
As with previous issues, the characteristics of the mortgages securitised, in terms of product type, LTV and geographic distribution were similar to those of our non-securitised mortgages.
The pricing of these issues continued the trend of being at lower cost than maturing older deals they were replacing.
No new Granite paper was issued to the market during the second half of the year as investor demand for this type of instrument reduced significantly.
However, in September 2007 a securitisation issue of 5.0 billion was undertaken in which Northern Rock retained all of the notes issued.
At 31 December 2007, securitised notes in the Group balance sheet amounted to 43.1 billion 31 December 2006 40.2 billion, representing 58% 31 December 2006 43% of our total funding balances.
COVERED BONDS Covered bonds are secured by a pool of ring-fenced residential mortgages.
In the first half of 2007 we increased the size of the covered bond programme to 30 billion and completed three issues raising 2.2 billion 2006 2.7 billion.
The bonds were issued in a range of maturities from five to ten years and included a small privately placed sterling bond 250 million and our inaugural US dollar issue of $1.5 billion 754 million equivalent.
No further funds were raised through the covered bond programme in the second half of the year due to prevailing market conditions.
At 31 December 2007, covered bonds in the Group balance sheet amounted to 8.9 billion 31 December 2006 6.2 billion representing 12.1% 31 December 2006 6.6% of our total funding balances.
BANK OF ENGLAND FACILITY Borrowings provided by the Bank of England under the loan facility amounted to 26.9 billion at the end of 2007 and are included in note 28 to the Accounts.
The repayment of the Bank of England facility will be a key performance objective of the business over the next few years.
31 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued 2007 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND POSITION The summary income statement for 2007 and 2006 is set out as follows: 2007 2006 m m Net interest income 761.4 818.1 Other income 39.0 198.7 Total income 722.4 1,016.8 Administrative expenses 276.1 277.5 Non-recurring expenses 127.2 Covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation 14.8 31.4 Total expenses 418.1 308.9 Impairment charges on loans and advances 239.7 81.2 Impairment charges on unsecured investment loans 232.2 Loss profit before taxation 167.6 626.7 Income tax expense 31.4 183.7 Loss profit for the year 199.0 443.0 Attributable to: Appropriations 44.5 48.5 Loss profit attributable to equity shareholders 243.5 394.5 Total 199.0 443.0 Basic loss earnings per share 65.6 p 94.6p TOTAL INCOME AND INTEREST MARGIN AND SPREAD The following table shows net interest income, total income and income ratios for 2007 and 2006.
2007 2006 m m Net interest income 761.4 818.1 Other income 39.0 198.7 Total income 722.4 1,016.8 Total income: mean total assets 0.69% 1.11% Total income: mean risk weighted assets 3.82% 3.56% Interest margin 0.70% 0.92% Interest spread 0.52% 0.77% Note: Interest margin has been calculated by reference to average interest earning assets excluding fair value adjustments.
Average balances have been calculated on a monthly basis.
Interest spread represents the difference between interest receivable as a % of average interest earning assets, excluding fair value adjustments, and interest payable as a % of average interest bearing liabilities, excluding fair value adjustments.
For the purpose of calculating interest margin and spread, average balances for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, where these have been economically hedged, are based on the contract rate implicit in the associated hedging instrument.
Interest margin at 0.70% and interest spread at 0.52% compares with the 2006 ratios of 0.92% and 0.77% respectively.
The reduction in spread primarily reflects the lower margin mortgage business written in the first half of 2007 and the higher funding costs in the second half of the year due to the Bank of England funding being charged at a premium rate above the existing average cost of funds.
32 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued The table below shows an analysis of other income: 2007 2006 m m Net fee and commission income 137.4 150.3 Other operating income 1.3 1.4 Losses gains on available for sale securities 136.6 45.1 Gain on disposal of loan book 23.8 Net trading expense income 64.9 1.9 Total other income 39.0 198.7 Net fee and commission income mainly comprises valuation commission, commission income generated on sales of third party products such as building and contents and payment protection insurance less third party administration fees not included within net interest income.
Losses gains on available for sale securities in 2007 comprise realised gains on AFS securities sold primarily in the first half of 2007 amounting to 41.7 million offset by a charge of 178.3 million in the second half of the year in relation to impairments on US$ CDOs.
The gain on disposal of loan book represents the gain realised on the sale of the secured commercial loan portfolio to Lehman Commercial Mortgage Conduit Limited.
Net trading expense income includes gains on fair value movements on derivatives not in designated hedge accounting relationships of 998.4 million 2006 - loss of 2,811.8 million, together with cross-currency exchange rate losses of 1,045.2 million 2006 gain of 2,812.6 million.
These are covered in more detail below within the narrative on hedge ineffectiveness.
In addition, within net trading expense income is a negative movement in the fair value of treasury investment securities designated as held at fair value through the income statement amounting to 21.1 million 2006 gain of 0.5 million.
HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS Volatility in reported results arises from hedge ineffectiveness on derivative instruments that hedge risk exposure on an economic basis.
Such accounting volatility, which will offset over time, arises due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain transactions.
The Company manages its risk exposures on an economic basis and does not include accounting hedge ineffectiveness in the assessment of its operating performance or in assessing the effectiveness of its derivative positions in any one financial period.
An analysis of hedge ineffectiveness and other fair value gains and losses is set out below: 2007 2006 m m Fair value hedge ineffectiveness 6.7 14.1 Cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 7.5 Hedge ineffectiveness included within interest margin 0.8 14.1 Fair value movements on hedging derivatives 998.4 2,811.8 Cross-currency movements 1,045.2 2,812.6 46.8 0.8 Total hedge ineffectiveness and other fair value gains and losses 47.6 14.9 Northern Rock enters into derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes.
Some of these are designated and accounted for as IAS 39 compliant fair value or cash flow hedge relationships.
Where effective fair value hedge relationships can be established, the movement in the fair value of the derivative instrument is offset in full or in part by opposite movements in the fair value of the instrument being hedged.
Any ineffectiveness arising from different movements in fair value will offset over time.
Ineffectiveness is included within 33 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued interest income or expense, as appropriate.
This represents a change in accounting presentation in 2007, as previously this was included within net hedge ineffectiveness and other fair value gains and losses see note 3 to the Accounts.
Where derivatives are economically effective for hedging purposes but cannot be included within effective IAS 39 compliant accounting hedge relationships, the movement in their fair value is recorded within net trading expense.
These are also excluded from managements view of operational performance as these fair value adjustments are not realised in the current accounting period.
The same treatment applies to the revaluation at each balance sheet date of economically hedged foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to some currency mis-match in its assets and liabilities denominated in US$ and euros.
This resulted in gains of 130 million from mid-September 2007 to the year end, which are included within cross-currency movements above.
In addition to the above table, interest related fair value movements on forward exchange contracts represented a gain of 49.6 million in 2007 2006 gain of 26.1 million, giving a net gain on hedge ineffectiveness of 2.0 million in 2007 2006 gain of 41.0 million.
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES excluding non-recurring expenses and the covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation 2007 2006 m m Staff costs 158.6 162.0 Other expenses 88.6 85.2 Depreciation and amortisation 28.9 30.3 Total operating expenses 276.1 277.5 Total operating expenses amounted to 276.1 million, representing a decrease of 0.5% 2006 277.5 million.
Included within the 2007 operating expenses is a credit for staff share schemes of 8.8 million 2006 expense of 16.5 million as performance conditions for certain share schemes were not met.
Also included are gains on property sale and leasebacks of 7.5 million 2006 nil.
NON-RECURRING EXPENSES Non-recurring expenses of 127.2 million were incurred during the second half of 2007 representing professional fees and costs incurred as a result of the strategic review process.
In addition, impairment charges have also been incurred in relation to certain property and software as described below.
2007 m Professional fees incurred by the Company 21.2 Professional fees recharged by the Tripartite Authorities 12.5 Corporate advisory fees 2.5 Reimbursement of third party expenses 5.1 Cost of staff withdrawals from Save As You Earn schemes 4.5 Other non-recurring administrative expenses 5.2 Non-recurring administrative expenses 51.0 Impairment charges on fixed assets 76.2 Total non-recurring expenses 127.2 Impairment charges on fixed assets have arisen in 2007 primarily on properties in the course of construction at the Groups head office sites in Gosforth and Sunderland, as well as accelerated write off of capitalised software.
These charges reflect the changed circumstances of the Group in 2007 leading to the cancellation of planned expansion.
This has been further clarified by the revised business and funding plan to be implemented under temporary public ownership.
The impairment of properties in the course of construction includes provision in respect of costs to complete the properties in excess of their estimated value following completion.
34 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued CREDIT QUALITY AND LOAN LOSS IMPAIRMENT The arrears position of each of our main personal lending portfolios based upon numbers of accounts three months or more in arrears is set out in the table below: CML Residential Together Together Standalone Residential Secured Unsecured Unsecured Average 31 December 2007 1.10% 0.57% 1.07% 1.15% 1.52% 30 June 2007 1.05% 0.47% 0.90% 0.97% 1.11% 31 December 2006 1.02% 0.42% 0.84% 0.85% 1.09% Source: Northern Rock and Council of Mortgage Lenders CML Residential accounts three months or more in arrears at 0.57% were higher than the equivalent figure of 0.47% at the half year, reflecting deteriorating market conditions but remained well below the CML average of 1.10%.
The Together secured three months plus arrears have increased during the year to be 1.07% at the year end from 0.90% at the half year and 0.84% at 31 December 2006, reflecting worsening market conditions.
At 31 December 2007, properties in possession totalled 2,215, representing 0.29% of all accounts compared with 1,314 0.17% at the half year and 662 0.09% at the end of 2006.
This increase is in line with our policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower will not maintain payments and where we have higher risk.
Three months plus arrears within our standalone personal unsecured loan portfolio were 1.52% at the end of 2007 compared with 1.09% at 31 December 2006 and 1.11% at 30 June 2007.
The increase in standalone unsecured arrears since the half year is in large part due to the contraction of the unsecured loan book.
Together unsecured arrears have also increased in line with the increase in Together secured arrears.
At 31 December 2007, 0.81% of our commercial loan accounts with balances outstanding of 4.3 million were three months or more in arrears compared with 0.31% of accounts with outstanding balances of 20.5 million at 31 December 2006.
The 2007 charge for customer loan loss impairment amounted to 239.7 million 2006 81.2 million representing 0.26% of mean advances to customers 2006 0.10%.
The increases in the loan loss impairment charge and year end impairment provision balances reflect the increase in default rates highlighted by higher arrears and properties in possession but also a significant deterioration in forecast recoveries on impaired loans.
The reduction in house prices reported for the last quarter of 2007, together with further anticipated falls as evidenced by trends in losses in the first quarter of 2008 have resulted in an increase in expected losses to be incurred on impaired mortgage loans.
Anticipated recoveries on impaired unsecured loans have also fallen dramatically as customers equity in their residential properties is expected to continue to fall and the market for debt sales since the year end has substantially disappeared.
We will remain focussed on managing our lending portfolios as the book reduces in line with the objective of achieving redemptions in order to repay the Bank of England debt.
However, it is expected there will be a negative impact on loan loss impairment charges in the future as the propensity of customers to default increases and recoveries on defaulted loans reduce further.
Loan loss impairment provisions and coverage at the year end are set out in the following table: Residential Commercial Unsecured Total 2007 Impairment provision m 63.7 0.7 178.6 243.0 % share of closing balances 0.07% 0.22% 2.37% 0.25% 2006 Impairment provision m 26.2 7.4 92.4 126.0 % share of closing balances 0.03% 0.47% 1.25% 0.15% 35 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued TAXATION Based on a loss before tax of 167.6 million, the effective tax rate in 2007 is a charge of 18.74% of pre-tax losses 2006 29.31% of pre-tax profits.
This rate is unusually high and is largely due to the non recognition of a deferred tax asset and the high level of non-recurring, non-tax deductible expenses recognised in 2007.
% Expected effective corporation tax rate based on the standard corporation tax rate for 2007 of 30% 30.00 Deferred income tax asset not recognised 33.23 Non-recurring, non-tax deductible expenses 22.26 Restatement of the group deferred tax liability from 30% 0.36 Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses 2.00 Current year recurring, non taxable income 0.24 Other net prior year adjustments 4.87 Effective tax rate 18.74 DIVIDENDS The final ordinary dividend for 2006 of 25.3p was paid to shareholders on 25 May 2007.
The interim dividend for 2007 was declared at 14.2p 2006 10.9p and was due to be paid in the second half of the year.
However, as a result of the challenging conditions faced by the Company, the Board considered that it was not appropriate to pay this dividend and it was therefore cancelled.
No ordinary dividend has been declared for the full year 2007.
Preference share dividends amounting to 27.8 million were paid on 4 July 2007.
RECONCILIATION OF STATUTORY AND UNDERLYING PROFIT BEFORE TAX As described above, management do not consider the volatility in reported income arising from hedge ineffectiveness in their assessment of operating performance of the Group in any one financial period and have historically reported underlying results together with statutory results.
In line with financial information provided by the Group prior to temporary public ownership, realised gains on swaps closed in the first half of the year are included in underlying results.
In addition, non-recurring expenses and impairments on treasury assets are excluded from managements assessment of underlying results as set out in the following table: 2007 2006 m m Statutory loss profit before tax 167.6 626.7 Adjustments: Hedge ineffectiveness 2.0 41.0 Impairment on treasury assets 410.5 Non-recurring expenses 127.2 Realised gain on swaps 39.0 Net losses gains on changes in fair value from assets held at fair value 21.1 0.5 Notional impact on covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation 6.3 2.0 Underlying profit before tax 421.9 587.2 The shortfall in 2007 underlying profit relative to managements expectations at the end of last year is primarily due to the increase in expected losses on impaired loans.
The deterioration as described above reflects a number of factors emerging from the fourth quarter of 2007 including falling house prices and much lower anticipated recoveries on impaired loans.
36 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued COMPOSITION OF BALANCE SHEET Following the receipt of the liquidity support facility from the Bank of England in September 2007, Northern Rocks balance sheet changed significantly by the year end, particularly in relation to the composition of liabilities.
Retail deposits fell to 10.5 billion compared to 22.6 billion at 31 December 2006 as customers withdrew funds.
Wholesale funding balances also fell to 11.5 billion compared with 24.2 billion at 31 December 2006 as counterparties withdrew balances on maturity dates.
No new securitisation or covered bond issues were undertaken in the second half of 2007.
These changes contributed to the drawdown on the Bank of England facility amounting to 26.9 billion at 31 December 2007.
Liquid assets at 31 December 2007 are significantly lower than at the end of 2006 as all cash assets have been used to repay liabilities, with liquidity requirements being met by the Bank of England facility.
2007 Assets 109.3bn Liabilities 109.3bn 4% 7% 3% 3% 10% 26% 7% 10% 8% 83% 39% Residential mortgages Loans from Bank of England Liquid assets Retail Other advances Wholesale Other Securitised bonds Covered bonds Capital Other 2006 Liabilities 101.0bn Assets 101.0bn 6% 9% 4% 1% 3% 13% 41% 22% 77% 24% Residential mortgages Retail Liquid assets Wholesale Other advances Securitised bonds Other Covered bonds Capital Other Over the next two to three years the balance sheet will contract significantly as Northern Rock customers coming to the end of their mortgage product redeem and we continue to restrict new lending volumes.
Other advances will reduce following the decision to cease offering new Together products to customers and the withdrawal from new standalone unsecured lending.
37 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued CAPITAL The following table shows a summary of Northern Rocks capital position at the end of 2007 and 2006.
Further detail on capital is disclosed in note 41 to the Accounts.

On 29 June 2007 the Company received notification of approval by the FSA of our Basle II waiver application and our regulatory capital requirements have been calculated under Basle II with effect from that date.
We have adopted the Retail Internal Ratings Based IRB approach for our residential and personal unsecured loans, the Foundation IRB approach for our treasury portfolios and the Standardised approach for commercial loans and operational risk.
The implementation of Basle II results in lower Pillar I risk weighted assets than under Basle I due to the high proportion of secured residential lending within our loan books.
38 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THE NORTHERN ROCK FOUNDATION Since demutualisation in 1997, Northern Rock has donated 5% of pre tax profit to The Northern Rock Foundation under a deed of covenant.
Such donations are used to support community and charitable causes in the North East of England and Cumbria.
The covenant for 2007 amounts to 14.8 million 2006 full year 31.4 million representing the charge for the first half of 2007.
This results in approximately 190 million having been donated since its inception in 1997.
Following the Company entering into temporary public ownership, we have committed that the Foundation will receive at least 15 million per year in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Further information on The Northern Rock Foundation is available on the Companys website.
OUTLOOK In accordance with European legislation, the Government is required to seek approval for the granting of the facilities to Northern Rock under State aid law, and the continuation of these facilities is dependent upon approval by the European Commission.
A submission to the European Commission was made by the Government on 17 March 2008 and at the date of the approval of the Report and Accounts remained under review.
Going forward the Companys business plan will be aligned with the objectives of the Tripartite Authorities at the time of taking Northern Rock into temporary public ownership.
Together with compliance with European State aid law this will necessitate a significant contraction in the Groups balance sheet driven by increased loan redemptions.
At the same time, new business levels will be significantly lower than in previous years.
New business will be focussed on prime residential mortgages with absolute levels dependent on new funding generated mainly from retail deposits in the UK.
Longer term, it is intended that Northern Rock will return to the private sector as a lower risk, financially viable mortgage and savings bank.
