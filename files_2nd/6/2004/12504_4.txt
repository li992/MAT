13 Premier Foods plc Financial review Pensions We provide retirement benefits for UK employees under our main defined benefit final salary scheme, the Premier Foods Pension Scheme the PF Scheme, which was formed by the merger of three pension schemes in May 2004.
A second smaller defined benefit final salary scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme the PAPPS provides benefits solely for former employees of Unilever Bestfoods employed in the Ambrosia business.
We regularly review our actuarial assumptions and in light of increased inflationary pressures in the economy have changed our FRS 17 assumptions.
The net effect of this adjustment is to increase the reported net deficit after deferred tax in the scheme, as calculated under FRS 17 assumptions to 45.2m.
The revision to the FRS 17 assumptions does not affect the actuarial deficit on which the cash contributions that the Company is making to the scheme are based and contributions remain at the same levels as those made during 2004.
