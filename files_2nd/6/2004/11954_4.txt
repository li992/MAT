FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW Evans Halshaw Wakefield Acquired during 2004 This year our results have been transformed by the acquisition of CD Bramall, which was our largest competitor in the UK.
We paid 293.5 million including assumed borrowings of 52.4 million.
The acquisition was immediately earnings enhancing and contributed underlying operating profits of over 40.0 million in just ten months of ownership.
We incurred exceptional one off costs of 4.7 million as part of the process of integrating the acquired business.
A majority of the costs were incurred to take out duplicate functions which were performed at the Bramall head office and for severance payments made to former directors.
Cash flow Borrowings at 31 December 2004 were 244.8 million compared to 96.7 million at the end of 2003.
At the time of the CD Bramall acquisition we said our target would be to reduce our debt to more normal levels by the end of 2005.
We are on track to achieve our target.
Our pro forma statement, contained in the circular sent to shareholders in February 2004, indicated a debt level at completion of the CD Bramall deal of just under three times shareholders funds.
In the ten months since then we have reduced the gearing ratio to 136.6 per cent.
The reduction in debt has been achieved by a combination of good cash flow from operations and property and business disposals.
m 2004 2003 Cash flow from operating activities 167.1 59.1 Interest paid 23.4 13.8 Tax 19.3 12.3 Replacement capital expenditure 9.4 9.0 Free cash flow 115.0 24.0 Acquisitions 315.4 24.4 Disposals 65.0 37.9 Share buyback - 11.0 Dividend 9.8 10.8 Other 2.9 1.6 Increase reduction in net debt 148.1 17.3 Cash flow generated from operations was 167.1 million, which compares with 59.1 million generated in 2003.
Operating profit, after adding back depreciation and goodwill amortisation, was 110.1 million.
A further 57.0 million of cash was generated in the year as a result of lower working capital utilisation.
The reduction in the second half of the year was 6.3 million compared to a first half reduction of 50.7 million.
Working capital management has been a key part of the integration of the Bramall businesses.
Net interest paid has increased in line with borrowings during the year and, taxation payments in proportion to the higher profits generated within the group.
Replacement capital expenditure was 9.4 million which includes plant and machinery, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles.
Gary Driver & Adele Towers Simon Nestor Service Reception Parts Reception FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW CONTINUED The acquisitions of 315.4 million mainly related to the purchase of CD Bramall at a cost of 293.5 million which includes the final dividend of 2.7 million paid to the former shareholders and assumed borrowings of 52.4 million.
Investment in new property developments was 19.8 million which includes land acquisitions of 7.0 million.
Porsche Centre Wilmslow Refurbished during 2004 Business disposals raised 17.9 million in 2004 2003: 26.1 million, which included the sale of five dealerships and of our stake in our associate company Thrifty.
Property disposals raised 47.1 million 2003: 11.8 million.
Financing costs The total net interest charge for the year of 30.7 million includes both bank interest and vehicle stocking charges.
Bank interest has increased in line with higher debt and stocking charges have increased in line with the level of vehicle stock held in the enlarged group.
Total net interest cover was 3.1 times compared to 4.5 times in 2003.
Tax The overall effective tax rate for the year was 32.2 per cent 2003: 31.2 per cent.
The rate is higher than the standard 30.0 per cent UK tax rate primarily due to depreciation on assets not eligible for capital allowances together with charging goodwill amortisation and incurring trading losses in Germany for which no tax relief in the current year is available.
Earnings per share Reported earnings per share increased by 11.4 pence from 24.5 pence in 2003 to 35.9 pence in 2004.
Earnings per share excluding goodwill amortisation and non trading items increased by 13.3 pence from 20.6 pence to 33.9 pence for 2004.
Dividends The proposed final dividend of 6.0 pence per share will bring the total dividend for the year to 10.2 pence, an increase of 34.2 per cent.
This increase in dividend demonstrates our confidence in the future prospects of the group.
Since the companys shares commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange in 1989 the compound annual growth rate in dividend has been 11.7 per cent.
Treasury policy and procedures Group treasury matters are managed within policy guidelines set by the Board with prime areas of focus being liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange exposure.
Management of these areas is the responsibility of our central treasury function.
Derivative financial instruments are utilised to reduce exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The Board does not permit the speculative use of derivatives.
Funding and liquidity management The group is financed primarily by loan notes, bank loans, vehicle stocking credit lines and operating cash flow.
Committed facilities have a range of maturities, are maintained at levels in excess of planned requirements and are in addition to short term uncommitted facilities that are also available to the group.
Each business within the group is responsible for its own day to day cash management and the overall cash position is monitored on a daily basis by the group treasury department.
Where our overseas subsidiaries borrow to fund their businesses they do so independently of and without recourse to the UK parent company.
Interest rate risk management The objective of the groups interest rate policy is to minimise interest costs whilst protecting the group from adverse movements in interest rates.
The groups policy is to borrow on a floating rate basis as the Board believes that the retail sector in which the group operates provides a natural hedge against interest rate movements.
Consequently, all fixed rate borrowings entered into by the group have been swapped into floating rate.
Foreign exchange risk management The group faces currency risk in respect of its net assets denominated in currencies other than sterling.
On translation into sterling movements in currency will affect the value of these assets.
The groups policy is therefore to match, where possible, net assets in overseas subsidiaries which are denominated in a foreign currency with borrowings in the same currency.
Similarly, where the group borrows in a foreign currency to finance assets denominated in sterling the borrowings are swapped into sterling.
In line with these policies the group has swapped all of its fixed rate loan notes denominated in US dollars into floating rate sterling and has borrowed Euro 18.9 million and USD 40.1 million against its net assets held in overseas subsidiaries.
Acquisition of CD Bramall The group acquired CD Bramall for a total consideration of 238.4 million, excluding debt and the final dividend paid to the former shareholders.
Upon acquisition the book value of the assets acquired were fair valued by making adjustments to align accounting policies and restate assets and liabilities to their estimated market value.
The net impact of the fair value adjustments made reduced the book value of the assets at acquisition from 105.5 million to 93.1 million.
The goodwill on acquisition, being the consideration less fair value, was 145.4 million.
The principal adjustments made were the revaluation of properties and the recognition on balance sheet of the deficits on the pension funds.
Pension Funds The group participates in six defined benefit pension schemes.
The schemes have been closed to new members for a number of years.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with SSAP 24 although we also include, in the notes of the financial statements, details of valuations prepared in accordance with FRS 17.
The pension cost for the year was 6.0 million 2003: 3.5 million.
Under FRS 17 valuation rules the total assets held by the six schemes at the end of the year were 170.2 million against liabilities of 249.7 million giving a deficit before tax of 79.5 million.
Of this 79.5 million, 46.0 million is already recognised as a liability on the balance sheet as a consequence of the fair value exercise for CD Bramall.
International Financial Reporting Standards For reporting periods from 2005 onwards the consolidated accounts of Pendragon are required under European legislation to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The first financial statements that will be published in accordance with IFRS will be the interim statement for the six months to 30 June 2005.
The group has a transition plan to manage the conversion to IFRS.
We will brief the investment community on the changes more fully in advance of our half year statement.
Summary Following the successful acquisition of CD Bramall we have once again demonstrated our ability, through strong operating cash flow and selective disposals, to manage our borrowings efficiently.
Both interest and dividend cover remained at good levels in the year and earnings grew strongly.
