Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2004 11 Finance Directors Report Interest Net interest payable in the year was 171.5 million, which was covered 2.3 times.
All of the debt within the Group is at either fixed rates or is fixed through interest rate swaps.
Tax charge The tax charge of 65.7 million represents an effective rate of 30.8% and is in line with the rate reported at the half-year.
The tax charge comprises corporation tax of 47.8 million and deferred tax of 17.9 million.
The current year corporation tax represents 22.4% of profit before tax.
The cash outflow in respect of tax during the year was 36.3 million and this represents 17.0% of profit before tax.
Dividend payment The directors are recommending the payment of a final dividend of 8.4 pence per ordinary share, to be paid on 24 January 2005.
This will result in a full year dividend of 12.0 pence per share, an increase on 40% on prior year.
The dividend cover, before exceptional items, is almost four times.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Group will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as the basis on which it will report its financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2006.
This adoption is in line with EU regulations passed in 2002 which require all EU listed companies to use endorsed IFRS to report their consolidated results for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The Group is currently preparing for the adoption of IFRS and key finance staff have attended IFRS training courses.
In addition, we have carried out a high level review of the key differences that will arise although we have yet to determine the full effects of adopting IFRS.
Our preliminary view is that the major differences between current accounting practice and IFRS will be in respect of fixed assets, hedge accounting and deferred tax.
In addition, the presentation of the financial statements will be noticeably different.
We note the likely impacts in these three areas as follows: Fixed assets The Group currently revalues its pub estate annually and adjusts the book value of assets accordingly.
The difference between the historic cost of these assets and their revalued amount is held in a revaluation reserve.
The estate is currently valued in line with UK accounting standards on an existing use basis.
IFRS require fixed assets to be valued at fair value and we will work with valuers to ascertain the effect that this may have on the value of the estate.
In addition, in the event that an individual pub falls below its historic cost, any loss must be recognised immediately in the Profit and Loss Account under IFRS.
Finally, a proportion of the value of each pub may need to be depreciated under IFRS rules.
No depreciation is currently charged to the Profit and Loss Account in relation to the pub estate.
Hedge accounting The Group hedges its interest rate risk using interest rate swaps.
The application of UK accounting standards currently results in gains and losses on the swaps being recognised at the same time as the gain or loss on the items being hedged i. e. floating rate debt.
IFRS set out strict criteria that must be met before such hedge accounting can be adopted.
Failure to achieve hedge accounting for a significant proportion of the Groups interest rate swaps may result in increased volatility of both earnings and net assets.
Deferred tax UK standards currently require a deferred tax liability to be recognised where a tax charge in relation to transactions reflected in the financial statements is expected to arise in the future.
IFRS require the recognition of deferred tax liabilities on a different basis and liabilities must be recognised even where they may not crystallise.
The principal difference that will arise in relation to the Group is that a deferred tax liability will have to be recognised following the revaluation of fixed assets.
This liability will represent the tax charge that would arise should the assets be sold at their revalued amount.
It should be noted that this charge will not be one that the Group expects to pay.
