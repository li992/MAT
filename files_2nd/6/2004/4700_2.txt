23 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Introduction Information presented Diageos strategy is to focus on its branded drinks businesses with international potential.
Diageo completed the disposal of its quick service restaurants business on 13 December 2002 and the combination of its packaged food business with General Mills on 31 October 2001.
In accordance with UK GAAP, the results of the quick service restaurants and the packaged food businesses have been included within discontinued operations in the comparative periods.
The following discussion is based on Diageos UK GAAP results for the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with the year ended 30 June 2003, and the year ended 30 June 2003 compared with the year ended 30 June 2002.
The group has adopted the requirements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, and the amendment to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions from 1 July 2003.
In accordance with UK GAAP, all comparative figures have been restated in compliance with these pronouncements.
There are a number of accounting differences between UK and US GAAP.
A reconciliation of net income from UK to US GAAP and an explanation of the differences between UK and US GAAP are set out in the US GAAP information in note 32 of the consolidated financial statements, with a further explanation of significant reconciling items between UK and US GAAP net income included in Discussion of US GAAP differencesbelow.
Presentation of information in relation to the premium drinks business In addition to describing the significant factors impacting on the profit and loss account compared to the prior year for both of the years ended 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2003, additional information is also presented on the operating performance of the premium drinks segment.
Volume Volume has been measured on an equivalent units basis to nine litre cases of spirits.
An equivalent unit represents one nine litre case of spirits, which is approximately 272 servings.
A serving comprises 33ml of spirits, 165ml of wine, or 330ml of ready to drink or beer.
Therefore, to convert volume of products, other than spirits, to equivalent units, the following guide has been used: beer in hectolitres divide by 0.9, wine in nine litre cases divide by 5 and ready to drink in nine litre cases divide by 10.
Non-GAAP measures Organic movement in volume, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items are measures not specifically used in the consolidated financial statements themselves non-GAAP measures.
The performance of the premium drinks segment is discussed using these measures.
Since overall performance is the result of a number of factors, breaking these down into broad categories and discussing each of these categories assists management and the reader in understanding the overall picture.
Once factors such as the effect of currency movements, excise duties and acquisitions and disposals have been eliminated, the above measures enable the reader to focus on the performance of the premium drinks brand portfolio which is common to both periods.
Organic movement measures also most closely reflect the way in which the business is managed, for the same reasons of achieving comparability between periods.
Diageos strategic planning and budgeting process is based on organic movement in volume, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items, and these measures closely reflect the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by the groups management.
These measures are chosen for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes since, as explained further below, they represent those measures which local managers are most directly able to influence and they enable consideration of the underlying business performance without the distortion caused by fluctuating exchange rates, excise duties, acquisitions and disposals.
In addition, management bonus targets are set based on the performance of the business as measured by organic operating profit growth before exceptional items.
The groups management believe these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the groups performance, since they provide information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to influence and they focus on that element of the core brand portfolio which is common to both periods.
However, whilst these measures are important in the management of the business, they should not be viewed as replacements for, but rather as complementary to, the comparable GAAP measures such as turnover and reported rather than organic movements in individual profit and loss account captions.
These GAAP measures reflect all of the factors which impact the business and the discussion in relation to premium drinks should be read in the context of the discussion of the overall group performance.
In the discussion of the performance of the premium drinks segment, net sales after deducting excise duties is presented in addition to turnover, since turnover reflects significant components of excise duties which are set by external regulators and over which Diageo has no control.
Diageo incurs excise duties throughout the world.
In some countries, excise duties are based on sales and are separately identified on the face of the invoice to the external customer.
In others, it is effectively a production tax, which is incurred when the spirit is removed from bonded warehouses.
In these countries it is part of the cost of goods sold and is not separately identified on the sales invoice.
Changes in the level of excise duties can significantly affect the level of reported turnover and cost of sales, without directly reflecting changes in volume, mix or profitability that are the variables which impact on the element of turnover retained by the group.
Also in the discussion of the performance of the premium drinks segment, certain information is presented using sterling amounts on a constant currency basis.
This strips out the translation effect of foreign exchange rate movements and enables an understanding of the underlying performance of the market that is most closely influenced by the actions of that markets management.
The risk from foreign exchange translation is managed centrally and is not a factor over which local managers have any control.
In the years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2002, the group underwent a major restructuring which resulted in the disposal of its food businesses Pillsbury and Burger King and its Malibu rum brand and the acquisition of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses.
As a consequence, results are not comparable from period to period and require additional explanation.
For this reason it is necessary to separate the effects of acquisitions and disposals on the sales and profit of brands acquired or disposed of in order to provide information on the underlying performance of individual markets.
Adjusting for these items enables group management to monitor performance over factors which local managers are most directly able to influence in relation to the core ongoing brand portfolio.
The underlying performance on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals is referred to as organicperformance, and further information on the calculation of organic measures as used in the discussion of the premium drinks segment is included below.
24 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review In order to assist the reader of the financial statements, the comparisons of both 2004 with 2003 and 2003 with 2002 include tables which present the exchange, disposal, acquisition and organic components of the year on year movement for each of turnover, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items.
Calculation of organic movement Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of, or terminated, in the current year, the group, in organic movement calculations, adjusts the results for the prior year to exclude the amount the group earned in that period that it could not have earned in the current period i. e. the period between the date in the prior period, equivalent to the date of the disposal in the current period, and the end of the prior period.
As a result, the organic movement numbers reflect only comparable trading performance.
Similarly, if a business was disposed of part way through the equivalent prior period, then its contribution would also be completely excluded from that prior periods performance in the organic movement calculation, since the group recognised no contribution from that business in the current year.
For acquisitions, a similar adjustment is made in the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the current period, the post acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the prior period, post acquisition results are included in full in the prior period, but are only included from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current period.
A further adjustment in organic movement is made to exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior years results as if they had been generated at the current years exchange rates.
Organic movement percentages are calculated as the organic movement amount in million, expressed as the percentage of the prior period results at current year exchange rates and after adjusting for disposals.
The basis of calculation means that the results used to measure organic growth for a given year will be adjusted when used to measure organic growth in the subsequent year.

Exceptional items under UK GAAP do not represent extraordinary items under US GAAP.
Turnover On a reported basis, turnover decreased by 390 million 4% from 9,281 million of which Burger King contributed 479 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 8,891 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
For premium drinks, turnover increased by 89 million 1%.
Turnover was adversely impacted by exchange rate movements of 271 million, principally arising from weakening of the US dollar.
The effect of disposals and the termination of certain distribution rights, principally Bass Ale in North America and the Brown-Forman agency brands in Great Britain, reduced premium drinks turnover by 105 million.
Operating costs On a reported basis, operating costs decreased by 474 million 6% from 7,494 million of which Burger King costs were 426 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 7,020 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Exceptional operating costs declined from 168 million to 40 million in the year ended 30 June 2004, and exchange benefited premium drinks operating costs in the year ended 30 June 2004, before exceptional items, by 166 million.
Before the impact of exchange, operating costs before exceptional items for premium drinks increased by 246 million of which excise duties accounted for 73 million and increased marketing expenditure accounted for 41 million.
On a reported basis, marketing investment for premium drinks increased 1% from 1,026 million to 1,039 million.
Marketing investment on global priority brands excluding ready to drink grew 10% to 569 million, while marketing spend on ready to drink brands declined by 28 million 14% to 166 million.
25 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Operating profit Reported operating profit increased by 84 million from 1,787 million of which Burger King contributed 53 million to 1,871 million.
Exceptional items charged to operating profit were 40 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with 168 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Exchange rate movements reduced operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2004 by 105 million US dollar reduction of 107 million, euro benefit of 29 million, other currencies reduction of 27 million.
Disposals and the termination of certain distribution rights contributed an incremental 13 million to operating profit before exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2003 compared to the year ended 30 June 2004.
Exceptional operating costs Operating profit for the year is after 40 million of exceptional costs in respect of the integration of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses, acquired in December 2001 2003 177 million: 2002 164 million.
Approximately 8 million of these costs were employee related, 8 million in respect of putting in place new distribution and broker agreements as part of the Next Generation Growth programme, 4 million in respect of write-downs of assets, and the balance of 20 million included legal and professional and systems costs.
The majority of these costs were incurred in North America.
Post employment plans Post employment charges calculated under FRS 17 resulted in a charge to operating profit of 101 million 2003 110 million and other finance charges of 18 million 2003 income of 36 million.
The figures for the year ended 30 June 2003 have been restated onto an FRS 17 basis.
At 30 June 2004, the deficit before taxation for Diageos post employment plans amounted to 1,044 million 30 June 2003 1,447 million.
This reduction has largely arisen from actuarial gains recognisable in the statement of recognised gains and losses of 586 million, principally due to the actual return on the assets in the funds being higher than the expected return and changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities.
In addition, at 30 June 2004, a deferred tax asset has been recognised on the post employment deficit in the United Kingdom of 245 million.
The post employment deficit after taxation has therefore decreased from 1,369 million to 750 million.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates before exceptional items was 451 million for the year compared to 478 million last year.
The 21% equity interest in General Mills contributed 258 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with 287 million last year.
The weakness of the US dollar accounted for 25 million of this decrease.
On 23 June 2004, Paul Walsh, CEO of Diageo plc, and John M. Keenan, a Diageo plc designated representative, resigned from the General Mills board.
As a result, Diageo ceased to equity account for its share of the results of General Mills from that date.
Diageos 34% equity interest in Mot Hennessy contributed 176 million to share of profits of associates before exceptional items 2003 177 million.
Share of  items comprises a 7 million charge for Diageos share of General Millsexceptional costs and 6 million in respect of restructuring within Mot Hennessy.
Finance charges Finance charges decreased from 315 million to 295 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
The net interest charge decreased by 74 million 21% from 345 million in the comparable prior period to 271 million in the year ended 30 June 2004, including 59 million for General Mills 2003 73 million.
Benefits of 26 million from the effect of reducing interest rates, 12 million from the disposal of businesses, 16 million from the effect of exchange rates excluding associates, and 13 million from cash flow were partly offset by an increased interest charge arising from the funding of the share repurchases of 15 million.
Other finance charges have increased by 54 million, as a result of a charge of 18 million in respect of the groups post employment plans in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with income of 36 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
This adverse movement principally reflects the decline in the values of the assets held by the post employment plans between 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003.
Non-operating exceptional items Non-operating exceptional items before taxation were a charge of 45 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with a charge of 1,297 million including 1,441 million in respect of Burger King in the year ended 30 June 2003.
These charges comprise 41 million 2003 41 million in respect of the dilution of the investment in General Mills, following the issue of additional shares by General Mills, and a 10 million cost in respect of disposed businesses, offset by a 6 million gain arising on the disposal of fixed assets.
The 10 million cost in respect of disposed businesses represents a 13 million loss on the sale of premium drinks brands, and a 26 million charge on the reassessment of the provisions required following the disposal of Burger King, offset by a credit of 29 million arising on the review of the provision held against the guarantee given by Diageo in connection with the sale of Pillsbury.
Profit before taxation After exceptional items, the profit before taxation and minority interests increased by 1,337 million from 632 million to 1,969 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Exchange rates Based on current exchange rates, the impact of adverse exchange rate movements on profit before exceptional items and taxation for the financial year ending 30 June 2005 is estimated to be 100 million excluding transaction exchange on share of profits of associates.
The group currently has net transaction hedges for US dollars in place which settle in the year ending 30 June 2005 to sell 541 million of US dollars.
Where these hedges are against sterling they are at an average rate of 1 $1.63.
The group currently has net transaction hedges for euros in place which settle in the year ending 30 June 2005 to sell 59 million of euros.
Where these hedges are against sterling they are at an average rate of 1 11.41.
Taxation The effective rate of taxation on profit before exceptional items for the year was 25%, compared with 25.6% for the year ended 30 June 2003, restated from the originally reported 25% following compliance with the new accounting pronouncements for post employment plans and share trusts.
26 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Dividend The directors recommend a final dividend of 17.0 pence per share, an increase of 8.3% on last years final dividend.
The full dividend would therefore be 27.6 pence per share, an increase of 7.8%.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 25 October 2004 to shareholders on the register on 17 September 2004.
Payment to US ADR holders will be made 29 October 2004.
A dividend re-investment plan is available in respect of the final dividend and the plan notice date is 4 October 2004.
Premium drinks The following discussion provides additional commentary on the trading performance of the premium drinks business with the equivalent period in the prior year.
In the discussion, movements are segregated between reportedor organicperformance.
Reportedmeans that the measure reflects movement in the number disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
Organicrepresents the movement excluding the impact of exchange, acquisitions and disposals.
In the discussion, under organic brand performancefor each market, movements given for volume, turnover, net sales after deducting excise duties and marketing expenditure are organic movements.
A further description of organic movement, how it is calculated and why it is considered useful for the reader is set out on pages 23 and 24.
27 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Notes 1 The reported turnover and net sales after deducting excise duties for the year ended 30 June 2003 have been restated following the adoption of application note G to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions.
The change reduced turnover and net sales after deducting excise duties by 159 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 in respect of the following markets 36 million for North America, 49 million for Great Britain, nil for Ireland, 6 million for Spain, 49 million for key markets and 19 million for venture markets.
2 The reported operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2003 has been restated following the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, and UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
The operating profit before exceptional items has been reduced by 74 million in respect of the following markets 21 million for North America, 16 million for Great Britain, 10 million for Ireland, 3 million for Spain, 20 million for key markets and 4 million for venture markets.
3 The exchange adjustments for turnover, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items are principally in respect of the US dollar and the euro.
4 Disposals include the transfer of Portugal to venture markets from key markets, and Germany to key markets from venture markets, effective 1 July 2003.
This adjustment represents the differential between the incremental amounts contributed by Germany compared to the amounts contributed by Portugal in the year ended 30 June 2003 139 million for turnover, 104 million for net sales after deducting excise duties and 18 million for operating profit before exceptional items.
In addition, disposals for turnover, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items were principally in respect of the termination of distribution rights for Bass Ale in North America and Brown-Forman agency brands in the United Kingdom, the disposals of Gilbeys Green and White Whisky in India, and the partial disposal of Don Julio in Mexico.
5 There have been no acquisitions of subsidiaries in the last 24 months.
6 In the calculation of operating profit before exceptional items the overheads included in disposals were only those directly attributable to the businesses disposed of, and do not result from subjective judgements of management.
7 The organic movement percentage is the amount in the column headed organic movementin the table above expressed as a percentage of the aggregate of the first three columns.
The basis of the calculation of the organic movement is explained on page 24.

29 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review North America Summary: Continued strong performance by Diageo in this important market Continued growth in global priority brands, together with mix improvement throughout the business, delivered double-digit growth in organic net sales after deducting excise duties Further improvement in operating margin by 1.2 percentage points Share gains in four of the six spirits categories Smirnoff ready to drink volume up 15%, following new product launches Incremental Seagram synergy benefit of 31 million Marketing investment up 9% behind priority brands Distributor strategy is on track Key measures: Reported Organic 2004 2003 movement movement million million %% Volume 13 Turnover 2,659 2,759 4 9 Net sales after deducting excise duties 2,240 2,299 3 10 Marketing 359 369 3 9 Operating profit before exceptional items 694 708 2 14 Reported performance Turnover was down from 2,759 million to 2,659 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Operating profit before exceptional items decreased 14 million 2%, from 708 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 694 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Organic performance Exchange rate movements accounted for a reduction in turnover of 242 million, principally as a result of a weakness in the US dollar which moved from 1 $1.59 in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 1 $1.74 in the year ended 30 June 2004.
In addition, the termination of distribution rights for Bass Ale in June 2003 and Cuervo 1800 in October 2002 reduced turnover by 58 million and 8 million, respectively.
Other disposals, including Kamchatka in the United States and Gibsons Whiskey in Canada, adversely affected turnover by 5 million.
At constant exchange rates the turnover of brands owned or distributed throughout both periods was 213 million higher in the year ended 30 June 2004 than in the comparable period, as discussed within organic brand performance below.
These factors combined to produce an overall decrease in turnover of 100 million.
Operating profit before exceptional items was reduced by 86 million as a result of exchange rate movements.
In addition, the termination of distribution rights and the disposals noted above reduced profit before exceptional items by 13 million.
However, those brands owned or distributed throughout both periods contributed 85 million more in the year ended 30 June 2004 than in the year ended 30 June 2003.
The net result of these factors was a decrease in operating profit before exceptional items of 14 million.

30 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Additional information: Smirnoff volume, excluding ready to drink, was flat and net sales after deducting excise duties was up 5% Captain Morgan volume, excluding ready to drink, was up 9% and net sales after deducting excise duties was up 11% From 1 July 2003, terms of trade were harmonised between the former UDV and Seagram brands and freight is now billed as net sales after deducting excise duties for all brands.
The actual freight cost is reported as cost of goods sold.
This change increased reported net sales after deducting excise duties in the year by approximately 2 percentage points versus the prior year Crown Royal, Diageos highest volume and most profitable local priority brand, grew volume 3% New packaging was introduced for Smirnoff, marketing investment increased and pricing was revised to enable Smirnoff to compete in the higher growth segment of premium vodka.
In the short term this has led to flat volume and some share erosion for Smirnoff, excluding ready to drink.
However, along with the stronger growth of Smirnoff Twist and the growth of Smirnoff ready to drink, price and mix improved.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume was up 15% due to the launch of Smirnoff Twisted V and share grew 15.1 percentage points to approximately 45% of the segment.
Further strong volume growth of Johnnie Walker, with Johnnie Walker Black Label, up 8%, and continued impressive growth of the super premium offerings, Johnnie Walker Gold Label and Johnnie Walker Blue Label, drove mix improvement in the brand.
Johnnie Walker Red Label, with volume up 2%, and Johnnie Walker Black Label both grew share in their respective segments.
Jos Cuervo volume growth was constrained by pricing pressure from competitors.
Net sales after deducting excise duties increased 6% reflecting growth in the higher margin Tradicional tequila and Margarita mixes.
Marketing investment increased to support brand building and focus on Jos Cuervos premium position.
Baileys solid growth continued with volume up 6% and share improved 1.4 percentage points in the cream liqueur category due in part to the launch of Baileys Minis in May 2003.
Marketing investment continues to build the brands reach with innovative campaigns such as the new broadcast sponsorship deal to produce Baileys in Tunewith VH1, a popular cable TV music channel.
Captain Morgan continues to grow volume and share in the fastest growing spirits category in the US, with share up 1.1 percentage points, boosted by the introduction of two new Parrot Bay Flavors.
Net sales after deducting excise duties benefited from a price increase across parts of the United States.
Tanquerays volume performance was held back in the second half as marketing campaigns were postponed until the brands transition from Schieffelin & Somerset to Diageo North America was completed.
Tanqueray grew share of the imported gin segment by 1.1 percentage points.
Guinness volume continued to outpace the total beer market, driven by increased sales and distribution of Guinness Draught in bottles and increased marketing around the St. Patricks Day selling period.
J B volume and net sales after deducting excise duties improved in the second half as the brands competitive position benefited from price increases taken by competitors.
Volume performance of the local priority brands was flat.
Crown Royal, which is at a price premium significantly above the competition, continued to deliver volume growth.
Together with Beaulieu Vineyard up 35% and Sterling Vineyards up 22%, this volume growth offset declines in other local priority brands.
Growth of these higher value brands, which represent 28% of Diageos local priority brand net sales after deducting excise duties, delivered mix improvement.
Similarly, in the category brands, growth of higher value brands such as Croc, Don Julio and Godiva, was partially offset in volume terms by the weaker performance of other category brands but delivered strong mix improvement.
Marketing investment increased 9% broadly in line with net sales after deducting excise duties after adjusting for the change in terms of trade.
Marketing investment increased due to higher media spend behind the global priority brands as well as a Crown Royal sponsorship agreement with the International Race of Champions.
These increases were offset by an overall decline in ready to drink spend reflecting a shift in the nature of marketing activities, however share of voice increased.
Diageo achieved further synergy benefits associated with the acquisition in December 2001 of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses of 31 million.
In part, this was offset by costs in respect of the restructuring of Diageos relationship with Schieffelin & Somerset of 6 million.
Diageos distributor consolidation strategy is on track.
Dedicated distributor sales resources are in place for Diageo brands in 36 states plus Washington DC and distributors continue to build their organisations in terms of capabilities and infrastructure.
31 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Great Britain Summary: Despite good volume growth margin pressures negatively impacted net sales after deducting excise duties Solid organic volume growth in spirits, with strong performances from Smirnoff Red and Gordons Gin Diageos share of UK spirits grew from 23.6% to 24.8% in the year Blossom Hill grew volume by 37%.
Diageos volume share of branded wines segment is now 13.7% versus 11.4% last year Guinness volume down 3% and ready to drink volume down 14% both in line with the decline in their respective segments Reduced marketing spend due to fewer new product launches and lower ready to drink investment Key measures: Reported Organic 2004 2003 movement movement million million %% Volume 56 Turnover 1,411 1,380 23 Net sales after deducting excise duties 780 790 1 1 Marketing 124 139 11 11 Operating profit before exceptional items 207 203 2 1 Reported and organic performance Turnover in Great Britain was up 2% from 1,380 million to 1,411 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
The 31 million improvement was due to an organic increase of 39 million, offset by 8 million of disposals.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 2% from 203 million to 207 million.
The 4 million increase reflects a 2 million organic reduction combined with a 6 million benefit from disposals.

In Great Britain, continued strong performance from spirits and wine, particularly Smirnoff Red up 19%, Gordons up 10% and Blossom Hill up 37%, drove 6% volume growth despite challenging trading conditions in beer and ready to drink.
Share of spirits grew 1.2 percentage points to 24.8%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties growth trailed volume growth as a result of negative mix due primarily to the decline in ready to drink.
Additionally, the shift in sales from the on to the off trade, as well as further consolidation in both channels, created pressure on pricing.
Smirnoff volume grew 11% as the strong performance of Smirnoff Red, up 19%, was offset by the decline in Smirnoff ready to drink volume, down 13%.
Net sales after deducting excise duty were down 6% reflecting mix deterioration primarily driven by the decline in ready to drink.
For Smirnoff Red, Diageo Great Britains largest spirit brand by volume, 2004 was a landmark year.
Volume grew 19% passing the 3 million case mark and gaining 2.6 percentage points of share.
New packaging, a strong marketing programme and new on trade distribution points were key volume drivers.
A price increase was implemented on 1 April 2004.
Smirnoff Ice remains the No.
1 ready to drink brand in Great Britain and increased its share by 1.7 percentage points, in a declining segment.
Volume fell 13% and net sales after deducting excise duty declined 17%.
Diageos share of the ready to drink segment declined slightly, by 0.3 percentage points to 33.9%, as volume declined due to the withdrawal of Gordons Edge and the decline of Archers Aqua.
Baileys volume growth and positive mix is the result of the introduction of Baileys Glide.
Baileys strategy is focused on broadening the brand footprint into new occasions.
32 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Guinness share in the beer category declined slightly, by 0.1 percentage points, the result of a 5% volume decline in the on trade, offset by 2% volume growth in the off trade.
A price increase for Guinness Draught was implemented on 1 February 2004.
The local priority brands delivered 1% volume growth.
Gordons grew overall volume by 10% and gained share, driven by new advertising and the relaunch of Gordons Sloe Gin.
Bells volume was down by 2%, but overall share grew to 16.0% and Bells remains the market leader.
Archers volume declined 12% primarily due to the decline of Archers Aqua by 27%.
Blossom Hill, which represents 8% of Diageo Great Britains net sales after deducting excise duties, grew volume by 37% and gained 2.2 percentage share points of the branded wines segment.
The brand now has the best selling red, white and ros wines in Great Britain.
Marketing investment was down by 11% principally due to a reduced number of product launches and lower ready to drink investment following the further decline of the ready to drink segment.
Ireland Summary: The results for Ireland reflect the continued decline of the beverage alcohol market, down a further 1%, and the shift from the on trade, where Diageo has the majority of its business, to the off trade Guinness volume declined 6% and net sales after deducting excise duties decreased by 3%, benefiting from price increases Diageo implemented a major restructuring to bring in a less complex and therefore lower cost operating model in response to the changes in the beverage alcohol market Key measures: Reported Organic 2004 2003 movement movement million million %% Volume 4 4 Turnover 961 953 1 3 Net sales after deducting excise duties 641 638 3 Marketing 76 67 13 9 Operating profit before exceptional items 126 131 4 10 Reported performance In Ireland, turnover increased on a reported basis from 953 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 961 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Operating profit before exceptional items was down from 131 million to 126 million.
Organic performance Although reported turnover was up 8 million, the main reason for this was the strength of the euro, which had a beneficial impact of 37 million.
The weighted average exchange rate used for translation strengthened from 1 11.52 for the year ended 30 June 2003 to 1 11.45 for the year ended 30 June 2004.
Market decline and brand performance reduced turnover by 28 million and disposals reduced it by 1 million.
For operating profit before exceptional items, the strength of the euro had a 9 million positive impact.
This benefit was more than offset by a 15 million restructuring charge to bring in a less complex and therefore lower cost operating model.
Other factors benefited operating profit before exceptional items by 1 million.

33 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review The beverage alcohol market in Ireland declined by a further 1% in the year, impacted by some decline in consumer confidence and an acceleration in the shift from the on to the off trade.
The shift towards the off trade is largely attributed to lifestyle and demographics changes, continued price competition in the off trade and to the initial impact in the on trade of the smoking ban introduced in March 2004.
The on trade declined by 6% and now represents 57% of the market volume, while the off trade grew by 7%.
Diageos volume declined by 4% in the full year.
The volume decline of 6% in the first half slowed to 1% in the six months ended 30 June 2004, partly reflecting comparison against the prior period which had been negatively impacted by duty increases in December 2002.
Diageos share of the total market declined 1.5 percentage points, primarily driven by the shift to the off trade where Diageos brands have lower share than in the on trade.
Increased competition from imported beer, which has been discounted aggressively by off trade retailers, has also adversely impacted share.
Net sales after deducting excise duties decreased by 3%.
Price increases on beer brands in March 2003 and June 2004 have partially offset the impact of the volume decline.
Guinness share of long alcoholic drinks beer, cider and ready to drink declined 1.5 percentage points in the year due to the continued switch from on to off trade and the hot summer in the first quarter of the financial year that benefited other segments within long alcoholic drinks.
The spirits market in Ireland continued to decline, in part due to the continued impact of the duty increase of over 40% in December 2002.
However, Smirnoff, excluding ready to drink, increased share of the vodka category by 3.0 percentage points.
The ready to drink segment represents only 1% of the Irish market.
Volume in the local priority lager brands, Budweiser, Carlsberg and Harp, was down 3% again affected by the on trade to off trade switch.
Category brands, where volume grew 9%, represent only 8% of total volume.
Marketing spend on an organic basis was up 9%.
This increase was the result of a change in treatment of certain costs.
On a like for like basis, spend was flat.
Spain Summary: Diageos organic volume grew by 3% and share increased by 0.6 percentage points despite further decline in the Spanish spirits market Performance by brand was mixed, but overall mix improved, driven by volume growth in Johnnie Walker and Cacique as well as price increases implemented in April 2004 Key measures: Reported Organic 2004 2003 movement movement million million %% Volume 23 Turnover 454 418 94 Net sales after deducting excise duties 342 316 84 Marketing 68 64 61 Operating profit before exceptional items 113 96 18 10 Reported performance Reported turnover was 454 million in the year ended 30 June 2004, up 9% against the 418 million reported in the prior year.
Reported operating profit before exceptional items was up 17 million 18% from 96 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 113 million in the current year.
Organic performance Favourable exchange rate variances due to the strength of the euro positively impacted reported turnover by 20 million.
There was a 2 million adverse impact from the loss of the distribution rights for Lagunilla wines in January 2003.
Organic growth of brands owned throughout this and the comparable period contributed 18 million.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased 17 million as a result of the strong euro, 7 million, and growth of continuing brands, 10 million.

J B volume was down in the standard scotch and local whisky category which continues to decline.
However, J B remains the number one brand with 26% share of the category.
The withdrawal of J B Twist negatively impacted mix and net sales after deducting excise duties were down 3% despite a 3% price increase in April.
Baileys continued to lead the cream liqueur segment with volume up 3% and share up 0.8 percentage points, to 65.3%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties benefited from a 4% price increase implemented in April.
Johnnie Walker volume increased 13% and gained share driven by growth in Johnnie Walker Red Label.
A moderate price increase was taken in April.
Smirnoff volume growth was driven by 4% growth in Smirnoff Red, offset by a decline in Smirnoff ready to drink which negatively impacted net sales after deducting excise duties.
Smirnoff continues to lead the vodka category with 35.4% share.
Local priority brand performance was up, driven primarily by Cacique whose volume grew 14% despite higher pricing.
Cacique continued to lead the dark rum segment with approximately 37% share, but lost 0.4 percentage points of share as a result of strong promotional activity from smaller competitors.
The category brand volume performance was driven by a decline in Bells of over 40% as distribution agreements were restructured, although mix improved.
This volume decline was partially offset by 9% volume growth of Pampero.
Spanish consumer trends continue to move from scotch to wine and dark rum, while socio-economic and regulatory pressures have accelerated the switch from on to off trade.
Despite these trends, Diageo grew overall share to 19.3%, which represents an improvement of 0.6 percentage points.
Marketing spend increased 1% driven by increased media spend on Cacique to support higher pricing, offset by a significant reduction in ready to drink spend.
Excluding ready to drink, marketing spend increased 9%.
Overall media investment has increased 17% and new campaigns have been launched on many priority brands.
Diageo introduced new advertising and promotional brand building activities such as J B Comedy and the Nightology Boat, a floating J B disco which travels to different cities along the Spanish coast.

Reported performance Reported turnover in the year ended 30 June 2004 was 2,275 million, up 9% on the prior year figure of 2,080 million.
Operating profit before exceptional items was up 2% at 511 million for the year ended 30 June 2004.
Organic performance Turnover in key markets was up 195 million compared with the year ended 30 June 2003.
There were unfavourable exchange movements of 49 million, principally on the Venezuelan bolivar and the Nigerian naira, offset by a 119 million improvement in organic performance.
In addition, the Germany Portugal transfer noted above increased turnover by 139 million.
The sale of 50% of Don Julio in January 2003 which has since been accounted for as an associate negatively impacted turnover by 14 million.
There has been a 9 million increase in reported operating profit before exceptional items.
This increase was due to organic improvements in brand performance of 26 million and an increase of 18 million in respect of the Germany Portugal transfer, partly offset by unfavourable exchange rate movements of 30 million principally the Venezuelan bolivar and the Don Julio disposal of 5 million.

Overall key markets volume growth was achieved through strong performance in Africa, Latin America, Australia and global duty free.
Volume growth together with price increases in Africa and Australia and overall favourable mix delivered 7% net sales after deducting excise duties growth.
The volume growth in global priority brands was led by strong performance of Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Guinness, which together constitute approximately 40% of key markets volume and net sales after deducting excise duties.
Johnnie Walker grew 6%, primarily driven by strong performances in global duty free and Australia.
Smirnoff volume increased 8%, with Smirnoff Red up 10% and ready to drink up 1%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties of Smirnoff increased 4% as negative mix in Germany was only partially offset by price increases in South Africa and Australia.

Baileys volume grew on strong performance in global duty free and Australia.
J B volume declined 7% on weakness in the scotch category in Korea.
Local priority brand volume increased, as strong performance of Bundaberg ready to drink Australia, up 35%, and Malta Guinness Africa, up 20%, compensated for declines in Tusker and Pilsner Kenya and Windsor South Korea reflecting beverage alcohol market declines in the challenging economic environments of Kenya and South Korea.
Net sales after deducting excise duties grew 5%, primarily driven by price increases on over 50% of local priority brand volume.
Category brand growth was primarily driven by growth in Africa and Latin America with favourable mix and some price increases.
Ready to drink volume increased by 9% with strong performance in Australia where volume rose 28% and in France, following the launch of Smirnoff Ice in May 2003.
African volume fell slightly, by 1%, and Germany suffered a major decline as the ready to drink segment declined by over 40% following the announcement of higher duty rates on ready to drink.
Marketing investment grew 10% driven by increased spend behind global priority brands, Bundaberg in Australia, and ready to drink in France and Japan.
Ready to drink investment in Germany was curtailed, however core spirits investment was maintained.
Africa, which is Diageos second largest market by volume, sustained its strong performance growing volume by 5%.
Guinness volume increased 11% principally driven by growth in Nigeria and Ghana.
Nigeria benefited from a growing beer market and successful trade activities focused on reducing distributor stock outs, while Ghana has been fuelled by strong demand, the launch of Guinness Extra Smooth and increased capacity following further production investment.
Smirnoff Red volume declined 1%, still impacted by the consumer trend towards beer and gin in South Africa.
Successful advertising and promotional activities drove Johnnie Walker volume growth of 6% and Captain Morgan volume growth of 9%.
Malta Guinness grew 20%, with strong demand, improved distribution and increased capacity availability.
The challenging economic environment in Kenya led the beverage alcohol market to fall and consumers to trade down to value lagers and spirits, adversely impacting premium local priority lager brands such as Tusker and Pilsner.
36 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Net sales after deducting excise duties in Africa grew 16%, benefiting primarily from price increases.

However, share declined 1 percentage point in Brazil as pressure from non-premium brands remains.
In Venezuela, volume rose 9%, despite the decline in the premium beverage alcohol market.
Johnnie Walker and Buchanans increased volume and share, aided by strong brand positioning.
Operating profit benefited from a 10 million gain on the disposal of government bonds purchased in the prior year to hedge exchange risk.
Mexicos performance was strong with volume growth in Johnnie Walker, J B, Baileys and Buchanans, resulting from increased marketing investment.
In Colombia volume grew 92%, benefiting from a newly implemented direct distribution system, strong promotional discounts and the spirits tax reform.
In Australia, volume, share and net sales grew for Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Baileys and Bundaberg, which together constitute over 65% of volume and net sales.
Overall portfolio volume grew 7% and share of spirits increased by 1 percentage point in a flat spirits market.

Baileys volume increased 26% and share increased 7.2 percentage points to 30.3%, on improved visibility and pricing.
Ready to drink performed exceptionally well, growing share by 3.5 percentage points to 33.9% in a segment growing 13%.
These volume increases were offset by decline in Captain Morgan, down 29% and category brands, down 8%, primarily due to the decline in secondary scotches.
Net sales after deducting excise duties increased 16% boosted primarily by price increases.
Global duty free gained further momentum in the second half, completing the year with 11% growth in volume.
Performance has rebounded compared to the prior period when travel was affected by the impact of the Iraq conflict and the SARS outbreak.

Volume of Johnnie Walker in China grew 68%, albeit from a small base.
Smirnoff volume growth was driven by the Middle East, which grew 24% supported by improved visibility and availability and a positive response to the launch of the new packaging and flavours.
Net sales after deducting excise duties growth was negatively impacted by the decline of ready to drink volume.
Baileys volume growth was primarily due to 56% growth in the Americas and Caribbean markets.
Declining sales and price pressure in Italy, which represents 25% of Baileys venture markets net sales after deducting excise duties, negatively impacted net sales after deducting excise duties growth.
Guinness volume decline was due to a strategic decision in Malaysia to limit duty free sales due to the lower margin in this channel.
In the Malaysian domestic market, Guinness grew at 7%.
The Guinness volume decline in Asia was partially offset by strong growth in the Caribbean markets.
Ready to drink volume declined 13% due to the decision to withdraw Gilbeys Island Punch from the Philippines market, a weak segment in parts of Europe and a slowdown in new market launches.
This decline was partially offset by Smirnoff ready to drink growth in the Americas and Caribbean markets and in the Nordics.
38 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Red Stripe, venture marketsonly local priority brand, recorded a 17% volume decline due to duty and price increases in the second half of fiscal 2003, and a tough economic environment in Jamaica.

Portugal delivered 24% volume growth despite an aggressive competitive environment.
The Nordics grew volume by 8% on spirits tax reductions and new product launches.
In Europe, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland underperformed due to a decline in the ready to drink segment and the trend towards the off trade.

Turnover Overall Turnover decreased by 1,619 million 15% from 10,900 million in the prior year to 9,281 million in the year ended 30 June 2003, following the disposals of Pillsbury in October 2001 and Burger King in December 2002, both of which are accounted for as discontinued operations and which contributed 479 million to turnover in the year ended 30 June 2003 compared with 2,361 million in the prior year.
39 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Continuing operations premium drinks For continuing operations, which now represents Diageos premium drinks business, turnover increased by 263 million 3% from 8,539 million in the year ended 30 June 2002 to 8,802 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
The Seagram spirits and wine businesses, which were acquired on 21 December 2001, contributed 1,214 million to turnover during the year, compared with 573 million in the six month period ended 30 June 2002.
This increase attributable to the acquired Seagram business was partly offset by the impact of brands which were disposed of during the two year period ended 30 June 2003 of 327 million, principally due to Malibu impact of 107 million, North American wine brands 42 million which were sold in May and April 2002 respectively, and the loss of the distribution rights of Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort in Great Britain, effective August 2002 108 million.
Turnover was also adversely impacted by the effect of exchange rate movements, primarily the US dollar, which reduced turnover by an estimated 303 million.
The remaining 243 million increase in turnover reflects the underlying performance of the ongoing brand portfolio which saw volume increase by 1%.
Discontinued operations Burger King contributed 479 million to turnover in the year ended 30 June 2003 compared with 1,123 million in the year ended 30 June 2002, following the disposal of Burger King in December 2002.
Turnover in the year ended 30 June 2002 also included 1,238 million from Pillsbury which was sold on 31 October 2001.
Operating costs Overall Operating costs decreased by 1,876 million 20% on a reported basis from 9,370 million in the year ended 30 June 2002 to 7,494 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
This decrease was caused by the disposals of Pillsbury in October 2001, which had 1,061 million operating costs in the prior year, and Burger King in December 2002, whose operating costs fell by 565 million reflecting the reduction in the period of ownership by the group.
Operating costs of premium drinks decreased by 250 million.
Continuing operations premium drinks For continuing operations, which now represents Diageos premium drinks business, operating costs decreased by 250 million 3% on a reported basis from 7,318 million in the year ended 30 June 2002 to 7,068 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Operating exceptional costs for continuing operations decreased by 281 million from 449 million in the prior year to 168 million these are discussed under exceptional operating costs below.
Excluding the exceptional operating costs, continuing operating costs increased by 31 million 0.5% from 6,869 million in the year ended 30 June 2002 to 6,900 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
There were increases in operating costs compared with the prior period arising from the acquisition of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses in December 2001 and from organic increases in marketing and other costs.
These were almost fully offset by reductions in costs from the movements in exchange rates 265 million, principally the US dollar, and from disposals 254 million, principally the loss of the distribution rights for Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort in the United Kingdom 103 million and Malibu 67 million.
Marketing investment for premium drinks increased by 38 million 4% to 1,026 million.
The major drivers of the increase were higher spend on the Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Smirnoff brands and behind the launch of Smirnoff Ice in key and venture markets.
Marketing spend on J B declined and spend on Guinness was down as a result of a reduction in spend in Great Britain and in Ireland.
Operating profit before exceptional items Overall Operating profit before exceptional items decreased by 45 million from 2,000 million to 1,955 million.
The decrease reflects an increase attributable to premium drinks of 232 million, offset by a reduced contribution of 277 million from discontinued operations.
Continuing operations premium drinks Operating profit before exceptional items for premium drinks increased by 232 million 14% from 1,670 million to 1,902 million.
The Seagram businesses, in the six months ended 31 December 2002, contributed 211 million, but this was offset by a 73 million impact of businesses disposed of, primarily Malibu impact of 40 million and North American wine brands 5 million which were sold in May and April 2002 respectively, and the loss of the distribution rights of Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort in the United Kingdom, effective August 2002 10 million.
132 million of the increase in operating profit before exceptional items is attributable to the organic performance of the brand portfolio, discussed in more detail below.
Exchange rate movements, net of the effect of currency hedging, had an adverse impact on operating profit before exceptional items of 38 million.
Discontinued operations The results for the year included an operating profit contribution of 53 million from discontinued operations Burger King only, compared with 330 million in the year ended 30 June 2002 Burger King and Pillsbury.
Exceptional operating costs Overall The operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2003 is after exceptional operating charges of 168 million compared to 470 million including 21 million in respect of discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2002.
This comprised integration and restructuring costs of 225 million, offset by 57 million received on the termination of Bass distribution rights in the United States.
40 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Continuing operations premium drinks In the year ended 30 June 2003, 177 million was incurred in respect of the integration of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses, acquired in December 2001 year ended 30 June 2002 164 million.
Approximately 43 million of these costs were employee related, 7 million were in respect of write downs of tangible fixed assets, 57 million were incurred in putting in place new distributor and broker agreements as part of the Next Generation Growth programme in the United States, and the balance included consultancy and systems costs.
The majority of these costs were incurred in North America and the United Kingdom.
It is expected that the total programme cost of restructuring and integrating the business will be approximately $700 million 460 million of which $590 million 390 million is expected to be cash.
As a result of the amount charged to the profit and loss account in the two years ended 30 June 2003, it is anticipated that approximately 2,200 jobs will be lost of which some 1,800 had been terminated by 30 June 2003.
On completion of the programme it is anticipated that some 2,500 jobs will be lost and that integration synergy will reduce Diageos annual cost base by approximately 115 million in the year ending 30 June 2005.
The above merger synergy represents a management estimate and, as a forward-looking statement, involves risk and uncertainty.
The expected level of synergy is based on a number of assumptions, including certain expectations concerning: the integration of back offices and sales forces in subsidiary regional offices resulting in headcount reductions and rationalisation of facilities: headcount reductions in central and regional offices: and procurement savings through improvement of supplier terms.
48 million 2002 48 million: 2001 74 million was incurred in respect of the restructuring of the UDV spirits and wine and the Guinness beer businesses.
Approximately 28 million of the costs were employee related and the balance included legal and professional costs.
Total costs of this integration amounted to 170 million charged to the profit and loss account over the three years ended 30 June 2003, and no further costs are expected.
As a result of the restructuring charge in the three years ended 30 June 2003, it is anticipated that approximately 750 jobs will be lost, of which approximately 600 had been terminated at 30 June 2003.
Effective 30 June 2003, Diageo relinquished its distribution rights for Bass Ale in the United States.
Under the distribution agreement, Diageo had the right to continue selling and marketing the brand in the United States until July 2016.
Consideration of 57 million received has been accounted for as an exceptional operating item.
In the year ended 30 June 2002, exceptional operating costs in relation to the premium drinks business included 164 million in respect of the integration of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses, 48 million in respect of the restructuring of the UDV and Guinness businesses and 220 million in respect of a settlement with Jos Cuervo following the termination of litigation and the formalisation of new arrangements for the distribution by Diageo of Jos Cuervo brands in the United States.
In addition, 17 million was incurred on the reorganisation of beer production facilities in Ireland.
These costs were in respect of a provision for additional pension benefits for certain employees.
Discontinued operations There were no exceptional operating costs in relation to discontinued operations in the year ended 30 June 2003.
In the prior year, exceptional operating costs for discontinued operations comprised 21 million in relation to the restructuring of franchisee loan financing arrangements in anticipation of the disposal of the Burger King business.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates before exceptional items was 478 million for the year compared with 324 million in the year ended 30 June 2002.
The 21% equity interest in General Mills contributed 287 million 143 million in the eight months ended 30 June 2002.
Exceptional items for associates comprised 18 million for Diageos share of General Millsexceptional costs incurred on its restructuring of the acquired Pillsbury business, and 3 million in respect of restructuring within Mot Hennessy.
Finance charges Finance charges increased by 20 million 7% from 295 million in the prior year to 315 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
The net interest charge decreased by 54 million, from 399 million in the prior year to 345 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 as the net benefits of 76 million in respect of the disposal of businesses, of 27 million from exchange rate related movements, and of 44 million from the reduction in interest rates were offset by other factors.
These factors included an increase of 14 million in the amount relating to the share of General Millsinterest charge, the effect of business acquisitions, principally the Seagram spirits and wine businesses, of 60 million and the funding of the share repurchases which increased the interest charge by 43 million.
Other finance income was 30 million in the year ended 30 June 2003, compared with 104 million in the prior year.
This adverse movement is principally due to a lower level of finance income in respect of the groups post employment plans in the year ended 30 June 2003 36 million than in the year ended 30 June 2002 104 million.
Non operating exceptional items Non operating exceptional items before taxation comprise losses of 43 million on disposal of fixed assets and losses of 1,254 million on disposal of businesses in the year ended 30 June 2003 compared with losses of 22 million and gains of 813 million respectively in the prior year.
Burger King was sold on 13 December 2002 for $1.5 billion 0.9 billion.
The sale resulted in a pre tax charge of 1,441 million, after writing back goodwill previously written off to reserves of 673 million.
Diageo retained $213 million 129 million of subordinated debt, with a ten year maturity 2013, from the Burger King Company.
In addition, Diageo has guaranteed up to $850 million 515 million of borrowings of the Burger King Company.
These loans have a term of five years from December 2002, although Diageo and Burger King have structured their arrangements to encourage refinancing by Burger King on a non-guaranteed basis prior to December 2007.
The loss on disposal of Burger King was partially offset by the receipt of 171 million additional consideration on the disposal of Pillsbury.
Gains on disposals of businesses in the year ended 30 June 2002 principally related to the disposal of Malibu 532 million and Pillsbury 314 million.
Taxation The effective rate of taxation on profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2003 was 25.6%, restated from the originally reported 25%, compared with 25.2% for the year ended 30 June 2002.
The restatement was made following compliance with the accounting pronouncements for post employment plans and share trusts which Diageo adopted from 1 July 2003.
After exceptional items the effective 41 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review rate of taxation was 77.7% for the year ended 30 June 2003 compared with 27.4% for the year ended 30 June 2002.
The effective rate of taxation for the year ended 30 June 2003 reflected the fact that the pre tax loss on the disposal of Burger King was 1,441 million with associated tax relief of 80 million.

Operating profit before exceptional items increased 35% from 523 million in the year ended 30 June 2002 to 708 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Organic performance The increase in turnover was primarily due to the turnover derived from the Seagram brands, acquired in the joint acquisition of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses in December 2001, which contributed 444 million in the six months ended 31 December 2002.
The effect of brand disposals and of exchange rate movements in the US dollar reduced turnover in the year ended 30 June 2003 by 105 million and 234 million, respectively.
The disposal impact is primarily attributable to the disposal of Malibu in May 2002 37 million, the Glen Ellen wine business in May 2002 37 million and Cuervo 1800 in September 2002 24 million.
The acquired Seagram brands were the main factor in growing operating profit before exceptional items in North America from 523 million in the previous year to 708 million in the year ended 30 June 2003, contributing 154 million in the six months ended 31 December 2002.

Global priority brand volume excluding ready to drink grew 7%.
Ready to drink volume, which includes flavored malt beverages and ready to drink in the United States and ready to drink in Canada, was down 17%, representing a decline in Smirnoff ready to drink of 11% and the withdrawal of Captain Morgan Gold.
Smirnoff had another strong year despite weakness in Smirnoff ready to drink.
Excluding ready to drink, volume was up 9%, driven by strong growth in Smirnoff Red and the continued success of the Smirnoff Twist flavoured vodka range.
Smirnoff Red increased its share to 23.1%.
The brands volume growth was driven by the success of the Whats your mixadvertising campaign.
In addition, Smirnoff Red continues to benefit from spend behind Smirnoff ready to drink and Smirnoff Twist.
44 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Smirnoff ready to drink volume was down 11%.
The launch of Smirnoff Ice Triple Black in January 2003 partially offset softness in Smirnoff Ice.
Volume of Johnnie Walker Red Label improved in the second half of the year.
Johnnie Walker Black Label also gained share although volume growth slowed from the first half.
Net sales after deducting excise duties for the total brand were up 7% due to volume growth of 2% and favourable price mix variances of 5%, driven by a 3% price increase in certain markets.
Baileys continued its impressive growth driven by national advertising around a very successful holiday programme, and the continued success of initiatives to broaden the appeal of the brand to new occasions.
The launch of Baileys Minis in May 2003 also contributed incremental volume and revenue, as well as generating momentum for the brand.
The strategy for J B in North America is to maximise value and, in the year, operating profit from the brand increased as marketing expenditure was reduced.
Jos Cuervo was the leader in US tequila sales.
The key drivers of its growth were high consumer visibility, the success of national advertising and an increased trial programme.
The success of the Distinctive Sincecampaign was a key driver of the growth in Tanqueray.
Both Tanqueray and Tanqueray No.
TEN increased their share of the category.
Excluding Captain Morgan Gold ready to drink, Captain Morgan volume was up 8% and net sales after deducting excise duties were up 10% driven by increased advertising and media spending for Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum.
Guinness volume grew slightly in the year, driven by strong performance from bottled Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness Draught in Bottles.
Local priority brand volume was up 1% for the year, with net sales after deducting excise duties up 4%.
Crown Royal showed strong gains, as did Sterling Vineyards, however these were partially offset by volume decline in Gordons Gin, Beaulieu Vineyard, and other smaller brands.
Volume of category brands was down 7% for the year, with net sales after deducting excise duties down 3%.
The decrease in volume was due to declines in Gordons vodka and other smaller category brands.
Bass volume was down versus the prior year: distribution of the brand was returned to Interbrew as of 30 June 2003.
There has been a mix improvement due to inclusion of the former Seagram brands and the launch of Croc.
Other business performance drivers: At 30 June 2003, almost 80% of Diageos volume was distributed through dedicated sales teams Ready to drink segment under pressure Efficiencies generated savings of over 10% in media planning and buying Share of US spirits brands increased by 0.3 percentage points to 27.3% Diageo North America continued to progress its strategic initiatives.
In particular its Next Generation Growth programme made excellent further progress.
In the second half of the year ended 30 June 2003, new distribution and brokerage agreements were reached in nine more states and additional distributors established dedicated sales forces.
At 30 June 2003 distributors and brokers in 34 states and Washington DC, representing nearly 80% of Diageos volume, were supporting Diageos brands, with just under 2,000 sales personnel working in teams solely dedicated to Diageo and S&S brands.
Following two years of rapid growth, flavored malt beverages in the United States slowed considerably, and volume in the segment was broadly level for the year.
Of the new launches this year, Smirnoff Ice Triple Black was the most successful and it is now the second best selling flavored malt beverage in the United States behind Smirnoff Ice.
Flavored malt beverages represented 2% of the beer category, of which Smirnoff ready to drink was estimated to constitute about a third.
Diageos share of US spirits increased in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 27.3% as a result of share gains in most priority brands.
Diageo consolidated to one media planning and buying agency resulting in a 10% reduction in media spend compared with cost levels in the year ended 30 June 2002.
In addition, a 15% reduction versus prior year was achieved in media production costs.
Marketing spend, at 369 million, was 6% below prior year while share of voice in the combined beer and spirits category increased.

45 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Organic performance The principal reason for the decrease in turnover was the termination of the distribution rights for Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort in Great Britain in August 2002 which reduced turnover by 108 million.
The acquired Seagram brands contributed 17 million to turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2002.
The organic increase in the year was 80 million 6%.
Increase in operating profit before exceptional items was due to organic growth of 29 million, offset by a net negative impact resulting from acquisitions and disposals of 13 million.

Growth in the spirits brands offset the decline in volume in ready to drink and beer.
Smirnoff Red retained its leadership position in terms of share.
Excluding ready to drink, volume grew 11%.
In addition, a 6% price increase was achieved in September 2002 against strong competition from the value end of the category.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume fell 3% in the year and net sales after deducting excise duties declined by 11%.
However, the brand grew share by 2 percentage points.
The ready to drink segment was significantly impacted by the duty increase in April 2002, with volume declining by 4% in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Diageo absorbed the duty increase and as a result net sales after deducting excise duties per equivalent unit reduced by 9%.
In addition, the duty impact was exacerbated by a move towards value offerings and by shifts in consumer drinking habits away from the on trade and city centre venues, which are the primary outlets for ready to drink occasions.
Baileys continued its very strong growth.
Share increased to 41% in the face of the introduction of two competing products into the category.
The launch of Baileys Minis and continued media awareness contributed to this growth as did brand building activity focused on broadening consumer enjoyment of the brand into new occasions.
Guinness performed well in a difficult beer market, with net sales after deducting excise duties down only 1%, compared with a 3% net sales after deducting excise duties decline in the beer category.
Local priority brand volume declined 3%.
Despite volume growth, net sales after deducting excise duties of Gordons, excluding ready to drink, declined by 2%, due to increased competitive pressure in the off trade.
The blended whisky segment continued to be driven by aggressive pricing but Bells maintained its lead in the segment.
Archers had a disappointing year with both its schnapps and ready to drink products showing volume decline.
Archers Aqua volume fell by 27% driven by the ready to drink segment downturn which was more pronounced in the fruit flavoured ready to drink segment.
Diageos category brands performance has been driven by excellent growth from Pimms, Piat dOr and Blossom Hill.
Other business performance drivers: Increased resources behind sales execution A comprehensive restructuring of the customer sales force drove growth in Great Britain.
The new structure both increased frequency of contact with customers and generated more effective sales promotions.

Operating profit before exceptional items was 5 million lower than the previous year at 131 million.

The loss of share was mainly driven by the shift to at home consumption where Guinness and spirits are under represented.
In addition, over 50% of Diageos off trade volume was in premium beer which was impacted by aggressive price discounting by competitors.
There was also a shift in consumption towards wine and away from spirits and ready to drink since the duty increase.
Guinness held share in the year for the first time in 10 years despite volume decline of 4%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties were level, benefiting from a price increase.
The decline in spirits and ready to drink volume in the second part of the year reflected the impact of the duty increase of over 40% in spirits and nearly 100% in ready to drink, implemented in December 2002.
Smirnoff Red and Baileys both gained share.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume declined 6%, however Diageos share of ready to drink was maintained.
Volume in each of the local priority brands, Budweiser, Smithwicks and Carlsberg, all declined.
The duty increase also impacted volume growth of the category brands, 45% of the volume of which is spirits.
Volume of Diageos wine brands declined by 7%.
Other business performance drivers: Continued decline in the beverage alcohol market driven by a weakening economic environment As previously described, the beverage alcohol market in Ireland deteriorated further as a result of declining consumer confidence, the continuing slowdown in economic growth and the excise duty increase on spirits and ready to drink which led to retail price increases of around 20%.
The social aspects of drinking are a significant issue in Ireland.
As part of its ongoing social responsibility programme, Diageo participated fully in the establishment of MEAS a new independent association established as part of the social responsibility programme undertaken by the industry.

Organic performance The reasons for the increase in turnover are the favourable impact of exchange rate movements in the year 20 million and the benefit of the acquired Seagram brands, principally Cacique, which contributed 35 million to turnover in the six months ended 31 December 2002.
Operating profit before exceptional items benefited from an 11 million contribution from the acquired Seagram brands, partially offset by an organic decline of 4 million.

Marketing investment declined by 9% mainly due to the decision to reschedule the J B advertising campaign originally planned for April to September 2003.
The performance in the six months ended 30 June 2003 was in contrast to that of the first half of the year with volume up 14% having been 11% down in the first half.
This was primarily driven by 9% growth in the volume of J B in the second half and the inclusion of Cacique for the first time in organic growth in the second half.
The decline in global priority brands in the first half was mainly driven by the poor economic environment and by the tough prior year comparison driven by the duty increase in January 2002.
Volume declined by 4% in the full year against a 13% decline in the first half.
Net sales after deducting excise duties decreased by 7% for the full year against a 11% decline in the first half.
J B volume was down 3% for the full year following a decline of 11% in the first half as volume in the second half grew 9%.
Johnnie Walker volume was down 4% for the full year having been down 13% in the first half, an increase of 10% in the second half.
The other major global priority brands in Spain, Smirnoff Red and Baileys, saw volume decline in the difficult environment of the first six months.
Volume and net sales after deducting excise duties increased in the second half.
Cacique continued to make share gains partially through increased distribution and, benefiting from its leading position in a growing category, volume was up 40%.
In addition, a price increase was implemented in May 2003.
Other business performance drivers: Market share gains on J B, Baileys, Johnnie Walker Red Label and Cacique In the Scotch segment, Diageos brands gained share slightly with gains by J B and Johnnie Walker Red Label partially offset by share decline in VAT69.

Operating profit before exceptional items was up 1 million at 502 million for the year ended 30 June 2003.
Organic performance Turnover was boosted by the acquired Seagram brands which contributed 141 million in the six months ended 31 December 2002, and by an organic increase of 46 million.
However, unfavourable exchange variances of 108 million principally in respect of the Venezuelan bolivar, and the impact of disposals of 30 million principally Malibu 24 million reduced turnover.
Exchange losses on the Venezuelan bolivar of 30 million were more than offset by the impact of acquired Seagram brands which contributed 39 million to operating profit before exceptional items in the six months ended 31 December 2002.

Johnnie Walker volume declined as growth in Johnnie Walker Red Label, up 2%, was offset by a 6% decline in Johnnie Walker Black Label.
Johnnie Walker Black Label was impacted by the tough trading environment in Latin America.
Excluding Latin America, Johnnie Walker Black Label volume was up 4%.
Ready to drink volume was up 26% driven by further strong performance of Diageos ready to drink brands in Australia and by the Smirnoff Ice launches in Taiwan, France, Japan and Global Duty Free.
Local priority brand volume fell as strong performance on Bundaberg Rum, up 16%, and Guinness Malta, up 17%, only partially compensated for the decline in Buchanans in Venezuela and for the impact which the change of distributor arrangements for Dimple in South Korea had on sales of that brand in the first half.
Volume of category brands fell by 5% driven by the decline in VAT69 in Venezuela and by the decline in Spey Royal in Thailand in the first half.
This was partially offset by growth in category brand volume in Africa.
While overall volume declined, net sales after deducting excise duties grew, reflecting the benefit of strong price increases gained on the Guinness brand in Africa.
Marketing investment grew by 11%, driven by increased spend behind new brand launches and the relaunches of Johnnie Walker and Dimple in South Korea.
49 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Other business performance drivers: Strong performance in Africa Strong volume growth in Australia Continued impact of difficult economic situation in Latin America Impact of SARS in Asia and Global Duty Free in the year ended 30 June 2003 Competitor pricing in Portugal As previously noted, several of Diageos key markets are in geographies which faced the most difficult challenges in the year ended 30 June 2003.
The overall profitability of the key markets in Latin America declined.
This was partially offset by growth in Africa and in South Korea while other key markets broadly maintained operating profit year on year.
Africa, which is Diageos second largest market by volume, and its third largest market by operating profit, gained further momentum in the second half.
Volume was up 6% and net sales after deducting excise duties were up 18% for the full year.
Guinness volume was up 10% driven by the continued success of the Michael Power campaign.
Guinness Malta volume increased by 17% as distribution improved in Nigeria and Cameroon.
Additional packaging and brewing capacity, resulting from recent investment in Nigeria and Cameroon, was also a major contributory factor behind the growth of both Guinness and Guinness Malta.
Further capacity expansion projects were planned.
There was growth across all global priority spirits brands, with the exception of Smirnoff which was impacted by weak economic conditions in South Africa.
In Latin America, overall volume and operating profit declined by 16% and 30% respectively.
This reflected a dramatic decline in the Venezuelan business and a 7% volume decline in other Latin American markets.
Despite a tough environment, all markets remained profitable and there were successes for a number of brands.
For example, Smirnoff Red volume in Brazil grew by 12% as the brand benefited from increased marketing investment.
Mexicos performance was also strong with volume up by 22%, driven by J B and Baileys which were moved to in-house distribution during the year ended 30 June 2003.
In South Korea, Windsor, the leading Scotch whisky brand, gained share in the year and volume grew by 1% in the six months ended 30 June 2003.
The structure of the acquisition of the Windsor brands has delivered an operating profit margin improvement.
The in-house distribution arrangements for Dimple, the third largest Scotch whisky brand, were fully operational by 30 June 2003.
Dimple distribution was rebuilt from 53% to over 80% of target accounts.
The performance of the Scotch whisky category slowed in the second half, impacted by the weaker economic environment.
Global Duty Free volume was level, despite the impact of the Iraqi conflict and the SARS outbreak on world travel in the year ended 30 June 2003.
This reflected extremely strong customer and consumer activities and continued investment in priority brands in this high profile market.
Smirnoff Ice was launched in the year ended 30 June 2003 in a number of duty free markets and Tanqueray No.
TEN was also launched with very strong impact.
In Australia, Diageos leadership position was reinforced as overall share of spirits grew by over 7 percentage points in the year as all the priority brands gained share.
Diageos spirits business in Australia benefited from focus on programmes to improve quality of serve in the on trade and to improve merchandising in both the on and off trade.
Overall volume increased 16% and net sales after deducting excise duties were up 14%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties per equivalent unit were slightly down due to the decision to reposition the prices of ready to drink brands to an appropriate price premium to beer.
The strong volume growth was driven by Johnnie Walker up 35%, Baileys up 7% and Bundaberg up 16%.
Diageos ready to drink business grew by 30%.
Dark spirits ready to drink performed exceptionally well with both Johnnie Walker and Bundaberg Premix increasing their share of the total ready to drink category.
Despite the strong volume performance, operating profit growth was constrained by higher marketing investment and higher pension costs.
Despite a reduction in general consumer confidence, the beverage alcohol market in Greece was stable and Diageos volume grew 3%.
Volume growth was principally driven by Johnnie Walker Red Label up 5% and Johnnie Walker Black Label up 10%, as both gained share.
Ready to drink volume grew 4% as growth in Smirnoff Ice up 8%, and Gordons Space up 5%, offset weakness in Archers Aqua and Smirnoff Mule.
Marketing expenditure was up 5% to support the launch of new campaigns on a number of brands.
In Taiwan, the key driver of volume growth of 9% was again Johnnie Walker which increased 9%.
Pricing remained flat in the year but net sales after deducting excise duties grew 16% due to mix improvements.
In Japan, overall volume declined 1%, with Johnnie Walker down 17% and Old Parr down 15%.
The Scotch category is in decline and Diageos brands have also lost some share.
This was offset by volume growth in Guinness, up 17%.
Smirnoff Ice sold 51,000 equivalent units between its launch in May and 30 June 2003.
In Portugal, Diageos strategy was to maintain price and not follow the aggressive discounting policy of competitors.
In addition a new route to market was introduced in the year ended 30 June 2003 which led to a reduction in stock held by distributors.
Consequently, volume was down 36% and net sales after deducting excise duties were down 39%.
The change in market dynamics was considered to be long term and, as Diageos strategy is to maximise value not volume, Portugal has been managed as a venture market since 1 July 2003.

Operating profit before exceptional items, at 262 million for the year ended 30 June 2003, was 29 million higher than in the previous year.
Organic performance The main factor for the improvement in turnover was the strong organic growth which added 108 million to turnover compared with the previous year.
However, this was offset by unfavourable exchange movements of 21 million and the disposal of brands of 31 million principally Malibu 17 million and Gilbeys Green and White Label whiskies 9 million.
The principal element of the increase in operating profit before exceptional items was organic growth of 38 million.

In addition, ready to drink was an important contributor to venture marketsgrowth with further rollouts of Smirnoff Red and Black Ice as well as the full year benefit of the previous years launches.
Johnnie Walker volume grew 7%, however growth slowed in the second half of the year due in part to the impact of the Iraqi conflict and the SARS outbreak on travel in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Johnnie Walker Black Label volume was up 12% and Johnnie Walker Red Label grew 4% driven by strong performance across most of the venture markets with the exception of Germany where volume was constrained by competition from lower priced products.
Smirnoff Red volume increased 4% as the brand continued to benefit from the improvement in brand equity which has resulted from the launch of Smirnoff Ice across venture markets.
In addition, marketing investment behind Smirnoff Red rose by 7%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties of Smirnoff benefited from the favourable mix impact of ready to drink.
Guinness volume improved in the second half driven by strong performance in Malaysia.
Volume of Red Stripe in Jamaica, venture marketsonly local priority brand, was impacted in the second half by the worsening economic conditions in Jamaica and excise duty increases, but net sales after deducting excise duties benefited from price increases in the second half.
Baileys volume grew by 11%, as the brand benefited from an extremely strong holiday programme and marketing investment was increased by 15% versus the prior year.
Other business performance drivers: Marketing investment up 27% mainly behind ready to drink launches and longer term growth projects Operating profit growth led by the Caribbean, Middle East, Nordics and Germany 51 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Marketing investment grew by 27% due to investment to support ready to drink launches as well as investment to support longer term growth behind Baileys in Germany, Italy, the Caribbean and venture markets in Latin America and Johnnie Walker in Asia and the Caribbean.
The Caribbean and the Middle East markets performed strongly as a result of good performance across the global priority brands with volume up on these brands 20% and 10%, respectively.
In Norway, Diageos business was successfully maintained by a third party distributor during the six month suspension of Diageos trading licence and volume grew.
Diageo is fully operational in Norway following the reinstatement of the trading licence in February 2003 and Smirnoff, Bells and Gordons all gained share in the off trade, a segment which is showing strong growth following a reduction in excise duties.
Smirnoff Ice continued to perform well in the Nordics and volume was 100,000 equivalent units in the year ended 30 June 2003.
In Germany, in the year ended 30 June 2003, ready to drink was the fastest growing segment in the spirits market and from its launch in February 2002, Smirnoff Ice sold nearly 500,000 equivalent units by 30 June 2003.
Germany has been managed as a key market since 1 July 2003.
In the Netherlands, the second half performance was adversely impacted by an 18% duty increase in January 2003 and volume was down 2%.
In the venture markets across Asia, overall volume grew by 1% despite the impact on the year ended 30 June 2003 of the SARS outbreak.
In India, the sale of the Gilbeys Green and White Label whiskies in December 2002 resulted in increased focus on the global priority brands.
However, strong volume growth in India was offset by weakness in the Philippines where the decline in travel as a result of the SARS outbreak noted above impacted in the duty free channel.
Trend information On 8 July 2004 Diageo issued a statement about current trading.
The following is an extract from this statement: Looking forward to the new financial year, Diageo expects that organic growth in volume, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit will be similar to that achieved in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Based on current exchange rates, the adverse impact of exchange rate movements on profit before exceptionals and tax in fiscal 2005 is estimated to be 100 million, mainly due to year on year weakness in the dollar and currencies such as the Nigerian naira and the Venezuelan bolivar which cannot be hedged.
The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, CEO of Diageo, on the current financial year in Diageos preliminary announcement on 2 September 2004.
As we begin the new financial year we reiterate the guidance we gave at the time of the July trading statement as we do not see any major changes in the trading environment we face.
Europe remains our key business challenge and North America continues to provide our biggest opportunity.
We will continue to invest in our brands and markets to capture the highest value growth opportunities for our shareholders.
Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow A summary of the cash flow and reconciliation to movement in net borrowings for the three years ended 30 June 2004 is as follows: Year ended 30 June 2003 2002 2004 restated restated million million million Operating profit 1,871 1,787 1,530 Exceptional operating costs 40 168 470 Restructuring and integration payments 97 185 148 Depreciation and amortisation charge 224 249 300 Increase in working capital 13 227 125 Other items 96 178 19 Net cash inflow from operating activities 2,121 1,970 2,008 Dividends received from associates 224 60 87 Interest and dividends paid to minority interests 299 355 400 Taxation 298 105 311 Net sale purchase of investments 9 20 8 Net capital expenditure 307 341 520 Free cash flow 1,450 1,209 856 Acquisitions and disposals 34 833 1,508 Equity dividends paid 800 767 758 Issue of share capital 4 4 11 Net purchase of own shares for share trusts 4 65 64 Own shares purchased for cancellation 306 852 1,658 Exchange adjustments 371 227 267 Non-cash items 45 37 179 Decrease increase in net borrowings 726 626 17 Following the implementation of UITF 38 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the cash flow for the years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2002 have been restated to present the cash outflow in respect of the net purchase of shares for the employee share trusts below free cash flow.
This resulted in an increase to free cash flow of 65 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 2002 64 million.
52 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review The primary sources of the groups liquidity over the last three fiscal years have been cash generated from operations and cash received from disposals.
A portion of these funds has been used to fund acquisitions, share repurchases, to pay interest, dividends and taxes, and to fund capital expenditure.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that comprises the net cash flow arising from operating activities, dividends received from associates, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, and capital expenditure and financial investment.
Free cash flow as used by the group covers all the items that are required by FRS 1 to be on the face of the cash flow statement down to, and including, capital expenditure and financial investment.
It is therefore a natural sub-total but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The groups management believe the measure assists users of the financial statements in understanding the groups cash generating performance as it comprises items which arise from the running of the ongoing business.
Where appropriate, separate discussion is given for the impacts of acquisitions and disposals of businesses, equity dividends and purchase of own shares each of which arises from decisions which are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.
The management regards capital expenditure as ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant and machinery is required to support the day-to-day operations, whereas acquisitions and disposals of businesses are discretionary.
However, free cash flow does not necessarily reflect all amounts which the group either has a constructive or legal obligation to incur.
The free cash flow measure is also used by management for their own planning, budgeting, reporting and incentive purposes since it provides information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to influence.
Free cash flow generated was 1,450 million, compared with 1,209 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 and 856 million in the year ended 30 June 2002.
The two years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2002 have been restated following the adoption of UITF 38 whereby shares purchased and sold by the employee share trusts no longer form part of capital expenditure and financial investment.
Cash inflow, in the year ended 30 June 2004, from operating activities was 2,121 million 2003 1,970 million: 2002 2,008 million.
Discontinued operations in the year ended 30 June 2003 contributed 76 million 2002 346 million to operating cash flow.
Operating cash flow included 97 million of restructuring and integration costs compared with 185 million and 148 million in the years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2002 respectively.
Working capital increased by 13 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared to increases of 227 million and 125 million in the comparative years.
During 2004, three separate dividends were received from Diageos investment in Mot Hennessy compared with none in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Diageos investment in Mot Hennessy in France and the United States was managed during 2004 through a partnership in which Diageo has a 34% interest.
The dividends received during the year include 65 million of receipts from Mot Hennessy to cover amounts payable by Diageo to the tax authorities.
Interest payments including dividends paid to minority interests were 299 million compared with 355 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 and 400 million in the year ended 30 June 2002.
Purchases of tangible fixed assets in the current year amounted to 327 million 2003 382 million: 2002 585 million and were wholly attributable to the premium drinks segment 2003 premium drinks 315 million and discontinued operations 67 million: 2002 330 million and 255 million, respectively.
There were no individually significant expenditures on tangible fixed assets during the three years ended 30 June 2004.
Tax payments were higher in the year ended 30 June 2004 than in the comparative year as refunds from the US and UK tax authorities were received in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Sale of businesses cost 17 million as a result of payments made in respect of businesses previously disposed of 2003 generated 912 million: 2002 generated 5,100 million.
The sale consideration received in the year ended 30 June 2003 of 912 million included 642 million from the disposal of Burger King, and 173 million $273 million from the contingent value right received as final settlement from General Mills on the sale of Pillsbury.
In addition, in the year ended 30 June 2003, 58 million $89 million was received from the call option agreements granted to General Mills over 29 million of General Millsordinary shares held by Diageo.
The sale consideration received in the year ended 30 June 2002 arose principally from the disposal of Pillsbury and the subsequent sale of shares in General Mills to General Mills, the Malibu brand disposal and the subsequent sale of businesses acquired in connection with the Seagram acquisition.
In the year ended 30 June 2004, acquisitions cost 17 million.
The sale consideration received in the year ended 30 June 2003 was offset by cash outflows in respect of acquisitions of 137 million 2002 3,592 million, of which the Seagram spirits and wine businesses accounted for 3,533 million.
The company spent a net 4 million on the purchase of its own ordinary shares for employee option schemes compared to 65 million in the prior year and 64 million in the year ended 30 June 2002.
Capital repayments The groups management is committed to enhancing shareholder value, both by investing in the businesses and brands so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure so as to reduce the cost of capital, while maintaining prudent financial ratios.
The company acquired, and subsequently cancelled, 43 million 2003 116 million: 2002 198 million ordinary shares during the year ended 30 June 2004 for a consideration including expenses of 306 million 2003 852 million: 2002 1,658 million.
The group continues to review its capital structure and will continue to conduct share buy-backs when appropriate.
Borrowings Following a board review in June 2003, the group policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of net borrowings of group financing companies is to limit the proportion of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
Previously group policy was to maintain the proportion of borrowings maturing within one year at below 60% of total borrowings, and to maintain the level of commercial paper at below 50% of total borrowings.
In addition, it is group policy to maintain backstop facility terms from relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.

These proceeds have been used in the ongoing cash management and funding activities of the group.
During the year ended 30 June 2003, the group borrowed $1,000 million 550 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2007, $1,000 million 550 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2008, and $200 million 110 million in the form of a medium term note that matures in 2018.
During the year ended 30 June 2002, the group borrowed 500 million in the form of a guaranteed bond, 5,000 million 25 million and 1100 million 67 million in the form of medium term notes that matured in 2002, and 1300 million 201 million and $100 million 55 million in the form of medium term notes that matured in 2003.
The 726 million decrease in net borrowings from 30 June 2003 to 30 June 2004 reflected free cash flow see Glossary of 1,450 million noted above, and the benefits from favourable exchange rate movements of 371 million, less 306 million on the repurchase of shares and an 800 million equity dividend payment.
The 626 million decrease in net borrowings from 30 June 2002 to 30 June 2003 reflected free cash flow of 1,209 million, net receipts for sales purchases of businesses of 833 million and decreases due to exchange movements of 227 million, less dividends paid of 767 million and own shares purchased for cancellation of 852 million.
At 30 June 2004, the group had available undrawn committed bank facilities of 1,758 million 2003 1,970 million: 2002 2,105 million.
Of the facilities, 1,044 million expire in the period up to May 2005 and 714 million expire in the period up to May 2009.
Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates plus an agreed margin, which is dependent on the period of drawdown.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being a minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items aggregated with share of associatesprofits to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with all of its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.
Capital commitments not provided for at 30 June 2004 were estimated at 99 million 2003 62 million: 2002 43 million.
Diageo management believes that it has sufficient funding for its working capital requirements.
Contractual obligations Payments due by period As at 30 June 2004 Less than More than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total million million million million million Long term debt obligations 1,550 910 1,499 907 4,866 Operating leases 66 105 85 262 518 Purchase obligations 601 665 352 650 2,268 Provisions for liabilities and charges and creditors greater than one year 123 130 11 20 284 2,340 1,810 1,947 1,839 7,936 Long term debt obligations comprise borrowings before deducting interest rate and foreign currency swaps with an original maturity of greater than one year.
Purchase obligations include various long term purchase contracts entered into for the supply of certain raw materials, principally grapes, cans and glass bottles.
The contracts are used to guarantee supply of raw materials over the long term and to enable more accurate predictions of future costs.
It is expected that all contractual commitments will be funded from future operating cash flows and no new borrowings will be required to meet these obligations.
Provisions for liabilities and charges and creditors greater than one year exclude 37 million in respect of vacant properties included in operating leases, 107 million for an onerous contract included in purchase obligations, post employment provisions and deferred taxation.
In addition the group has 312 million of 9.42% cumulative guaranteed preferred securities which are included in non-equity minority interests on the consolidated balance sheet.
The securities are redeemable only at the option of the company on or after 16 November 2004.
55 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Off-balance sheet arrangements In connection with the disposal of businesses, the group has given guarantees of third party debt which were necessary to complete the disposals on the most favourable terms.
The directors are not aware of any instances of default by the borrowers at present, but the ability of the borrowers to continue to be in compliance with the guaranteed debt instruments, and in particular remaining current on payments of interest and repayments of principal, is significantly dependent on the current and future operations of those borrowers and their affiliates.
Diageo has guaranteed up to $850 million 467 million of external borrowings of Burger King until December 2007.
These loans had an original term of five years from December 2002, although Diageo and Burger King agreed to structure their arrangements to encourage refinancing by Burger King on a non-guaranteed basis prior to the end of five years.
The primary covenants under the guarantee are pari passu ranking and negative pledge.
See Additional information for shareholders Material contracts Agreement for the sale of Burger King Corporationfor further information.
In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in October 2001, Diageo has guaranteed debt of International Multifoods Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The JM Smucker Company as from 18 June 2004, to the amount of $200 million 110 million, repayable in November 2009.
In addition, certain of the acquired Seagram businesses had pre-existing guarantees at the date of the acquisition in relation to the solvency of a third party partnership.
This partnership has outstanding loans of $100 million 55 million.
Vivendi has indemnified the group against any losses relating to these arrangements.
The above guarantees are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the groups premium drinks business.
The group also has unrecognised gains and losses of 153 million and 89 million, respectively, in respect of financial instruments at 30 June 2004.
For further disclosures with regard to financial instruments, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
Save as disclosed above, neither Diageo plc nor any member of the Diageo group has any off-balance sheet financing arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on the groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.
Risk management The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the groups treasury department.
The treasury department uses a combination of derivative and conventional financial instruments to manage these underlying treasury risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board-approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the finance committee this committee is described in the corporate governance report.
These include benchmark exposure and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The benchmarks, hedge cover and overall appropriateness of Diageos risk management policies are reviewed by the board following, for example, significant business, strategic or accounting changes.
In June 2002 the board reviewed and approved changes to the groups interest rate and foreign exchange risk management policies.
The transition to the revised policies, which are described below, began during the year ended 30 June 2003.
In June 2003, the board reviewed and approved further changes to the groups liquidity risk management policies.
The transition to these new policies, which are described below, took place during the year ended 30 June 2004.
The framework provides for limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the optimal application of the board-approved strategies.
Transactions giving rise to exposures away from the defined benchmark levels arising on the application of this flexibility are separately monitored on a daily basis using value at risk analysis.
They are carried at fair value and gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account as they arise.
At 30 June 2004 gains and losses on these transactions were not material.
The finance committee receives bi-monthly reports on the activities of the treasury department, including any exposures away from the defined benchmarks.
The internal control environment is reviewed regularly.
Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the groups transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign currency net assets by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps.
The groups policy is to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net assets before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies where a liquid foreign exchange market exists.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net assets before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net borrowings and foreign exchange swaps are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments, in accordance with SSAP 20.
In order to achieve hedge accounting for its net investment in currency denominated assets under International Financial Reporting Standards, Diageo will need to introduce additional processes to determine, monitor and document the effectiveness of the hedges in the context of the underlying exposure.
Diageo has established a project team to determine the appropriate processes.
For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised at the same time as the underlying transaction.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards, the degree of confidence in forecast future cash flows required to achieve hedge accounting will increase.
This will lead to a reduction in the volume of such hedging transactions.
56 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk and within this category of market risk, is most vulnerable to changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing long term fixed rate bonds, medium term notes and floating rate commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions.
The profile of fixed rate to floating rate net borrowings is maintained according to the duration measure that is equivalent to an approximate 50% fixed and 50% floating amortising profile.
The number of years within the amortising profile depends on a template approved by the board.
The floating element of US dollar borrowing is partly protected using interest rate collars.
Following the June 2002 policy review, the level of interest rate collars will continue to reduce.
Remaining interest rate collars as at 30 June 2004 will take up to approximately two years to expire.
In addition, where appropriate, the group may use forward rate agreements to manage short term interest rate exposures.
Swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements and collars are accounted for as hedges.
Such management serves to increase the accuracy of the business planning process.
Diageo has a target range for cash interest cover defined as operating profit before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and share of associatesprofits, and after dividends received from associates, over net interest cash flow including minority interest dividends of five to eight times and under the current economic environment Diageos intention is to be at the higher end of this range.
The top limit may, however, be exceeded on certain occasions.
The full impact of International Financial Reporting Standards on Diageos interest rate risk management policy and the extent to which Diageo will be able to continue to hedge account for interest rate derivatives are under review.
The interest expense recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates under International Financial Reporting Standards than under current hedge accounting.
Liquidity risk Following the June 2003 board review, the groups policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of group financing companiesborrowings is to limit the proportion of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
Previously group policy was to maintain the proportion of borrowings maturing within 12 months at below 60% of total borrowings, and to maintain the level of commercial paper at below 50% of total borrowings.
Credit risk A large number of major international financial institutions are counterparties to the interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and deposits transacted by the group.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long term credit rating of A or better.
The group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties, together with their credit ratings.
Commodity price risk The group uses commodity futures and options to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity futures and options contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures or options are then either closed out at the time the raw material is purchased or they are exchanged with the company manufacturing the raw material to determine the contract price.
Commodity contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value but any gains and losses are deferred until the contracts are closed out or exchanged.
Open contracts at 30 June 2004 and gains and losses realised in the year or deferred at the balance sheet date were not significant.
Employee share schemes Awards and option grants vesting under the various employee share schemes are generally satisfied by the transfer of existing shares.
These awards and option grants are hedged through the purchase of shares or call options.
Exceptions to this policy are in respect of exercises under certain GrandMet and international schemes that are satisfied by the issue of new equity.
Insurance The group purchases insurance for commercial, or where required, for legal or contractual reasons.
In addition, the group retains insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of financing these losses.
Sensitivity analysis For financial instruments held, the group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of the groups financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes in the fair values of borrowings, the guaranteed preferred securities and the associated derivative financial instruments at 30 June 2004 are set out in the table below.
The fair values of quoted borrowings and guaranteed preferred securities are based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
These are based on rates obtained from third parties.
The estimated changes in fair values for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 30 June 2004, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 30 June 2004, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only as, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
57 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Sensitivity analysis table at 30 June 2004 Fair value changes arising from: 1% fall 10% Estimated in interest weakening fair value rates in sterling million million million Borrowings 5,463 170 509 Interest rate contracts 5 58 2 Foreign exchange contracts: Transaction 38 101 Balance sheet translation 19 132 Guaranteed preferred securities 320 36 Written call options re General Mills shares 41 3 5 Other financial net assets 2,077 7 238 Diageo has sold call options to General Mills giving General Mills the option to purchase 29 million of General Millsshares held by Diageo subject to certain limitations.
The call options have a strike price of $51.56 and expire in October 2005.
The estimated fair value of the call options was derived using a Black Scholes model using market volatility, share price and interest rates as at 30 June 2004.
It is estimated that a 15% increase in the share price of General Mills would increase the negative fair value by 29 million.
Critical UK GAAP accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
Diageos accounting policies are set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
In applying these policies the directors are required to make estimates and subjective judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit for the year.
The directors base these on a combination of past experience and any other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The actual outcome could differ from those estimates.
Of Diageos accounting policies, the directors consider that policies in relation to the following areas are of greater complexity and or particularly subject to the exercise of judgement.
Brands, goodwill and other intangibles Acquired brands are held on the consolidated balance sheet at cost.
Where brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.
Assessment of the useful economic life of an asset, or that an asset has an indefinite life, requires considerable management judgement.
Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that intangible assets, including brands, are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
In particular, the group performs a discounted cash flow analysis annually to compare discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of each acquired brand.
The analysis is based on a three year forecast with terminal values being calculated using the lower of the growth rate implicit in the companys strategic plan and the long term growth rate the real GDP growth rate of the country plus its inflation rate of the principal countries in which the majority of the profits of each brand are generated.
The estimated cash flows are discounted at the groups weighted average cost of capital in the relevant country.
Any impairment write downs identified are charged to the profit and loss account.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
Neither a 1% reduction in the long term growth rate assumptions used nor a 1% increase in the discount rate would result in any impairment charge.
Post employment benefits Diageo accounts for post employment benefits in accordance with FRS 17.
Application of FRS 17 requires the exercise of judgement in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises in excess of inflation, employee and pensioner demographics and the future expected returns on assets.
Diageo determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with its actuaries, and believes these assumptions to be in line with UK practice generally, but the application of different assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reflected in the profit and loss account and balance sheet in respect of post employment benefits.
The assumptions vary among the countries in which the group operates, and there may be an interdependency between some of the assumptions.
A list of the major assumptions used by the group for the three years ended 30 June 2004 are set out in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
It would be impracticable to give the impact of the effect of changes in all of the assumptions used to calculate the post employment charges in the profit and loss account and balance sheet, but the following disclosures are provided to assist the reader in assessing the impact of changes in the more critical assumptions.
The finance charges included in the profit and loss account for post employment benefits are partly calculated by assuming an estimated rate of return on the assets held by the post employment plans.
For the year ended 30 June 2004 this was based on the assumption that equities would outperform fixed interest government bonds by three percentage points.
A one percentage point increase in this assumption would have improved profit before taxation by approximately 30 million.
The rates used to discount the liabilities of the post employment plans are determined by using rates of return on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term of the plan liabilities.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the profit and loss account charge in the year ended 30 June 2004 would have improved profit before taxation by approximately 11 million.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the post employment liability at 30 June 2004 would have increased the liabilities by approximately 385 million.
58 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review The net liability for post employment benefits is partly determined by the market value at the end of the year of the assets owned by the post employment plans.
A 10% movement in worldwide equity values would increase decrease the net pension liability before tax at 30 June 2004 by approximately 280 million.
Operating exceptional items Operating exceptional items are those that, in managements judgement, are material items that arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the group but, by virtue of their size or incidence, should be separately disclosed if the consolidated financial statements are to properly reflect the results for the period.
The determination of which items should be separately disclosed as operating exceptional items requires a significant degree of judgement.
Financial instruments The group uses financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are structured so as to reduce the market risk associated with the underlying transaction being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
While UK GAAP includes prescriptive disclosure requirements in relation to financial instruments, it does not include a standard on hedge accounting.
Nevertheless, under UK GAAP, hedging principles are generally applied whereby the cash flows on hedge instruments are matched to the underlying hedged risks, with hedging instruments held in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
In the absence of detailed guidance under UK GAAP, judgement must be applied in the establishment and application of accounting policies in relation to financial instruments accounted for as hedges.
New accounting standards The financial information included in this annual report complies, to the extent detailed below, with the following pronouncements issued by the UK Accounting Standards Board ASB.
New UK and US accounting pronouncements that will impact the UK and US GAAP information are also set out below.
United Kingdom The group has adopted the reporting requirements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits in its primary financial statements from 1 July 2003.
The group also complies from 1 July 2003 with the following requirements issued by the UKs Accounting Standards Board: UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, and the amendment to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions.
The UK GAAP financial information for the two years ended 30 June 2003 and the appropriate year ends has been restated following the adoption of FRS 17, UITF 38 and the amendment to FRS 5.
FRS 17 Retirement benefits This standard replaces the use of the actuarial values for assessing pension costs in favour of a market-based approach.
In order to cope with the volatility inherent in this measurement basis, the standard requires that the profit and loss account shows the relatively stable ongoing service cost, the expected return on assets and the interest on the liabilities.
Differences between expected and actual returns on assets, and the impact on the liabilities of changes in the assumptions, are reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The adoption of FRS 17 has decreased the reported operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2003 by 88 million year ended 30 June 2002 111 million.
This charge has been offset by a decrease in exceptional charges of 14 million year ended 30 June 2002 decrease in exceptional income of 25 million and an increase in other finance income of 36 million year ended 30 June 2002 104 million, giving a net decrease in the profit for the year of 38 million year ended 30 June 2002 32 million.
In addition, the adoption of the standard has reduced shareholdersfunds at 30 June 2003 by 1,865 million 30 June 2002 reduced by 728 million: 30 June 2001 increased by 384 million.
UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts This abstract changes the presentation of an entitys own shares held in an employee share trust from requiring them to be recognised as assets to requiring them to be deducted in arriving at shareholdersfunds.
It also has consequential changes to UITF 17 requiring that the expense to the profit and loss account should be the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of award and the amount that an employee may be required to pay for the shares i. e. the intrinsic valueof the award.
The impact of the adoption of UITF 38 in the year ended 30 June 2003 has been to increase operating profit before exceptional items by 14 million year ended 30 June 2002 5 million: year ended 30 June 2001 4 million: year ended 30 June 2000 decrease of 6 million and increase the tax charge by 4 million year ended 30 June 2002 1 million: year ended 30 June 2001 1 million: year ended 30 June 2000 credit of 1 million.
In addition, in the year ended 30 June 2003 exceptional charges were reduced by 2 million, giving a net increase in the profit for the year of 12 million year ended 30 June 2002 4 million: year ended 30 June 2001 3 million: year ended 30 June 2000 decrease of 5 million.
The reclassification of shares acquired by the share trust own shares from fixed asset investments and debtors to equity has reduced shareholdersfunds by 288 million at 30 June 2003 30 June 2002 244 million: 30 June 2001 179 million:30 June 2000 146 million.
FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions The amendment to the standard added a new application note G on revenue recognition.
This requires that revenue should be stated at fair value of the right to consideration.
Diageo incurs certain promotional expenditure, where permitted under local law for example, slotting fees, whereby fees are paid to retailers for prominence of display, listing or agreement not to delist Diageos products that are not wholly independent of the invoiced product price.
Such expenditure is now deducted from turnover.
The change, which has no impact on operating profit, reduced turnover and operating costs by 159 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 year ended 30 June 2002 382 million: year ended 30 June 2001 714 million: year ended 30 June 2000 599 million.
Thefollowing pronouncements have recently been issued by the ASB.
FRS 20 Share-based payments In April 2004 the ASB issued FRS 20 Share-based payments.
The standard requires that share based payments should give rise to a charge in the profit and loss account that is allocated to the period of service the award relates to.
The charge is measured by reference to the fair value of goods or services received or, for transactions with employees, by reference to the fair value of 59 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review the equity instrument at the date of grant.
It is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The group is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.
FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date In May 2004 the ASB issued FRS 21 Events afterthe balance sheet date.
The standard amends the accounting treatment to be adopted by entities for events occurring between the balance sheet date and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Under the standard, dividends declared after the balance sheet date will be non-adjusting post balance sheet events.
The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
United States Thefollowing US GAAP pronouncements have been recently issued.
132 R Employers Disclosures About Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued a revised SFAS No.
The group has provided the additional disclosures in respect of the groups postretirement plans in note 5 and note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
FIN 46 and FIN 46 R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46 and in December 2003 a revised interpretation was issued FIN 46 R which clarified certain provisions of FIN 46 and provided for further scope exemptions.
FIN 46 R requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the party that has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses and or receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both the primary beneficiary.
A variable interest entity VIE has one or more of the following characteristics: 1 the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support beingprovided: 2 the equity holders lack the ability through voting rights or otherwise to make decisions about an entitys activities: or 3 the equity holders lack the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or lack the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity.
At 30 June 2004 the group was a partner with a subsidiary of LVMH Mot Hennessy-Louis Vuitton SA LVMH in Schieffelin & Somerset Co S&S, a partnership which marketed, distributed and sold, throughout the United States, certain premium and agency brands of Mot Hennessy and the group.
The creditors of the partnership have no recourse to the general credit of the group.
At 30 June 2004 the group was the primary beneficiary of the partnership and has consolidated the balance sheet of S&S at that date.
Following the termination of this joint arrangement S&S is not expected to be consolidated under FIN 46 R in the year ended 30 June 2005.
The group has a number of other similar joint arrangements with LVMH in France and the Far East, all involved in the marketing, distributing and selling of alcoholic beverages.
The balance sheets of these arrangements have also been consolidated in the groups US GAAP consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2004.
The group has an agreement with Destilera Serralls, Inc. Serralls whereby Serralls produces and sells rum maturates to the group.
The group has concluded that this arrangement does not represent a variable interest in Serralls.
The group has an agreement with Tequila Cuervo La Rojena, S. A. fide C. V. and Casa Cuervo, S. A. fide C. V. collectively Cuervo whereby the group was appointed the exclusive distributor of Jos Cuervo products in the United States.
The term of the contract extends to 30 June 2013.
Cuervo is involved in the production and sale, importation, exportation, distribution, licensing, manufacturing and bottling of tequila and other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.
The group has concluded that this arrangement does not represent a variable interest in Cuervo.
On 13 December 2002, the group completed the legal disposal of Burger King, a leading company in the worldwide quick service restaurant industry.
In connection with the disposal, the group agreed to guarantee a $750 million term loan and a $100 million revolving line of credit on behalf of Burger King and its subsidiaries.
As part of the proceeds from the sale, the group received a subordinated debt instrument in an original principal amount of $213 million.
The group has concluded that Burger King is not a variable interest entity and is therefore outside the scope of FIN 46 R. Diageo has complied with FIN 46 R in the groups US GAAP consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2004.
The implementation of FIN 46 R has had no impact on the US GAAP consolidated shareholdersequity or net income.
03-6 Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No.
128, Earnings per Share In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB issued EITF Issue No.
This issue addressed changes in the reporting and calculation requirements for earnings per share, providing the method to be used when a company has granted holders of any form of security rights to participate in the earnings of the company along with the participation rights of common stockholders.
The group has reviewed the contractual rights granted for stock options and concluded that EITF 03-6 does not affect the groups reporting and disclosure.
106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 In December 2003, the United States Congress enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act.
The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Medicare Part D, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No.
106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FSP 106-2.
The group is in the process of determining the impact of this issue on the business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
Therefore, in accordance with FSP 106-2, the US GAAP accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net period postretirement benefit cost included in the consolidated financial statements do not reflect the effects of the Act.
This is because the group is currently determining whether the benefits conferred by the US plans are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D under the Act.
03-1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments In June 2004, the EITF issued EITF Issue No.
The issue includes determining the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity securities within the scope of SFAS No.
115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS No.
115 and equity securities that are not subject to the scope of SFAS No.
115 and not accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
60 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review The Task Force reached a consensus that the application guidance in EITF 03-1 should be used to determine when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss.
The guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealised losses that have not been recognised as other than temporary impairments.
These disclosure requirements became effective for periods ended prior to 30 June 2004.
The recognition and measurement guidance of EITF 03-1 should be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2004.
The group considers that there were no unrealised losses requiring additional disclosures at 30 June 2004 and will evaluate, as the need arises, the impact of EITF 03-1 on the business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
Conversion to International Financial Reporting Standards The European Union has issued a regulation requiring most companies listed in the EU to comply with accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and adopted by the EU, in the preparation of their consolidated accounts for financial reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The EUs objective is to improve financial reporting and enhance transparency, in order to assist the free flow of capital and improve the efficiency of the capital markets.
Diageo therefore expects to have to present its consolidated financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2006 in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards and International Accounting Standards together IFRSs.
There remains some uncertainty as to the number of comparative financial statements Diageo will be required to present to comply with US requirements.
These would generally require at least two years of comparative information, but on 12 March 2004 the SEC published proposals whereby foreign registrants adopting IFRS for the first time would be required to provide only one year of comparative financial statements instead of two.
If the proposal is approved, Diageos opening IFRS balances will be as at 1 July 2004.
Over the last few years, the IASB has undertaken an extensive programme to develop new standards and to improve its existing ones.
The final text for most of the standards was completed by the end of March 2004.
However, some standards, in particular IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, may be subject to further changes.
In addition, certain IFRSs may be issued during the next two years, which Diageo, where allowed, may decide to adopt early.
The group commenced a programme of work in 2002, initially in respect of financial instruments where it was clear that substantial differences existed between IFRSs and current UK GAAP.
This programme has been extended to include an initial assessment of the differences between each IFRS and the current Diageo accounting policy.
Following this exercise, a programme has been initiated to identify required changes to systems and processes: to provide training so as to ensure that the group can meet the new reporting requirements: and to identify other consequential impacts on the group which will need further consideration and or action.
The main uncertainties relate to the standards that have not yet been finalised and adopted by the EU.
However, the directors currently expect that the principal impact of the adoption of IFRSs on Diageos net profit and shareholdersfunds will arise from changes in respect of financial instruments, share-based payments, post employment benefits and deferred tax.
The impact of IFRSs on the groups hedging policies is discussed under Risk managementabove.
Discussion of US GAAP differences Diageos consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which is the groups primary reporting framework.
Reconciliations between UK and US GAAP are set out in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements and this section explains the principal differences.

See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Turnover UK GAAP turnover sales in US terminology for the year ended 30 June 2004 was 114 million 2003 128 million: 2002 140 million higher than turnover under US GAAP, as the accounting treatment for joint arrangements between the group and LVMH is different.
Under UK GAAP, the group includes in turnover its attributable share of turnover of joint arrangements, measured according to the terms of the arrangement and sales to joint arrangements by Diageo companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Under US GAAP, joint arrangements have been accounted for during the year under the equity method of accounting and the groups share of sales of the joint arrangements is not included as part of group sales.
Sales to joint arrangements by Diageo companies are accounted for as part of turnover.
Net income The significant reconciling items in net income are as follows: Inventories The fair value of the net assets under US GAAP of the Guinness Group was higher than the net assets under UK GAAP, primarily in respect of maturing whisky inventories.
The fair value of the inventories at the date of acquisition 17 December 1997 was 601 million higher under US GAAP compared to UK GAAP.
The increase in inventory values is unwinding over a number of years on the sale of the whisky to third parties.
In the year ended 30 June 2004, 37 million 2003 46 million: 2002 58 million of the fair value increase was realised.
Pension and other post employment benefits Under UK GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using the market value of assets, are charged credited to finance charges in the profit and loss account.
Any amount arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The surplus or deficit in post employment plans at the balance sheet date is part of the groups consolidated net assets.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost, the interest being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the year and the expected return on assets for the year calculated using a smoothed market value of assets are charged credited to operating profit.
The cumulative amounts arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are amortised through operating profit over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
Only when the plan is in deficit, calculated on the plans accrued rather than projected liabilities, is the liability included in the groups consolidated net assets.
If the plan is in surplus, the groups consolidated net assets include a prepayment or provision which is the difference between the cumulative profit and loss account charges and the cumulative cash contributions made to the plan.
Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares Under the terms of the contingent value right received in connection with the disposal of Pillsbury, in the year ended 30 June 2003, Diageo received a cash payment of 173 million from General Mills.
Under UK GAAP, this was recognised in the profit and loss account as an exceptional gain on the disposal of businesses.
However, under US GAAP, this was recognised in the profit and loss account in the year ended 30 June 2002 as a derivative and was accordingly held at its estimated fair value with changes in this fair value included in the profit and loss account.
The group received cash in settlement of the contingent value right on 1 May 2003.
Under UK GAAP, the premium received from the sale of options to General Mills over 29 million ordinary shares of Diageos holding in that company has been deferred in the balance sheet.
The premium will be recognised in the profit and loss account on exercise or lapse of the options.
Under US GAAP, the option contract represents a derivative and is accordingly held at its estimated fair value at the balance sheet date with changes in fair value included in the profit and loss account.
Other derivative instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Under UK GAAP, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and derivatives hedging forecast transactions are not recognised until realised.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, all derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Certain of the groups derivatives qualify for and are designated as hedges under US GAAP, which defers the effect on net income from gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value, to coincide with the timing of the recognition of the hedged item.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for US GAAP hedge accounting treatment are charged or credited in determining net income under US GAAP.
In the year ended 30 June 2004, under US GAAP, gains of 62 million were recognised on foreign exchange derivatives 2003 losses of 148 million: 2002 gains of 97 million and gains of 62 million were recognised on interest rate instruments 2003 losses of 45 million: 2002 losses of 219 million.
The year on year movements are a product of the portion of the groups hedging instruments for which mark-to-market movements are taken to net income under US GAAP but not under UK GAAP, and the movements in exchange and interest rates in each period.
Other differences arising between UK and US GAAP on derivative instruments amounted to losses of 13 million 2003 gains of 4 million: 2002 gains of 22 million.
62 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Operating and financial review Burger King impairment charges and transaction costs Under UK GAAP, the sale of Burger King was accounted for as a disposal and the results prior to the disposal date are presented within discontinued operations.
Net income for the year ended 30 June 2003 reflected a pre tax charge in relation to the sale of Burger King of 1,441 million and 750 million under UK and US GAAP, respectively, representing 691 million of the total UK US GAAP difference in net income.
Under US GAAP, the transaction is not accounted for as a disposal due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continuing involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance.
However, a charge for impairment was recognised rather than a loss on disposal.
The charge for impairment under US GAAP was lower than the loss on disposal under UK GAAP principally because the goodwill and brands acquired on the original acquisition of the quick service restaurants business were being amortised over 40 years up to 30 June 2001 prior to the adoption of SFAS No.
142, whereas no amortisation had been charged on the goodwill and brands under UK GAAP.
By the date of disposal, Diageo had incurred additional cumulative amortisation including related deferred tax under US GAAP of 609 million on the goodwill and brands of Burger King.
Other differences arising between UK and US GAAP, principally in respect of derivative instruments, reduced the charge under US GAAP by 82 million.
In the US GAAP balance sheet, the total assets and total liabilities of Burger King at 30 June 2004 including consideration deferred under US GAAP classified within other long term assetsand other long term liabilitieswere each 1.2 billion 2003 1.3 billion.
Under US GAAP, the transaction will be accounted for as a disposal when the uncertainties related to the guarantee provided in respect of the acquisition finance have been substantially resolved and or the buyers cumulative investment meets or exceeds minimum levels.
As at 30 June 2002, under US GAAP, an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill attributable to the groups quick service restaurants business of 135 million was recognised.
Under UK GAAP, the goodwill to which the impairment related had already been written off to reserves.
Disposals of businesses Under UK GAAP, the group made losses on disposals of other businesses of 10 million compared with gains of 97 million under US GAAP in the year ended 30 June 2004.
The principal reason for the difference was the recognition of the deferred gain established on the sale of Pillsbury.
In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in the year ended 30 June 2002, Diageo guaranteed the debt of a third party to the amount of $200 million 110 million.
Under UK GAAP, Diageo provided for the amounts which it could have paid to settle the potential liability or transfer it to a third party as a cost of the transaction.
On 18 June 2004, International Multifoods Corporation was acquired by the JM Smucker Company, as a result of which the provision being carried in respect of the guarantee has been reviewed and revised.
Under US GAAP, Diageo had deferred the element of the gain on disposal of Pillsbury equivalent to the amount guaranteed.
As a result of the acquisition of International Multifoods Corporation by JM Smucker, the deferred gain under US GAAP has been recognised in the year ended 30 June 2004, and a provision, against the guarantee, equal to that under UK GAAP has been established.
In June 2003, under UK GAAP, excluding the pre tax loss in respect of the disposal of Burger King of 1,441 million and the receipt under the terms of the contingent value right of 173 million described above, the group made gains on disposals of other businesses of 14 million compared with gains of 16 million under US GAAP in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Exceptional and extraordinary items Under UK GAAP, exceptional items are those that, in managements judgement, are material items that arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the group but, by virtue of their size or incidence, should be separately disclosed if the consolidated financial statements are to properly reflect the results for the period.
US GAAP does not have such a category.
Under US GAAP, certain of these items are treated in accordance with paragraph 26 of APB 30 as a separate component of income from continuing operations, if appropriate.
The group has had no extraordinary items under either UK or US GAAP for the three years ended 30 June 2004.
