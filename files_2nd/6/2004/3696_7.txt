This amortisation may also be excluded from Recommended dividends per share increased by 10.1%.
The changes required to the accounting for employee share based incentives will increase operating costs, assuming utilisation of this type of benefit continues at the rate incurred in 2004.
Due to the transitional arrangements, this increased cost will not come into full effect until 2005.
The Group does not intend to change the fundamental tenet of its foreign exchange hedging policy.
IFRS requires all hedges to be strictly designated and the hedge effectiveness tested.
Up until now the nature of Cobhams use of this form of derivative instrument is to take broad hedges against the anticipated net position of a portfolio of foreign exchange risks.
Meeting the strict hedge criteria for all contracts may therefore not be practicable.
If this were the outcome, forward foreign currency contracts would be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and movements in these fair values booked to the income statement as they arise, resulting in potential volatility in the reported profit and loss account.
The Group will identify the WARREN TUCKER underlying profit impact of the hedging policy.
