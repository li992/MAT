The raw materials which the Groups businesses use and the products that they produce are subject to demanding regulations concerning product safety in all parts of the world.
These regulations, which also cover product testing and risk assessment requirements, are subject to review and revision, as is currently happening in Europe with the proposed REACH Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals regulations.
The Group is assessing the potential impact of these proposals on its businesses and will ensure compliance when the new European Union regulations come into force.
There is a growing pressure from legislators, customers and the general public to reduce the environmental and health impacts of products throughout their life cycle.
ICI is responding to this by ensuring that each business has a Product Stewardship programme in place.
This voluntary programme embraces, through best business practices, product regulatory requirements, societal pressures, reducing the risk of harm to people and the environment, and ICI aims to provide the relevant information to enable correct use and disposal of products.
