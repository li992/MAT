Stagecoach Group plc page 15 Finance Directors review Pensions The Group continues to account for pensions on the basis of SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs.
Under SSAP 24, total pension costs in the year ended 30 April 2004 were 32.9m 2003: 31.2m.
The post-tax pension scheme deficit under FRS 17 Retirement benefits improved i. e. reduced by 50.5m in the year.
Under FRS 17, the defined benefit pension schemes in respect of the Groups UK Bus and head office employees showed a net liability at 30 April 2004 of 115.8m after taking account of deferred tax.
In addition, the defined benefit pension schemes in respect of the Groups Rail employees showed a net liability of 14.2m after deferred tax.
We believe the Rail deficit needs to be considered separately as the franchise payments under the South West Trains franchise take account of increased contribution levels to fund the deficit and we believe that the Group has no liability beyond the end of the franchise.
International Financial Reporting Standards Being a UK quoted company, Stagecoach Group plc is required to produce future financial statements and annual reports in line with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS also known as International Accounting Standards IAS.
The Groups first full set of IFRS accounts, including comparatives, will be prepared for the year ending 30 April 2006.
In September 2003, the Company established a Steering Committee to oversee the convergence to IFRS.
To date the Committee has identified the main differences between IFRS and the current Group UK GAAP policies and is making good progress in establishing the accounting policies or changes that will be required.
The convergence project is ongoing and the Committee will continue to monitor evolving best practice and will apply the standards that are required for adoption in due course.
The Company is committed to ensuring it complies with all material aspects of IFRS and until such time as its conversion project is complete, it is inappropriate to provide a comprehensive summary of all of the accounting differences that could impact the Companys financial statements.
The most significant areas of difference are expected to be in respect of financial instruments, pensions and goodwill.
The Steering Committee is also closely examining the detailed IFRS regulations in relation to leases and government grants.
Accounting policies The Group has implemented UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts early.
As a result, there has been an impact on the classification of our shares purchased during the year.
The adoption of UITF 38 has had no impact on the profit for the year ended 30 April 2004 2003: Nil.
Had UITF 38 not been adopted, the consolidated net assets would have been 3.9m higher as at 30 April 2004 2003: Nil.
There have been no other changes in accounting policies.
