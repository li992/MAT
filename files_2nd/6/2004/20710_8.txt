Annual Report & Accounts 2004 17 Financial Review continued International Financial Reporting Standards We are currently working on restating our 2004 results on an IFRS basis.
This will form the 2004 comparative results which we will disclose in the 2005 interim and annual results.
These restatements will be on both a statutory basis excluding IAS 39 and a proforma basis including the impact of IAS 39, other than hedge ineffectiveness.
They will also include the restated opening reserves positions at 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2005.
The Group is planning to provide this 2004 information in an announcement to be issued towards the end of May 2005, giving an explanation of the changes from UK GAAP to IFRS.
At this point the IFRS statutory comparative gures and opening reserves will have been audited.
Our view of the key areas that will be affected by IFRS, and the current estimates of these impacts, are shown in the table below.
These numbers have not been audited and are therefore subject to change.
Impact on 2004 Impact on 2005 Profit & Loss Account Opening Reserves Statutory Proforma m m m Mortgages and Loans at Amortised Cost IAS 39 Under UK GAAP the Group generally recognises discounts, incentives, fees and costs to profit as incurred.
Under the effective interest rate rules in IAS 39, all discounts and incentives, and most fees and commissions receivable and payable, are spread over the average life of the loan.
N a 0 to 20 50 to 100 Impairment IAS 39 From January 2005 the Group can only provide for losses on an incurred basis.
This will reduce the level of provisions held within the Group.
N a 0 to 20 0 to 50 Re-recognition of Financial Liabilities at their contractual value Under IFRS it is not possible to fide-recognise any contractual financial liability.
As a consequence amounts fide-recognised and taken to profit during 2004 under UK GAAP will be restated.
0 to -20 0 to -20 0 to -50 Pension Fund deficit The pension fund deficit of 65.3m, and the existing SSAP 24 prepayment of 264.1m, less associated corporation tax, will be written off to reserves.
N a N a -200 to -250 Finance Leases Finance Leases will be accounted for on a pre-tax actuarial basis rather than a post-tax basis.
The overall return from a transaction will not change, but profits will be recognised later in a transaction compared to UK GAAP.
0 to -20 0 to -20 0 to -50 Operating Leases The calculation of operating lease depreciation will change from an actuarial basis to a straight line basis.
This will lead to higher depreciation in the early years of a lease but lower depreciation towards the end of a lease.
0 to -20 0 to -20 0 to -50 Dividends Payable UK GAAP dividends are deducted from retained earnings in the year to which they relate.
Under IFRS dividends are not recognised until approved.
N a N a 100 to 150 Fair Value of Available For Sale Assets IAS 39 The majority of our Treasury assets will be categorised as available for sale.
Any movements in fair values will go to reserves.
N a N a 0 to 50 Fair Value of Derivatives IAS 39 Derivatives will be brought on to the Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value taken to the profit and loss account.
This will lead to profit and loss volatility, which will be mitigated by the use of hedge accounting.
However, some volatility will remain, due to residual hedge ineffectiveness.
N a N a 0 to 50 There are a number of other IFRS adjustments which are not individually significant and have not been itemised separately.
Impact on 2004 Impact on 2005 Profit & Loss Account Opening Reserves Statutory Proforma m m m Group Overall Impact -20 to -40 -10 to -30 -25 to 25 Overall, the impact on the Group 2004 proforma profit and loss account is expected to be a reduction of pre-tax profit of between 10m and 30m, less than 5% of total pre-tax profit.
Earnings per share will be reduced by a similar proportion.
The impact on opening reserves at 1 January 2005 is an estimated overall change of between plus and minus 25m, less than 5% of opening reserves.
Due to the different regulatory capital treatment for pensions, cashow hedges and available for sale assets, the overall beneficial impact on regulatory capital of IFRS as at 1 January 2005 is estimated to be between 0m and 50m.
