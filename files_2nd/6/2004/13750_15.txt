We expect that the group will be fully prepared for the transition in 2005 and for the first set of applicable financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2006.
However, the implementation plan is dependent upon the completion of the standard-setting process by the IASB and the endorsement of such standards by the EU.
The group has not yet determined the full effects of adopting IFRS.
The preliminary view is that the major differences between our current accounting practice and IFRS will include hedge accounting, accounting for embedded derivatives and other items falling within the scope of the financial instruments standards, accounting for business combinations, pensions and post-retirement benefits, deferred tax and share-based Malcolm Wyman payments.
The group will continue to monitor developments in IFRS.
