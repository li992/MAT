Background St. Modwen acquired this 88-acre site in October 2002 via a sale and leaseback which enabled Goodyear to release value whilst retaining the right to remain in occupation on a flexible term basis.
The company also undertook to assist Goodyear in using surplus space and within 9 months, a 33,000 sq ft office building was vacated and re-let to brokerage business Promise Finance, securing 120 new jobs.
Partnership The arrangement with Goodyear involved the creation for the company of close links not only with Goodyear but also with Wolverhampton City Council.
As Goodyears manufacturing plans evolved a masterplan was drawn up enabling it to consolidate its operations in part of the site, releasing the balance for mixed used development.
In late 2004, after extensive consultation a resolution to grant planning consent was obtained for the sites redevelopment.
Goodyears 88-acre facility Located in a predominantly residential suburb of Wolverhampton.

Planning consent for a first phase of 62,000 sq ft of industrial distribution units was obtained and these were developed by St. Modwen.
In 2003, BZL closed its zinc smelting operation and sold the entire 212 acre site to the company.
As part of the acquisition, St. Modwen assumed all the environmental obligations for the Partnership site from BZL.
In the subsequent year the company has cleared the site, taken control of the remaining Avonmouth is a story of two partnerships.

In a surprisingly short time with no intervening period of dereliction the zinc smelter plant has been demolished at a cost of some 2m and a robust regime for the sites future safekeeping put in place.
The emerging masterplan will see the whole 212 acre site brought back into use as a recycling Eco Park and a major employment site, recreating the jobs lost by the smelters closure and replacing a potentially contaminating use with Demolition ones that will actually aid the environment.

The aim was to re-instate this 750-acre wooded North Staffordshire estate as one of the UKs leading visitor destinations.
After obtaining outline planning consent in 2003 detailed consent was obtained in November 2004 for the first phase of the 100m restoration and regeneration scheme.
Partnership From the outset the company undertook extensive consultation with Stafford Borough Council, the planning authority, Staffordshire County Council, the neighbouring local authorities, the parish council, local action groups, English Heritage, English Nature and numerous historical societies.
Out of this consultation a framework of a restoration project emerged on which there was extensive public consultation.
A planning application followed and after further extensive discussions with interested parties a resolution to grant planning was obtained.
A long and expensive delay ensued when the Secretary of State called in the application but the partnership forged in the consultation process stood the test and the enquiry found in favour of the scheme.

In the five years ending 30th November 2004 we have exceeded this target, with net asset value per share increasing by 122%, and dividends per share by 100%.
Over this five year period, the total annualised shareholder return was 30.5% per annum compared with 13.1% from the FTSE Real Estate index, and 4.1% from the FTSE 250 index Tim Haywood source: HSBC Datastream.
Finance Director The continued progression of the share price up 18% in the year to 305p on 30th November 2004 lifted the market capitalisation of the company to 368m, placing it comfortably in the FTSE250 index of leading shares.
Profit and Loss account Net rental income received in the year, including our share of rent from joint ventures, increased by 5.5% 2.0m to 38.4m.
Acquisitions in the year contributed 4.5m additional rent of which Longbridge, and the remaining half of Kirkby Shopping Net asset value per share Centre contributed 4.3m, helping to offset the 2.9m of rental income lost on disposals principally Belle Vale Shopping increased by 122% over Centre and Worcester Retail Park.

Basingstoke, and the remainder of MG Rovers site at Longbridge, the gross portfolio rent receivable, including our share of rent from joint ventures, increased by 15.1% 5.9m to 44.8m as at 30th November 2004.
A number of our sites are currently being managed in such a way as to enable development in the near future.
This tends to lead to a higher level of voids.
During the year under review, however, we managed to reduce our overall voids from 13.9% to 13.1%.
We also added 0.4m to the annual rent roll from net lettings, even after allowing for voids created in preparation for development.
Property profits which comprise profits on sale of both development properties and investments increased by 35% in the year to 34.0m 2003: 25.2m.
These profits were again achieved from a broad range of projects, of which 11 contributed more than 1m.
Included in these profits was 12.5m from sales of industrial and distribution properties, 6.4m from retail developments, 2.4m from office developments, 7.8m from the sale of residential land and 4.9m relating to the disposal of our investment in Pubmaster.
Overheads increased during the year by 1.6m to 14.9m, principally as a result of recruitments and the regional expansion needed to match our increased activity.
We continue to adopt the policy of satisfying employee share options, when exercised, by purchasing the required number of shares in the market place, rather than issuing new share capital, which would dilute returns for existing shareholders.
With 5.1m outstanding options held by 112 employees, and a significant share price increase in the year, the impact has been a charge to the profit and loss account of 3.8m 2003: 4.2m.
The companys option schemes which comprise the SAYE scheme open to all employees, and the executive share option scheme, which is available to 36 senior and middle managers and directors remain an important tool in the recruitment and retention of key staff, and in aligning employee interests with those of shareholders.
20 St. MODWEN PROPERTIES PLC Annual report 2004 Portfolio analysis - income producing properties The triennial valuation of the companys final salary pension Capital value by sector scheme which has been closed to new entrants since 1999 as at 5th April 2003, showed a deficit of 3.9m.
The company Industrial 54% has therefore provided 1.5m 2003: 1.2m in the accounts, Retail 40% Office 6% a sum which includes the regular cost of current service, and the amortisation of the past service deficit, as required under SSAP 24.
Mindful of the ever-increasing cost associated with final salary schemes, the company took steps during the year to limit its exposure by introducing employee contributions, extending the normal retirement age and capping certain benefits.
Finance costs have increased to 17.2m 2003: 16.0m.
Average group borrowings increased by 19m to 184m due to the steady programme of acquisitions in the year, while average joint venture borrowings remained unchanged at 159m.
Despite rising interest rates during the year, the beneficial impact of the companys hedging strategy, and selective renegotiation of facilities resulted in a reduced weighted average rate of Rental income by sector interest payable as at 30th November 2004 of 6.2% for group borrowings 2003: 6.4%.
The cost of joint venture borrowings, Industrial 58% which were not hedged to the same extent, rose to 5.8% Retail 36% Office 6% 2003: 5.3%.
The groups borrowings are at variable rates of interest, although we actively manage our interest rate exposure using interest rate swaps.
At the year-end, 56% of company net borrowings were hedged in this way 2003: 96%, and 51% of joint venture borrowings 2003: 58% The group does not capitalise interest on its developments or its investments, but expenses all interest as it arises.
Taxation The effective rate of tax charge for the year, including provision for deferred taxation, has fallen to 24.5% 2003: 28.4% due Capital value by location to the availability of industrial building and capital allowances on recent acquisitions, and land remediation relief for expenditure Midlands 38% on brownfield renewal.
It is anticipated that, with the continued South 43% North 19% utilisation of capital allowances, the effective rate will remain below the standard rate of Corporation Tax.
Benefit from tax planning activities is only recognised when the outcome is reasonably certain.
Cash flow The company continues to produce a strong cash flow, based on recurring net rental income of 38m and an ongoing programme of asset disposals, which generated 42m in the year.
This enabled us to fund a 60m development programme, together with property acquisitions of 130m during the year, with only a 92m increase in net debt.
Furthermore, in managing our development programme we pay particular attention to its financing profile, controlling the timing of land payments and sales and the receipt of progress payments to optimise cash flows.
This enables us to undertake an ever-increasing scale of development activity without excessive gearing.
21 St. MODWEN PROPERTIES PLC Annual report 2004 Operating and financial review Financial review continued Total returns % Balance Sheet Investment properties - The total value of investment properties, including 100% of joint ventures, increased by 140m during the year to 615m.
Expenditure on the portfolio totalled 138m, of which the largest transactions were the 57m MG Rover acquisitions at Longbridge and 30m in our 50% joint venture company Key Property Investments Limited, in respect of the acquisition of The Malls, Basingstoke.
The independent valuation at 30th November 2004 resulted in an uplift on our share of the portfolio of 5.5% 26.1m.
This revaluation increase reflects a market value movement of 18.3m on our retail properties.
The remaining uplift represents added value from the management and development of specific assets within the portfolio.
Although many of our sites are situated in disadvantaged areas that currently qualify for relief from Stamp Duty Land Tax, this benefit, because it is potentially temporary, Income returns % is not recognised within the valuation.
Nor does the valuation include any hope value from future development activities or changes of use.
Assets held in work in progress are carried at cost, not included in the annual valuation.
Other investments - Our 27.2% stake in Northern Racing PLC, an AIM-listed company, has been accounted for in accordance with UITF 31 Exchanges of Businesses.
As a result, the carrying value of our investment at 30th November 2004 is 9.6m.
This represents the fair value of the assets acquired, plus post acquisition profits.
Under UITF 31, we are not permitted to recognise the AIM market value of our stake, which, at the share price of 195p on 30th November 2004, was 18.7m.
Prior year restatement - The 2003 comparative balance sheet has been restated in accordance with UITF 38, our accounting for ESOP Trusts, to show the 1.3m investment in our own shares as Capital returns % a deduction from shareholders funds.
Gearing and financing As a result of the strong programme of acquisitions during the year, group net borrowings have increased to 227m 2003: 135m, representing a gearing ratio of 85% 2003: 60%.
This is still at the lower end of our preferred gearing range of 75% to 125%, and therefore gives us ample headroom and flexibility to move swiftly to undertake further development and acquisitions.
At this level, we have undrawn committed facilities of 96m.
In addition, the groups share of debt within joint ventures, which is secured solely upon the assets within the relevant joint venture, was 99m 2003: 97m.
The group is financed by shareholders funds and bank debt of varying maturity profiles, which is appropriate to the needs of the St. Modwen IPD group and reflects the type of assets in which it invests.

The company actively manages its tax affairs undrawn facilities of 96m to ensure that this situation will not arise, and indeed this years tax charge has benefited from such management.
Without such a provision there would be a notional uplift of 5.3m or 4.4p per share 2003: 3.9m or 3.2p per share.
The effect of the fair value adjustment FRS13 of marking the Groups interest rate derivatives to current market value would be to produce a notional liability after tax of 0.4m or 0.3p per share 2003: 0.3m or 0.2p per share.
The effect of providing deferred tax on future disposals of investment properties would be to produce a notional liability of 24.6m or 20.3p per share 2003: 18.3m or 15.1p per share.
An adjustment to restate the companys investment in Northern Racing PLC to market value, would provide a notional uplift after tax of 6.2m or 5.2p per share 2003: 7.6m or 6.3p per share.
