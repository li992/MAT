finance review Andrew Jenner Finance Director 2004 was another strong year for Serco.
We delivered good growth in underlying turnover, and profit was also well ahead of 2003.
The increase in free cash ow was particularly pleasing, building on the improvement in the previous year, and reects our continued focus on this important measure.

Financial performance Analysis of the Groups financial performance in 2004 is shown in Figure 1.
1.1 Turnover Total turnover for the year to 31 December 2004 increased by 5.2% to 1,636.8m.
After adjusting for the effect of disposals and contracts exited see 6.1 Disposals, turnover grew by 14.0%.
Turnover for 2004 includes an incremental contribution of 35m from Premier Custodial Group PCG following the acquisition of the remaining 50% in July 2003.
From this date the results of PCG have been included in Group turnover.
Gross margin on Group turnover, representing the average contract margin across the portfolio, has increased to 13.8% 2003 13.7%.
1.2 Exceptional items There were no exceptional items in 2004.
During 2003 there were three exceptional items resulting in a net profit of 3.6m.
1.3 Profit before tax Profit before tax and intangible amortisation increased by 10.3% to 73.9m, representing a net margin on turnover of 4.5% 2003 4.3%.
Profit before tax, intangible amortisation and the contribution from exceptional items in 2003 grew by 16.4%.
Profit before tax and after intangible amortisation increased by 8.6% to 57.4m.
1.4 Intangible amortisation Intangible amortisation, arising primarily from goodwill, was 16.5m in 2004 2003 14.1m.
The increase results largely from the acquisitions of the remaining 50% of PCG in July 2003 and the Ontario Driver Examination Services DES franchise which commenced operation in September 2003.
The small decrease in the rate is primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of profits.
1.6 Earnings per share As a result of the above, earnings per share before intangible amortisation increased by 10.6% to 12.20p.
Earnings per share after intangible amortisation grew by 8.1% to 8.37p.
Dividends The proposed final dividend of 1.82 p per share gives a total dividend for 2004 of 2.63p, a 12.4% increase on 2003.
Further analysis is shown in Figure 2.

Cash flow continued 3.1 Operating cash flow There was an operating cash inflow for the year of 68.0m 2003 46.4m, an increase of 47%.
This represents a conversion of 196% 2003 196% of operating profit and 95% 2003 81% of Group EBITDA into cash.
The improvement in conversion rates is particularly notable given that our strong level of organic growth brings an accompanying demand for working capital, typically equivalent to a months incremental turnover each year.
3.2 Dividends from joint ventures Dividends received from joint ventures during 2004 of 14.2m 2003 12.6m represent an 85% 2003 78% conversion of profit after tax of joint ventures into cash.
3.3 Interest and taxation The 2004 outflow of 5.2m 2003 7.8m benefited from the Group being able to utilise tax losses of subsidiaries that were previously joint venture companies.
3.4 Capital expenditure Capital expenditure for the year, excluding investment in PFI Special Purpose Companies SPCs, was 19.3m 2003 21.8m.
This expenditure represented 1.4% of Group turnover, and is broadly similar to prior years.
3.5 Acquisitions disposals The 2004 net outflow of 9.0m primarily relates to the acquisition of shares in ITNET plc prior to 31 December 2004 for 13.7m and the disposal of businesses in Australia and New Zealand for 3.2m.
Further details are in section 6.
3.6 Non-recourse debt financed assets The 25.2m outflow relates to the net movement on expenditure on PFI assets under construction, non-recourse loans and other PFI balance movements.
Further analysis is provided in Figure 3.
The movements on the PFI balances are the result of timing differences between loan repayment draw-down and asset spend recovery.
Over the lifetime of each PFI contract, we expect these movements to offset each other.
Included within the change in PFI balances is 8.7m of equity and subordinated debt invested into the Traffic Information Services TIS PFI SPC in January 2004.
Net debt At 31 December 2004 net recourse debt was 14.8m 2003 22.3m.
Further analysis is provided in Figure 4.
PFIs represents long term loans secured on the contracts of PFI and other concessions, and not any other assets of the Group.
The loans are excluded from all of our credit agreement and other covenants calculations, therefore having no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Non-recourse debt, utilised to fund PFI assets and the acquisition of the DES franchise, reduced during the year to 256.4m 2003 357.0m, largely due to Laser see 7.
PFIs and the scheduled part repayment of other debt.

Net debt continued In addition to Figure 4, non-recourse debt of 51.4m 2003 55.2m is included in joint venture gross liabilities.
Pensions For 2004 we have continued to apply the transitional rules and disclosures for the implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
This requires the market values of the assets and liabilities for defined benefit schemes to be calculated and disclosed in a note, discussed in more detail in Note 32 to the Annual Review and Accounts.
In summary, at 31 December 2004, there was a net deficit on an FRS 17 basis in relation to the defined benefit scheme of 75.6m 2003 69.7m, and an asset base of 380.8m 2003 350.4m.
Long term employer and employee contributions were increased in 2003 and have remained at the same level to address the level of deficit in the scheme.
Acquisitions disposals 6.1 Disposals In line with our intention to focus the business on areas with the greatest potential for growth and profitability we announced in April 2004 the disposal of a number of small and medium sized contracts in Australia and New Zealand.
The annual turnover of these contracts was approximately 38m.
The disposals were completed by August 2004.
The above disposals, together with 2003s disposal of a number of our Swedish contracts and the exiting of our rail maintenance contract with Network Rail in January 2004, have reduced annualised turnover by 140m.
6.2 Acquisitions Also during December 2004, we invested 13.7m in the shares of ITNET plc, a company in which we acquired a controlling interest during February 2005.
PFIs At the end of 2004 the Group was involved in 11 PFI projects, with 10 equity investments and 11 operating contracts.
These contracts contribute 3.2bn to the Groups order book of 12.7bn.
During 2004 PFIs contributed 194m 2003 133.4m to turnover and 14.6m 2003 11.9m to gross profit.
At the end of 2004 we had invested 23.9m of equity and subordinated debt into our SPCs.
Cumulatively, as at 31 December 2004, we had generated 26.9m of cash from these investments, representing a net inflow to the Group of 3.0m.
During October 2004, we stopped accounting for Laser the National Physical Laboratory PFI SPC as a subsidiary due to the discussions surrounding the transfer of control of the PFI asset to the DTI.
This has removed the non-recourse debt and corresponding PFI debtor from the balance sheet.
Serco Group plc finance review 8.
Treasury 8.1 Treasury management The Groups treasury function is responsible for managing the Groups exposure to treasury risk, and operates within a defined set of policies and procedures reviewed and approved by the Board.
8.2 Credit facilities and liquidity management The Groups liquidity during 2004 was principally provided by a 140m revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at year-end, and two private debt placements.
The 140m facility was replaced in January 2005 by a five-year 450m term loan and revolving credit facility.
The 450m facility is to fund the acquisitions of ITNET plc and RCI Holding Corporation and is also available to fund the Groups day-to-day liquidity requirements.
The 450m facility is unsecured, with covenants and obligations typical of these types of arrangement, which are consistent with our previous facilities.
The Group continues to service two private placements which include sterling and US dollar tranches.
The first, for 43.2m, was taken out in 1997 and matures in 2007.
The second, for 117m, was taken out in 2003 and amortises from 2011 to 2015.
8.3 Foreign exchange risk The Group does not currently hedge the sterling equivalent of the net assets of its overseas operations as the net asset value of these businesses does not represent a significant proportion of the market value of the Group.
Foreign exchange gains and losses therefore do not represent a material risk to the consolidated net asset value of the Group.
The foreign exchange exposure on the US dollar tranches of the private placements has been fully hedged into sterling in accordance with the risk profile set out above.
The nature of the Groups business in general does not involve a significant amount of cross-border trade.
Consequently the Group is not exposed to substantial foreign currency transaction risk as sales and costs are approximately matched within overseas operations.
Material transactional exposures of individual business units are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.
Central funding of individual business units gives rise to monetary assets and liabilities centrally and in the business units.
Where the asset or liability is denominated in a currency that is not the operating currency of the business unit involved, and a foreign exchange risk would otherwise result, the foreign currency exposure arising is hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.
8.4 Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowing and deposits is selectively managed, using interest rate swaps.
8.5 Credit risk The Group monitors the credit quality of counterparties and limits credit exposures accordingly.
Serco Group plc finance review 52 53 9. International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS Serco Group plc will adopt IFRS for accounting periods beginning on 1 January 2005.
The Groups interim financial statements for the six months ending 30 June 2005 will be the first under IFRS.
The Group is well positioned to ensure compliance within the required timescale.
Reporting systems and procedures have been enhanced to support the new reporting requirements and the Groups IFRS accounting policies are being developed.
In addition, IFRS training programmes have been provided to ensure that IFRS knowledge is embedded throughout the organisation.
A number of areas of difference between IFRS and UK GAAP, which may impact the Groups reported results and financial position, have been identified.
These include goodwill and intangible assets, financial instruments, share based payment, employee benefits including pensions, joint ventures and taxation.
Areas that may require additional disclosure include segment reporting, service concessions and joint ventures.
The key points arising from the adoption of IFRS are: The Groups underlying performance, cash flow and ability to pay dividends will be unaffected The impact on year-on-year earnings growth after transition is likely to be minimal The fair value concept may introduce volatility into the balance sheet, largely due to the inclusion of financial instruments and actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes On transition, the Groups profit before tax will be principally affected by nonamortisation of goodwill, partially offset by a charge for share based payment On transition, net assets will reduce principally through recognition of actuarial losses on defined benefit pension schemes.
The Groups analysis of the effect of IFRS is ongoing.
In addition, the interpretation of standards is evolving so further changes may arise, notably in accounting for pension schemes and service concessions, including PFIs.
Post balance sheet events During December 2004, Serco made a recommended offer to acquire all of the issued and to be issued share capital of ITNET plc, a UK listed company.
The acquisition of ITNET was declared unconditional in all respects on 3 February 2005.
On 17 February 2005, Serco announced that it had acquired, or contracted to acquire, more than nine tenths in value of ITNETs shares and that Serco intended to compulsorily acquire the outstanding ITNET shares.
Also during December 2004, Serco made an offer to purchase RCI Holding Corporation, an American private company.
The process of obtaining US government approvals is continuing, and we expect to reach completion during March 2005.
