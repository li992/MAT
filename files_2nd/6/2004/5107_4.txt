Annual report and accounts 2004 17 Operational and financial review continued Financial year 2004 compared with financial year 2003 Revenue easyJets revenue increased 17.1% from 931.8 million to 1,091.0 million, from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
Passenger revenue, the largest component, increased by 17.0% from 880.0 million to 1,029.3 million, driven by a 19.7% growth in passenger numbers from 20.3 million to 24.3 million, partly offset by a 2.3% decline in average fares.
The number of passengers carried reflected an increase in the size of the easyJet fleet in operation from an average of 66.0 aircraft to an average of 79.9 aircraft and a small increase in the average load factor achieved from 84.1% to 84.5%.
Revenue from non-ticket sources, within ongoing operations, includes in-flight sales of food and beverages, excess baggage charges, change fees, credit card booking fees and commissions received from products and services sold such as hotel and car hire bookings and travel insurance.
In financial year 2004, 61.7 million was earned from non-ticket sources, up 19.1% from the prior year.
Ground handling charges, including salaries easyJets ground handling charges increased by 16.9% from 95.2 million to 111.3 million, from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
The increase in third-party ground handling charges reflects the 18.4% increase in the number of sectors flown, and the reduction in unit costs at London Luton airport due to increased throughput and the migration of the operations into a joint venture.
Airport charges easyJets external airport charges increased by 28.2% from 149.3 million to 191.4 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
This increase was attributable to the increase of 18.4% in the number of sectors flown, and the higher rates charged at certain primary airports where much of easyJets organic growth was centred in 2004.
Fuel easyJets fuel costs increased by 21.8% from 120.6 million to 146.9 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
The increase was higher than the 19.5% increase in number of block hours flown.
This is primarily due to approximately a 14.7% increase in easyJets average unit US dollar fuel cost, compared with the previous year, resulting in additional costs to easyJet of approximately 21.3 million.
The strengthening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which fuel prices are denominated, over the course of financial year 2004 provided a set off benefit of approximately 17.0 million.
In addition, a 1.7% increase in sector length, the introduction of new aircraft, and increased optimisation of route planning aided the efficiency of easyJets fuel consumption.
Benefits obtained from Group hedging activities were approximately 11.0 million.
Navigation charges easyJets navigation charges increased by 21.8% from 72.0 million to 87.7 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
This increase was principally attributable to a 21% increase in the ASKs flown in financial year 2004.
Crew costs, including training easyJets crew costs increased by 31.0% from 96.8 million to 126.8 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
The increase in crew costs resulted from an increase in headcount during the financial year 2004 to service the additional sectors and aircraft operated by easyJet during the year, the increase in salaries, and the costs of recruitment and crew in training necessary for aircraft not yet delivered.
It also resulted from the need to hire additional crew during the migration of certain operations from Boeing to Airbus aircraft.
These costs amounted to some 6.4 million in the financial year 2004.
Maintenance Maintenance expenses increased by 14.5% from 89.1 million to 102.0 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004. easyJets maintenance expenses consist primarily of the cost of routine maintenance and spare parts and provisions for the estimated future cost of heavy maintenance and engine overhauls on aircraft operated by easyJet pursuant to dry operating leases.
The extent of the required annual maintenance reserve charges is determined by reference to the number of flight hours and cycles permitted between each engine shop visit and heavy maintenance overhaul on aircraft airframes.
The increase in maintenance costs was largely due to the addition of further leased aircraft to the fleet during the year.
18 Annual report and accounts 2004 Aircraft financed by operating lease incur reserves for maintenance, while the corresponding maintenance effect for owned aircraft is dealt with through a depreciation charge of the capitalised maintenance costs under aircraft ownership.
Advertising Advertising costs increased by 10.1% from 27.7 million to 30.5 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
Spend per passenger was approximately 8% lower than the previous year which is principally due to market maturation and the synergistic benefits of the integration of the businesses of Go Fly and easyJet.
In 2004, a number of new markets were entered into, such as Berlin and Dortmund, which resulted in additional advertising expenditure to create brand awareness.
Merchant fees and incentive pay Merchant fees and incentive pay reduced by 0.7% from 13.7 million to 13.6 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
Merchant fees and incentive pay includes the costs of processing fees paid to credit card companies on all of easyJets credit and debit card sales and the per-seat sold transferred commission paid as incentive pay to easyJets telesales staff.
In financial year 2004, approximately 75% of bookings were made using credit cards, the same as in financial year 2003.
Incentive pay paid to telesales personnel remained flat year-on-year due to the rise in initial sales made over the internet, from 93.8% of initial seats sold during financial year 2003 to 95.7% of initial seats sold during financial year 2004, and the increase in on line change transactions from 6% in financial year 2003 to 73% in financial year 2004.
Cost of integrating businesses of easyJet and Go Fly Costs of integrating the businesses of Go Fly and easyJet were nil in financial year 2004 2003: 7.9 million.
Integration, which was substantially complete at 30 September 2003, was considered to have been finalised by the Board in March 2004.
Aircraft insurance costs Aircraft insurance costs reduced from 21.2 million in financial year 2003 to 19.8 million in financial year 2004.
The increase is significantly less than the growth in capacity.
This was as a result of lower rates being negotiated, and also due to the exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar.
Other costs Other costs increased by 24.9% from 57.2 million to 71.7 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
Items in this cost category include administrative and operational costs not included elsewhere including some salary expenses.
Also this cost category includes short-term aircraft wet leases, compensation paid to passengers, certain other items, such as currency exchange gains and losses and the profit or loss on the disposal of fixed assets.
The major influence of this category of costs was the growth in the scope of the operation.
Depreciation Depreciation charges decreased by 3.5% from 19.9 million to 19.2 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
The depreciation charge reflects depreciation on owned aircraft and capitalised aircraft maintenance charges, and also includes depreciation on computer systems and other assets.
easyJet has owned an average of 8.0 B737-300 aircraft and 4.9 A319 aircraft during the financial year 2004 2003: 10.0 B737-300 aircraft and 0.02 A319 aircraft.
The decrease in depreciation reflects the additional number of owned aircraft set off against the 9.1% improvement in the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which the majority of easyJets assets are denominated, and the additional depreciation of other assets such as spares and leasehold improvements.
Accelerated depreciation of 737-300 aircraft In 2003, management provided 10.2 million additional depreciation in respect of the four oldest owned Boeing 737-300 aircraft, due to the distressed nature of the second-hand aircraft market.
In 2004, a further 3.4 million was charged in respect of accelerated deprecation, to align the aircraft carrying value with the residual value.
The residual values of six owned Boeing 737-300 aircraft held in easyJet Hamburg Limited and easyJet Aircraft Limited have also been reassessed.
This has led to an additional 2.7 million of accelerated depreciation being recognised on these aircraft during the financial year.
Annual report and accounts 2004 19 Operational and financial review continued Goodwill amortisation Goodwill amortisation charges reduced slightly from 17.6 million to 17.1 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
The decrease reflects the reduction in the goodwill balance as the result of the return of certain retention monies during the financial year in relation to the purchase of Go Fly in 2002.
Aircraft dry lease costs easyJets aircraft dry lease costs comprise the lease payments paid by easyJet in respect of those aircraft in its fleet operated pursuant to dry operating leases.
Aircraft dry lease costs increased by 16.6% from 82.7 million to 96.4 million from financial year 2003 to financial year 2004.
During the period six new Boeing 737-700 aircraft, and 15 new Airbus A319 aircraft were added to the fleet.
Over the period, easyJet has benefited from the strengthening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which lease costs are denominated, low dollar interest rates, and the benefit of the lower cost of the new Airbus A319 aircraft.
As a consequence, easyJet has seen its average leasing cost per aircraft fall by around 9%, year-on-year.
Aircraft long-term wet lease costs easyJets aircraft wet lease costs comprise the lease payments paid by easyJet in respect of those aircraft in its fleet operated pursuant to ACMI leases that is, leases of an aircraft plus crew, maintenance and insurance of a duration of more than one month.
The 2.1 million charge in financial year 2003 relates to the costs incurred leasing two aircraft for 2.5 months under wet leases for part of the summer 2003 season.
One aircraft was procured in order to be able to commence new routes from Paris Orly earlier than would otherwise have been possible.
The other aircraft was procured to cover for the long-term unavailability of an aircraft which was subject to hail damage.
Share of operating profit of The Big Orange Handling Company In January 2004, easyJet announced that it had sold 74% of its ground handling operations at London Luton Airport to Menzies Aviation Limited.
The joint venture company to manage this is called The Big Orange Handling Company Limited.
During the financial year 2004, the share 26% of the turnover attributable to easyJet was 1.4 million, and the share of operating profit was 0.2 million.
Net interest Net interest reflects interest paid or payable by easyJet net of interest received or receivable by easyJet.
easyJets net interest receivable decreased from 12.2 million in financial year 2003 to 11.5 million in financial year 2004.
This reflects the increase in loans due to the financing of new Airbus aircraft from 72.8 million to 119.8 million, set off against the increase in the cash balance during the year from 335.4 million to 510.3 million and also increasing interest rates, particularly in the UK, since easyJets cash surplus is predominantly held in sterling.
Committed contribution to result of Deutsche BA In August 2002, easyJet and British Airways entered into an option agreement under which the Group was granted an option to acquire 100% of the share capital of British Airways wholly owned subsidiary Deutsche BA Holding GmbH Deutsche BA.
The Group was obliged to make monthly capital contributions to British Airways whilst the option remained unexercised.
Although the decision to terminate the option was made in March 2003, a total of u3.0 million 1.9 million was paid.
After a release of accruals made in 2002 not required, Deutsche BA related costs were 1.3 million in 2003.
No costs were incurred in financial year 2004.
Amounts written off investments In the financial year 2003, easyJet wrote off its investment in Deutsche BA after deciding not to exercise its option to purchase.
The total amount written off of 7.8 million included 3.1 million for the cost of the option, plus 4.7 million of related professional costs.
Taxation In financial year 2004, easyJet incurred a tax charge of 21.1 million, an effective tax rate of 34% 2003: 19.1 million charge, being 37% effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate is higher than the UK standard rate of tax which is principally due to purchased goodwill not being tax deductible.
A more detailed explanation may be found in note 7 to the accounts.
20 Annual report and accounts 2004 Retained profit for the year For the reasons described above, easyJets retained profit after interest and taxes increased by 26.9% from 32.4 million in financial year 2003 to 41.1 million in financial year 2004.
Earnings per share The basic earnings per share increased by 25.5% from 8.24 pence in the financial year 2003 to 10.34 pence in the financial year 2004.
The basic earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation, increased by 15.1% from 12.72 pence in the financial year 2003 to 14.64 pence in the financial year 2004.
The basic earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation, accelerated depreciation of certain owned aircraft, committed contribution to Deutsche BA, amounts written off investments, and costs of integrating the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly, reduced by 12.8% from 18.01 pence in the financial year 2003 to 15.71 pence in the financial year 2004.
Other matters Critical accounting policies easyJets consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the stated accounting policies requires easyJets management to make estimates and assumptions that will affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
easyJets estimates and assumptions are based on managements historical experiences, changes in the business environment and advice from specialists.
However, actual results may differ from these estimates if actual conditions are different.
The differences may be material.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those which are material to easyJets financial statements, but yet require a significant amount of judgment from management.
The policies used in determining the carrying value of aircraft, aircraft maintenance liabilities, and corporation tax are deemed to be the most critical accounting policies.
Carrying value of aircraft easyJet typically holds its owned aircraft for a period of seven years, and depreciates aircraft to an estimated residual value over this period.
As aircraft have a useful life beyond 20 years, there is usually a substantial residual value at seven years.
The residual value relates to the expected net sale proceeds which easyJet estimates it could obtain when it sells the aircraft.
In estimating the residual values, easyJet management will consult a range of external valuers, and take into account its own knowledge and experience.
Nevertheless, there can be significant variations between expected and actual residual values, as a result of factors such as the general strength of the global aviation market, the supply of aircraft suitable for low cost airlines, the supply of the specific aircraft type being sold, and the supply of aircraft generally.
Variations may result in changes to the depreciation estimate or impairment charges and as this is a significant component of the cost base of the Group, this may cause significant variations in the profitability of the Group.
Aircraft maintenance costs easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of its leased aircraft during the course of the lease term.
These are as a result of legal and constructive obligations in the lease contract in respect of the return conditions applied by lessors, which require aircraft airframes, engines, landing gear and auxiliary power units to reach at least a specified condition on their return at the end of the lease term.
In most instances, to reach the specified conditions, easyJet will need to carry out a heavy duty maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe once during the lease term, usually towards the end of the lease.
Other work may be required on landing gear and auxiliary power units.
The cost of heavy duty maintenance checks for airframe and engines are substantial airframe checks may cost between $1.0 million and $2.2 million, and engine shop visits may cost between $1.0 million and $2.4 million.
In accordance with FRS12, as there is a legal and constructive obligation to return the aircraft in a specified condition, a charge is made in the profit and loss account each month based on the number of flight hours or cycles used to allow the creation of a provision which is designed to cover the cost of heavy duty maintenance checks when they occur.
The cost of each heavy duty maintenance check is subject to uncertainty.
Annual report and accounts 2004 21 Operational and financial review continued Management is required to make numerous estimates in calculating the provision required.
These include the expected date of the check since costs generally rise over time, market conditions for heavy duty maintenance checks pertaining at the expected date of check, the condition of asset at the time of the check this is particularly true of engines, whose true condition can only be established once it is off wing, the likely utilisation of the asset in terms of either flying hours or cycles, and the regulations in relation to extensions to lives of life limited parts, which form a significant proportion of the cost of heavy duty maintenance costs of engines.
In arriving at these estimates, management uses its historic experience, its assessment of future operational performance and market conditions, and also examines advice from industry specialists.
The Group is also required to pay maintenance reserves to certain lessors on a monthly basis, based on usage, to provide a security deposit for the lessor should the aircraft be returned without meeting its return conditions.
These maintenance reserves are then returned to the Group on production of evidence that qualifying maintenance expenditure has been incurred.
Maintenance reserves paid are deducted from the provision made.
In some instances, not all of the maintenance reserves paid can be recovered by the Group and therefore are retained by the lessor at the end of the lease term.
If management considers this is likely to occur, then an additional provision is made again either on a flying hours or cycles basis to cover the expected liability.
Assumptions made in respect of the basis of the provisions are reviewed for all aircraft once a year.
In addition, when further information becomes available which could materially change an estimate made, such as a heavy duty maintenance check taking place, utilisation assumptions changing, or return conditions being renegotiated, then specific estimates are reviewed immediately, and the provision is reset accordingly.
Corporation tax In the ordinary course of easyJets business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain at the time the accounts are prepared.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our corporation tax liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
This process involves estimating our current tax exposures on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.
Included in the estimation process is making judgements as to the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Tax exposures can involve complex issues and can take an extended period to resolve.
The effective tax rate of the Group is derived from the effective tax rate of the weighted earnings in each jurisdiction that we operate.
Changes in the geographic mix of earnings can affect the Group effective tax rate.
Liquidity and investments The Group holds significant cash or liquid funds as a form of insurance to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events.
The cash and liquid investment balances at 30 September 2004 totalled 510 million 2003: 335 million.
The robust increase in cash and liquid investment balances from prior year represents continued cash inflows generated from the operation of the business together with cash inflows generated from aircraft financing activities.
Group cash resources are used to fund payments made to Airbus in advance of taking delivery of aircraft, and drawdown of the full committed aircraft financing is made only when the aircraft is delivered.
As a result aircraft deliveries are cash generative for the Group.
The Group has committed financing in place for 82 of the 120 Airbus aircraft on order, stretching through September 2007.
Surplus funds are invested, in line with Board-approved policy, in high quality short-term liquid instruments, usually money market funds or bank deposits.
Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any one individual counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
Such counterparty exposures are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
Accordingly, the possibility of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by counterparties is considered to be unlikely.
22 Annual report and accounts 2004 Management of financial and fuel price risks The Board of Directors is responsible for setting treasury policy and objectives, and approves the parameters within which the various aspects of treasury risk management are operated.
Approved treasury policy outlines the Groups approach to corporate and asset financing, interest rate risk, fuel price risk, foreign exchange risk and cash and liquidity management.
The policy also lists the financial instruments and time periods which the Groups treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks.
The policy is under on-going review to ensure best practice in the light of developments in the trading and financial markets.
A special financing sub-committee of the Board is responsible for approving policy amendments.
Group treasury implements the agreed policies on a day-to-day basis to meet the treasury objectives.
These objectives include ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its day-to-day needs and to fund its capital commitments: deploying any surplus liquidity in a prudent and profitable manner: managing currency, fuel, interest rate and credit exposures: and managing the Groups worldwide relationship with banks and financial institutions.
Financing and interest rate risk All of the Groups debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders and other financiers.
These factors are also reflected in the medium term profile of the Groups loans and operating leases.
The incidence of repayments is shown in note 23.
The Group demonstrated its continued ability to raise new committed financing by financing 82 of the 120 Airbus aircraft to be delivered through September 2007.
Group interest rate management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of its financing: all Group loans are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months while a minimum of 40% of operating leases are fixed at time of aircraft delivery.
At 30 September 2004 the Group had a net cash balance, however 100% of the Groups gross loan borrowings were at floating rates of interest: this proportion is unchanged from prior year.
Of the operating leases in place at 30 September 2004 approximately 58% were based on fixed interest rates and 42% were based on floating interest rates.
The Groups loan borrowings and operating leases are denominated in US dollars.
The Groups aircraft are priced in and transacted in US dollars and therefore all financing transactions to 30 September 2004 have been transacted in US dollars.
Fuel price risk The Group fuel risk management policy aims to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel price while ensuring that the Group may also benefit from price reductions.
In order to provide protection the Group uses a limited range of hedging instruments traded on the Over The Counter markets principally zero-cost collars, with approved counterparties and within approved limits.
Group policy at 30 September 2004 is to hedge a maximum of 80% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in advance, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated expense up to 36 months in advance.
Further details can be found in note 23 below.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives with off-balance sheet risk selectively for currency and fuel risk management purposes.
The Groups policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use these instruments to hedge anticipated exposures.
Forward foreign exchange and fuel contracts and zero-cost collars are used to cover currency and jet fuel exposures.
All contracts outstanding at 30 September 2004 are summarised at note 23.
The Group does not permit selling of currency and jet fuel options, except as part of a fully matched options collar hedging structure.
Annual report and accounts 2004 23 Operational and financial review continued International Financial Reporting Standards European legislation, introduced in June 2002, requires that easyJet adopts International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS from 1 October 2005.
This means that both its interim financial statements at 31 March 2006 and its Group report and accounts at 30 September 2006 will be prepared under IFRS, rather than UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
These financial statements will also include comparatives for the prior year.
The change from UK GAAP to IFRS will require substantial change to both easyJets published financial statements and its underlying financial reporting processes and procedures.
A comprehensive programme has been formulated by easyJet to facilitate a timely transition.
A project team was created in November 2003, with a full time dedicated project manager.
Representatives from all relevant areas of the business have been formed into a team to oversee the transition.
A series of workstreams has been initiated which cover the areas of financial accounting, management accounting, taxation, treasury, contracts, business planning, IT systems, training, human resources and investor relations.
The project team has its own budget and is adequately resourced to meet its objectives.
Regular meetings are held between key personnel.
Throughout the transition, regular consultation has occurred with KPMG Audit Plc, the Groups auditor.
Regular updates have also been given to the Audit Committee.
The project has been subdivided into three main time periods: l Phase one November 2003 to 30 September 2004 Planning phase.
Diagnostic assessment of the impact of IFRS, with planning and preparation for production of the IFRS opening balance sheet, and resolution of most of the key technical issues.
l Phase two 1 October 2004 to 30 September 2005 Transition phase.
Dual reporting in both IFRS and UK GAAP: finalisation of technical issues.
l Phase three post 1 October 2005 Completion phase.
Full IFRS accounting and monthly reporting, to produce first interim and full year IFRS financial statements.
Significant progress has been made to date, with the following key milestones from phase one of the project having already been met: l Assessments have been made of the effect of each IFRS on easyJet.
Detailed technical accounting papers have been written for each standard, summarising the effect of the new IFRS compared to UK GAAP, and easyJets proposed accounting treatment.
Systems, resource and logistical issues associated with the implementation of the IFRS have also been considered: l Formulation of the first draft of the new IFRS accounting policies and procedures manual, a summary of which has been presented to the Audit Committee: l Amendment of internal systems to allow for collection of data suitable for use in preparing IFRS financial statements from the transition date of 1 October 2004: l Dry runs of monthly reporting systems to ensure that an IFRS compliant balance sheet could be produced at 1 October 2004: l Communicating the effect of IFRS to relevant finance department personnel.
All qualified and part qualified accounting staff have undergone both general IFRS technical training, and training that is specific to their own area of expertise: l A detailed review has been carried out of easyJets material contractual arrangements to search for hybrid financial instruments.
Phase one of the project ended on 30 September 2004.
There are no material incomplete issues.
A detailed project plan for phase two of the project has been prepared and is operational.
Based upon standards issued to date, easyJet has identified a number of significant divergences between IFRS and UK GAAP, which are set out below.
In phase two of the project, as expected, the project team is still evaluating certain issues, so it is possible that further significant divergences may become apparent.
In addition, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB has a number of ongoing projects which could affect the divergences set out below between IFRS and UK GAAP.
The full population of divergences will only be known after 1 October 2005, the date that easyJet is to adopt IFRS.
24 Annual report and accounts 2004 Key divergences IAS 32 and 39 Financial instruments IAS 32 and 39 specify accounting treatments for financial instruments which are radically different from UK GAAP.
The current rules for the introduction of IFRS allow for IAS 32 and 39 to be adopted only on 1 October 2005 rather than 1 October 2004, for all other IFRS.
easyJet has no plans to adopt IAS 32 and 39 early.
However, the project team is continuing with its work on the assumption that easyJet will need to be ready to adopt these standards from 1 October 2005.
Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account when realised as an offset to the related income or expense.
Under IAS 39, financial instruments will be valued on the balance sheet at fair value.
Such hedges will be subject to strict tests in terms of both their effectiveness and documentation.
If these tests are not satisfied, then movements in the fair value of financial instruments will be taken to the profit and loss account.
Included within financial instruments under IAS 39 is also the requirement that certain purchase options should be valued on the balance sheet.
At present the Company has options to purchase aircraft in the future at a price that has already been determined.
To the extent that these options remain at the date at which the Group implements IAS 39 they will be valued and included within the Group balance sheet under IFRS.
IFRS 3 Business combinations Purchased goodwill is being held in the UK GAAP consolidated balance sheet of easyJet in respect of the acquisitions of both Go Fly and easyJet Switzerland.
The goodwill is being amortised over a period of 20 years.
Under IFRS 3, regular amortisation of goodwill is prohibited.
Instead, an annual impairment test is required to support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any impairment charge will be reflected in the profit and loss account.
The format of the impairment test is different from that used under UK GAAP.
IFRS 2 Share based payments Under UK GAAP, no charge is reflected in the profit and loss account for easyJets share options.
However, easyjet has been disclosing by way of a note to the financial statements the value of all options issued since the inception of the Group, under the terms of FRED 31, a proposed UK accounting standard.
FRED 31 has been superceded by UK accounting standard FRS 20, Share-Based Payment, which is effective for schemes issued after 7 November 2002 which have not vested prior to 1 January 2005.
This years footnote disclosure meets FRS 20 requirements.
The requirements of IFRS 2 are identical to those of FRS 20, except that the charge will be recognised in the profit and loss account rather than by way of a footnote.
IAS 12 Income taxes Under UK GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on a timing difference basis, with the calculation having a predominantly profit and loss account focus.
Under IAS 12, deferred tax will be calculated on a temporary difference basis with a more balance sheet focus, with provision for many more timing differences.
In particular, there are differences in the provision requirements for revaluations of non-monetary items, sale of assets where rollover relief may be available and unremitted earnings from subsidiaries and associates.
At the date of this report, easyJet has reviewed the guidance issued thus far from the Inland Revenue including that in the Finance Act 2004 as to the basis on which they will tax companies using IFRS.
easyJet is working closely with its advisors to ensure that the taxation impact of this new regime is fully understood and managed.
Other information Given the date of easyJets year end September, which makes it a relatively late adopter of IFRS, the project team will be analysing in detail actual published financial statements to determine the extent to which a best practice emerges.
The project team will then make recommendations to amend proposed accounting treatments and disclosures, should it consider this to be necessary.

Earned seats also include seats provided for promotional purposes and to easyJet staff for business travel.
11 Represents the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for passengers.
No weighting of the load factor is carried out to recognise the effect of varying flight or stage lengths.
12 Represents the sum by route of passengers multiplied by the number of kilometres those passengers were flown.
13 Represents the number of seats initially sold over the internet divided by the total number of seats initially sold, during the relevant financial year.
Sales that are originally made via the internet, but are later amended by phone, are included.
14 Represents the number of seats initially sold over the internet divided by the total number of seats initially sold, during the final month of the relevant financial year.
15 Represents the passenger revenue divided by the number of passengers carried.
16 Represents the total revenue divided by the total number of ASKs.
