The likely impact of IFRS on the financial results of Great Portland Estates is significant.
The primary areas of difference from current UK reporting will be the recording of revaluation surpluses or deficits within the income statement, and the recognition on the balance sheet of contingent tax on chargeable gains or an international approximation thereof and the marking to market of some, but not all, financial instruments.
There remain areas of uncertainty, such as the tax treatment of IFRS by the Inland Revenue, the principle of distributable reserves and the layout of the income statement the term profit and loss account will probably be superseded.
Preparatory work to accommodate the change to IFRS will continue over the coming year and we shall monitor developments closely.
