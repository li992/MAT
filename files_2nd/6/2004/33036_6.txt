26 Operating and financial review BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Financial review The review is divided into the following Introduction The 2004 financial year was marked by the continuing sections: transformation of our business operations and 26 Introduction markets, where the pace of change is accelerating.
We 28 Group results are driving the change by providing our customers with 30 Line of business results new technology and services with greater capabilities and lower cost.
The focus on delivering the strategy 30 BT Retail continued and the groups performance benefited from 32 BT Wholesale the growth in new wave activities such as Information 34 BT Global Services and Communications Technology ICT solutions, 34 Other operating income broadband, mobility and managed services and 34 Operating costs continued cost efficiency programmes.
The 2003 financial year was characterised by a 36 Group operating profit loss focus on implementing and delivering the strategy 36 Associates and joint ventures announced in April 2002 and further corporate 37 Total operating profit loss transactions in the continued restructuring of the 37 profit on sale of group undertakings and group and reduction of net debt.
The corporate xed asset investments transactions included the unwind of the Concert joint 38 profit on sale of property xed assets venture on 1 April 2002 and the disposal of our interest in Cegetel for 2.6 billion.
39 Interest charge The 2002 financial year was dominated by a series 39 profit loss before taxation of corporate transactions designed to focus and 39 Taxation transform the group and reduce its net debt position.
40 Earnings loss per share Those corporate transactions included raising 40 Dividends 5.9 billion through the rights issue in June 2001, selling our Japanese telecom and Spanish mobile investments 40 Financing for 4.8 billion, selling the Yell directories business for 42 Treasury policy approximately 2 billion, the demerger of mmO and 2 42 Off-balance sheet arrangements the sale and leaseback of properties for 2.4 billion.
42 Capital resources As a result of the major restructuring of the group 42 Foreign currency and interest rate exposure and the significant level of corporate transactions completed during the period under review, we believe 43 Capital expenditure it is difficult for investors to meaningfully compare the 43 Acquisitions financial performance of the group between the 43 Demerger and capital reduction financial years under review.
In this Financial review 43 Balance sheet the commentary is therefore focused principally on the trading results of the continuing activities of BT Group 43 Return on capital employed before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
In 44 Pensions comparing the continuing activities of the group, the 44 Geographical information results of our discontinued activities, namely our 44 Economic and Monetary Union Japanese telecom and Spanish mobile investments, 45 Regulatory financial information Yell and mmO are excluded.

This is also consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management Please see cautionary statement regarding and we believe allows a meaningful comparison to be forward-looking statements on page 141. made of the trading results of the group during the period under review.
The goodwill amortisation and exceptional items are therefore analysed and discussed separately from the line of business results in this Financial review because they are considered to be a reection of the corporate activity rather than the trading activity of the lines of business.
The following table shows the summarised profit and loss account which includes a reconciliation of the key performance measures before and after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and is discussed further in this Financial review.
The operating results by line of business are discussed in addition to the overall group results as we believe the activities and markets they serve are distinct and this analysis provides a greater degree of insight to investors.
