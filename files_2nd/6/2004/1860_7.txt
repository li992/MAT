18 BBA GROUP CHIEF ANNUAL REPORT 2004 EXECUTIVES REVIEW Technology sales.
With the growth of Europe and Asia-Pacific, we have a good balance geographically, with 48 per cent sales in North America, 44 per cent Europe and 8 per cent Asia-Pacific Rest of World.
Looking at 2005, we expect another year of strong demand, the full year benefit of the Tenotex acquisition and again, good cash flows.
The outlook for raw material prices remains uncertain: we will require a general reduction in worldwide commodity prices to provide a benefit to our Materials Technology earnings.
Until that happens, we will continue to implement price increases across our product range, and work to drive through further productivity and process development programmes.
Strategy Our strategy continues to be focused on growth primarily in the Aviation Services market.
We have shown over recent years that there are plenty of opportunities to increase revenues our underlying markets have long term growth prospects and there are assets available to acquire to supplement this market growth.
As we saw in 2004, we can grow through increasing our geographic presence.
In both businesses we have expanded in North America and Europe.
We already have a significant presence in China and Asia-Pacific in Materials Technology and, as the business and commercial aviation market continues to build momentum in this region, we aim to establish ourselves as a major player in Aviation Services commensurate with our position elsewhere in the world.
19 We will continue to look for assets which consolidate and improve our market positions and returns in geographic regions in which we already operate.
Furthermore, there may be markets in which we do not currently participate but which fit with our existing competencies.
Our Aviation revenues at constant currencies have grown 26 per cent in the last three years and in Materials Technology 27 per cent over the same period.
Our cash flows and balance sheet give us the opportunity to continue to expand and that is what we intend to do, provided, of course, that our investments fit with our strategic criteria and provide financial returns that will add to the value of the Group overall.
Looking Forward 2004 was a year of good progress in top-line revenue growth in both divisions.
We continued to improve the market positions of both Aviation and Materials Technology through investment in new business, acquisitions and productivity, all of which will benefit 2005.
We expect demand to continue to be robust and free cash flow should see an improvement over 2004.
We also expect to see further corporate development activity, particularly in the Aviation area.
The future direction of the US dollar is difficult to predict and the outlook for raw material prices is unclear.
However, with the actions we have taken and continue to take, we expect to make good progress in 2005.
