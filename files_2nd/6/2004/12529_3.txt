Financial review Economic environment In 2004, sustained strong economic growth, particularly in Asia, has driven the demand for crude oil.
This was compounded by disruptions to supply and political uncertainty in the Middle East, as a result of which prices continue to remain supported at historically high nominal levels into 2005.
The Brent oil price commenced the year at US$29.9 per barrel and grew steadily throughout the period, peaked at US$49.6 per barrel in October, and fell to US$39.5 per barrel in December, averaging US$38.3 per barrel for the year 2003: US$28.8 per barrel.
Following US dollar weakness against the pound in 2002 and 2003, the US dollar pound rate opened 2004 at US$1.79 and remained broadly stable into the fourth quarter of the year, following which the dollar weakened markedly against the pound to end the year at US$1.92.
Profit and loss account In October, Premier announced its intention to adopt the US dollar as the reporting currency of the group going forward, with the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 being the first to be published in US dollars.
The majority of Premiers revenue and expenditure is transacted in US dollars as it is the functional currency of the upstream oil and gas industry.
By adopting the US dollar for reporting purposes, the Board believes that the accounts will give a clearer picture of performance of the groups business, minimising the impact of US dollar exchange rate fluctuations.
Comparative numbers for 2003 provided in these results were originally reported in sterling, and have been translated at the appropriate US dollar pound rates prevailing during the period.
The rates used are an average rate of US$1.63 for profit and loss items and a year-end rate of US$1.79 for balance sheet items.
John van der Welle Finance Director As explained in the 2003 results, the profit and loss account for that year has been analysed to show profit relating to ongoing operations, i. e. those assets retained after the restructuring.
