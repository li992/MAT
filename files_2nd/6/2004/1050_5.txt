The accounting policies are consistent with those set out in the Groups statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 except for turnover which is now presented net of tolling charges for concentrate sales.
The change in presentation, which is set out in Note 1 b to the financial statements, has no effect on profit before tax or net assets in either year.
The US dollar is the reporting currency of the Group and the principal currency in which the Group operates and in which assets and liabilities are denominated.
Key Operating Statistics Production and Sales Volumes Copper Production Copper Sales 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 tonnes 000 tonnes 000 tonnes 000 tonnes Los Pelambres 350.6 326.7 352.2 332.8 El Tesoro 97.8 92.4 98.3 92.0 Michilla 50.0 52.7 50.2 52.6 Group total 498.4 471.8 500.7 477.4 Group copper production increased by 5.6% to 498,400 tonnes in 2004.
This was mainly due to Los Pelambres, where the production of payable copper in concentrate increased by 23,900 tonnes.
The increase resulted from higher throughput following completion of modifications to the grinding lines at the end of 2003 which compensated for slightly lower grades and recoveries.
At El Tesoro, cathode production increased by 5,400 tonnes also due to higher throughput, resulting from an optimisation of the crushing circuits in the year.
Production at Michilla was 2,700 tonnes lower due to a reduction in grades in the first half of the year when changes in the sequence of ore extracted were made to avoid old mine workings in the vicinity of Michillas open pit.
Further details of throughput, grade and recoveries at each mine are given in the Production, Transport and Water Statistics on page 44.
The volume of copper sold increased by 4.9% to 500,700 tonnes, reecting the production level at each mine.
Differences between production and sales volumes result from the timing of shipments and loading schedules.
Los Pelambres produces and sells both copper and molybdenum concentrates, and is credited for the gold and silver content in the copper concentrate sold.
During 2004, molybdenum production was 7,900 tonnes 2003 8,700 tonnes.
The decrease was due to lower molybdenum ore grades and lower recoveries.
El Tesoro and Michilla do not have by-product credits from their copper cathode sales.
Rail tonnages transported at the transport division increased marginally from 4.4 million tons in 2003 to 22 4.5 million tons in 2004.
ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 In its first full year of operations, Aguas fide Antofagasta sold 32.6 million cubic metres of water, a 5.3% increase over 2003 when the water rights and facilities it now operates were controlled by ESSAN.
Realised Copper Prices and Cash Costs per Pound Realised copper Cash costs prices per pound per pound 2004 2003 2004 2003 cents cents cents cents Los Pelambres 142.2 84.6 7.9 29.3 El Tesoro 136.9 82.5 52.4 42.4 Michilla 129.2 82.5 85.6 69.8 Group weighted average 139.8 83.9 24.3 36.4 LME average 130.0 80.7 Realised Prices Realised prices are determined by comparing revenues grossed up for tolling charges for concentrates with sales volumes for each mine in the year, and reflect the effective prices achieved by each mine.
Realised copper prices increased from 83.9 cents per pound in 2003 to 139.8 cents per pound in 2004, mainly due to higher LME copper prices, which averaged 130.0 cents per pound in 2004 compared with 80.7 cents per pound in 2003.
Similarly, realised molybdenum prices at Los Pelambres in 2004 were US$20.0 per pound 2003 US$5.5 per pound, compared with an average market price of US$16.2 per pound 2003 US$5.3 per pound.
The Chairmans Review discusses the main factors behind the improvement in copper and molybdenum prices on pages 10 and 11.
At Los Pelambres, realised copper prices and molybdenum prices exceeded market prices mainly because, in line with industry practice, concentrate sales agreements generally provide for provisional pricing at the time of shipment with final pricing based on the average market price for specified future periods.
Revenues on provisionally priced shipments are adjusted monthly until final settlement.
Turnover from copper sales at Los Pelambres in 2004 included positive net pricing adjustments of US$94.5 million 2003 US$38.3 million.
These include positive adjustments of US$62.5 million relating to sales open at the beginning of 2004, and a further US$32.0 million for sales both invoiced and settled in the year.
Molybdenum sales at Los Pelambres in the first half of this year included similar positive net pricing adjustments of US$78.5 million 2003 US$7.1 million.
This included US$8.2 million relating to sales open at the beginning of 2004 and US$70.3 million relating to sales both invoiced and settled in the year.
Los Pelambres did not hedge its production during 2004 2003 hedging losses of US$3.7 million.
At El Tesoro, realised copper prices of 136.9 cents 2003 82.5 cents exceeded market prices principally due to premiums obtained on sales of its LME-registered grade-A cathodes.
El Tesoro did not hedge its production during 2004 2003 hedging loss of US$3.5 million.
23 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial Review Realised copper prices at Michilla were 129.2 cents per pound including cathode premiums.
Michilla did not benefit fully from higher copper prices as part of its first quarter production had been hedged in 2003 at a cost of US$9.3 million 2003 hedging loss of US$3.9 million.
Cash Costs Cash costs are a measure of the operational cost of copper production expressed in terms of cents per pound of payable copper produced.
Cash costs include by-product credits and tolling charges for concentrates at Los Pelambres and exclude depreciation, financial income and expenses, exchange gains and losses and corporation tax for the Groups three mines.
Group weighted average cash costs in 2004 decreased by 33% to 24.3 cents per pound 2003 36.4 cents per pound, mainly due to the substantial by-product credits at Los Pelambres which offset cost increases at all three mines.
Cash costs at Los Pelambres fell to 7.9 cents per pound 2003 29.3 cents per pound, due to the very significant increase in molybdenum prices.
Cash costs in the year excluding by-product credits were 53.7 cents per pound compared with 45.6 cents per pound in 2003.
The increase was due to higher treatment and refining charges TC RCs, as well as the effect of lower ore grades, higher shipping costs, the effect of the stronger peso and higher maintenance costs.
These factors were partly offset by the economies achieved by higher throughput levels.
Cash costs increased at both El Tesoro and Michilla compared with 2003.
At El Tesoro, cash costs increased to 52.4 cents per pound 2003 42.4 cents per pound.
At Michilla, cash costs increased to 85.6 cents per pound 2003 69.8 cents per pound.
The cost increases at both mines were mainly due to a combination of higher waste to ore ratios, lower ore grades, higher costs of sulphuric acid and fuel and, in the case of Michilla, slightly lower production levels.
Review of Performance Turnover, EBITDA, depreciation and amortisation, operating profit, capital expenditure and net assets are analysed on a segmental basis in Note 2 to the financial statements.
Turnover 2004 2003 US$m US$m Turnover 1,908.7 978.0 Group turnover increased by 95% to US$1,908.7 million in 2004.
The increase was due mainly to better realised copper prices at all three mines, following the improvement of LME copper prices compared to 2003, together with higher sales volumes.
The reasons for the improved prices and volumes are explained in the Key Operating Statistics above as well as in the discussion contained in the Chairmans Review on pages 8 to 16.
Overall turnover from copper sales which are now stated net of tolling charges for concentrates reached 24 US$1,430.7 million, compared with US$793.8 million in 2003.
By-product revenues at Los Pelambres ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 increased to US$347.4 million 2003 US$105.0 million mainly as a result of higher molybdenum prices.
Turnover at the transport division was also up by 13.1% to US$85.7 million 2003 US$75.8 million, mainly due to the stronger Chilean peso and marginally higher transport volumes.
Aguas fide Antofagasta contributed US$44.9 million in its first full year of operations.
In 2003, it contributed US$0.4 million having started operations on 29 December of that year.
In 2004, sales of copper concentrate and copper cathodes represented 75% of Group turnover and therefore revenues depend significantly on LME and realised copper prices.
Based on production volumes in 2004, and without taking into account the effects of provisional pricing and hedging activity, a one cent change in the average copper price for the year would affect turnover and profit before tax by US$11.0 million and earnings per share by 2.9 cents.
By-product sales at Los Pelambres principally molybdenum concentrate represented 18% of Group turnover.
A one dollar change in the average molybdenum price in the year would affect turnover and profit before tax by US$17.4 million, and earnings per share by 4.4 cents.
The transport division represented 5% of total turnover, and Aguas fide Antofagasta represented 2%.
Metal sales both copper and by-products are denominated in US dollars.
Transport revenues are denominated in both Chilean pesos and US dollars.
Sales at Aguas fide Antofagasta are denominated principally in Chilean pesos.
EBITDA and Operating Profit 2004 2003 US$m US$m EBITDA 1,328.8 524.3 Depreciation 134.5 136.8 Other amounts written off fixed assets 19.1 0.2 Operating profit 1,175.2 387.3 Operating profit increased 203% to US$1,175.2 million compared with 2003.
Operating profit at the mining division increased by US$769.8 million to US$1,122.9 million 2003 US$353.1 million, mainly due to the impact of higher copper and molybdenum prices together with higher copper sales volume, offset by higher operating costs as explained in the Key Operating Statistics above.
Operating profit increased by US$651.5 million at Los Pelambres, US$93.5 million at El Tesoro and US$30.6 million at Michilla.
Exploration expenditure increased by US$6.8 million to US$10.3 million in 2004 due to increased activity in Chile, including initial costs relating to pre-feasibility work at Esperanza and the exploration programme at Michilla in the second half of the year.
Net corporate costs in 2004 were similar at US$10.6 million 2003 US$11.6 million, and include a gain of US$2.1 million on the sale of the Groups 51% interest in the Magistral project in northern Peru during 2004.
25 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial Review Operating profits at the transport division in 2004 were US$30.6 million, a decrease of US$3.4 million compared to the previous year, which included other operating income of US$6.5 million received from a third party relating to a contract cancellation.
Aguas fide Antofagasta contributed US$21.7 million in 2004 compared with US$0.2 million after acquisition at the end of 2003.
EBITDA earnings before interest, tax, and amortisation for the year was US$1,328.8 million 2003 US$524.3 million.
This is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortisation of US$134.5 million 2003 US$136.8 million and other amounts written off fixed assets of US$19.1 million 2003 US$0.2 million to operating profit.
Net capital expenditure and financial investment amounted to U$80.1 million 2003 US$78.2 million and is further explained under Cash Flows on page 29.
Income from Other Fixed Asset Investments 2004 2003 US$m US$m Dividend income 0.1 Profit on disposal of fixed asset investments 1.1 Income from other fixed asset investments amounted to less than US$0.1 million.
During 2003, dividend income was US$0.1 million.
Following the demerger of Quienco in October 2003, the Group disposed of nearly all its other investments, including substantially all of its shares held in Banco fide Chile S. A.
This resulted in a profit of US$1.1 million.
There were no comparable disposals in 2004.
Net Interest Payable 2004 2003 US$m US$m Interest receivable 19.2 4.6 Interest payable 34.0 32.7 Foreign exchange 3.0 2.1 Release of discount relating to provisions 0.7 1.1 12.5 31.3 The increase in interest receivable reflected the substantial increase in Group cash and term deposits during 2004, together with higher market interest rates.
Group cash and deposits were US$881.4 million at the end of 2004, compared with US$195.7 million at the beginning of 2004 and US$252.4 million at the beginning of 2003.
Interest income also includes US$7.5 million relating to gains under currency swaps during the year 2003 nil.
26 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Deposits are typically held on short-term maturities of less than three months.
93% of the year-end cash and deposit balances were denominated in US dollars with the remainder mainly held in Chilean pesos.
Interest payable remained at similar levels to 2003, as increased market rates were offset by lower debt balances following regular principal repayments at Los Pelambres and El Tesoro during the year.
Interest costs at Los Pelambres were US$23.2 million compared with US$22.7 million the previous year.
Interest costs at El Tesoro for 2004 were US$9.9 million compared with US$9.7 million in 2003.
As explained under Financial Position on page 30, the project borrowings at both Los Pelambres and El Tesoro were refinanced at the end of 2004 and replaced by unsecured corporate loans.
In 2004, the ratio of operating profit to net interest was 94.0 times 2003 12.4 times and the ratio of EBITDA to net interest and principal repayments excluding amounts repaid on refinancing and voluntary prepayments was 8.0 times 2003 3.0 times.
The Groups borrowings relate mainly to Los Pelambres and El Tesoro, which represent US$588.9 million out of total borrowings at the end of 2004 of US$598.9 million.
Of total borrowings, 72% were floating rate and 28% were fixed rate after taking into account the effect of hedging instruments.
Borrowings are almost entirely denominated in US dollars.
Based on total borrowings at the end of 2004, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase interest payable by US$4.3 million but increase net interest receivable after taking into account cash and deposit balances at the end of 2004 and given that the Group was in a net cash position by US$4.5 million.
Details of the composition of borrowings, cash and deposits and interest rates are given in Notes 18 and 19 to the financial statements.
Taxation 2004 2003 US$m US$m Current tax 183.9 9.6 Deferred tax 54.8 54.8 238.7 64.4 Tax including deferred tax amounted to US$238.7 million 2003 US$64.4 million, reflecting the increased profit for the year.
The tax charge comprises current tax of US$183.9 million 2003 US$9.6 million and deferred tax of US$54.8 million 2003 US$54.8 million.
The current tax component has increased because, during this year, Los Pelambres and El Tesoro have absorbed the tax losses which derived from the start up of their operations in 1999 and 2001 respectively.
Deferred tax includes provision for withholding taxes of US$36.0 million for profits earned in Chile which are expected to be remitted abroad for dividend payments, and is the principal reason the effective tax rate of 20.5% 2003 18.0% exceeded the Chilean statutory tax rate of 17%.
27 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial Review Further details regarding the current and deferred tax charges for the year, including a reconciliation to the Chilean statutory rate of 17%, are given in Note 6 to the financial statements.
Earnings per Share 2004 2003 cents cents Earnings per share 283.1 91.5 Earnings per share calculations are based on 197,171,339 ordinary shares being the number of shares in issue throughout both 2003 and 2004.
Earnings per share increased 209% to 283.1 cents, reflecting the higher profit after tax and minority interests for the year.
Dividends Dividends on ordinary shares for the year are as follows: 2004 2003 cents cents Ordinary Interim 15 11 Final 24 24 39 35 Special Final 40 Total 79 35 Dividends on ordinary shares are payable in either US dollars or sterling.
Further details, including conversion rates for dividends payable in sterling, are given in the Report of the Directors on page 46 and in Note 7 to the financial statements.
The cost of ordinary dividends paid and proposed in 2004 will be US$155.8 million, compared with US$69.0 million excluding the demerger dividend in 2003.
This represents an increase in the ordinary dividend compared with 2003 of 11.4% excluding the special dividend and 125.7% including the special dividend.
The total 2004 dividend including the special dividend will be covered 3.6 times compared with 2.6 times in 2003.
In 2003, a dividend in specie of shares in Andsberg Limited was also declared, which carried a redemption right of US$1.11 per share.
No comparable transaction occurred in 2004.
28 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Acquisitions On 16 December 2004, the Group acquired a 30% interest in Antofagasta Terminal Internacional S. A. ATI, which operates the sole concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta.
The investment, acquired at a cost of US$2.9 million, has been accounted for as an interest in an associate and had no material effect on the Groups earnings or operating cash flows in the year.
On 8 October 2004, the Group acquired a 100% interest in EMISA Antofagasta S. A. an engineering company based in Antofagasta.
The investment, acquired at a cost of US$0.1 million, has been consolidated and had no material effect on the Groups earnings or operating cash flows in the year.
On 29 December 2003, the Group acquired a 30 year concession to operate the water rights and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile.
The cost of the concession was US$193.8 million which was satisfied in cash.
The cost included IVA Chilean VAT of 19% which is recoverable over a number of years, and of which US$5.8 million was recovered in 2004.
Cash Flows The Group cash flow statement is presented on page 72.
The key features may be summarised as follows: 2004 2003 US$m US$m Net cash inflow from operating activities 1,253.5 510.2 Capital expenditure and financial investment 80.1 78.2 Acquisitions and disposals 2.8 195.2 Equity dividends paid 76.5 58.2 Other items 149.2 121.6 Changes in net cash debt relating to cash flows 950.5 57.0 Exchange and other non-cash movements 6.2 5.9 Movement in net cash debt in the year 944.3 51.1 Net debt at the beginning of the year 661.8 712.9 Net cash debt at the end of the year 282.5 661.8 Net cash inflow from operating activities increased by 146% to US$1,253.5 million compared with US$510.2 million in 2003.
This reflected the improved operating results adjusted for depreciation, other amounts written off fixed assets and normal working capital movements in debtors, creditors and stocks.
Net capital and financial investment expenditures in 2004 were US$80.1 million.
Of this amount, US$47.7 million related to capital expenditure at Los Pelambres, which included initial expenditure on the Mauro dam of US$17.0 million.
The Mauro dam will cost approximately US$450 million, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2007.
The cost will be funded out of Group cash balances with US$163.5 million expected to be incurred during 2005.
Net capital expenditure and financial investment for the Group in 2003 was US$78.2 million.
29 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial Review Acquisitions and disposals in 2003 related mainly to the purchase of the water concession by Aguas fide Antofagasta for US$193.8 million, which included IVA Chilean VAT of 19% recoverable over a number of years.
During 2004, the Group spent US$2.9 million to acquire its interest in ATI and US$0.1 million to acquire its interest in EMISA Antofagasta.
It also recovered US$5.8 million of IVA relating to the water concession.
Equity dividends paid in the year were US$76.5 million 2003 US$58.2 million, representing the 2003 final dividend paid in June 2004 and the 2004 interim dividend paid in October 2004.
The 2004 final dividend including the special dividend will be paid in June 2005.
Other items principally related to dividends paid by subsidiaries to minority shareholders, tax payments and financial income and expenses.
These are analysed in the review of performance above and in the notes to the cash flow statement on pages 103 to 105.
The increase of US$27.6 million is due mainly to the minority share of dividends paid out by subsidiaries which rose by US$39.1 million to US$120.8 million in 2004, mainly offset by lower net financial costs which were US$13.0 million lower in 2004.
Foreign currency exchange differences and other non-cash movements are analysed in the reconciliation of net cash flow to movement in net debt on page 72.
Changes in the cash and debt components of net cash debt during the year are analysed under Financial Position below.
Financial Position 2004 2003 US$m US$m Net cash debt at the end of the year Current asset investments term deposits and cash at bank 881.4 195.7 Long-term and short-term loans 598.9 857.5 Net cash debt 282.5 661.8 The movement in net cash debt during the year was US$944.3 million.
The principal reasons for the change from a net debt position at the beginning of the year to a net cash position at the end of the year are set out above under Cash Flows.
During the year, net debt repayments amounted to US$263.3 million.
This included voluntary repayments of project debt of US$50 million at Los Pelambres and US$24.1 million at El Tesoro.
In December 2004, Los Pelambres and El Tesoro both took advantage of favourable debt market conditions to refinance their project loans with unsecured corporate facilities, to benefit from lower LIBOR margins and less restrictive covenants.
Los Pelambres refinanced its outstanding balance of US$460 million with a new loan which is repayable in semi-annual instalments over six years, while El Tesoro refinanced its outstanding balance of US$100 million with a new loan which is repayable in semi-annual instalments over five years.
30 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 At 31 December 2004, the Group held cash and deposits of US$881.4 million 2003 US$195.7 million.
After taking into account the minority share of non-wholly owned operations, the Groups share of the total balance was US$655.8 million 2003 US$173.4 million.
In January 2005, El Tesoro also fully repaid its finance lease of US$12.2 million relating to the previous purchase of a power line.
Total Group debt at 31 December 2004 was US$598.9 million 2003 US$857.5 million.
Of this amount, US$362.6 million 2003 US$518.0 million is proportionately attributable to the Group after taking the minority share of partly-owned operations into account.
An analysis of debt by Group company is contained in Note 18 to the financial statements.
US$104.7 million of the total Group debt of US$598.9 million is repayable within one year.
This short-term portion includes US$76.3 million under the Los Pelambres corporate loan and US$19.9 million under the El Tesoro corporate loan.
As explained above in relation to net interest payable, Group cash and debt is mainly floating rate and almost entirely denominated in US dollars.
The Group was in a net cash position at the end of 2004 on both a consolidated basis and an attributable basis.
At the end of 2003, the Group was in a net debt position and gearing was 53% on a consolidated basis calculated as Group net debt to shareholders funds and minority interests and 38% on an attributable basis calculated as the Groups proportional share of net debt to shareholders funds.
Balance Sheet The Groups balance sheet is set out on page 70.
Consolidated shareholders funds increased from US$905.9 million at the beginning of the year to US$1,322.7 million, reflecting the profit attributable to shareholders and exchange movements less dividends for the year.
Further details are given in Note 22 to the Financial Statements.
Minority interests increased from US$343.1 million at the beginning of the year to US$588.9 million, principally reflecting the minoritys share of profit after tax less minority share of distributions from the partly owned operations.
Treasury Management and Hedging The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price movements.
Derivative instruments are entered into for hedging purposes only and not for trading purposes.
Details of derivative instruments outstanding at 31 December 2004 are given in Note 19 to the financial statements.
Antofagasta Minerals S. A. manages commodity and treasury operations on behalf of the mining division while the FCAB the Railway in Chile manages treasury operations on behalf of the transport division.
Policies are set by a central Risk Management Committee and reviewed by each divisional board.
31 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial Review Foreign Currency Exchange Differences Exchange rates used to translate the results denominated in foreign currencies are given in Note 1 d to the financial statements.
The currency translation gain of US$14.5 million 2003 gain of US$15.5 million results mainly from the re-translation of peso-denominated subsidiaries at year-end rates.
The Chilean peso strengthened by 6.2% from Ch$594 US$1 at the beginning of 2004 to Ch$557 US$1 at the end of 2004.
Going Concern After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In forming this opinion, the Directors have taken into account the financial position of the Group including borrowing facilities in place, the current copper price and market expectations in the medium-term.
International Financial Reporting Standards The European Union announced in June 2002 that listed companies in member states would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in place of national generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The adoption of IFRS will be first reflected in the Groups financial statements for the half year ending 30 June 2005 and the year ending 31 December 2005, together with restated comparatives for 2004.
The Group began preparation for the adoption of IFRS in 2004.
It has analysed the differences between IFRS and UK and Chilean GAAP and has considered the effect of applying IFRS on the Groups accounting policies.
It is currently in the process of quantifying the changes which result from conversion and is preparing comparative financial information for 2004 under IFRS.
It is also implementing changes required to the Groups existing accounting systems and procedures.
The Group will release its 2005 half year results under IFRS in September 2005.
These will include a reconciliation of the Groups previously reported UK GAAP profit and loss accounts, balance sheet and shareholders funds to restated IFRS results, together with explanations of material policy differences and adjustments arising.
A summary of the more significant accounting policy changes which the Group anticipates will arise, based on current interpretations of the standards within each of these areas, is provided below.
This assessment may be subject to revision as result of new accounting developments and also as a result of changes to provisional conclusions which have so far been adopted by the Group as its conversion project is finalised.
It is not a comprehensive list of all expected changes.
32 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial Instruments IFRS generally requires derivatives to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
Subsequent changes in fair values are either taken to equity if the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are met or to the income statement if hedge accounting does not apply.
Previously, derivatives qualifying as hedges in accordance with UK GAAP have been held off the balance sheet and the fair value disclosed within a note to the financial statements.
The Group currently does not intend to adopt hedge accounting under IFRS although this decision will be kept under review.
Commodity based normal purchase or normal sale contracts that meet the own use requirements of IFRS are recognised, as with UK GAAP, in earnings when they are settled by physical delivery.
Any derivatives embedded within the terms of contractual commitments that are not considered closely related to the underlying host contract will also be separately identified and fair valued see provisional pricing below.
Provisional Pricing Copper and molybdenum concentrate sales generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment with final pricing settlement based on the average LME copper price or market molybdenum price for specified future periods.
The Groups accounting treatment under UK GAAP has been to value sales which remain open to final pricing at the period end in aggregate at the lower of provisional invoice prices and mark-to-market prices at the balance sheet date.
Forward prices are used for copper concentrate sales, while spot prices are used for molybdenum sales due to the absence of a futures market.
Under IFRS, the Group considers that such a provisional sale contains an embedded derivative which is required to be separated from the host contract.
The host contract is the sale of metals contained in the concentrate at current spot prices, less tolling charges deducted.
Both gains and losses from the markingto-market of the embedded derivative would be recognised in the profit and loss account each period.
In particular, any unrecognised gain under UK GAAP at the 2004 year end would be reflected in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 under IFRS and therefore would no longer be recognised in the 2005 accounting period.
Deferred Tax Under IFRS, deferred tax is provided and on some balances previously excluded from provision under UK GAAP such as revaluations and fair value adjustments.
Under IFRS, full provision must be made for tax arising on unremitted earnings from subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except to the extent that the Group can control the timing of remittances and remittance is not probable in the foreseeable future.
Under UK GAAP, the Group only provides tax on unremitted earnings to the extent that dividends have been accrued or if there is a binding agreement for the distribution of earnings at the reporting date.
33 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial Review Foreign Currency Translation and Exchange Differences IFRS may require the use of a functional currency for individual operations that differs from UK GAAP.
This may require certain exchange differences, currently taken through reserves, to be recorded in the profit and loss account.
Dividends Declared After Reporting Date Under IFRS, dividends that do not represent an obligation at the reporting date are not accrued for in the balance sheet.
Hence the companies proposed dividend will not be recognised into the Group accounts until the period which they are declared payable by the directors or approved by shareholders.
Under UK GAAP, dividends are recognised in the period in respect of which they have been declared.
Post-retirement Benefits and Severance Indemnities The Group does not provide defined benefit pension schemes or other post-retirement benefits and the adoption of IFRS will not affect the Group in this respect.
Provision is currently made for severance indemnities which are payable on termination of employment or on eventual closure of an operation with a finite life.
The provision is based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
IFRS requires this provision to be calculated using an actuarial valuation method, attributing the benefit to periods of service and based on appropriate actuarial assumptions.
UK GAAP does not require such an actuarial valuation to be used in calculating the provision.
Under IFRS, gains and losses will be recognised in the profit and loss account in a manner similar to the Groups approach under UK GAAP.
