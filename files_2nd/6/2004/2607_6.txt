Licence revenue consists of royalties receivable from Japanese and product licensing partners.
Comparison of the year to 31 March 2004 with the year to 31 March 2003 Burberry Group has completed two transactions that affect the comparability of results for the year to 31 March 2004 relative to the year to 31 March 2003.
On 1 July 2002, the Group purchased the operations and certain assets of its distributor in Korea, which largely operated as a retail business consisting primarily of 46 concessions at acquisition date the Korea acquisition.

In determining underlying performance, financial results are adjusted to exclude the impact of the Korea acquisition, and to reflect prior financial year exchange rates.
Turnover Total turnover advanced to 675.8m from 593.6m in the comparative period, an increase of 14%, or 15% on an underlying basis i. e. excluding an 11.3m reduction attributable to exchange rate movements and excluding the incremental contribution from the Korea acquisition.
At constant exchange rates, turnover increased by 16%.
Total retail sales increased by 13% in the year to 257.4m.
On an underlying basis, retail sales increased by 15%, driven by sales from newly opened stores with a modest contribution from existing stores.

The US market achieved strong gains throughout the year.
In Asia, the Hong Kong market quickly rebounded from the external shocks early in the financial year, while south east Asia, boosted by new stores, achieved significant gains in the second half.
Korea was adversely affected by a volatile macro-economic environment throughout the year.
A slow first half in Continental Europe was more than offset by vigorous growth in the second half of the year.
The soft UK market saw improving trends late in the year.
During the year, the Group opened nine new stores, including Burberry stores in the US 3, Europe 1 and Asia 4, as well as one outlet store and four concessions.

Sales growth resumed in Spain, reflecting the successful repositioning efforts in that market.
Licensing revenues in the year increased by 15%, 18% underlying, to 67.0m.
The majority of the increase was driven by royalty gains in Japan which reflected increases in certain royalty rates and a reduction in management fees payable with respect to specific licences.

The licensing revenue increase also reflected outstanding sales gains from global product licences, particularly fragrance, which benefited from the highly successful Burberry Brit launch.
