GlaxoSmithKline 59 Operating and financial review and prospects The Operating and financial review and prospects discusses the operating and financial performance, the financial outlook and the financial resources of the Group.
The results for each year are compared primarily with the results for the preceding year under the following headings: 60 Financial trends and ratios 61 2004 Year results for the year to 31st December 2004 compared to the year to 31st December 2003 71 Financial position and resources at 31st December 2004 76 Outlook and risk factors Additionally, in accordance with US requirements: 79 2003 Year results for the year to 31st December 2003 compared to the year to 31st December 2002 Exchange rates The Group, as a multinational business, operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies.
Its results as reported in sterling, are affected by movements in exchange rates between sterling and overseas currencies.
Average exchange rates prevailing during the period are used to translate the results and cash ows of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures into sterling.
Period end rates are used to translate the net assets of those undertakings.
The currencies which most inuence these translations are the US dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Groups practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate CER growth.
This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year.
CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates.
% represents growth at actual exchange rates.
Business performance During the years 2000 to 2003, business performance was the primary performance measure used by management and was presented after excluding merger items, integration and restructuring costs and disposals of businesses.
Management believes that exclusion of these items provides a better comparison of the way in which the business was managed and gives an indication of the performance of the Group in terms of those elements of revenue and expenditure which local management was able to inuence.
For 2004, with the completion of these programmes, the Group is reporting results on a statutory basis only.
Growth rates are presented comparing 2004 results both with 2003 business performance results and 2003 statutory results.
Management considers that the comparison of 2004 statutory results with 2003 business performance results gives the most appropriate indication of the Groups performance for the period under review and therefore commentaries are presented on this basis unless otherwise stated.
This information is provided in addition to the statutory results prepared under UK GAAP which appear on pages 90 and 91 to assist shareholders to gain a clear understanding of the underlying performance of the business and increase comparability for the periods presented.

Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits that fall to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GlaxoSmithKline.
The Group has open issues with the revenue authorities in the USA, UK, Japan and Canada, but by far the largest relates to Glaxo heritage products in the USA.
In the USA, for a number of years, GlaxoSmithKline has had significant open issues relating to transfer pricing.
GlaxoSmithKline has attempted to settle the dispute, first through direct discussion with the US Internal Revenue Service IRS and subsequently through discussions between the USA and UK authorities under the terms of the double tax convention between the two countries.
GlaxoSmithKline understands that the views of the two tax authorities were so different that they were unable to reach agreement, and discussions were terminated in July 2003.
86 GlaxoSmithKline Operating and financial review and prospects 2003 Year continued Earnings 2003 2002 Growth restated restated CER% % Statutory earnings m 4,478 3,930 19 14 Basic earnings per share 77.1p 66.5p 22 16 Basic earnings per ADS $2.53 $2.00 23 27 Adjusted earnings m 4,759 4,642 7 5 Adjusted earnings per share 82.0p 78.5p 10 4 Adjusted earnings per ADS $2.69 $2.36 10 14 Weighted average number of shares millions 5,806 5,912 Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are presented above in order to illustrate business performance which is the primary measure used by management.
Adjusted earnings increased by seven per cent.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10 per cent reecting the reduction in the weighted average number of shares resulting from the Groups share buy-back programme.
The interest cost of this programme also impacts the Groups earnings.
Adjusted earnings per share increased four per cent in sterling terms, compared with 10 per cent in CER terms.
The adverse currency impact on EPS of six per cent in the year reected the significant weakening of the US dollar relative to 2002 and compares with a four per cent adverse currency impact on turnover.
This difference principally arises from a different mix of currencies in profits compared with turnover.
Taken together with other expenses, taxation and business disposals this resulted in a basic EPS of 77.1 pence compared with 66.5 pence in 2002 and a diluted EPS of 76.9 pence compared with 66.3 pence in 2002.
Merger and manufacturing restructuring costs were lower in 2003 than in 2002 and as a result, the sterling based growth in basic EPS of 16 per cent was signicantly higher than the CER based growth in adjusted EPS despite the overall negative impact of currencies in 2003. Dividend The Board has declared a fourth interim dividend of 14 pence per share making a total for the year of 41 pence per share.
This compares with a total dividend of 40 pence per share for 2002.
In 2004, GlaxoSmithKline expects a similar increase in the total dividend as has been declared in 2003.
The allocation of the quarterly dividends will be rebalanced in 2004.
GlaxoSmithKline intends to increase the first three interim dividends from nine pence to 10 pence, with the remainder of the total dividend for the year being allocated to the fourth quarter dividend.
