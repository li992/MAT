Besides Pubmaster, BUSINESS IS NOW a further 80 individual pub acquisitions were made in the year, but there were 376 disposals, 256 of which were sold to avoid local concentrations as a direct consequence of acquiring Pubmaster.
The average number of pubs during the year was 6,575, with the original Punch estate having on average 4,425 pubs, 1% fewer than last year.
FULLY Pubmaster acquisition On 1 December 2003 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Pubmistress Limited which operated an estate of 3,115 leased and tenanted pubs trading under the Pubmaster name.
This acquisition is INTEGRATED referred to uniquely within the financial statements under the heading Acquisitions.
The headline cost of 1,193m on a cash and debt free basis included the assumption of 894.2m securitised debt: all other debt has since been repaid.
WITH The fair value adjustment includes a revaluation of assets and loans, and gives rise to goodwill of 85.9m, which it is intended to amortise over 20 years, and of which 3.1m was charged in the period.
The most significant component in the revaluation was that relating to the securitised debt and associated hedging instruments, which was valued 86.6m higher than PUNCH the book value acquired: this will be written down over the life of the loans, and gave rise to a credit within interest payable of 3.8m in the year.
The Pubmaster business is now fully integrated with Punch.
Other acquisitions, disposals and investment Goodwill resulting on acquisition A further 48.7m was invested in the acquisition of 80 individual pubs August 2004 during the year, together with investment of 46.2m on existing pubs m within the estate and 5.0m on infrastructure.
We continue to see excellent Net cost of investment 223.8 returns on our pub investments and good opportunities to develop our Less: net assets of Pubmistress estate further.
Of the 46.2m investment, 34.9m was spent on 580 profit at acquisition 34.7 enhancing projects including 74 from the Pubmaster estate, generating fair value adjustments 103.2 a first year pre tax ROI of 29%.
Goodwill 85.9 During the year we sold a total of 376 pubs raising net proceeds of 75.6m.
Of these, 256 were sold as an immediate consequence of the Pubmaster acquisition these raised 53.9m net proceeds but generated a book loss of 12.0m, which is recorded as an exceptional item due to the unique circumstances of the sale.
The remaining 120 disposals were generally sold for alternative use at a price very close to book value.
Revaluation of the estate In line with our policy of rolling estate revaluation over a five year period, 877 pubs were revalued by DTZ in 2004 and yielded a surplus of 84.7m 20% over book value.
This has been accounted for through reserves.
Borrowings and interest cost Total borrowings for the Group at 21 August 2004 were 2,800.4m, net of 73.0m of cash collateralised loans.
Net debt, recognising cash held within the business of 165.3m, was 2,635.1m, an increase of 1,185.3m over prior year primarily due to the Pubmaster acquisition.
The majority of borrowings are held in two securitisation structures, being Punch Taverns Finance and Pubmaster Finance.
Punch Taverns Finance was restructured early in the year to combine with Punch Funding II and raise additional leverage of 265m.
Other borrowings are revolving bank facilities secured on the value of recent pub acquisitions: at 21 August 2004 just 13.7m was drawn down against facilities of over 225m.
The Group additionally had a 50m unsecured facility at year end which had been established to provide short term finance to assist with the Pubmaster acquisition, however there were no drawings under this facility at 21 August 2004.
Interest costs on each tranche of the securitised debt are fixed for their life, Borrowings and interest cost 2004 2003 either directly or using hedging instruments, and currently average 7.1%.
Net interest costs during the year totalled 166.8m before exceptional Securitised debt: Punch Taverns Finance 1,808.9 730.4 items, and were covered 2.0 times by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items.
Punch Funding II 717.3 Pubmaster Finance 977.8 Exceptional items Other borrowings 13.7 106.6 Cash 165.3 104.5 Exceptional items of 23.1m 19.0m post tax were incurred in the year to 21 August 2004.
These arose from the refinancing activity to merge Net debt 2,635.1 1,449.8 two securitisation structures and from the integration of Pubmaster and associated disposals.
Details of these costs are provided in note 4 to the financial statements.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Taxation The overall tax charge of 30.8m represented 23% of pre-tax profit, or 22% on a pre-exceptional basis prior year 14%, and continues to benefit from the utilisation of tax losses brought forward from prior years.
As these INCREASED losses are used up, it is expected that the tax charge will gravitate to a standard 30% corporation tax rate over the next two years.
BY 24% pre exceptional items Earnings per share The basic earnings per share of 41.2p diluted 40.3p includes the cost of exceptional items.
On an adjusted basis excluding exceptionals, earnings per share were 48.8p, an increase of 24% over the prior year.
The growth in earnings per share was impacted by the rising tax charge as previous tax losses are used up.
assuming the same effective tax rate for both years, growth in adjusted earnings per share would have been 38%.
Dividend The Board has recommended a final dividend payment for the year of 6.1p per ordinary share, increasing the full year dividend to 9.0p prior year 6.5p, a growth of 38%.
The cost of this dividend is covered 4.6 times by post tax earnings in the year, or 4.9 times on a fully taxed pre-exceptional basis.
Accounting policies There have been no changes to accounting policies during the year.
The group is working towards the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which will first be reported for the year ending August 2006.
It is currently too early to quantify the impact of adopting IFRS on the Groups results and financial position.
The key areas currently identified that affect the Group financial statements under IFRS are in respect of fixed assets, hedge accounting, accounting for business combinations including the accounting treatment of goodwill, taxation, pensions and share-based payments.
Post balance sheet acquisition of InnSpired On 10 September 2004 the Group completed the acquisition of InnSpired Group Limited, which owned 1,064 pubs, for a headline cost of 335m incorporating 239m of securitised debt.
Consequent to, and shortly after the acquisition, 88 pubs were sold to Admiral Taverns for 22.6m, including 51 from the InnSpired estate.
On 21 October 2004 the Group agreed terms to redeem the fixed rate component of the InnSpired securitisation and announced plans to redeem the remaining securitisation notes, to be replaced initially by short term borrowing.
This redemption was achieved in full by 22 November 2004.
