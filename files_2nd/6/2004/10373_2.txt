The Group intends to provide a fuller update on the impact Accounting policies of IFRS later in 2005.
Amendment to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions: Revenue recognition and UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts apply for the first time this year.
As a result, the Group has changed its accounting policy on revenue recognition to record turnover net of coupons and staff discounts.
Prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The effect has been to decrease the Groups reported turnover by 12m 2003 9m with no impact on reported profits.
UITF 38, which requires an entitys own shares held in Employee Share Trusts to be deducted from shareholders funds rather than being shown as an asset, has resulted in own shares of 11m being deducted from shareholders funds at 25 September 2004, but has not required a restatement of prior year comparatives.
The Group has continued to account for pensions under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs whilst providing the additional disclosures required by FRS 17 Retirement Benets in the notes to the financial statements.
The Group intends to adopt FRS 17 in full for the year ending 1 October 2005 which should assist the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The impact of this change in accounting policy on the 2004 comparatives will be to reduce reported profit before tax by 11m and net assets by 219m.
IFRS implementation The Group will be required to adopt IFRS when preparing its consolidated financial statements for 2005 06.
Accordingly, the Annual Report for the coming year to 1 October 2005 will be the last to contain financial statements prepared under UK accounting standards UK GAAP.
Under IFRS the Group will be required to restate its results for the year to 1 October 2005 and reconcile these to the previously reported UK GAAP numbers.
This requirement will apply to the Group for the first time in respect of the interim financial statements for 2005 06.
Mitchells & Butlers is in the process of identifying and resolving all conversion issues to ensure a smooth transition to IFRS.
The main areas of difference identied to date arise in respect of the following standards: Deferred taxation Share based payments Derivatives and hedge accounting Pensions.
