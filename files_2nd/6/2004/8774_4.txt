12 01681 JJB AR 2004 TEXT 25 5 04 3:50 pm Page 13 Financial review continued Dividend At the time of the publication of our Interim results in October 2003, we stated that following representations from a number of institutional shareholders, we would adopt a more progressive dividend policy.
The Board has therefore proposed a final dividend of 7.0 pence net per ordinary share, payable on 14 July 2004 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 11 June 2004.
Together with the interim dividend paid on 10 December 2003 of 3.0 pence net per ordinary share, this results in a total dividend for the 52 weeks ended 25 January 2004 of 10.0 pence, an increase of 38 per cent compared to 7.25 pence per share paid in the comparative period.
The total dividend is covered 2.7 times by underlying headline earnings per ordinary share as defined in note 11 on page 43 of these Financial statements.
This step change has brought JJBs dividend cover more into line with other mid-cap retailers.
Share Capital Details of the share capital and movements during the accounting period are described in note 22 to the Financial statements on page 48.
The share price of the ordinary shares at the close of business on Friday 23 January 2004 was 256 pence, representing an equity market capitalisation of approximately 609 million.
This represents an increase of 82 per cent from the price of 141 pence at 31 January 2003.
Following the announcement of the preliminary results on 14 April 2004, the closing share price was 284 pence.
On 11 May 2004, the date on which declarable interests have been disclosed in the Directors report, the share price was 251 pence.
Office of Fair Trading In August 2003, the Office of Fair Trading OFT pronounced JJB guilty of price-fixing in the sale of certain replica kit products over a two year period during 2000 and 2001 and levied a fine of 8.4 million.
We have appealed against the decision of the OFT to the independent Competition Appeals Tribunal CAT : the appeal was conducted during March 2004 and the decision of the CAT is awaited in the near future.
No provision has been made in respect of this fine in our accounts as, on the basis of advice received, the Board believes that the appeal will be successful.
