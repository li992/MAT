Steve Hare Group Finance Director IAS 39 Hedge Accounting Under IAS 39 derivative instruments are marked to market at the balance sheet date.
On subsequent revaluation at each period end, the ineffective element of the hedge is taken to the income statement.
Spectris currently has three categories of financial instrument that are accounted for under IAS 39, however only two are expected to result in amounts being charged or credited to the income statement.
1 Average rate option a nil cost option for $145 million with a spread of 1.751.90 has been put in place.
This instrument was taken out to protect the groups US dollar exposure.
2 Cross currency interest rate swaps these were taken out to x the oating rate private placement US dollar debt into xed interest euro debt.
3 Forward currency contracts a number of contracts exist hedging US dollar exposure on sales.
These effective hedges should not result in amounts being charged to the income statement.
The effect of holding the first two instruments above is to introduce volatility into the income statement which, in the case of 1 will be driven by US dollar to sterling exchange rate movements, and in the case of 2 euro interest rate movements.
