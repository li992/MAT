those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and regulatory compliance.
ARM and Artisan have a number of information systems that are dissimilar, which will have to be integrated, or in some cases, replaced.
Difficulties associated with integrating ARM and Artisan, which would be exacerbated because they are headquartered in Tim Score Chief Financial Officer different countries, could have a material adverse effect on the combined company and the value of ARM ADSs or ARM ordinary shares.
General economic conditions may reduce ARMs revenues and harm ARMs business ARM is subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic conditions.
Technology purchases and investments may be delayed or reduced due to economic uncertainties in ARMs key markets.
The impact of this on ARM is difficult to predict but if businesses defer licensing ARMs technology, require less services or development tools, or if consumers defer purchases of new products which incorporate ARMs technology for example, the slower than expected migration to 3G mobile phone technology, ARMs revenue could decline.
A decline in revenue would have an adverse effect on ARMs results of operations and could have an adverse effect on ARMs financial condition.
ARM operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor market The semiconductor market is characterised by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
ARM believes that its future quarterly operating results will continue to be subject to a wide variety of risk factors including those set out above.
