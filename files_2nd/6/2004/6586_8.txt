by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated.
Summary In total, at 31 December 2004 on the FRS 17 basis, there was a net additional liability on all pension post-retirement obligations of 580 million 2003 563 million in addition to the net 68 million 2003 138 million already included in long-term liabilities prepayments on the balance sheet.

Joint ventures Following the divestments made in 2004 there would be no significant impact on the equity of joint ventures from the application of FRS 17. International Financial Reporting Standards The European Union requires all listed companies to report under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005 with prior year comparatives on the same basis.
We gave details in our 2003 annual report of the programme of work the Group had established to enable it to report under IFRS for the first time when it announces its 2005 interim results.
That work continued during the year and, in December 2004, we advised that in addition to generally introducing more volatility, the keyareas of impact on the profit and loss account and balance sheet will be in accounting for financial instruments, post-retirement benefits, development expenditure and share-based payments.
There will also be other changes of less significance.
It is our intention to restate the 2004 results on an IFRS basis at the end of April, prior to the publication of the interim results, to allow the impact to be interpreted and understood.
Financial resources and going concern At 31 December 2004 the Group had net funds of 65 million.
In addition it had available, but undrawn, committed borrowing facilities totalling 582 million.
Having assessed the future funding requirements of the Group, the Directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate for the accounts to be prepared on a going concern basis.
