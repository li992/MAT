financial reporting and have pursued a strategy of communicating early the impact on our nancials.
In line with this, we have early adopted European embedded value EEV principles in our 2004 supplementary reporting.
A number of the other changes will be implemented and become mandatory in 2005, with the most fundamental change being the requirement to report under IFRS for financial years starting 1 January 2005 onwards.
During 2004 we provided an indication of the impact of implementing IFRS on our balance sheet at 31 December 2003 and have shown that there will be a reduction of 250 million to our statutory shareholders funds.
In addition, from 1 January 2005 we are required to assess and monitor our capital position under the Prudential Sourcebook PSB regime as prescribed by the FSA.
In anticipation of these changes, Aviva has made a significant investment of 171 million to date in our global finance transformation programme, in anticipation of these changes and we are now moving into a phase of embedding these new requirements into our underlying processes and overall governance framework.
We have made good progress though we still have much to do.

An important aspect of the groups overall capital management process is the setting of target risk-adjusted rates of return for individual business units, which are aligned to performance objectives and ensure that the group is focused on the creation of value for shareholders.
The group has a number of sources of capital available to it and seeks to optimise its debt to equity structure in order to ensure that it can consistently maximise returns to shareholders.
The group considers not only the traditional sources of capital funding but the alternative sources of capital including reinsurance and securitisation, as appropriate, when assessing its deployment and usage of capital.

For example, for UK between the guaranteed value of the policy and the market value of with-profit business, the shareholder cost is lower because some of the underlying assets.
the cost can be absorbed by the excess assets in the with-profit fund: Guaranteed annuity options The groups UK with-profit funds have The shareholder cost of guarantees and options is calculated using written individual and group pensions which contain guaranteed annuity real world stochastic economic scenarios, whereas the guarantee rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the and option liabilities are calculated using a combination of market benets from a policy in the form of annuity based on guaranteed consistent stochastic scenarios in the UK and deterministic regulatory conversion rates.

Integration of risk and capital management The group has developed an Internal Capital Assessment ICA framework for identifying the risks to which each of its business units and the group as a whole are exposed, and quantifying their impact on the volatility of economic capital.
The ICA estimates how much capital is needed to mitigate the risk of insolvency to a selected remote level of risk.
This is carried out by all material parts of the group and combines the results of financial tests with the groups risk reporting model.
The financial tests are currently based on stress and scenario analyses although these have been informed by full stochastic risk-based capital RBC models where available.
Although the ICA is an internal process, from 2005 the FSA will use ICA to inform the target regulatory capital levels it sets for the group and the UK insurance businesses.
