Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors The Board determines the fees paid to non-executive directors under a policy which seeks to recognise the time commitment, responsibility and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to an effective board.
For the year ended 31 January 2004 non-executive directors were paid an annual fee of 38,000 for their services as members of the Board plus, where appropriate, the following additional fees: Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director John Nelson 12,000 Chairman of the Audit Committee Phil Bentley 10,000 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee John Nelson 6,000 Chairman of the Social Responsibility Committee Margaret Salmon 3,000 The fees for services as members of the Board for the year ending 29 January 2005 will be 42,000.
The fee for chairing the Remuneration Committee has also increased to 8,000 p. a. reflecting the increased responsibility and time commitment of this role.
The previous increase in non-executive directors fees was in February 2002.
Following the appointment of Gerry Murphy as Chief Executive and the demerger of Kesa Electricals, Sir Francis Mackay volunteered to reduce his Chairmans fees from 300,000 to 250,000 per annum, reflecting the reduced time commitment required.
This reduction was implemented in full for the year ended 31 January 2004.
Non-executive directors have letters of engagement instead of service contracts.
The Chairmans letter of engagement allows for six months notice up to the age of 65 when the appointment ends without the need for notice.
Other non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years.
Their position can be revoked without compensation at any time at the discretion of the Company.
In March 2004 the letters of engagement, other than for the Chairman, were revised to comply with the UKLAs Combined Code as it applies going forward.

Adjusted earnings per share, which removes the impact of exceptional items which were net gains in both years and acquisition goodwill amortisation, increased 33% from 13.4p to 17.8p per share.
2004 2003 Basic earnings per share 20.3p 17.7p Exceptional items 2.7 p 4.6 p Goodwill amortisation 0.2p 0.3p Adjusted earnings per share 17.8p 13.4p The Board has proposed a final dividend of 6.15p per share, making the total dividend for the year 9.65p per share.
This dividend is covered 1.84 times by adjusted earnings before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
Return on invested capital Underlying return on invested capital ROIC improved in the year from 7.6% to 8.7%, just above the Groups cost of capital at 8.4%.
Underlying ROIC assumes properties appreciate at a steady rate over the long-term.
When calculating the underlying ROIC, short-term variations in property values more or less than the long-term mean are excluded.
ROIC is defined as net operating profit less adjusted taxes operating profit excluding goodwill amortisation, exceptionals, property lease and depreciation costs less tax at Group effective tax rate, plus property revaluation in the year divided by average invested capital average holding in the year of goodwill, fixed assets and net current assets invested in the business, plus property operating lease costs capitalised at the market property yield.
Excluding goodwill from average invested capital, underlying ROIC improved from 10.9% to 12.5%.
Cashflow and investment in the businesses Net debt decreased from 1,926.4m at the start of the year to 843.8m at the year end.
During the year 423.0m of debt was demerged as part of the Kesa Electricals demerger.
In addition, 203.0m of proceeds were received on the sale of discontinued businesses.
A total of 777.4m of net cash was generated from operating activities compared to 895.0m in the previous year.
Capital expenditure for the Group was 389.1m, down from 468.4m in the previous year.
A total of 819.2m 2003: 215.4m was received during the year in respect of the sale of tangible fixed assets, 687.6m relating to the proceeds from the sale by B&Q Properties Limited formerly Chartwell Land plc of its third-party property portfolio.
Investments, acquisitions and disposals The Group successfully completed the demerger of Kesa Electricals on 7 July 2003.
On demerger, the Company declared a dividend in specie, which was satisfied by the issue of shares in Kesa Electricals.
The dividend in specie of 1,592.9m represented the net assets of the business transferred to Kesa Electricals at the date of demerger of 785.6m, goodwill of 1,230.3m relating to Kesa Electricals businesses that had previously been written off to reserves which was resurrected on demerger, less debt of 423.0m assumed by Kesa Electricals.
Further information is provided in note 1 under discontinued operations.
During the year, the Group acquired the remaining 0.6% of Castorama Dubois Investissements S. C. A. CDI for 62.4m, giving rise to goodwill of 53.1m.
The Group also completed the disposal of the non-core home improvement businesses.
These included the sale of Rno Dpt in Canada, Dubois Matriaux in France, NOMI in Poland and Castorama Brazil and the closure of Castorama Belgium.
An exceptional loss on disposal of 58.3m has been included in the profit and loss account.
In addition, the closure of the loss-making Castorama Germany business was also completed.
Property The Group owns a significant property portfolio, most of which is now used for trading purposes and which, at the year end, had a value of 2.2bn.
Following the buy-out of the minority interest, a full external valuation of the CDI properties on an existing use basis was undertaken.
In addition, the Group has continued its normal practice of externally valuing on an existing use basis one-third of the B&Q property portfolio in the UK, with internal valuations being performed for the other two-thirds.
In both cases, these revalued amounts have been incorporated into the accounts, giving rise to a revaluation surplus in the year of 295.7m.
This surplus reflects the strong growth in property yields during the period together with the full valuation of our property portfolio.
Interest The net interest charge for the year, excluding the exceptional financing charge of 86.9m, was 44.1m, of which 33.6m related to continuing operations.
The net interest charge from continuing operations in the prior year of 12.4m benefited from interest income of 14.8m on the proceeds of the rights issue held prior to the purchase of the CDI minority.
Exceptional financing charges Exceptional financing charges of 86.9m, shown in the profit and loss account for the year, comprised a cost of 27.7m, relating to restructuring the Groups debt as a result of the demerger of Kesa Electricals, a gain of 23.9m on unwinding an associated interest rate swap and a cost of 83.1m incurred in connection with a foreign exchange contract, which had been taken out to protect the Sterling value of the expected euro receipts from the sale or Initial Public Offering of Kesa Electricals.
As Kesa Electricals was subsequently demerged, part of the contract was no longer required and was closed out in April 2003 at a loss of 83.1m.
A further loss of 45.9m arose on 20 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 FINANCIAL REVIEW
