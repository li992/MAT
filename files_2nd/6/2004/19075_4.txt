Financing and structure Minerva The Group finances its activities through a mixture of cash flow and borrowings.
The Group seeks to gear selectively property investments with secured long-term bank debt, typically non-recourse, whilst holding a large amount of cash providing the Group with security, liquidity and flexibility.
The Group deposits its cash with selected financial institutions with high credit ratings.
Total borrowings at 30 June 2004 were 690.7 million 2003: 670.2 million.
Cash and short-term deposits were 103.9 million 2003: 141.2 million and the Group had undrawn loan facilities of 2.9 million 2003: 2.9 million.
The increase in net debt during the year of circa 57.8 million to 586.8 million largely reflects the property acquisitions made during the year, the expenditure incurred in bringing our development schemes to their present states, the acquisition of interest rate swaptions to hedge future interest rate exposure and the provision of short-term secured finance to Allders, partially offset by the net proceeds arising from the sale of The Brooks shopping centre.
In terms of its borrowings, the Group adopts a risk-averse hedging strategy with almost all of its borrowings, which are secured on property assets, at fixed rates.
The Group continues to use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest rate profile and at 30 June 2004, 97 per cent 2003: 95 per cent of Group borrowings were hedged under fixed or swapped-fixed interest rate agreements.
In addition, as part of a strategy to hedge interest rate exposure beyond the Financial reporting timeframe which exists under its existing loan agreements, the Group acquired, During the year the Group adopted application note G to FRS 5 Reporting the in August 2003, interest rate swaptions with an exercise interest rate of substance of transactions which was issued by the Accounting Standards Board 5.25 per cent on principal loans totalling 175 million, which are scheduled in November 2003.
