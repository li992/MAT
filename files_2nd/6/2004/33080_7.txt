Historically, the economic lives charges based on the allocation to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and have not been changed following these reviews.
Tangible fixed assets Bases of amortisation Tangible fixed assets also represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Goodwill Group and hence the estimates and assumptions made to determine their carrying value and related depreciation are critical to the Groups financial position and Once capitalised, goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated performance.

As networks are the asset is acquired and regularly reviewed for appropriateness.
The lives are based typically brought into service over a period of time, the charge for amortisation is on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, initially calculated by reference to the capacity of the network compared to capacity at which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.
For this purpose, network maturity is determined as being reached infrastructure cannot be depreciated over a period that extends beyond the expiry of after a maximum period of five years from service launch.

Historically, changes in useful economic lives have not resulted in material changes to the Groups depreciation charge.
If the licences were amortised over their economic life on a straight-line basis, the annual amortisation charge would be higher in the period to network maturity and Cost capitalisation lower thereafter.

The adoption of EITF 00-21 substantially aligns the Groups US GAAP revenue recognition policy with UK GAAP.
As contracts entered into before 1 October 2003 are accounted for in accordance with SAB 101, the related deferred connection revenues, and related costs, will continue to be recognised over the remaining life of the customer relationship.
For the 2004 financial year, the Groups revenue under US GAAP increased by 188 million as a result of following the methodology under SAB 101 for the first six months and EITF 00-21 for the remainder of the year.

Allowance for bad and doubtful debts The allowance for bad and doubtful debts reflects managements estimate of losses arising from the failure or inability of the Groups customers to make required payments.

An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs.

Although the Group reports its balance sheet in sterling, which is the principal currency for most transactions undertaken in its shares, it does not hedge its foreign Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About currency balance sheet exposure for three reasons.
First, the Group believes its Market Risk shareholders principally value its shares by discounting its estimated future sterling The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, and foreign currency cash flows and converting to sterling at appropriate rates where foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
Secondly, the Group manages the currency of its net debt according to Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines banded multiples of those currencies operating cash flows, adjusted for dividends and authorised and reviewed annually by the Companys Board of directors, most recently share purchases.
As such, at 31 March 2004, 119% of net debt were denominated in on 20 January 2004.

These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are Cash deposits and other financial instrument transactions give rise to credit risks on the on-lent or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries.
The Board of directors has amounts due from counterparties.
The Group regularly monitors these risks and the credit approved three debt protection ratios, being: net interest to operating cash flow plus ratings of its counterparties and, by policy, limits the aggregate credit and settlement risk dividends from associated undertakings : retained cash flow operating cash flow plus it may have with one counterparty.
While these counterparties may expose the Group to dividends from associated undertakings less interest, tax, dividends to minorities and credit losses in the event of non-performance, it considers the possibility of material loss equity dividends to net debt: and operating cash flow plus dividends from associated to be acceptable because of these control procedures.
