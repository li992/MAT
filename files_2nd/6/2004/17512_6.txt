0147 Xstrata AR 2005 1-70 29 3 05 11:37 am Page 10 10 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 chief executives report Growth through acquisition During 2004 Xstrata examined a number of possible acquisition targets to assess their potential to complement the growth inherent in the Groups commodity businesses.
In the final quarter of 2004, our focus turned to the potential acquisition of WMC Resources Limited, a large diversified Australian mining group.
4 Following our initial approach to the Board of WMC in October 2004, and the Boards rejection of this approach, on 22 November we made a cash, debt-financed offer for the entire issued share capital of WMC directly to shareholders of AUD6.35 per share.
We subsequently raised this offer to AUD7.20 per share cum dividend and declared it unconditional on 2 March 2005.
Shortly after our offer was declared unconditional, a counter offer was made by BHP Billiton of AUD7.85 per share, which has been recommended by the WMC Board.
Xstrata announced that it would not be raising its offer, due to close on 24 March 2005.
0 1 Xstratas approach to the potential acquisition of WMC has underscored our unremitting commitment to creating value for 2 shareholders, over and above any desire for growth for its own sake.
Value creation remains the guiding principle in the pursuit 3 of the strategy to continue to leverage our size and momentum to grow Xstrata, taking advantage of opportunities as they arise 4 and withdrawing if further pursuit will destroy value.
5 6 The strategy we have successfully pursued since the formation of Xstrata plc three years ago remains the roadmap for 7 Xstratas future growth to enhance further Xstratas position as a value-adding business for its shareholders through a 8 combination of internal growth from our portfolio, small incremental transactions and company-transforming acquisitions.
9 0 There are a number of alternative opportunities available to Xstrata to achieve further value creation for shareholders and we 1 will continue to examine these carefully.
The strength and balance of our current portfolio, together with the growth being 2 achieved from these assets and new projects, mean that we are ideally positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 3 at the right moment.
4 5 Balance sheet, dividend and capital management 6 Xstratas balance sheet was further strengthened in 2004 by the very strong cashflow generated from our operations.
By the end 7 of 2004, Xstratas gearing stood at 16.8%, down from 31.3% net debt to equity as at 31 December 2003, with free cashflow 8 before expansionary capital expenditure and acquisitions of $1.4 billion.
The syndicated loan facility of $1.4 billion was refinanced 9 during the first half, reducing borrowing costs.
0 1 As a result of the Groups strong financial performance in 2004, the Board has declared a full year dividend of 16US per share, 2 bringing the total dividend for 2004 to 24US per share, an increase of 20% from the previous year.
This increase continues our 3 policy of progressively increasing the dividend and reflects our confidence in the outlook for Xstratas businesses in the medium term.
4 5 In the second half of 2004, we initiated the Equity Capital Management Programme which enables the purchase of up to 10% 6 of Xstratas issued shares in the market.
Through the programme, around 0.5% of Xstratas issued share capital was purchased, 7 returning $51 million to shareholders.
The programme has been suspended while Xstratas offer to shareholders of WMC Resources 8 remains open.
The programme remains an excellent option to improve balance sheet efficiency and enhance earnings in a tax 9 efficient manner without cancelling any shares.
40 41 This section of the CEOs report has been updated from the text issued at the announcement of preliminary results to reflect further developments in respect of Xstratas offer for WMC.
