This is due to the combined effect of a reduction in the discount rate due to falling corporate bond rates and increases in mortality assumptions following recent actuarial valuations.
We are making further special contributions to the schemes of approximately 13 million per annum.
We expect that this level of additional contribution should eliminate the deficit in the medium-term.
We will continue to monitor closely the funding position of the schemes.
In common with many companies, we continue to account for pension costs under SSAP24 and, consequently, our UK pension cost for the year was 10.7 million.
Under FRS 17 it would have been 9.2 million.
