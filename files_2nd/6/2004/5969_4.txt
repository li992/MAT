Impairment review In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, the Board has carried out an impairment review in respect of the compound semiconductor operation at Newton Aycliffe and in California, because of the operating loss being incurred.
The review was based on a series of forecasts of operating results and cash ows.
A discounted cash ow forecast calculation was prepared using a discount rate of 10%.
The discounted cash ow forecast was compared to the current carrying value of the assets concerned.
Sensitivity analysis was applied to the key underlying assumptions including the discount rate.
The most important assumptions are those related to the timing and extent of future sales, where changes in assumptions would result in material movements in the discounted cash ow calculation.
6 Filtronic plc Annual Report 2004 Financial Review In addition a series of performance milestones, operational, technical and market-related have been determined.
Progress in achieving these milestones is reviewed regularly to monitor developments, which are fundamental to the assumptions underlying the forecast operating results.
If some or all of these milestones were not to be achieved as expected, then the Board may nd it necessary to review and possibly change some of the assumptions used.
By their nature these assumptions are subjective, and contain significant levels of judgement related to operational and technical matters as well as to broader market issues.
Having taken all of these areas of judgement and their related assumptions into account, the Board has determined that no impairment has taken place.
