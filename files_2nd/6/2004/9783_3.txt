Where relevant, comparatives have been restated.
The reporting period for this financial year covers the 53 weeks to 3 April 2004, whereas the prior period covered the 52 weeks to 29 March 2003.
For comparative purposes, the commentary that follows, in so far as it relates to the profit and loss account, is provided on a 52 week basis to 27 March 2004 and 29 March 2003.

The performance of Clothing for the year as a whole was disappointing, with total Clothing sales down 0.5% on last year.
Womenswear, in particular, performed below expectations with a strong performance from per una and casualwear, held back by the performance in other areas.
Elsewhere, Lingerie and Menswear performed ahead of last year until the last quarter when sales were marginally lower.
Clothing market share for the year declined by 0.2 percentage points to 11.0%.
In Home, we are repositioning our offer and broadening our appeal to more customers.
A pilot Marks & Spencer Lifestore was opened in Gateshead in February and new product introduced down the chain.
Customers responded well to the Lifestore environment and were excited by the concept, but the product in some areas has been too contemporary and sales were down on last year.
A second Marks & Spencer Lifestore is due to open in Kingston in the summer followed by one in Thurrock, taking forward the learnings in environment, product appeal and price.
In Food, we maintained our market share over the year as a whole.
We out-performed the market in the first half of the year, but our like-for-like performance was not as strong in the second half in a competitive sector.
We continue to benefit from additional footage as we extend the reach of the Food offer.
We opened 49 Food stores during the year, of which 40 are Simply Food stores, 10 in partnership with Compass.
We remain on plan to open 500,000 sq ft of new food space by March 2006.
Like-for-like food ination for the year was c. 1%.
We are continuing to realise gains in our Clothing bought-in margin as a result of work on the supply chain and actions taken in previous years to increase overseas production and consolidate our supply base.
For the year as a whole, this delivered an improvement in the bought-in margin which was ahead of plan, helped by a weak dollar.
Total markdown 4 costs were marginally ahead of last year, offset by slightly lower shrinkage.
Overall, the full year Clothing gross margin was 1.5 percentage points ahead of last year.
We expect the bought-in margin in 2004 05 to be 0.75 percentage points ahead of this year, and remain on track to deliver a 3 percentage point improvement to the Clothing bought-in margin in the three years to 2005 06.
The Food gross margin for the full year was 0.5 percentage points ahead of the same period last year.
The improvements seen in Food waste in the first half were negated in the second half as a result of the weaker sales performance and, for the year as a whole, waste as a per cent to sales was in line with last year.
Logistics costs of 310m, which are included in cost of sales, were broadly in line with the same period last year.
The changes to the general merchandise logistics operation, which were announced at the end of last year, were completed during the first half of the year.
Ten distribution centres are now operated by two contractors, Exel and Christian Salvesen.
These new arrangements will generate ongoing annual savings of approximately 20m, of which 11.5m have been realised in the second half of the year.
Alongside the change of contractors, progress was made in acquiring the assets used in the distribution network.
We have purchased six warehouses, in addition to one we already owned, and agreed leases on three more, incurring capital expenditure of 78.1m.
UK Retail operating costs of 1,835m, excluding exceptional charges, increased by 1.2% over last year: employee costs decreased by 1.3% to 912.8m: within this, performance bonuses for management and store staff were down 29m on last year: property, repair and renewal costs of 323.6m decreased by 3.4%: depreciation was 227.3m, an increase of 4.4%: and other operating costs of 371.3m increased by 10.7%.
This was largely due to costs incurred in improving business efficiency in Retail Change and the supply chain and IT costs to support the growth initiatives of Simply Food, Home and Loyalty.
Including logistics costs, operating expenses have increased by 1.0% on last year.
Underlying UK Retail operating expenses, which exclude the incremental costs of the growth initiatives, were down 1.3%.

This represents a change from previously published guidance of 16m, as a landlord contribution has now been spread over the period to the first rent review in accordance with UITF 28 Operating Lease Incentives.
We have also provided 22.5m as an exceptional charge in connection with the Head Ofce restructuring programme which was announced prior to the year end.
This represents the anticipated redundancy costs for 500 people relating to the first phase of the programme.
The cost relating to the second phase of the programme will be provided for in 2004 05, again as an exceptional charge, once our plans are further developed.

Operating profit for the Marks & Spencer branded businesses increased by 19.8% to 41.8m.
In the Republic of Ireland, sales were ahead of last year and the performance of the three Simply Food stores opened during the year has been encouraging.
The franchise business and our stores in Hong Kong suffered in the first quarter from the effects of SARS and the war in Iraq.
However, following the end of the war and the removal of Hong Kong from the World Health Organisations list of affected areas, trading conditions improved.
More recently, trading conditions in Hong Kong have benefited from an increase in visitors from mainland China following a relaxation of border controls.
Turnover for the year at Kings Super Markets was 3.9% at constant exchange rates lower than the comparative period last year.
On a like-for-like basis, which excludes the two stores closed at the beginning of the year, turnover was down 1.4%.
The performance during the year was affected by local competition, a weak economy and uncertainty surrounding the disposal of the company, negotiations for which were terminated in August.
Since then we have brought in new management who have been working to develop the business and drive financial performance, and we have seen an improvement in the second half of the year, with turnover down 0.5% on a like-for-like basis first half down 2.3%.

The total impact of the launch on Money profit for the year was 58.6m.
Underlying profit was 89.5m and was impacted by the transfer of 300m of balances to the new &more card and the costs of running the enlarged cards business.
profit within Marks & Spencer Insurance, our Guernsey captive, increased by 5.8m to 19.7m, due to an improvement in the performance of underlying investments year-on-year and a release of insurance reserves of 4.2m.
In Personal Loans, our focus was on maintaining net interest margin in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
Also, during the critical period around the launch of the credit card, promotional activity was curtailed to avoid customer confusion.
As a direct consequence, new business reduced by 15%.
However, our earlier decision to concentrate on Marks & Spencer customers, who are lower risk than the industry average, has meant that credit losses were substantially reduced, increasing net income from Personal Loans by 14% year-on-year.
By the end of the year, the total amount of lending to customers had risen to 2.5bn, exceeding the previous peak of 2.3bn in 2001.
Within this total, balances on card accounts had reached 1.2bn, almost twice the level at the end of last year.
6 The bad debt charge as a percentage of total customer balances was 2.4% for the year which is similar to the rate charged last year.
Within the new credit card portfolio, levels of delinquency as well as bad debt and fraud losses to date were negligible.
Using experience based on the Chargecard, a provision of just under 1% of balances has been established.
As expected, the operating cost ratio climbed higher this year to reach a peak of 6.7% of average balances.
This ratio will now reduce as the rate of investment in new capability declines.
Within Savings and Protection, overall trading profit was down 1.3m, driven by a fall of 3.5m in Life income.
The launch in February of our new Mini Cash ISA product went well with new deposits of 325m by the end of the year.
Other Savings and Protection products performed well, with an 18% increase to 104m in gross unit trust retail investment, and a three-fold increase in the number of travel insurance policies sold.
Initial results from the motor insurance pilot were encouraging and the product was launched nationally in April 2004.
A series of new product and regional distribution trials are also planned which if successful will be rolled out during the year ahead.
Card and Loyalty Roll-out This year saw the successful delivery of the largest project ever undertaken by Marks & Spencer Money, with the launch of the &more credit and loyalty card, which was delivered on time and within budget.
Approximately 2.6 million Chargecard customers were given the option of converting to the &more credit card and of these, 1.7 million chose to accept the offer and activate the card.
Those choosing not to activate the credit card have been retained as Chargecard customers.
In addition, 380,000 new accounts were opened which was ahead of our expectations.
According to recent Mori data, Marks & Spencer was ranked equal first in terms of new accounts issued across the UK credit card industry for the first quarter of 2004.
At the end of March 2004, there were 2.1 million customers with an &more credit card account.
This makes us a top ten credit card operator from a standing start.
Within six months of launch, the average balance per account had reached 448, with the percentage of balances bearing interest standing at 77% which is in line with the industry average.
Initial data on the newly acquired customers, shows that they spend more in store than converted Chargecard customers.
Early results from the loyalty programme, although still in its infancy, indicate that customers are not only spending their loyalty vouchers but also increasing their spend.
Interest Net interest expense was 45.8m 44.5m on a 52 week basis compared to 40.5m for last year.
The average rate of interest on borrowings during the period was 5.3%.
Taxation The tax charge reects an effective tax rate for the full year of 30.1% before exceptional charges, compared to 28.7% last year.
The rate last year is lower due to the favourable resolution of a number of open prior year issues with the Inland Revenue.
In particular, the Revenue accepted that contributions to European subsidiary closure costs were tax deductible in the UK.
This one-off benefit resulted in a favourable adjustment which was reected in the effective tax rate for last year.
com Earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the effect of exceptional items, has increased by 6% to 24.7 pence per share 23.4 pence per share on a 52 week basis, an increase of 0.4%.
Dividend A final dividend of 7.1 pence per share last year 6.5 pence per share is proposed, making the total dividend for the year 11.5 pence per share last year 10.5 pence per share, an increase of 9.5%.
Capital expenditure Group capital additions for the year were 434m compared to 311m last year and our previously published guidance of 540m.
The major components of the additions are analysed below.

The decrease compared to previously published guidance is due to the timing of planned new developments and refurbishment of existing stores.
Group capital expenditure for 2004 05 is expected to be in the region of 400m.

Included within this are properties owned by the Group with a net book value of 2.2bn, of which 1.8bn was unencumbered.
As a result of the pending relocation of the Head Ofce, we have reviewed the carrying value of Michael House.
This review indicated that there was a shortfall in estimated recoverable value compared to book value as a result of current market conditions.
Accordingly, we have written down the carrying value and taken a 20m charge through the statement of total recognised gains and losses, as the property had previously been revalued.
Stock at the end of the year was 398.0m, an increase of 36.2m on the balance at the end of last year.
Approximately 10m of the increase is due to the move towards direct sourcing of merchandise which results in the Group taking ownership of the stock earlier in the supply chain.
Food stock also increased by 10m due to the increase in footage and the proximity of Easter to the year end.
The balance of the increase relates to Clothing and was a consequence of the weak sales performance in the fourth quarter.
Action has been taken to clear this stock in the early part of the new financial year, with an appropriate provision made in these results.
Customer advances net of provisions for bad debts have increased by 436.5m since last year due to the launch of the &more credit and loyalty card in October.
Other debtors decreased by 98.2m to 298.5m.
This reduction was driven by the receipt, shortly after last year end, of deferred proceeds from the sale of our business in France and by a decrease in the level of prepaid pension contributions for the UK dened benefit pension scheme.
Marks and Spencer Group plc Financial review continued Cash and investments at the end of the year were 720.6m, an increase of 248.7m on the balance at the end of last year.
This increase was largely driven by the receipt of cash ISA deposits shortly before the year end.
Creditors due within and after more than one year increased in aggregate by 883.4m.
This increase was largely due to an increase in gross borrowings of 413.9m, including 400m raised to fund an injection into the UK dened benefit pension scheme and a 360.7m increase in customer deposits mainly driven by the successful launch of the Mini Cash ISA.
Provisions for liabilities and charges decreased by 136.8m as we incurred further costs in connection with the closure of the European operations and the costs associated with rationalising the general merchandise logistics operation, which were provided for last year.
In addition, there was a significant decrease in the deferred tax liability as the 400m contribution to the UK pension scheme resulted in a deferred tax asset of 90m, representing the deductions from current tax that we expect to receive in future periods.
Cash ow Analysis of free cash ow operating cash ow before acquisitions and disposals and transactions with shareholders is as follows: 2003 2004 As restated Cash ow analysis m m Cash inow from Retail operating activities 602.3 848.8 Cash inow from Financial Services operating activities 64.2 319.9 Capital expenditure 428.8 324.5 Proceeds from asset disposals 126.2 25.0 Interest paid 49.8 46.2 Tax paid 220.4 216.9 Free cash ow 93.7 606.1 The Group generated an operating cash inow for the year of 666.5m last year 1,168.7m.
Within this, the cash inow from retailing activities was 602.3m last year 848.8m.
A major factor in the reduction in operating cash ow was the year-onyear net increase in contributions paid to the UK dened benefit pension scheme of 357m, being the one-off injection of 400m in March 2004, offset by a year-on-year reduction in regular contributions to the scheme.
This was partly compensated 8 for by an improvement in working capital.
The cash inow from Financial Services activities was 64.2m last year 319.9m.
Within this, the growth in customer cash ISA deposits, together with other favourable working capital movements, has more than compensated for the cash outow required to fund the growth in customer advances following the launch of the &more card.
During the period, the Group acquired tangible xed assets totalling 433.5m last year 311.0m.
After taking into account the timing of payments, the cash outow for capital expenditure was 428.8m last year 324.5m.
During the year, the Group received 126.2m last year 25.0m from the sale of properties.
Acquisitions and disposals include a net inow of 51.3m, being deferred proceeds following the sale of stores in France to Galeries Lafayette less agreed adjustments under the terms of the sale agreement.
The total movements in net debt comprise the amounts shown in the table below: 2003 2004 As restated m m Opening net debt 1,831.4 1,907.0 Free cash ow 93.7 606.1 Equity dividends 247.1 225.4 Net sale of xed asset investments 8.7 5.1 Sale closure of businesses 51.3 30.8 Issue of new shares under employee share schemes 24.8 19.6 Repurchase of own shares 54.4 141.7 Net purchase of own shares held by employee trusts 3.6 0.8 Redemption of B shares 33.4 158.0 Exchange and other movements 3.3 1.5 Closing net debt 1,994.7 1,831.4 At the end of the period, net debt was 1,994.7m, an increase of 163.3m, giving rise to retail gearing of 44.7% last year 53.0% including the net post-retirement liability.
Financing and capital structure In order to support the growth of Marks & Spencer Money, additional funding arrangements have been put in place.
During August, a three-year Syndicated Loan Facility of 1.25bn was signed which is used to provide surety and exibility of funding and provide further back-up for the existing Commercial Paper programme.
com The Medium Term Note MTN programme was renewed in September 2003.
Twenty-five new private MTNs were issued during the year by Marks and Spencer Financial Services plc with a Sterling equivalent of 544.1m and maturities ranging from one to five years.
The Groups total outstandings within this programme at the end of the financial year were equivalent to 2,196.5m last year 1,754.8m.
In March 2004, we raised 400m through a 10-year Public Bond Issue under the existing MTN programme at a xed rate of 5.625%, in order to fund a cash contribution into the UK dened benefit pension scheme.
Debt raised to fund the Financial Services operation is a mix of short to medium term instruments designed to match, on a portfolio basis, the income stream from its customers.
The balance of debt, raised to introduce a level of gearing into the retail balance sheet, has a range of maturity terms to reduce the repayment risk of the Group, the first being due in November 2006.
We currently have committed facilities of 405m available together with uncommitted bank facilities of 430m supporting our 1.5bn Commercial Paper programme.
Average interest rates on borrowings were lower during the year at 5.3% last year 5.8%.
Interest cover was 18.4 times and xed charge cover was 7.3 times.
During the financial year, 18,490,000 ordinary shares representing 0.8% of the weighted average issued share capital of Marks and Spencer Group plc were purchased in the market for a total cost of 52.9m, at a weighted average price of 286p.
On 25 September 2003 and 25 March 2004, 28,398,331 and 19,176,707 B shares respectively, were redeemed at par, at a total cost of 33.4m.
Following this redemption, 121,244,763 B shares remain in issue.
The next opportunity for redemption will be 27 September 2004.
Treasury policy and financial risk management The Board approves treasury policies and senior management directly control day-to-day operations.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the treasury committee, comprising two executive directors, one non-executive director, the Director of Corporate Finance and the Group Treasurer.
The treasury committee is empowered to take decisions, as necessary, within that delegated authority.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, 9 such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups Treasury also enters into derivatives transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and nancing.
It has been, and remains, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, liquidity, counterparty and the financial risks associated with the Financial Services operation.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk in respect of debt on the retail balance sheet is reviewed on a regular basis.
At the balance sheet date interest obligations in respect of the property securitisation and the two Public Bond issues in Sterling were at xed rates.
The current Group policy for debt raised to finance the operation of Financial Services see part e below, is to match the interest rate prole of customer balances and this is achieved with the help of interest rate swaps.
b Foreign currency risk Currency exposure arising from exports from the UK to overseas subsidiaries is managed by using forward currency contracts to hedge between 80% and 100% of sales for periods averaging 10 to 15 months forward.
Imports are primarily contracted in sterling and only economic exposures arise.
The Group is increasing the proportion of imports contracted in local currencies and a policy is in place for the hedging of these exposures, principally using forward currency contracts.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss account translation exposures.
Where appropriate, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
c Liquidity risk The objective is to ensure a mix of funding methods offering exibility and cost effectiveness to match the needs of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are nanced by a combination of retained profits, customer deposits, bank borrowings, commercial paper, medium term notes and securitised loan notes.
Commercial paper issuance and short term borrowings are backed by committed bank facilities totalling 1,655m.
d Counterparty risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by counterparties.
The risk is managed by using a number of banks and allocating each a credit limit according to credit rating criteria.
These limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
Dealing mandates and derivative agreements are agreed with the banks prior to deals being arranged.
Marks and Spencer Group plc Financial review continued e Financial Services Interest rate exposures for Financial Services are managed, as far as practical, by matching the periods of borrowings and their interest basis with that of the customer debt.
Interest rate swaps are used to convert xed rate income to oating rate income and oating rate borrowings to xed rate borrowings as applicable, to meet this purpose.
The details of derivatives and other financial instruments required by FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, are shown in notes 18, 21 and 23 to the financial statements.
Accounting changes Accounting for pensions At the end of last year, we reported that the FRS 17 valuation of the Groups UK dened benefit pension scheme showed a deficit of 1.2bn 0.9bn after deferred tax and announced that we would bring forward the next formal actuarial valuation of the scheme.
In March 2004, we announced the results of this valuation which showed a shortfall of 585m.
We have subsequently made a cash contribution of 400m to the scheme, demonstrating our commitment to ensuring that the scheme is adequately funded and providing reassurance to scheme members.
At the same time, we announced the adoption of accounting standard FRS 17 Retirement Benets for this financial year.
The impact of adopting FRS 17 on the profit and loss account charge for the UK scheme together with what the charge would have been under the previous policy based on SSAP 24, is as follows: Year ended Year ended 3 April 2004 29 March 2003 FRS 17 SSAP 24 FRS 17 SSAP 24 m m m m Operating cost 117 175 122 136 Other finance income charges 14 27 Net charge before tax 131 175 95 136 The FRS 17 charge for the year for the Group as a whole was 139.0m compared to a restated 104.8m last year.
As a 10 consequence of adopting FRS 17, a deficit of 470m net of deferred tax 670m before tax at 3 April 2004 is reected on the Groups balance sheet.
These changes have been accounted for by way of a prior year adjustment and previously reported gures have been restated accordingly.
The impact of adopting the new policy on the current financial year is to increase profit before tax by 43.2m.
The impact of adopting the policy on the year ended 29 March 2003 was to increase profit before tax by 41.6m.
The cumulative effect of this prior year adjustment on the balance sheet as at 29 March 2003 is an increase in the provision for retirement benets of 1,249.3m, offset by a deferred tax asset of 373.8m, a decrease in pension assets of 42.7m and a reduction in the deferred tax liability of 12.5m, giving rise to a decrease in reserves of 905.7m.
Other accounting changes The Group has also adopted Application Note G of FRS 5 Revenue Recognition and UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
Application Note G of FRS 5 requires a provision to be established for customer returns.
A provision has now been made, representing the Groups cumulative estimate of the amount of merchandise sold during the year which will be returned and refunded in the following year.
The new Application Note also requires turnover to be stated net of any discounts given.
Accordingly: staff discounts, previously reported as part of employee costs, have been reclassied and are now deducted from turnover: and discounts provided to certain customers at Kings Super Markets, previously reported as a deduction from gross margin, have been reclassied as deductions from turnover.
UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts has also been adopted for the first time this year.
As required by this UITF, own shares held by employee trusts have been reclassied from xed asset investments to a reduction in shareholders funds.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported gures have been restated accordingly.
The impact of adopting these new policies on the current financial year is to reduce turnover by 49.8m with a negligible impact on profit before tax.
The impact of adopting the policy on the year ended 29 March 2003 was to reduce turnover by 58.1m and profit before tax by 3.4m.
The cumulative effect of these prior year adjustments on the balance sheet as at 29 March 2003 is a decrease in xed asset investments of 1.8m, an increase in the provision for customer returns of 32.1m, offset by a deferred tax asset of 9.5m giving rise to a decrease in reserves of 24.4m.
com International Financial Reporting Standards It will become mandatory for all EU listed companies to report their consolidated financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS from 2005 onwards.
This will apply to the Group for its 31 March 2006 year end.
We have set up a programme to ensure compliance with IFRS is met.
We have identied that the greatest impact on the Group is likely to be changes in the accounting treatment for property, share-based payments, financial instruments and software capitalisation.
Outlook for 2004 05 The planned opening of new footage, plus the annualisation of footage opened in 2003 04, will add c. 2% sales contribution to Clothing and c. 5% to Food, on a weighted average basis.
We anticipate further improvements in the Clothing bought-in margin of approximately 0.75 percentage points.
We remain on track to deliver a total of 3 percentage points improvement to the Clothing bought-in margin in the three years to 2005 06.
UK retailing operating costs, including logistics, but excluding any accrual for performance-related bonuses, will increase by 5%.
The investment in new footage, including the annualisation of costs associated with footage opened in 2003 04, will account for over 4% of this increase.
If performance proves to be in line with business plans agreed by the Board, a bonus provision will be made.
Guidance, reporting the impact on operating costs, will be given at the appropriate time.
The revenue costs of the Head Ofce move to Paddington Basin will be c. 10m, compared to 19.6m incurred this year.
These costs will be treated as exceptional.
The Head Ofce restructuring programme, recently announced, will incur termination costs that will be treated as exceptional.
We have made a provision of 22.5m for the cost relating to the first phase of approximately 500 roles in the financial statements for 2003 04.
The cost relating to the second phase of the programme will be provided for in 2004 05.
The effect of the continued development of the &more credit and loyalty card business will be to reduce the impact of the credit card launch on Financial Services profits by c. 20m, from 58.6m this year to c. 40m in 2004 05.
The effective tax rate is estimated to be c. 31%, compared to a rate for 2003 04 of c. 30%.
11 FRS 17 has been adopted for the first time in this years financial statements.
We anticipate the charge to operating profit for the UK dened benefit scheme to be broadly similar to 2003 04 at c. 117m.
We estimate a net charge to interest relating to FRS 17 in 2004 05 of c. 10m, taking into account the funding cost of the 400m public issue.
Group capital expenditure for 2004 05 will be c. 400m.
Going concern statement After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
