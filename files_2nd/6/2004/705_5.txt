2 There is no goodwill amortisation under IFRS rather goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
3 Goodwill previously written off directly to reserves is not recycled to the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal.
4 Under IFRS deferred taxation on unremitted earnings of associated undertakings is provided where incremental tax would be due regardless of whether there is a commitment to remit the earnings.

6 Under IFRS the Group will continue to identify separately items referred to as exceptional items under UK GAAP where such a presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Groups performance.

Under UK GAAP deferred taxation is provided on timing differences, and initial recognition of pharmacy licences as a fair value adjustment does not create a timing difference.
A consequence of the Groups decision to take up the option not to restate prior business combinations before the IFRS opening balance sheet date 1 January 2004 is that this deferred taxation liability is adjusted through retained earnings rather than as an adjustment to capitalised goodwill.
The taxation will not be payable as long as the licences are not sold.
The reduction in total equity is a one off effect on IFRS transition and going forward the deferred taxation liability will be an adjustment to capitalised goodwill.
2 Deferred taxation on rolled over capital gains must be provided in full under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP provision is not necessary when there is no commitment to dispose of the asset.
3 Under IFRS, dividends are not provided for until the dividend recommended by the Board is approved by shareholders, and so the proposed 2004 final dividend recorded under UK GAAP is reversed.
