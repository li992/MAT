Westbury plc Annual Report 2004 37 2004 account 26-64 7 5 04 10:56 am Page 38 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT Introduction The Board recognises the importance of high standards of corporate behaviour and is committed to conducting the Groups operations in accordance with the best principles of corporate governance.
This Report together with the Remuneration Report on pages 31 to 37 describe how the Principles of Good Governance and the provisions of the Code of Best Practice identified in the Combined Code issued by the London Stock Exchange on 25 June 1998 are applied by the Company.
Following publication in January 2003 of the Higgs Review on Non-Executive Directors and the Smith Report on Audit Committees, the Combined Code was amended and a revised Code introduced for financial years beginning on or after 1 November 2003 the New Code.
The Board has reviewed the New Code and will take whatever steps it considers appropriate to comply with its requirements.
The Board believes there is already substantial compliance with the New Code and a number of disclosures which have been included in this Annual Report reflect its new and revised provisions.
The Board considers that during the year ended 29 February 2004, the Group complied with the requirements of the Combined Code except, as noted in the Remuneration Report, the Board does not consider it appropriate to adopt notice periods of one year or less for two executive directors who are relatively close to their normal retirement dates.
Board of Directors The business and management of the Company is the collective responsibility of the whole Board.
During the year ended 29 February 2004, the Board met formally as a whole nine times.
The Board reviews the trading performance of the business and annually in September undertakes a strategic review.
There is a schedule of matters reserved for consideration and approval by the Board which includes the annual budget, annual business plan, major land purchases, investment proposals, the approval of annual and interim results and a review of the overall system of internal control.
The Company Secretary is responsible for preparing the agenda for each Board Meeting and for ensuring that appropriate information is provided to the directors ahead of each meeting.
In addition, all of the directors have full and timely access to detailed information on the Groups operations, including management accounts and reports from the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and the Regional Boards.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Board has established a procedure for the directors to take independent professional advice, if necessary at the Companys expense, in the furtherance of their duties.
All new directors are provided with appropriate training, on appointment and subsequently, to undertake their duties as a director.
The Board currently comprises an independent non-executive Chairman, four executive and two independent non-executive directors.
Their biographies appears on page 25 and demonstrate the wide range of high level business experience which is necessary to manage and direct the Group.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate with a clear division of responsibilities, ensuring a balance of responsibility and authority at the head of the Company.
The senior independent non-executive director is D R Wilson.
It is the Groups intention to appoint a further independent non-executive director in the near future.
During the year, there were no absences from any Board Meetings or its Committees by any directors.
Each of the non-executive directors has at all times acted independently of management and has no relationship which would materially impact on the exercise of their independent judgement and decision making.
One third of the directors offer themselves for re-election each year at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Articles of Association.
In addition each director seeks re-election every three years in accordance with the Combined Code.
New directors appointed during the year offer themselves for re-appointment at the next Annual General Meeting.
Details of directors submitting themselves for re-election in 2004 are shown on page 29 in the Report of the Directors.
Each year the Board formally assesses its performance led by the Chairman of the Board.
The Company encourages its executive directors to take up non-executive positions with other public listed companies.
