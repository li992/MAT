Payment of this dividend, to shareholders registered on the Company share register on 27 May 2005, is expected on 8 July 2005.
In future, the Board will propose an annual dividend at the time of our preliminary results, taking into account the outlook for future earnings, free cash flow generation and the investment opportunities available to the Group to deliver further growth and shareholder value.
For 2005 the Board expects to maintain a dividend pay-out ratio similar to the 30% level provided for the 2004 dividend.
We expect then to move progressively towards a pay-out ratio of 40% in the medium-term.

2003 included an unusually large dividend from KAPCO.
Capital expenditure to maintain operating capacity of our power stations is at a very similar level to 2003.
Capital expenditure to increase our operating capacity amounted to 158 million comprising spend on Tihama, the Canunda wind farm and the West Field mine development at Hazelwood in Australia.
Acquisitions in 2004 include the purchase of the EME portfolio and Turbogs at 1,073 million of which 13 million of acquisition costs were outstanding at the year end and 135 million including costs of acquisition respectively.
Disposals include proceeds from the sale of a 4% holding in HUBCO.
The Rights Issue in contemplation of the Turbogs and EME acquisitions was completed in September with a 91.2% take up and raised net proceeds of 286 million.
Funding from minorities includes cash injections from partners towards the EME 26 portfolio acquisition, Tihama and Al Kamil.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Balance sheet A summarised, reclassified presentation of the Group balance sheet is set out below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 m m Fixed assets Intangibles and tangibles 3,656 2,049 Investments 1,251 536 Other long-term assets 581 3 Total fixed assets 5,488 2,588 Net current liabilities excluding short-term debt 150 93 Provisions and creditors due after more than one year excluding debt 537 243 Net debt 2,739 692 Net assets 2,062 1,560 Gearing 133% 44% Debt capitalisation 57% 31% Net assets at 31 December 2004 increased by 502 million to 2,062 million, as compared with 1,560 million as at 31 December 2003.
This comprises an increase in shareholders funds arising from the Rights Issue and retained profits for the year offset by a net loss arising on retranslation of our net investment in foreign entities.
Minority interests have also increased since 2003 as a result of the sale of the 35% shareholding in Al Kamil and the minority interest of 30% of our acquisition of EME and 25% of our acquisition of Turbogs.
The acquisitions of Turbogs and the EME assets have fundamentally changed the balance sheet of the Group, with fixed assets and investments almost doubling in size.
The acquisitions are highly leveraged due to the contracted nature of the assets acquired, causing debt capitalisation to rise to 57%.
Long-term assets mainly represent long-term receivables in respect of leased assets.
Net debt at 31 December 2004 has increased to 2,739 million from 692 million in 2003.
The increase in debt is principally due to the cost of the EME and Turbogs acquisitions, the construction of Tihama, together with 1,219 million of net debt on the balance sheets of the acquired subsidiaries.
Paiton, Indonesia Net debt and capital structure Group net debt at 31 December comprised: 2004 2003 m m Cash and liquid resources 612 743 Convertible bond 158 200 Secured bank loans 3,193 1,235 Net debt 2,739 692 The above net debt of 2,739 million excludes the Groups share of joint ventures and associates net debt of 1,452 million 2003: 712 million.
These obligations are generally secured by the assets of the respective joint venture or associate borrower and are not guaranteed by International Power plc or any other Group company.
In view of the significance of this amount, it has been disclosed separately.
The large year on year increase in net debt is principally due to the acquisition of the EME portfolio.
