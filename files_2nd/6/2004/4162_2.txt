com 11 Operating and financial review Market Positioning Urban regeneration is a huge market and one in which Crest now has the reputation, track record and skills to secure exciting opportunities which will deliver both sustainable communities and increasing shareholder returns.
Crest has moved decisively in recent years to position itself as a market leader in sustainable development and the urban regeneration partner of choice for the public and private sectors.
We apply our planning and management skills to create mixed use and mixed tenure developments in which current and future generations will want to live and work.
We have put innovative design, product quality and social awareness at the heart of our Chief Executive John Callcutt product offering and we have embraced the economic and social imperative of producing more affordable housing, particularly in the South East, with the result that we have more than doubled our production of affordable homes in 2004.
Trading Performance 2004 was a record year for Crest with pre-tax profits up 10% to a new high of 82.1m 2003: 74.6m.
Housing We increased the number of housing units sold by 30% to 2,524 2003: 1,936.
Open market units were up 11% at 1,812 2003: 1,628, which was a solid performance while the number of affordable units more than doubled to 712 units 2003: 308.
While, in 2006 and beyond, the number of affordable units is set to grow, fewer affordable units will be delivered in 2005 due to the lumpy nature of the affordable programme.

com Operating and financial review continued As previously announced, the average selling price fell to 210,000 as a result of the doubling of affordable unit volumes.
The average selling price of open market housing units was 5% lower at 244,000 2003: 258,000 due to both increased volumes from our South West and Midlands businesses and our planned move to the broader mid market sector.
In 2005, the average selling price will rise due to the temporary lull in affordable unit numbers noted above.
Our housing forward sales position at the year end was 4% up at 201m 2003: 193m.
Our current forward sales position is 265m 2003: 275m.
This is slightly down due to the large number of reservations taken on the successful launch of Bristol Harbourside in the prior year.
Land Sales As part of our strategy, we assemble large sites and create substantial land value as we bring them through the planning process and into development.
Crests strength in land buying and planning enables us to secure a dependable flow of planning permissions on significantly more land than we are able to develop.
Sale of land is, and will continue to be, an integral part of Crests method of operation not only to generate cash but also to allow us to adjust our portfolio to changing market conditions.
Housing land sales amounted to 45m, compared with 74m in 2003.
The 2003 comparative included the sale of sites in the South East which would have increased our exposure to the upper market sector.
Mixed Use Commercial Commercial property sales amounted to 69m, compared with 13m last year.
The increase reflects the flow of sales from the major mixed use schemes at Bristol Harbourside, Park Central, Birmingham and Riverside, Hemel Hempstead.
Our commercial forward sales position at the year end amounted to 109m 2003: 116m.
2004 was a record year for Crest with pre-tax profits up 10% to a new high of 82.1m 2003: 74.6m.

com 15 Operating and financial review continued Operating Margins The planned increase in affordable units and commercial sales, which have inherently lower risks and margins than open market housing, led, as expected, to a reduction in the overall group gross margin from 24.5% to 22.4%.
This was offset by a significant improvement in overhead efficiency to 7.6% 2003: 8.6% attributable to turnover gains and tight overhead control.
Overall operating margins were therefore 14.8% 2003: 15.9%.
Housing and Commercial Portfolios In 2004, we acquired 44 sites comprising 4,661 plots, with a projected development value of 883m.
The short term housing portfolio now stands at 15,060 plots 2003: 13,204 with a projected development value of 2.89bn 2003: 2.48bn, an increase of 16% over the twelve months.
At the current level of turnover, the portfolio represents over 5 years supply.
Our housing strategic land bank consists of 800 acres controlling 13,182 plots 2003: 13,236.
Our aim is to substantially replace greenfield sites with urban development opportunities.
Consequently, we expect the greenfield strategic land bank to reduce both in size and in proportion as it is consented and to be replaced with urban regeneration land.
The current commercial land portfolio covers over 100 acres for 1.8 million square feet of commercial space with a development value of 418m.
The majority of this relates to the mixed use schemes at Bristol Harbourside, Riverside in Hemel Hempstead, Park Central in Birmingham, Farnham and Chertsey North.
In addition we have 240 acres of strategic commercial land.
These housing and commercial statistics exclude the projects at Oakgrove in Milton Keynes, at Bath Western Riverside and in Camberley town centre which were agreed but not contracted at the year end.

The net assets attributable to the ordinary shares are equivalent to 260p per share compared to 224p per share at October 2003, an increase of 16%.
The Groups capital employed of 506.8m has increased by 139.1m and the return on average capital employed is 21.7% compared to 23.4% last year.
The increase in capital employed is due principally to a number of apartment blocks reaching build completion in the final quarter for which receipts are due in the first quarter of 2005.
The Group has a 225m five year Revolving Credit Facility from a syndicate of nine banks.
This, together with the 120m US Private Placement and overdraft facilities, means the Group has total borrowing facilities available of 352m.
Net borrowings at the year end were 178.4m 2003: 81.9m, representing gearing of 54% 2003: 29% which is in line with our normal gearing policy.
Average borrowings of 184.4m were similar to 2003 182.9m.
Net interest costs at 12.8m were at a similar level to 2003 but interest cover has improved to 7.4 times, compared with 6.9 times in 2003.

com 19 Operating and financial review continued Market Outlook In the second half of 2004 customers became more cautious following a succession of interest rate rises and the rate of house price inflation has abated.
However, the fundamentals of the market remain good: demand is supported by continued growth in the UK economy and by low unemployment.
Supply in the southern half of England, where we operate, is constrained by inflexibilities in the planning system and intervention by the public sector.
We believe this shortage will help underpin prices in the coming year.
While we expect to be operating in a less buoyant housing market, the quality of the housing land bank and the strength of our affordable and mixed use commercial businesses give us confidence that we can make further progress in 2005.
Our emphasis on sustainable development in the context of urban regeneration leaves us particularly well placed for the longer term.... the quality of the housing land bank and the strength of our affordable and mixed use commercial businesses give us confidence that we can make further progress in 2005.
