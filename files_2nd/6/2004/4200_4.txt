Financial review Trading We continued to make good progress in 2004, with reported sales from continuing operations up 4% at 291.1m.
It is important to note, however, that the weak dollar had a significant negative impact on our sales.
This is due to the fact that not only do we have a large business in the USA, but also a number of our products are priced worldwide in US dollars.
In constant currency terms our sales from continuing operations would have been up by 10% on the previous year.
Sales volumes in the Oleochemicals business were up 3% year on year.
With our continued shift to higher added value products and away from commodities in our Other businesses, volumes fell in that sector.
Overall for the Group, volumes were up 1%.
Operating margins reached a record high of 17.9% in the Oleochemicals sector, due to a combination of product mix changes and price increases, combined with the higher sales volumes.
Profits in the Other sector also rose, due primarily to price increases and improved product mix, along with the benefits of last years restructuring.
The discontinued operations shows the results up to disposal of our Fire Fighting Chemicals business, sold in January 2004, and our Australian rock anchor business, sold in July 2004 and the exceptional items represent the net loss on disposal of these discontinued operations.
Interest Our net interest expense appears high, given our gearing level.
This is due to the fact that our US dollar private placement debt is at a fixed rate of 7.37%.
Also, because of the wide geographical spread of our business, it is not always possible to match positive and negative cash balances between many countries.
Taxation The tax charge of 35.3% on pre-exceptional profits reflects the geographical spread of our businesses and no significant change in the charge is expected in the current year.
The actual tax charge is slightly higher at 36.5% as no tax relief is available on some of the exceptional losses.
Dividends With strong growth in earnings and good cash generation, we are able to increase the total dividend payment by more than inflation, whilst at the same time increasing dividend cover on a pre-exceptional basis.
Accordingly, it is proposed the final dividend is increased by 7% to 8.4p, making a total of 12.5p 2003 : 11.85p.
At this level, dividend cover is raised to 1.8 times from 1.6 times in 2003.
Barbara Richmond Group Finance Director, President Active Ingredients and Industrial Chemicals Cash Dividends per share With the good trading performance I mentioned earlier and control of working capital, we generated 12.9m of cash in 2004.
00 01 Capital expenditure rose to 14.9m 2003 : 12.3m which was approximately in line 02 with depreciation of 14.4m 2003 : 14.6m.
03 04 We began buying shares back into treasury towards the end of 2004.
We believe this 10 12 13 Pence 11 is a flexible and efficient way for us to improve our cost of capital, whilst at the same time maintaining our financial capacity to undertake appropriate acquisitions, which will deliver shareholder value.
Earnings per share pre-exceptional Treasury policy 00 The Groups treasury policies are approved by the Board and subject to regular 01 reporting and review.
02 03 The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to currency, interest rates and the availability of capital.
04 10 Pence 15 20 25 As far as currency risk is concerned, transaction risk is hedged up to three months forward by the use of foreign currency bank balances and forward currency contracts.
Return on capital employed pre-exceptional Translation currency exposure is not hedged but the risk is reduced by matching interest expense to foreign currency earnings where it is efficient to do so.
00 01 In terms of interest rate risk, the policy is to maintain at least half of the Groups gross 02 borrowings at floating interest rates, with interest rate swaps being used where appropriate.
03 On 1 December 2003 the UK regulations on the market purchase and holding of a 04 10 15 20 25 % companys own shares Treasury Shares were amended to enable companies to achieve more flexibility on their levels of debt and equity and thus their cost of capital.
These changes give us an additional means of managing our balance sheet, if and when Net debt considered appropriate by your Board.
00 IFRS 01 As many of you will already be aware, we will be required to produce our accounts in 02 accordance with International Accountancy Standards IAS and IFRS from 2005.
The first 03 set of results reported under these standards will be the interim results for the six months to 30 June 2005.
However, in order for shareholders and other readers of the 04 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 m accounts to become familiar with the impact of this change, we intend to publish on our website www.
com, during the course of the second quarter of 2005, a profit and loss account and balance sheet for 2004, restated to international standards, together with an explanation of the main differences from the reported results in these accounts.
Financial review 15 Financial review Along with many companies, the adoption of international standards will principally impact our accounts in three areas: Pensions Goodwill Share based payments There will also be some impact from the standards on financial instruments and deferred tax but these are expected to be small.
Overall, we estimate the principal effect of the new standards will be on the balance sheet.
This is due to the major change caused by the switch from SSAP 24 to IAS 19, which is similar to FRS 17.
The effect of this on our UK pension schemes, as in previous reports, is detailed below.
Pensions The table below summarises the UK pension position of the Group at 31 December 2004 under the current standard, SSAP 24, under FRS 17 IAS 19 and as calculated at the latest actuarial valuation.
This is because, whilst there has been some further recovery in equity markets, the rate at which liabilities are discounted has also fallen.
As I have reported previously, it is the actuarial position which forms the basis of our long term funding decisions and not the accounting year end snapshot.
Below is a table showing the charge to the profit and loss account for our UK schemes under the two accounting standards, together with an estimate of the 2005 expense.
As you can see, our profit would have increased by 0.3m if we had applied FRS 17 in 2004 in respect of our UK schemes.
