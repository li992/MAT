P&O Annual Report 2004 15 Operating and financial review Other activities Adding value Reallocating capital Within our other activities we achieved two major strategic objectives.
At the start of 2004 we set a target of 250 million net property sales.
Our property teams exceeded this goal by over 120 million with disposals completed in Germany, Australia, the US, Spain and the UK.
A similar net sales target has been set for 2005 with over 150 million achieved by March 2005.
This includes the disposal of part of Regent Quarter, our mixed use scheme, in Kings Cross, London.
Achieving objectives We also achieved another key strategic objective of taking capital out of Container Shipping.
On 16 April 2004, P&O Nedlloyd effectively became an independently listed company, Royal P&O Nedlloyd N. V. on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Euronext.
P&O sold its previous 50% share of P&O Nedlloyd to Royal P&O Nedlloyd, in which it now holds a 25% interest.

Whilst none of our operations were directly affected, many of our staff have been touched by this tragedy.
Our local operations and contacts in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and Indonesia were able to provide immediate practical and financial assistance through donating food, clothes and medicines and supplying shelter and transport.
This was later supported by a Group donation of 200,000 channelled via our ports in the region.
Reducing ship emissions In 2003, P&O and BP Marine embarked on an ambitious project with the potential to reduce ships exhaust emissions dramatically.
At the beginning of 2004 we trialled a new technology, the Eco-Silencer, on board the Pride of Kent.
The technology uses seawater to scrub out harmful emissions from the funnel before they are released into the atmosphere.
The tests have proven the viability of exhaust gas scrubbing and we look forward to further developments next year.
Even without the Eco-Silencer fully optimised, the system is delivering a high percentage of reductions in exhaust emissions.
