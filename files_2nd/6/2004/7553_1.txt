0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 05 Company and financial review Dear fellow investor, Despite making good progress over the past four years, 2004 was a year of underperformance.
The Group made a pre-exceptional profit of 58.9m, but this was not as much as we could or should have made, nor as much as we had predicted at the beginning of the year.
Howden Joinery recorded another strong set of results.
However our performance in UK Retail was severely impacted by a weak promotional strategy and a slowdown in new product introduction in the first half of the year, combined with issues surrounding the new supply chain systems in the second half of the year.
We are making progress in addressing these issues and 2005 is intended to be a year of stabilisation and recovery in UK Retail with further growth in Howden Joinery.
Taking account of exceptional costs of 31.9m see section below and a loss on disposal of xed assets of 2.0m, the profit before tax was 25.0m 2003 117.9m with turnover up 2.2% to 1,515m 2003 1,482m.
Supply chain systems The introduction of the new supply chain system in 2004 was essential, as the systems that we had been using were not capable of supporting the growth and development of the business.
The existing systems had not been designed to accommodate the complex requirements of home delivery in UK Retail or the range of products now sold as part of our every room in the house strategy.
A new system was needed to support substantial growth in Howden Joinery and the internationalisation of the Group, both in terms of customers and suppliers.
The new system was intended to enable the management of each route to market to focus on the appropriate supply chain strategy for their specic business, through a better alignment of the supply chain to meet its customers needs.
So last March we introduced significant technical change new hardware, software and processing architecture designed to provide new inventory management systems to link our factories, third-party suppliers, primary and secondary warehouses and customers.
The intention was to have clear visibility of our stock along the supply chain, thus enabling accurate first-time deliveries to the customer at the time of their choice.
Although we were reassured that the expected initial teething problems of a new system would be remedied by the summer, it became apparent during September that the problems were far worse and were causing significant disruption to the home delivery service to our customers.
For the balance of the year these issues have been highly diversionary, and the associated recovery costs and customer refunds have substantially reduced our profits.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 06 Things always seem worse in the middle of a crisis than they are when you look at the big picture.
Overall we are in a far better place than we were five years ago.
Our results this year have been disappointing.
However we still remain committed to our vision To help more people live better lives in their homes.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 06 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 07 In September 2004, we undertook a thorough root cause analysis of the problems in the supply chain.
This revealed significant technical problems.
Subsequent actions focused on: 01 securing Howden Joinery for its peak autumn trading season: 02 stabilising UK Retail for the 2005 Winter Sale: 03 re-establishing customer service levels: 04 improving stock availability: 05 increasing the effectiveness of home delivery and fullling incomplete orders: and 06 rectifying and optimising system performance.
We have made progress in all these key areas.
Since September we have improved interfaces with supplier systems, increased data processing capacity, rewritten critical software components and concentrated on stock planning and data quality.
Although the system remains fragile, the performance during the 2005 UK Retail Winter Sale has given the Board increasing confidence that the supply chain systems are stabilising.
The real test will be satisfactorily handling a high level of home deliveries through to the end of the first half of 2005.
Though we are still not using the system to its fullest, as it continues having to work with legacy systems, we believe that it eventually can deliver customer service levels better than those achieved before implementation.
In the medium term we will make further investment in these systems and remove the old legacy systems: this should provide a fundamental building block to improve the net operating margin of the retail business to a reasonable and sustainable level.
UK Retail The impact of the technical problems with the new inventory management system was magnied in the UK Retail supply chain, which is highly complex with home deliveries.
An average kitchen involves up to two hundred separate items being delivered into the customers home in one drop.
Rectifying problems for individual customers can be very expensive which means that good customer service costs less than bad customer service.
Our first half performance also suffered from a weak promotional strategy, as well as a slowdown in new product introductions particularly in beds and bedrooms as we completed the rollout of the store refurbishment programme.
The combination of these issues resulted in the division incurring a loss of 46.0m, compared to a profit of 41.7m in 2003.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 07 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 08 So what went wrong with the implementation of our supply chain system?
Our investigations have revealed both technical and business process problems.
Not insurmountable but critical to getting the best out of our new system.
Because of the complexity of our supply chain these problems hit us severely.
While we have worked hard to x these problems our main focus above and beyond anything else has been about improving customer service.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 08 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 09 New product introduction was accelerated in the second half of the year with a focus on lower priced ranges, particularly around the 500 price level.
Seven new kitchen ranges, nine new ranges of bedrooms, 15 sofas, seven beds and four bathrooms were introduced.
We have closed the gaps in our bed and bedroom ranges, and performance is improving.
In 2005, the performance of Hygena kitchens will likewise benefit from lower-end product introductions.
We also increased our advertising spend in the second half to restore our traditional price value offer with our promotions proposition more home for your money.
By the end of the year, independent market research on like-for-like price comparisons showed that our products are now highly price-competitive.
We have also made commercial and operational management changes to enable us to get closer to the customer and be able to make faster and better decisions.
In 2004, gross new customer orders were down 3% by value on 2003, but net orders were down by 7%.
The difference between gross orders and net orders reects a 36m increase in the level of refunds to customers for missed and late deliveries compared to 2003, primarily due to the supply chain system problems described earlier.
This level of refunds is expected to reduce during 2005 as the supply chain system issues are resolved.
The table below shows the opening customer order book for UK Retail, the net orders received in the period gross customer orders less the value of customer refunds in the period, deliveries the point at which an order is recorded as a sale and the closing order book position.
Total orders First half Second half Cumulative weeks 52-24 weeks 25-52 weeks 52-52 excluding VAT m m m 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 Opening order book 34 26 90 99 34 26 Net orders 526 490 377 347 903 837 Deliveries 470 417 441 408 911 825 Closing order book 90 99 26 38 26 38 A sale is only recorded as income when the delivery is made to the customer.
Orders that were delayed by the supply chain issues have been carried over from 2004 into 2005, resulting in sales of 825m being 9% down on the year, compared to a 7% fall in net orders.
The 12m year on year increase in the closing order book is expected to reverse in 2005.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 09 We believe that our new supply chain systems have the potential to make a big improvement in our service to customers and in our ability to make better business decisions both at Board level and throughout the business.
Delivering the orders taken during the 2005 Winter Sale will be a testing ground for the new systems performance.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 10 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 11 Gross margin in 2004 was adversely affected by the impact of the increased level of refunds to customers and by the decision at the end of the first half to sharpen pricing.
Any improvement in the level of refunds in the first half of 2005 as a result of supply chain improvements is likely to be offset by product mix changes, increases in raw material costs and maintenance of our value pricing proposition.
In 2004, we spent 13m 2003 19m on store refurbishments, relocations and new stores.
We estimate the profit impact of the resulting store disruption to be about 9m, compared to 19m in 2003.
A net 24 stores were opened in the new format in 2004 18 refurbishments and seven new and relocated stores, minus one closure.
This means that 146 out of 195 out-of-town stores were in the new format at the year-end, representing over 80% of out-of-town store orders.
Of these stores 80 have been fully retted, 23 have received a partial ret and 43 have received the new partial ret.
Our investment in 2005 will be lower, as we have effectively completed the refurbishment programme.
The remaining unconverted stores will be relocated over time, with ten relocations planned in 2005.
We estimate disruption costs in 2005 to be 5m and this reduction, compared to the 9m cost in 2004, has been included in our 40m savings plan.
We are also currently testing three new, smaller-store formats.
As announced in December 2004, UK Retail is targeting financial improvements in 2005 both from the reversal of the effects of the supply chain disruption in 2004 and from the implementation of 40m of specic cost saving measures.
Actions have been taken in each of the areas detailed in December and progress is in line with managements plans.
Actions are also in place to eliminate the exceptional operating costs relating to the supply chain disruption and to reduce the level of refunds paid to customers as a result of poor service.
But we also anticipate some 47m of cost increases in 2005.
These include some 12m relating to rent and rates increases, 13m more for pensions and an extra 8m cost as part of the supply chain stabilisation and improvement activities.
The balance of 14m relates to working time directive and other logistics costs, regulations regarding electrical appliance recycling, depreciation and other central costs.
In February 2005 we were pleased to announce the launch of a partnership with Tesco and are now accepting Tesco Clubcard in our stores.
Tesco has ten million Clubcard holders.
We are the only furniture retailer associated with Tesco Clubcard and we plan to use this partnership to generate new customer orders, increase average order values and increase spend.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 11 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 12 On a brighter note new product ranges introduced during the year such as bedrooms and beds are selling well.
Therell be many more new products coming into our stores during 2005.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 12 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 13 Hygena Cuisines Although Hygena Cuisines uses the same inventory system as the UK Retail operation and was also affected by out-of-stock problems, particularly in the second half, it has a fundamentally different distribution system where customer collection largely replaces home delivery.
This, together with our continuing investment in store refurbishment, resulted in the business making a modest profit of 1.6m in 2004 following a break-even performance in 2003.
Sales, at 119m, were up 4.6% on last year, with same store growth up by 4.5% in local currency.
During the year we added 17 new format stores 13 rets and four new stores to the 68 that were open at the beginning of the year, making a total of 85 out of a chain of 139.
Although only 60% of the showrooms are in the new format, orders from these showrooms accounted for over 70% of our total orders in 2004.
Howden Joinery Howden Joinery continues to go from strength to strength, with operating profits of 105.0m, up 45.8% on the 72.0m made in 2003.
This is a trade-only business and was less affected by the supply chain pressures than the retail business for two main reasons.
First, it is a much simpler operation with a reduced number of stock lines compared to UK Retail, a greater proportion of which are manufactured in-house.
This enables us to take faster action to minimise disruption.
Secondly, it is a fully stocked operation with the customer picking up the product from the depot.
When the builder goes to the Howden depot, he buys what he wants there and then.
There is no ordering, no home delivery and the depot does not rely on a just-in-time process.
Howdens peak trading month is October and contingencies were put in place to ensure that this was protected from the wider supply chain problems.
Howden Joinery in the UK had 320 depots open at the year-end, an increase of 20 units in the year.
Sales, at 559m, were up 25% and same depot sales were 19% higher.
Net operating margin, at 18.8%, has improved 2003 16.1% with the business able to sustain a selling price increase in 2003, combined with the benefit of a maturing depot portfolio and a lower number of new depot openings.
The Board sees potential for a chain of up to 480 depots in the UK.
This is in line with the footprints of other national builders merchant chains in the UK.
Therefore, in 2005 and 2006, we will invest in a faster rate of new openings than in 2004, with up to 40 new depots each year.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 13 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 14 Another year another outstanding performance by Howdens.
Because of the relative simplicity of the Howdens model where home delivery is not involved the supply chain was not such a big issue.
We saw record growth and continued new depot openings.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 14 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 15 As a consequence, we expect the operating margin to fall slightly in 2005, since depots traditionally lose money in their first 18 months of trading.
Howden Joinery is continuing to develop and update its kitchen product with nine new ranges, higher specication appliances and functionally enhanced accessories added during the year in line with customer demand.
The bathroom pilot, tested during 2004 in six depots, has been discontinued.
Howden International During the year we moved to the next phase of our Howden Millwork pilot in the United States, testing both pricing and demand for new ranges of kitchens made to US specications.
This will help validate whether the business can provide acceptable levels of return.
There has been an encouraging start to sales of the new kitchens, which were introduced in the late autumn.
They will continue to be tested during the first half of 2005.
The Howden Millwork pilot continues to perform in line with expectations.
Losses in the year were 8.6m 2003 8.4m loss and we expect a similar level of loss in 2005.
In France, we opened pilot Howden depots in Paris and Lille in February 2005.
Plans are in place to open a further ten depots and, subject to these openings, we expect to incur losses of up to 4m in 2005.
This demonstrates our commitment to test the Howden business model internationally.
Asia We have two small joint ventures in Asia, where our strategy is to invest in low risk ways to experiment and learn about different markets and different approaches to trading.
The sourcing joint venture in China was established in September 2003 to obtain a cheaper source of products.
During 2004 we bought 5m of goods from the venture, but shipments in December alone were equivalent to those for the rest of the year.
Purchases from China are expected to increase markedly during 2005.
The products supplied from China provide a significant margin benefit to the Groups business units.
Some benefit is retained in the joint venture which broke even in the year and is expected to generate an operating profit in 2005.
We also have a retail joint venture in Taiwan where we opened one new store, bringing the total to 14 trading at the year-end.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 15 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 16 The upgrade of Hygena Cuisines in France is now largely complete.
We are seeing promising results.
Our sourcing joint venture in China is beginning to produce worthwhile savings.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 16 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 17 Exceptional costs The Board has reviewed the carrying value of the investment in the new system by looking at its future discounted cash ow benets.
This resulted in a 10.3m write down of assets previously capitalised.
A further 9.7m of system costs have been directly expensed in 2004, making a total exceptional charge of 20.0m for our systems.
We have incurred 17.1m in costs for extra deliveries and installation, technical supply chain rectification work and additional call centre support.
In addition we spent 2.3m on redundancy costs arising from the commercial and operational restructuring of the UK Retail business.
These costs have been partially offset by a net credit in respect of share scheme amortisation, comprising a release of 9.1m in respect of previous years amortisation on share schemes that are no longer expected to vest and a current year charge of 3.2m in respect of schemes which are expected to vest.
In addition there is a net release of related national insurance of 1.6m.
These total a net exceptional operating cost of 11.9m.
HM Customs & Excise claim We continue to contest vigorously HM Customs & Excises challenge to the Companys VAT treatment for structural guarantees.
The maximum potential exposure is 60.5m and this has been paid to HM Customs & Excise.
We would expect this to be offset by the recovery of 15.3m of insurance premium tax paid on the sale of extended structural guarantees if our claim was not to succeed.
In May we changed the insurance product and no longer give a discount on the furniture if the customer chooses to purchase the revised product.
We are carrying the tax paid of 60.5m on our balance sheet as a debtor without any provision.
Pensions MFI operates two funded schemes which provide benets based on the final pensionable pay of participating employees.
The last triennial full actuarial valuations of these schemes were as at 6 April 2002 and the next such valuations are due as at 6 April 2005.
Interim valuations have been undertaken at each financial year-end for the purposes of disclosure under FRS 17.
Pension costs charged to the profit and loss account in 2005 under FRS 17 are estimated at 34m, compared to the SSAP 24 charge in 2004 of 16m.
The charge is broadly split two-thirds to UK Retail and one-third to Howden Joinery.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 17 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 18 Its been a tough year for us but its at times like this that the character and spirit of the Company is most tested.
Were so proud of how our people have responded to difficult and frustrating times.
We thank our people for being so exceptional and showing great commitment.
Perhaps that reects one of the most important things that has changed over the last five years.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 18 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 19 The FRS 17 valuation as at December 2004 showed a deficit of 295m 206m net of deferred tax.
This includes additional pension obligations in respect of the equalisation of normal retirement dates of approximately 50m before tax calculated on an FRS 17 basis, after the previous FRS 17 valuation as at December 2003 had been prepared, and on assumptions used by the Company at the time which were subsequently identied and announced to the market in May 2004.
The Board continues to take advice as to the actions required to obtain recovery from third parties in relation to these additional obligations.
On 14 March 2005 a 12m settlement was agreed with one of the parties on whose advice the Group and the trustees of the plan relied.
In the context of the triennial valuations, MFI will be discussing with the pension scheme trustees ways of addressing the deficit and establishing the future level of contributions.
In the meantime the Company and the trustees have agreed an additional interim funding rate of 20m per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.
As a result, our expectations are that the cash contribution to the scheme in 2005 will be in the order of 35m compared to 15m in 2004.
The actual level of cash contributions going forward into 2006 will be determined after the results of the April 2005 triennial full valuations are known, which is expected to be during the second half of 2005.
Taxation The effective tax rate for the Group before exceptional items is 41% for 2004, compared to 30% in 2003.
The rate is higher as the Group has a relatively xed level of disallowable expenditure for tax purposes, which represents a higher percentage of the reduced profit in 2004.
The effective rate of tax on profit before tax is 58%.
The tax rate in 2003 and 2002 benefited from the release of provisions held against open items with the Inland Revenue which were favourably resolved during the period.
We estimate that the effective rate of tax will fall to a rate closer to 36% in 2005.
Dividends The Board has proposed a final dividend of 2.0p per share 2003 2.0p to be paid on 10 June 2005 to shareholders on the register at 27 May 2005.
The shares will be quoted ex-dividend from 25 May 2005.
This brings a total dividend for the year to 4.0p per share 2003 3.8p, an increase of 5.3% over the previous year.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 19 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 20 Treasury Treasury operations are managed within policies and procedures approved by the Board.
The Group treasury function reports regularly to a Treasury Committee of the Board.
The major financial risks, to which the Group is exposed, relate to movements in exchange rates and cash management.
Where appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments to manage these risks.
No speculative use of derivatives, currency or other instruments is permitted.
The Treasury function does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
Liquidity and funding The Group had net borrowings of 71.6m 2003 1.2m at the year-end: this shows a reduction of net cash of 70.4m during the year, but is struck after lodging a further 14.5m with HM Customs & Excise for the disputed VAT on our structural guarantee product and an additional exceptional cash cost of 28.1m relating primarily to the supply chain system.
In addition the Group held 9.4m 2003 11.8m on short-term deposit, held in escrow for future insurance claims.
The Group has a 185m revolving credit facility with six major relationship banks.
This was drawn down 100m at the year-end and, as at the year-end, has a 4.25 year maturity period to March 2009.
Cash management Group Treasury policy on investment restricts counterparties to those with a minimum Standard and Poors Moodys long term credit rating of AA and a short term credit rating of A1 P1.
Investments mainly consist of bank deposits and certicates of deposit.
The Group regularly reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the limits placed on individual credit exposures and categories of investments.
Currency risk management Currency movements can affect the Groups reported profit.
The Group has a policy of hedging most of its foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange purchase contracts.
As at 25 December 2004, approximately 75% of the 2005 foreign exchange purchase requirements had been protected.
MFI ANNUAL REPORT 2004 20 0145 MFI 02-21 Annual report 2004 tp 4 4 05 9:03 pm Page 21 Accounting standards In June 2002, the European Union EU approved a regulation that will require all listed EU companies to prepare consolidated statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The regulation applies to all accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
MFIs accounting period ended on 25 December 2004 and, as a result, the first accounting period for which the Group will prepare accounts under IFRS will be the financial year 2006.
We are prevented by the Companies Act from adopting these standards in 2005.
The Group continues its preparation for IFRS and will give further guidance on the accounting impact in due course.
The key areas likely to affect MFI are as follows: 01 Property leases 05 Deferred taxation 02 Share-based payments 06 Dividends 03 Foreign exchange hedging 07 Pensions 04 Intangible assets And nally The problems of the past year have had a significant impact, in their different ways, on our customers, suppliers and shareholders.
But they have also placed a tremendous pressure on our staff from the stores and call centres, to the supply chain, manufacturing and systems support areas.
We have large numbers of staff who have been with us a long time.
During the year there have been extraordinary stories of people who have gone way beyond the call of duty to get their job done, to help their colleagues and to serve our customers as best they could in difficult circumstances.
We would like to express our thanks to everyone in MFI for their efforts.
Gordon MacDonald and Martin Clifford-King resigned from the Board during the year.
Both Gordon and Martin made valuable contributions to the growth of MFI over the last few years for which we thank them.
Mark Robson is expected to join the Board in April as Chief Financial Officer.
He brings a wealth of hands-on experience and will play an important role in the business going forward.
