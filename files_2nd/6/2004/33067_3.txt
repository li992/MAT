27 BUSINESS OVERVIEW Smith & Nephews operations are organised into three core business units that operate globally: orthopaedics, endoscopy and advanced wound management.
These three businesses comprise the Groups Continuing Operations.
Smith & Nephew believes that its businesses have the opportunities for strong growth due to its markets benefiting from an ageing population, an increase in active lifestyles and trends toward less invasive medicalprocedures.

This is calculated by excluding the effects of foreign currency translation movements and acquisitions see Note 2b of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
Management believes that sales growth on an underlying basis provides a consistent year-on-year measurement of performance without the distortions created by the translational effect of foreign currency movements and acquisitions which are separate from the Groups normal operations.
Underlying sales growth is used bymanagementinits , budgetingandplanning.

Smith & Nephew operates predominantly in the well-developed healthcare markets of the US 49% of group turnover, Europe 33% of group turnover and Japan and Australia 9% of group turnover.
These markets are characterised by an increase in the average age of the population caused by the immediate post-World War II baby boomer generation approaching retirement, increased longevity, more active lifestyles, obesity and increased affluence.
Together these factors have created significant demand for more effective 29 healthcare products which deliver improved outcomes through technology advances.
Furthermore, pressure to resist increases in overall healthcare spending has led healthcare providers to demand products which minimise the  .
A recent trend has been increasing consumer awareness of available healthcare treatments through the Internet and direct-to-customer advertising.
This has led to increased consumer influence over product purchasing decisions.
In orthopaedics, improvements in technology have lengthened the effective life of reconstructive implants and have facilitated the implantation of knees and hips in relatively young patients thereby improving the quality of life for a new generation.
The decision to create separate divisions for reconstructive, trauma and clinical therapy products was a strategic move intended to generate greater customer focus.
With experienced managers responsible for sales, marketing and product development in each, management believes that divisionalisation has resulted inincreasedsales momentumforSmith& Nephewintraumainthe US.
The endoscopy business is benefiting from the continued trend worldwide towards less invasive surgery with particular focus on arthrosopic repair of the knee and shoulder using a broad range of technology.
The Group also expects to benefit from the demand for less invasive approaches to spinal disc repair and arthroscopic hip repair.
The advanced wound management business is focused on the treatment of chronic wounds of the older population and other hard-to-heal wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, burns and certain surgical wounds and is therefore also expected to benefit from demographic trends.
The market for advanced wound treatments is relatively unpenetrated and it is estimated that the potential market is significantly larger than the current market.
This increased penetration is expected to be driven by improved outcomes from new technology, health economic benefits, increasing nursing shortages, quality of life expectations and education of healthcare  treatments.
In order to take advantage of the expanding markets the Group must continually develop its existing and new technologies and bring new products to its customers.
Expenditure on research and development in 2004 represented approximately 5% of Group turnover and products launched within the last three years represented 20% ofGroupturnover.
Sales Force The Groups sales force, which includes independent commissioned sales agents, increased by 9% during 2004.
The biggest increase was 22% in orthopaedics where the most significant increase was in the US.
The size of the endoscopy sales force increased by 3% to 655.
The advanced wound management sales force increased by 3% to905.
Currency Movements Smith & Nephews results of operations are significantly affected by exchange rate movements.
A substantial proportion of its sales and operating expenses are earned and paid in currencies other than Sterling, the Groups reporting currency.
Accordingly, the Group is subject to exposure arising from the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries into Sterling for financial reporting purposes.
The Group is also subject to exposures arising from sales made in a currency different from the related costs and expenses.
The Group attempts to manage the impact of exchange rate movements on cost of sales by a policy of purchasing forward all its foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed.
In addition, businesses are required to purchase forward a minimum of 50% of their forecast foreign currency requirements on a twelve-month rolling basis.
The Group also incurs interest in currencies other than Sterling on its indebtedness denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
To the extent that other currencies, particularly the US Dollar and Euro, decline in value against Sterling, Smith & Nephews turnover, operating profit and effective cost of sales may be adversely affected, this would be offset by a reduction in the effective cost of servicing debt.

Other Management is not aware of any governmental, economic, fiscal, monetary or political policies or factors that have materiallyaffected, directlyorindirectly, the  byshareholders.
30 Critical Accounting Policies The Groups significant accounting policies are set out in Note 1 of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
Of those, the  most use ofmanagements judgment are as follows: Stocks A feature of the orthopaedic business whose finished goods stock makes up 64% of the Group total finished goods stock is the high level of product stock required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use.
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product lifecycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic stock to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of stock compared with historical or forecast usage.
This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years.
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience, but it does involve management judgements on effectiveness of stock deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old .
Intangible Fixed Assets In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill and other intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ or changes in expectations arise   .
Post-Retirement Benefits The cost of the Groups defined benefit pension plans are charged to operating profit, so as to spread the expense of providing future pensions to employees over their remaining working lives with the Group, in accordance with SSAP 24.
In this way, actuarial variations are charged or credited to operating profit over periods of ten to thirteen years.
The principal assumptions used in calculating pension costs are set out in Note 33 of the Notes to the Group Accounts with the most critical being the return on investments and increase in pensionable earnings for the UK and US plans.
If actual results should differ from these assumptions the Groups financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected.
The optional alternative accounting treatment, FRS 17, which requires immediate recognition of actuarial variations direct to reserves, has not been adopted because management believes that it has the effect of overstating plan deficits since a short-term rate of interest is applied to plan liabilities which are long-term in nature.
If FRS 17 had been adopted a liability, net of related deferred tax, of 89.1m would have been recognised on the balance sheet compared with a net liability of 0.5m underSSAP 24.
Contingenciesand Provisions The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
Provision is made for loss contingencieswhen it is deemed probable that an adverse outcomewill occurand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the  .
The estimation of the liability for the costs of the macrotextured product withdrawal for which insurance coverage has been declined is dependent upon two main variables.
These are the number of implant revisions that will ultimately be required and the average cost of settlements with patients.
In the hypothetical scenario that all implants eventually need to be revised prematurely and that insurance cover continues to be unavailable, the cost to the Group of the declined insurance cover is estimated to be 190m an additional 110m over the amount provided, assuming the average cost per settlement remains approximately the same and there is a standard rate of mortality.
These estimates constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties.
The group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world.
Group policy is to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, but at any time the Group has unagreed years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits.
Significant issues may take several years to resolve.
In estimating the 31 probability and amount of any tax charge management takes into account the views of internal and external advisors and updates the amount of provision whenever necessary.
The ultimate tax liability may differ from the  law, settlement .
2004YEAR The following discussion and analysis is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the Group Accounts of Smith & Nephew included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The Groups Accounts are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Reconciliations reflecting the effect of the significant differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP are set forth in Note 39 of Notes to the Group Accounts.
New Accounting Policiesin 2004 There are no new accounting policies in 2004 but the Groups policy for contingencies and provisions has been added to the disclosures.

Financial Highlightsof 2004 Group turnover was 1,248.5m for the year ended 31 December 2004, representing 6% growth compared to 1 2003.
Profit on ordinary activities before taxation was 177.9m, compared with 230.1m in 2003.
Profit before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items calculated as set out in the Five Year Record, improved 15% to 278.4m.
Basic earnings per Ordinary Share were 13.39p, a 16% decrease compared to 15.92p for 2003.
Adjusted basic earnings per Ordinary Share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items as set out in the Five Year Record , representinga 14% increase.
32 Group Turnover 1 1 For the year ended 31 December 2004, underlying sales growth was 11 2%.
Reported sales benefited by 1 2% from the acquisition of MMT but adverse currency translation, particularly the weakness of the US Dollar relative to Sterling, reduced sales by 7%.
Reported group sales consequently increased by 69.6m 6% to 1,248.5m from1,178.9m.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales represents 26.8% of sales compared to 29.3% in 2003.
This improvement arose from manufacturing cost and efficiency savings and transactional currency benefits from the relative decline in the value of the US Dollar which reduced the cost of purchasing finished goods in many countries, particularly in Europe and Australia.
There was also a mix benefit as the fastest growing business, orthopaedics, also has the lowest costofsales.
Marketing, sellingand distribution expenses These costs represented 38.2% of sales, compared to 37.3% in 2003.
This increase is due mainly to additions to sales forces,  US.
Administration Expenses Administration expenses were 7% higher than in 2003 and represented 10.7% of sales compared with 10.6% of sales in2003.
Research and Development There was no material change in expenditure .

BSN Medical Agency and Management Fees Agency and management fees were received in respect of services provided to BSN Medical for sales force resource, physical distribution and logistics and administration in certain countries.
The calculation of the fees is designed to result in a neutral, cost-recovery position for Smith & Nephew and is for a transitional period only.
In 2004 recoveries fell by 4.3m 22% as a number of shared service agreements expired and BSN established its .
Operating Profit before Goodwill Amortisation and Exceptional Items Operating profit before goodwill amortisaton and exceptional items from ContinuingOperations was 251.5m, an increase of 30.8m compared to 220.7m in 2003, resulting from an increase in gross profits of 79.9m partly offset by higher expenses.
Operating profit margins before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items from ContinuingOperations improvedfrom18.7%to20.1%.
Goodwill Amortisation The amortisation charge on acquisition goodwill increased by 2.0m to 20.5m.
The increase was due to the acquisition in March 2004 of MMT partly offset by translational currency benefits due to the decline in the value ofthe US Dollar.
Exceptional Items Operating exceptional items of 80.0m represents provision of 13.4m for the amount due from excess layer insurers who have declined insurance coverage for claims relating to macrotextured knee revisions together with an estimate of 66.6m for the cost of settlements with patients likely to arise in the future and assuming that .
Share of Operating Profit of the Joint Venture The Groups share of operating profit before exceptional items increased by 1.1m from 22.7m in 2003 to 23.8m in 2004.

33 Net Interest Receivable Payable Interest income increased by 2.9m from 11.0m in 2003 to 13.9m in 2004.
Interest expense decreased by 5.4m from 14.8m in 2003 to 9.4m in 2004.
The Groups share of the joint ventures and associated undertakings net interest expense was 1.4m and nil respectively compared with 1.5m and 0.7m respectively in 2003.
Interest payable on currency swaps amounting to 14.6m was set off against interest receivable on swaps.
Overall interest moved favourably by 9.1m from a net interest payable positionof 6.0mtoa net interest receivable positionof3.1m, duetofavourable movements ininterest .
Taxation The taxation charge decreased by 29.3m to 52.7m in 2004.
The taxation charge on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 80.7m an increase of 10.5m on the 2003 charge due to higherprofits.
The effective rate of taxation on profit before goodwillamortisation and exceptional items was 29.0% the same as 2003.
The taxation charge was reduced in 2004 by 28.0m as a consequence of the exceptional item and in 2003 increased by 11.8m as a result of the profit on disposal of the associated undertaking less exceptional costs.
Growth in sales in the US was 10% 22% underlying less 12% adverse currency translation.
Outside the US, growth was 17% 10% underlying less 4% adverse currencytranslation and including 11% from the acquisition of MMT.
Sales pricing in reconstruction and trauma increased by approximately 3% inthe US.
In reconstruction, knee sales increased by 12% 21% underlying less 9% adverse currency translation.

This reflects continuing strong market conditions particularly in the US, the expansion of sales forces and the introduction of minimal incision surgery MIS procedures.
Trauma benefited from the substantial investment in creating a dedicated US sales force, achieving a sales increase of 5% in the US, ahead of the market 17% underlying less adverse currency translation of 12%.
Sales 34 growth outside the US was 1% 4% underlying growth less 3% adverse currency translation.
These result in 3% global growth 11% underlying less 8% adverse currency translation.
Clinical Therapy sales, which consist of the SUPARTZ joint fluid therapy and EXOGEN ultrasound bone healing products, also benefited from sales force investment, growing32% 44% underlyingless 12% adverse currencytranslation comparedwithlast year.
A number of new orthopaedic products are in the pipeline.
Marketing approval in the US for the ceramic on ceramic hip was received in December.

Blade sales declined 3% 3% underlying growth less 6% adverse currency translation following a stabilisation of the re-use of blades by US hospitals.
Operating Profit Operating profit from the endoscopy business before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased by 2.3m 4% from 59.5m in 2003 to 61.8m in 2004.
The operating profit marginincreased from 19.8% to 20.3% as a result ofimprovedgross margins.
Advanced Wound Management Sales Advanced wound management sales were 355.0m for 2004 largely unchanged from 353.5m in 2003.
This is equivalent to 5% underlying growth less 5% adverse currency translation.
Outside the US, sales grew 5% 8% underlying less 3% adverse currency translation.
However, sales in the US declined 14% negative 4% underlying growth and 10% adverse currency translation, where they were seriously affected by the need to switch to another enzyme debrider product.

The operating profit margin increased from 12.0% to 14.4% principally as a result of higher gross margins due to manufacturing efficiencies and expense control.
35 2003YEAR Financial Highlightsof 2003 Group turnover was 1,178.9m for the year ended 31 December 2003, representing 6% growth compared to 2002.
Profit on ordinary activities before taxation was 230.1m, compared with 177.9m in 2002.
Profit before taxation goodwill amortisation and exceptional items calculated as set out in the Five Year Record, improved 15% to 242.2m.
Basic earnings per Ordinary Share were 15.92p, a 31% increase compared to 12.11p for 2002.
Adjusted basic earnings per Ordinary Share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items as set out in the Five Year Record , representinga 15% increase.
ii Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items comprised 220.7m from Continuing Operations 2002 196.0m fromContinuing Operationsand 2.1m fromdiscontinued operations.
Group Turnover For the year ended 31 December 2003, group turnover totalled 1,178.9m, an increase of 6% or 69.0m compared to 1,109.9m for 2002.
Underlying growth of Continuing Operations was 11%.
Translation of foreign currencies had the effect of decreasing turnover by 2%, primarily due to the depreciation of the US Dollar against Sterling.
The loss of revenues from the Groups discontinued rehabilitation business resulted in an adverse impact to the Groups turnover of 26.2m 3%.
Selling price increases accounted for approximately 2% of the underlyingsales growth.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales at 345.1m represented 29.3% of sales compared to 29.7% in 2002.
This improvement arose from manufacturing cost and efficiency savings and transactional currency benefits from the decline in the value of the US Dollar reducing the product cost in many countries outside the US, notably in Europe and Australia.
The reduction in cost of sales would have been greater but for the acquisition, in late 2002, of the remaining DERMAGRAFT interests notalready   forthisproduct.
36 Marketing, sellingand distribution expenses At 440.1mthese costs represented 37.3%ofsales, the same percentage as in2002.

Research and Development Expenditure on research and development increased by 5.5m 9% compared with2002.
Thisrepresented 5.7% of sales compared with 5.5% in 2002.
Smith & Nephew continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate the group from its competitors.
In 2003, 20% of Smith & Nephews sales were from  last three years.
BSN Medical Agency and Management Fees Agency and management fees are received in respect of services provided to BSN Medical for sales force resource, physical distribution and logistics and administration in certain countries.
In 2003, recoveries fell by 1.3m 6% as a number of the shared service arrangements expired and BSN Medical established its ownstand-alone operations.
This trend of lower agency fees is expected to continueas more BSN Medicalentities exit the arrangements.
Operating Profit before Goodwill Amortisation and Exceptional Items Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items from Continuing Operations was 220.7m, an increase of 24.7m compared to 196.0m in 2002, resulting from profit arising from additional sales together with cost and efficiencysavings.
These two factors more than offset  of7.3mdueto the need to amortise the deficits of the Groups principal plans and increased DERMAGRAFT costs of 7.2m followingthe acquisitionof50% ofthe  owned.
Operating profit margins before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items from Continuing Operations improved from 18.1% to 18.7% of which1.5% points was due to cost and efficiencysavings and 0.3% points was due to transactional currency benefits offset partly by 0.6% points in respect of higher pension costs and 0.6% pointsfromthe effect .
Goodwill Amortisation The amortisation charge on acquisition goodwill increased by 1.0m to 18.5m.
The increase was due to a full years amortisation of ORATEC goodwill compared with nine months in 2002, offset partly by the translational currencyeffect ofa weakerUS Dollar.
Exceptional Items Operating exceptional items were a net cost of 22.4m compared to a net cost of 29.9m in 2002.
In 2003, 17.6m of net costs were incurred as a consequence of Smith & Nephews unsuccessful public offers to purchase Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital AG and 4.8m of costs arose on the integration of the ORATEC acquisition, principally in the relocation of manufacturing and development operations.
Exceptional items in 2002 consisted of 17.5m for the write down of the Groups trade investment in the common stock of ATS following its filing for bankruptcy, 4.0m for further rationalisation due to the contribution of businesses to BSN Medical and  acquisitionofORATEC andDERMAGRAFT.
Share of Operating Profit of the Joint Venture The Groups share of operating profit before exceptional items increased by 3.1m from 19.6m in 2002 to 22.7m in 2003.
Operating profit margins improved from 12.6% in 2002 to 13.8% in 2003 as a result of cost and efficiency savings arising from continuing manufacturing rationalisation.
The Groups share of exceptional items .
Share of Operating Profit of Associated Undertaking The operating profit of AbilityOne up to the date of disposal on 12 September 2003 was 4.8m.
37 Net Profit on Disposalsof Associated Undertaking A net profit of 31.5m arose on the disposal of the Groups 21.5% equity interest in AbilityOne to Patterson Dental Inc. after writing off 8.2m of acquisition goodwill previously set-off against reserves and after charging 1.1mofadjustments inrespect ofpreviousdisposals.
Net Interest Payable Interest income increased by 4.4m from 6.6m in 2002 to 11.0m in 2003.
Interest expense decreased by 2.0m from 16.8m in 2002 to 14.8m in 2003.
The Groups share of the joint ventures and associated undertakings net interest expense was 1.5m and 0.7m respectively compared with 1.6m and 0.9m respectively in 2002.
Interest payable on currency swaps amounting to 18.5m was set off against interest receivable on swaps.
Overall interest payable decreased by 6.7m to 6.0m due to lower average net debt during the year and lower US Dollar and Euro interest rates on borrowings and swap liabilities offset in part by  rates oncashbalances andswap assets.
Taxation The taxation charge increased by 16.2m to 82.0m in 2003.
The taxation charge on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 70.2m an increase of 8.6m on the 2002 charge due to higher profits.
The effective rate of taxation on profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 29.0% compared with 29.3% in 2002.
The taxation charge was reduced in 2003 by 3.5m as a consequence of the exceptional costs, by 0.8m from the exceptional costs in BSN Medical and increased by 16.1m as a result of the gain on disposal ofAbilityOne.
Underlying growth in sales was 16%.
This increase demonstrated Smith & Nephews market share gains in the global orthopaedics market excluding spine, which is estimated to be growing at 13%.
Sales pricing contributed approximately 3% to reported growth.
Products introducedwithinthe last three years represented 25% ofsales in 2003.
During 2003 the business recruited 60 dedicated trauma sales representatives, with further plans for expansion in2004inthe US.
Reconstructive implant sales grew by 15% equivalent to an underlying growth rate of 19% after 4% of adverse currency translation following an aggressive expansion of OXINIUM products into the market.
The OXINIUM bearing material continued to be a great success and has helped surgeons successfully treat younger implant patients duetoits .
38 Knee sales grew by 20%, an underlying rate of 24% after 4% of adverse currency driven mainly by the promotion and rollout of OXINIUM technology: hip sales grew by 11% an underlying rate of 16% after 5% of adverse currencyeffect drivenbythe launchofthe OXINIUMfemoralhead.
More than 30,000 knees made of OXINIUM had been implanted into patients and by the end of 2003 it was accounting for 40% of knee units being sold by the business in the US.
The joint fluid therapy product SUPARTZ contributed3% tokneesales growth.
Growth in sales of hips resulted from the continued solid performance of the SYNERGY and ECHELON platform systems and the introduction in 2003 of femoral heads made of OXINIUM, which by the end of 2003 were accountingfor35% ofhipheads sold bySmith& Nephewinthe US.
Trauma sales increased by 6% an underlying rate of 10% after 4% of adverse currency effect benefiting from increased focus following the divisionalisation of the US business.
Trauma sales increased in the US by 4% equivalent to 13%  9% adverse currency.
Theseresults werehelped bygrowthinsales of the EXOGEN ultrasound bone stimulation products, of 14% 22% underlying growth after 8% adverse currency andthe introductionofthe  in2003.

Operating Profit Operating profit from the orthopaedics business before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased by 20.5m 21% from 98.2m in 2002 to 118.7m in 2003.
The operating profit margin increased from 20.9% to 22.6%as a result , additionalsales .
Underlying growth in sales was 4%.
Sales in the US declined by 7% with an underlying fall of 2% after adjusting for 9% adverse currency and 4% for the benefit of ORATEC.
Outside the US sales growth was 19% 14% underlying after 5% adverse currencytranslation.
Endoscopy was adversely affected in the US by two market issues increased re-use of arthroscopic resection blades and decreased business from one of its largest customers, HealthSouth.
With respect to blade re-use, the business launched an educational campaign that features research highlighting the risks of this practice to hospitals andcliniciansinthe US.
Endoscopy sales growth was also affected by its decision to defer two product launches into 2004 the digital scanning camera and the next generation varicose vein removal system.
Clinical evaluations identified the opportunity to make improvements prior to both products broader launch.
Both of these products were launched inearly2004.
Sales of knee and shoulder repair products grew by 14% an underlying rate of 18% after 4% of adverse currency translation while ORATEC products produced sales growth of 41% of which 17% arose from underlying growth, 32% was the acquisition effect less 8% adverse currency translation helping Smith & Nephew to maintain its marketleadership  marketshare of29%.
Operating Profit Operating profit from the endoscopy business before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased by 5.7m 11% from 53.8m in 2002 to 59.5m in 2003.
The operating profit margin increased from 18.4% to 19.8% as a result of effective expense control and by accelerating the integration of the ORATEC acquisition.
During 2003 the manufacturing and development activities of ORATEC at Palo Alto, California were relocated and integrated  Andover, Massachusetts.
Advanced Wound Management Sales Advanced wound management sales were 353.5m for 2003, an increase of 10% compared to 321.7m for 2002.
The advanced wound management business maintained its leadership 39 position with approximately 20% of the market for advanced treatments of hard-to-heal wounds.
It further developed the concept of wound bed preparation as a new clinical and scientific platform.
DERMAGRAFT and TRANSCYTE bioengineered human tissue products, acquired in November 2002, were integrated successfully intothe US business.
DERMAGRAFT achieved its target sales of 7m.
Sales of the ALLEVYN family of products continued to grow strongly at 24% 20% underlying growth plus 4% favourable currency translation and ACTICOAT silver-based  achievedsales growthof51% 55% underlyingless 4% adverse currency.
The business launched a new enzymatic wound bed preparation product, GLADASE, following the termination of a supply arrangement for the previous equivalent US product, SANTYL.

Operating Profit Operating profit from the advanced wound management business before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items decreased by 1.5m 3% from 44.0m in 2002 to 42.5m in 2003.
The operating profit margin decreased from 13.7% to 12.0% principally as a result of acquiring, at the end of 2002, the remaining 50% of the DERMAGRAFT   inthe UK andthe US.
40 OUTLOOK AND TREND INFORMATION The discussion below contains statements that express managements expectations about future events or results rather than historical facts.
These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the Groups actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.
Smith & Nephew cannot give assurance that such statements will prove correct.
These risks and uncertainties include factors related to: the medical devices industry in general: product liability claims and related insurance coverage: the geographical markets in which the Group operates: the nature and efficiency of the Groups products: the Groups ability to research, develop, manufacture and distribute its products: the translation of currencies to Sterling: and the values of international securities markets.
For additional information on factors that could cause the Groups actual results to differ from estimates reflected inthese , youshouldread RiskFactors ofthisdocument.
The markets on which the Group focuses continue to demonstrate robust growth and are expected to benefit for many years to come from an ageing population, active lifestyles and the development of less invasive techniques in orthopaedic and endoscopic surgery.
Management believe that Smith & Nephews continuing innovation in advanced wound management products and the potential for further penetration of moist wound healing and woundbed  .
The markets in which the Group operates continue to grow strongly and management expects that innovative new product development programmes and sales force investment particularly in orthopaedics and endoscopy willenable the  .
For 2005, management expects to achieve high teens sales growth in orthopaedics and high single digit sales growth at endoscopy and wound management.
Management expects that continued investment and planned  growthgoingforward.
A significant external influence on Group sales and profits in 2005 and beyond will be the translational effects of currency to the extent that average rates of exchange differ from those in year 2004.
Reported sales and profits would benefit from a strengthening in the value of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling compared with average rates of exchange in 2004 but would be reduced by a strengthening in the value of Sterling against those currencies.
A further influence on profit and on operating profit margin trends in 2005 and beyond will be the transactional effects of currency to the extent that rates of exchange differ from those in 2004.
Operating profit margins will improve if the effective rate of exchange of the Euro compared with the US Dollar increases and will be reduced by a relative strengthening of the US Dollar.
The effective rate of exchange will determine the average cost of finished goods purchased by the Groups selling operations from its manufacturing operations and will be affected byactualrates ofexchange, .
Management does not anticipate that the dispute with certain insurers over their declination of coverage of macrotextured product liability claims will be resolved during 2005.
Consequently, it is expected that settlements with patients will not be reimbursed by insurers and that this will have an adverse impact on cash flow of approximately 40m during 2005.
There will be no impact on operating profit since these payments will be chargedtothe provisionestablished in2004.
Translation of foreign currency net debt into Sterling had the effect of decreasing net debt by 150.8m in the three-year period ended 31 December 2004.
Closing net borrowings includes 31.6m of net currency swap assets 2003 43.4m, 200216.7m.
Acquisitions and Disposals In the three-year period ended 31 December 2004, 165.9m including the issuance of 50.3m of Loan Notes in 2004 was spent on acquisitions, net of disposal proceeds, funded from net debt.
Acquisitions totalled 295.8m and comprised ORATEC 191.2m, MMT 69.6m, Collagenase 9.1m, DERMAGRAFT 7.8m, Acticoat 7.3m and other10.8m.
In the same three-year period, 129.9m was received from the disposal of businesses and the formation of BSN Medical.
This comprised 5.7m on the formation of BSN Medical, 71.8m for the rehabilitation business and 52.4mforAbilityOne.
Capital Expenditure The Groups ongoingcapital expenditure andworkingcapital requirementshave been  generated by business operations and, where necessary, through short-term committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
In recent years capital expenditure on tangible and intangible fixed assets has represented approximately 7% to 8% of continuing group turnover.
Capital expenditure in 2005 is expected to be approximately the same percentage ofGroupturnoveras 2004.
In 2004 capital expenditure of 102.3m 101.1m net of disposals of fixed assets was incurred.
The principal areas of investment were in the placement of orthopaedics instruments with customers, manufacturing plant and equipment, .
At  expenditure hadbeen contractedbut notprovidedfor.
Operating Cash Flow Management assesses available cash flow in terms of operating cash flow before outgoings on rationalisation, divestment, acquisition integration and other exceptional costs and after capital expenditure and financial investments.
This figure 144.9m for 2004 is after several adjustments to net cash inflow from operating activities, the most comparable UK GAAP figure.
Management believes that this figure represents a truer reflection of cash flow generation because it excludes exceptional cash flow items.
This measure is used in the Groups management reporting, budgeting and planning.
Management also uses as a key indicator the cash 42 conversion ratio i. e. the percentage of cash flow compared to group operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
This was 58% for 2004 2003 77%, 2002 73% and was lower than in previous years as a result of an increase in orthopaedic stocks to improve customer service and meet anticipated increases in demand for both existing and new products.
Management uses this cash conversionratio to monitor the efficiency of its use of capital employed and to provide meaningful year-on-year cash flow trend information.
Management has set long-termtargets forthe Groupof70% 75% cashconversionratio.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities to operating cash flow before outgoings on rationalisation, divestment, acquisition integration, macrotextured knee settlements  costs.

At 31 December 2004, the Group held 32.6m in cash and balances at bank and had committed and uncommitted bank facilities of 326m and 212m respectively.
Undrawn bank facilities amounted to 414m, of which 225m were committed.
Of the undrawn committed facilities, 6m expire within one year and 219m after two but within five years.
Of the drawn facilities, 31.9m expires within one year, 0.3m expires in 1-3 years and 93.7 expires within 3-5 years.
In addition Smith & Nephew has 50.3m of loan notes payable within 1-3 years.
Smith & Nephewintendstorepay the  cashanddrawingdownon the .
The principal variations in the Groups borrowing requirements normally result from the timing of the bi-annual dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals of businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital fluctuations.
In2005the settlement ofmacrotextured patient claimswillalso be a factor.
Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure needs and its working capital funding for 2005, as well as its otherknownorexpected , canbe met fromits existing .
Further information regarding borrowings at 31 December 2004 is set out in Note 19 of the Notes to the Group Accounts.
The Group believes that the borrowing facilities do not contain restrictions that are expected to impact  policyforthe foreseeable future.
Pension Funding The movements in the stock market values over the last five years have adversely affected the funding levels of Smith & Nephews major defined benefit plans in the UK and US.
These plans continuetobe accountedforunder SSAP 24 and their combined SSAP 24 deficit is estimated as 49m at 31 December 2004 2003 55m.
This is less than the combined deficit under FRS 17 of 123.7m 2003 121.2m.
The difference is due to the noninvestment return discount rate required to be applied to liabilities under FRS 17.
The SSAP 24 deficit is to be funded over members average future working lives.
Existing provisions and planned increases in future contributionsare consideredadequate tocoverthe .
Payment Policies It is Company policy to ensure that suppliers are paid within agreed terms.
At the year-end, the Companys trade creditorsrepresented the equivalent of39days credit.
43 EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATERISK AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Board of Directors of the Company has established a set of policies to manage funding, currencyand interest rate risks.
These policies include the use of derivative financial instruments only for the management of the   activities andtheirfinancing.
ForeignExchange Exposure The Group trades in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
The Groups policy is to protect shareholders funds by matching foreign currency assets, including acquisition goodwill, with foreign currency liabilities wherever practicable.
These liabilities take the form of either borrowings or currencyswaps.
It is the Groups policyfor operating units not to hold unhedged monetary assets .
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly on translation of overseas sales and profits into Sterling and secondly, the currency cost of purchases by Group companies of finished products and raw materials.
The principal flows of currency are purchases of US Dollars and Sterling from Euros, Japanese Yen, Australian andCanadianDollars, as wellas  the US andthe UK.
The Group partly mitigates the translational impact on profits through the interest arising on foreign currency borrowings or swaps.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use .
The Group managed 320m of foreign currency purchase transactions by using forward foreign exchange contracts, of which the major transaction flow is Euros into US Dollars.
The Groups policy is for firm commitments to be fully covered and forecast transactions to be covered between 50% and 90% for up to one year.
If the Euro were to weaken against US Dollar by 10% on average over the year, the fair value of forward foreign exchange  2003 increaseby3m.
Had the Group not transacted forward foreign exchange purchase contracts and if Sterling were to have weakened on average over the year by 10% against all other currencies, Smith & Nephews profit on ordinary activities before taxation in 2004 would have increased by 29m on account of transactional and translational movements: if the Euro were to have weakened on average over the year by 10% against all other currencies, profit on ordinary activities before taxation in 2004 would have reduced by 10m: if the US Dollar were to have weakened on average over the year by 10% against all other currencies, profit before taxation in 2004 would not have changedmaterially.
The Groups net debt is exposed to movements in exchange rates on foreign currency liabilities.
Based upon the net debt position at 31 December 2004 if Sterling were to weaken against the US Dollar by 10%, the increase in the Groups net debt would be 51m.
If Sterling were to weaken against all currencies excluding the US Dollar by 10%, the Groups net debt would be increased by 20m.
That is, if Sterling were to weaken against all currencies by10%, the Groupsnet debt wouldincreaseby71m.
Interest Rate Risk The Group contracts fixed rate currency swaps and uses simple floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs and differentials between borrowing and deposit rates within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps and the fixed interest element of currencyswaps are accounted for as hedges and, as such, changes in fair values resulting from changes to market rates are not recognised in the Group balance sheet nor in reported profits.
The cash flow effects of interest rate swaps match cash flows on the  there isnonet cashfloweffect frommovements inmarketinterest rates.
As at 31 December 2004, the majority of interest costs and differentials had been protected through to December2005.
If the Group had not transacted interest rate swaps or fixed interest rate cross currency swaps to hedge its interest rate risk, based uponthe net debt positionat 31December2004,  rates across all currencies by one percentage point would increase the Groups annual net interest payable by 1.1m 2003 increase by 1.3m.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities, excluding fixed interest rate currency swaps, were principally at floating interest rates and thus their fair values are not directly affected by movements inmarketrates ofinterest.
44 At 31 December 2004, an increase of one percentage point in Sterling interest rates would have reduced the fair value of Sterling interest rate swaps and the Sterling fixed interest element of currency swaps by 5m: and an increase of one percentage point in US Dollar interest rates would have increased the fair value of US Dollar interest rate swaps and the US Dollar fixed interest element of currency swaps by 4m.
In the case of decreases in interest rates of one percentage point the changes in the fair values of the interest rate and the fixed interest element of currency swaps would have been an increase of 5m relating to Sterling and a decrease of 4m relatingtoUS Dollars.
Financial Instruments The Groups financial instruments are subject to changes in fair values as a result of changes in market rates of exchange and forward interest rates.
All financial instruments are accounted for as hedges.
As a result, changes infairvalues  the  before taxation.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
Smith & Nephew does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject tomaterial .

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Management believes that the Group does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC in item 5E of Form 20-F, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures orcapital resourcesthat ismaterial toinvestors.

45  REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS Under European regulation, from 2005 Smith & Nephew will be required to publish its financial statements under IFRS.
The transition is being managed internally by a Project Committee reporting to a Steering Committee which ischairedbythe FinanceDirector.
Quarterlyreports have been made tothe Audit Committee.
The Project Committee has performed a full assessment of the extant standards and their impact on both the reported financialstatements and the underlyingbusiness processes,  standards yet to be finalised by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted by the European Union.
Amendments to internal reporting systems  have been effected  ona fullIFRS basis.
In November 2004 the Group announced its external communication plan, explaining to investors the impact of IFRS based on managements expectations of the format of the final standards.
A summary of the adjustments required to restate each quarters earnings and net debt in 2004 to an IFRS basis was included within the 2004 preliminary announcement issued on 3 February 2004.
In parallel with the issue of 2004 financial statements, management has published the revised accounting policies which will be applied from 2005 onwards, together with an unaudited description of the major accounting changes and quantification of how existing UK GAAP reporting reconciles to the IFRS equivalent for 2003 and 2004 full years.
This document is available on the Groups website and in printed copy on request from the Groups company secretary.
From Quarter 1, 2005, all results willbe presented underIFRS.
Based on the standards currently in issue and managements understanding of future developments, the major differences in accounting policies which will impact Smith & Nephew are for employee benefits in particular pensions accounting and a requirement for the expensing of all share options granted, for acquisition goodwill which will no longer be amortised but will be subject to annual testing for impairment and increased recognition of intangible assets arising on acquisition.
In addition, management expects the recognition criteria for deferred tax will change, resulting in a net write back of provisions, principally related to goodwill set off against reserves.
The proposed standards and interpretations on financial instruments have necessitated a change in Smith & Nephews accounting practice.
The Group continues to hedge the net investment value of foreign subsidiaries and the overall hedging strategy for trading hedges remains essentially unchanged.
However, management does not believe that it will be possible to fix forward the reported interest costs of the Group with the same certainty as could be achieved under UK GAAP, resulting in some volatility within financing costs over each quarterly period.
Management expects to be fully prepared for the transition.
However, full implementation is dependent on the completion of the standard setting process by the International Accounting Standards Board and the adoption of such standards by the European Commission.
The failure of the European Commission to adopt all of these standards in time for financial reporting in 2005, or the issue of further interpretations by the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC in advance of the reporting date, could result in the need to change the basis of accounting or presentation of certain financial information from that presented in this note.
In particular, the International Accounting Standards Board has yet to provide definitive rulings and transitional guidance on specific aspects of IAS 39 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments which impact the Group.
Management intends to continue monitoring developments as the standards and recognised practicesevolve.
Had Smith & Nephew been reporting under IFRS management believe its results and shareholders funds since the transitiondate wouldhave been as follows: Results 2004 2003 Attributable profitforthe financialyear.................................... 138.2m 172.4m Basicearningsper OrdinaryShare........................................ 14.78p 18.54p Dilutedearningsper OrdinaryShare...................................... 14.67p 18.42p IFRS attributable profit for the financial year in 2004 is 13.0m 2003 24.3m higher than UK GAAP mainly due to the non-amortisation of goodwill of 20.5m 2003 18.5m, offset partly by higher amortisation of intangible fixed assets of 4.4m 2003 nil.
Other principal adjustments to profit include: a net charge of 46 5.0m under IFRS 2 for share based compensation 2003 3.5m : a net benefit of 2.7m 2003 1.2m for pensions reflecting a current service cost benefit of 3.6m 2003 2.7m and 1.8m 2003 3.8m finance costexpense anda creditof0.9m 2003 2.3m onthe difference indeferred taxation accounting.

US GAAP Smith & Nephew prepares its accounts in accordance with UK GAAP which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Reconciliations of profit for the financial year and shareholders funds are set out in Note 39 of Notes to the Group Accounts.
As a consequence of the preparatory work to convert the accounts from UK GAAP to IFRS, management has identified certain adjustments that were needed to the UK US GAAP reconciliations in prior years andhas restated forthese as disclosed inNote39ofthe Notes tothe GroupAccounts.
Results Restated Restated 2004 2003 2002 Profitforthe financialyear.................................. 142.4m 179.5m 145.2m Basicearningsper OrdinaryShare........................... 15.23p 19.30p 15.68p Dilutedearningsper OrdinaryShare.......................... 15.12p 19.18p 15.55p US GAAP profit for the financial year in 2004 is 17.2m higher than UK GAAP mainly due to the non-amortisation of goodwill of 20.5m, offset partly by higher amortisation of other intangible fixed assets of 13.0m.
Other principal adjustments to profit include: a credit of 24.4m on differences in hedge accounting: a charge of 6.5m under FAS 123 for stock based compensation: a charge of 6.4m for pensions reflecting a difference in methodology for calculating the service cost and a credit of 2.1m on the difference in deferred taxation  intoreplacement assets.
Shareholders Funds Restated 2004 2003 At 31December...................................................... 781.9m 690.7m Shareholders funds in 2004 are 54.9m higher than UK GAAP principally due to the non-amortisation of goodwill, 33.3m: different recognition criteria for intangible assets and goodwill, 76.3m: dividends on a declared rather than a proposed basis, 30.0m: inclusion of a minimum pension liability, 93.6m: and lower taxation provisionduetothese adjustments of20.9m.
Prospects Smith & Nephew have published expectations of future results on an IFRS basis in Outlook and Trend Information.
New accounting standards in the US which may affect US GAAP results are detailed in Note 38 of the Notes to the GroupAccounts.
