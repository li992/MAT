"For the purposes of this condition, ""Cumulative Total Shareholder Return"" can be the increase in Share Price, the value of the dividend s per share paid or a combination of the two."

The interests in share options detailed above include those of the Director and his immediate family.
These performance conditions are considered appropriate because they provide challenging but achievable targets in order to incentivise the holder to work towards and achieve Company shareholder expectations.
In assessing whether the performance conditions have been met, the Remuneration Committee considers whether the criteria for successful completion of each individual condition have been achieved or exceeded.
These methods of assessment were chosen because they provide a clearly defined process for the Remuneration Committee to determine successful completion of each condition and are consistent with other performance monitoring procedures used within the Company as a whole.
