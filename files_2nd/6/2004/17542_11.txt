40 Yell Group plc OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the Yell Group.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UK UK GAAP.
UK GAAP differs in certain important respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the US US GAAP.
See the reconciliation of UK GAAP to US GAAP at Note 28 to the audited financial statements for the Yell Group.
US GAAP information is provided in this document because we have US employees who have been granted share options.
FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Group Turnover We are the leading provider of classified directory advertising and associated products and services in the UK and the leading independent provider of classified directory advertising in the US.
We currently derive our turnover principally from sales of advertisements in our printed directories, Yellow Pages, Yellow Book and Business Pages.
We also generate turnover from online-related activities such as online advertising, website design and domain-name sales and from Yellow Pages 118 24 7.
Our sales and publishing cycle requires us to agree to an advertising sale often months in advance of the actual delivery of the directories and recognition of the corresponding revenues.
Therefore, we have better visibility of our expected near-term financial results than might otherwise be the case.
We recognise turnover from advertisement sales for a printed directory when we have completed delivery of that directory.
Because the number and type of directories are not evenly distributed throughout the year, turnover and profits do not arise evenly over the year.
Therefore, certain periods have higher-than-average levels of turnover and profits, whilst others have lower-than-average levels.
For example, during our 2004 financial year, the four financial quarters accounted for 22.1%, 25.8%, 23.0% and 29.1% of Group turnover, respectively.
Different directories may grow at different rates, such that growth may not be evenly distributed between quarters.
We sometimes have to rephase our timing of distributions into an earlier or later period for operational reasons, such as when we rescope directories or integrate acquisitions.
Such changes can also affect the quarterly distribution of turnover.
We recognise turnover from non-printed directories and other activities over the life of the contract from the point at which the service is first provided or, in the case of a single delivery, at the time of delivery.
Growth in our turnover is driven primarily by the volume of advertisement sales to new and existing advertisers and by new product offerings.
In the US, we have also experienced growth in turnover as a result of acquisitions of other independent directory publishers and new printed directory launches.
Our ability to increase turnover in the UK during the period under review was limited by the undertakings given to the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in 2001, under which, from January 2002, we were required to limit the annual growth in advertising rates in our UK printed Yellow Pages directories to RPI less 6% for an expected period of four years.
This has restricted our ability to raise prices on advertisements within our printed Yellow Pages directories in the UK.
When RPI is less than 6%, this price cap requires us to reduce the price in absolute terms that we can charge our advertisers for placing advertisements in our UK printed consumer classified directories.
Relative to inflation, our prices will decrease each year that the price cap remains in effect.
For example, if inflation as measured by RPI were 2% at the time prices are set for given directories in each of the four years commencing January 2002, then advertisement prices would be reduced in absolute terms by 4% each year, and the prices in the fourth year would be approximately 15% lower than they were when the new price cap took effect.
During our 2004 financial year, the average price of advertising in our Yellow Pages directories decreased by 4.8%, as compared to a decrease of 4.4% during our 2003 financial year.
We are not subject to any regulatory price constraints in the US.
In the 2004 financial year, 49% of the Groups turnover was affected by a price cap, as compared to 50% during the 2003 financial year.
In the 2004 financial year, 53% of our turnover came from our UK operations compared with 55% in the 2003 financial year.
41 Annual Report 2003 04 Cost of Sales Our cost of sales consists principally of costs associated with the publication of directories, including advertising sales, paper, printing and pre-press production, as well as bad debt expense.
The principal components of advertising sales costs, which represent a significant portion of our cost of sales, are employee costs of the sales force, including salaries, benets and commissions, and associated direct costs.
We recognise the cost of sales for each directory on completion of delivery of that directory.
We anticipate that cost of sales will increase as we expand and introduce new directories and other products.
Our expansion into new markets in the US also increases our employee costs.
In addition to requiring a larger sales force, the commissions we pay to our sales force tend to be higher in new markets, as our commission structure pays higher remuneration for new advertisers.
Paper is our largest raw material and one of our largest variable-cost items.
In recent years paper prices have uctuated signicantly.
In the 2004 financial year, paper costs were equivalent to 6.7% of Group turnover and represented 11.5% of our total cost of sales in the UK and 16.5% of our total cost of sales in the US.
Cost of sales also includes bad debt expense.
Our UK business currently has low bad debt expense relative to our US business due to our established market position in the UK.
Our Yellow Book directories business operates in a number of markets in which we are a relatively new entrant, and as a result a higher proportion of our advertisers are new advertisers, a category in which historically we have intentionally allowed a higher rate of bad debts.
We believe that the benefits of our growth strategy in the US outweigh any risks associated with the credit profile of our advertisers, and over time, as our newer directories become more established in their respective markets, we expect that bad debt expense as a percentage of turnover in the US will decrease.
Nevertheless, because we expect to continue our growth strategy in the future, we expect our bad debt expense as a percentage of turnover in the US to remain higher than in the UK.
Distribution Costs and Administrative Costs Our distribution costs consist principally of amounts payable to third-party delivery companies with which we contract for the delivery of our printed directories.
Our distribution costs related to a directory are recognised when the directory is delivered.
Our administrative costs consist principally of amortisation and depreciation, advertising, promotion and marketing expenses, administrative staff expenses, information technology costs and staff training.
Advertising, promotion and marketing expenses represent our most significant discretionary expenses.
A substantial portion of our advertising, promotion and marketing expenses and the costs relating to the development of our online services relate to promotional and brand-building expenditures, which are largely discretionary and which we can reduce if we determine at any stage that the business environment does not justify the related expenditure.
Gross Profit Margins The change in the geographic mix of our business, as well as the strategy we have pursued of rapid growth and geographic expansion of our business in the US, has had an important effect on our financial results during the periods under review, including our profit margins.
These factors are expected to continue affecting our financial results in the future.
Our printed directories business in the UK, which we view as more developed and which covers substantially all of the UK, has historically had higher gross profit margins than those in the US.
In the US, the different market dynamics and the younger portfolio result in lower gross profit margins.
In the 2004 financial year, for example, our gross profit margin for our UK printed directories was 61.6%, compared to 43.4% for our US printed directories.
Our overall gross profit margin is therefore affected and will continue to be affected to the extent our US operations continue to form an increasing portion of the geographic mix of our business.
We intend to increase our focus on enhancing our operating efficiencies and organic growth in the US, and we believe there will be opportunities to improve our US gross profit margins as our US operations become more established.
42 Yell Group plc YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2003 Group Turnover Year ended 31 March 2003 2004 2 2 m % m % UK printed directories 573.7 51.5 593.9 50.0 Other UK products and services 41.2 3.7 41.0 3.5 Total UK turnover 614.9 55.2 634.9 53.5 US printed directories: 1 US printed directories at constant exchange rate 499.1 44.8 605.0 51.0 1 Exchange impact 53.0 4.5 Total US turnover 499.1 44.8 552.0 46.5 Group turnover 1,114.0 100.0 1,186.9 100.0 1 Constant exchange rate states current year results at the same exchange rate as that used to translate the previous years results.
Exchange impact is the difference between the results reported at a constant exchange rate and the actual results reported using current year exchange rates.
2 The percentage of total Group turnover.
Group turnover increased by 72.9 million, or 6.5%, from 1,114.0 million in the 2003 financial year to 1,186.9 million in the 2004 financial year, reflecting increased turnover during the period from each business segment.
UK turnover UK printed directories turnover increased by 3.5%, or 20.2 million, during the 2004 financial year.
The growth was primarily the result of an increase in the number of unique advertisers from approximately 451,000 to approximately 480,000 as a result of the continued success of our first-year advertiser discount programmes and our ability to retain 77% of existing customers.
We added over 116,300 new advertisers, exceeding our target of 100,000 new advertisers for the fourth successive year.
Turnover per unique advertiser decreased for all UK printed directories by 2.8% to 1,237 from 1,272, after the effect of the 4.8% price reduction on our Yellow Pages directories and the dampening effect that the increased numbers of customers had on yield.
Turnover from our online directory service increased by 5.5 million, or 27.1%, from 20.3 million to 25.8 million.
This increase was offset by a reduction in turnover from our other products and services, primarily from discontinued products resulting from the sale of our data-service business, Yell Data, in June 2003 and the ending of our contract with BT to sell advertising in their phone books in March 2003.
US turnover Turnover from US printed directories increased by 52.9 million, or 10.6%, from 499.1 million in the 2003 financial year to 552.0 million for the 2004 financial year.
Turnover was negatively affected by 53.0 million from a weakening US dollar.
On a constant US dollar basis, US turnover grew by 105.9 million, or 21.2%.
The average exchange rates were approximately $1.69 to 1.00 in the year ended 31 March 2004 and $1.55 to 1.00 in the prior year.
The Group had 386,000 unique advertisers in the US in the year ended 31 March 2004 compared to 363,000 in the prior year.
Average turnover per unique advertiser grew 14.0% from $2,135 to $2,434.
Same-market growth of 9.3% has grown from 6.1% last year.
Directories from acquisitions that published for the first time in the most recent year are not included in the same-market growth results.
The former McLeod directories are now performing in line with Yellow Book same-market growth.
Same-market growth is derived by comparing the turnover from directories including rescoped directories that we published in a period with turnover from these same directories or predecessor directories covering substantially the same geographic area published in the previous publishing cycle, which is not necessarily the same period in the prior financial year.
Rescoped directories are those where we redefine the geographic boundaries covered by one or more directories, which could include replacing one directory with multiple directories or combining multiple directories into fewer directories.
Remaining growth was due to ten new directory launches contributing 2.2% to the growth, four directories publishing for the first time after acquisition and the inclusion of a full year of results of acquisitions contributing 9.4% to the growth.

2 The percentage of related turnover.
Total cost of sales increased by 43.0 million, or 8.4%, compared to last year.
The 20.1 million, or 9.7%, increase in cost of sales for UK printed directories from 207.9 million in the 2003 financial year to 228.0 million in the 2004 financial year reflected higher advertisement volumes.
Cost of sales for Yellow Book directories as a percentage of turnover was 56.6% in the 2004 financial year, as compared to 57.5% in the 2003 financial year.
Cost of sales for other UK products and services decreased by 2.6 million, or 17.3%, from 15.0 million in the 2003 financial year to 12.4 million in the 2004 financial year, reflecting the products discontinued in the year.
Our consolidated bad debt expense was 71.0 million, or 6.0% of Group turnover in the 2004 financial year, as compared with 67.6 million, or 6.1% of Group turnover in the 2003 financial year.
The charge for UK bad debts was 4.5% of UK printed directories and other products and services turnover in both the 2004 and 2003 financial years.
The US bad debt expense was 7.7% of US printed directories turnover in the 2004 financial year as compared to 8.1% in the 2003 financial year, reflecting the more developed US profile and the relatively low level of launches in 2004.
Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin Year ended 31 March 2003 2004 2 2 m % m % UK printed directories 365.8 60.6 365.9 57.7 Other UK products and services 26.2 4.3 28.6 4.5 Total UK gross profit 392.0 64.9 394.5 62.2 US printed directories: 1 US printed directories at constant exchange rate 212.1 35.1 261.5 41.3 1 Exchange impact 22.0 3.5 Total US gross profit 212.1 35.1 239.5 37.8 Gross profit 604.1 100.0 634.0 100.0 Gross profit margin % UK operations 63.8 62.1 US operations 42.5 43.4 Group total % 54.2 53.4 1 Constant exchange rate states current year results at the same exchange rate as that used to translate the previous years results.
2 The percentage of total gross profit.
The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of Group turnover from 54.2% in the 2003 financial year to 53.4% in the 2004 financial year principally reflected the changing geographic mix of our operations resulting from the increased contribution of our US business.
44 Yell Group plc Distribution Costs and Administrative Costs Distribution costs decreased by 1.5 million, or 4.2%, from 36.0 million in the 2003 financial year 3.2% of Group turnover to 34.5 million in the 2004 financial year 2.9% of Group turnover.
Excluding the effects of the weakening dollar, distribution costs would have increased by 0.4 million.
Administrative costs increased by 64.4 million, or 16.7%, from 384.7 million in the 2003 financial year to 449.1 million in the 2004 financial year.
The increase was largely due to exceptional costs arising as a result of the IPO, including: 57.0 million for employee incentive plans: 28.9 million in fees, including VAT, paid to the previous owners: and 4.2 million for other costs.
These increases were partially offset by the absence of 15.0 million in costs incurred for the withdrawn initial public offering in July 2002 and the effect of the weakening US dollar.
Group Operating Profit and EBITDA Year ended 31 March 2003 2004 Change m % UK operations Operating profit 142.3 129.8 Depreciation and amortisation 69.2 69.4 1 EBITDA 211.5 199.2 Exceptional IPO items 14.7 33.9 1 Adjusted EBITDA 226.2 233.1 3.1 US operations Operating profit 41.1 20.6 Depreciation and amortisation 51.7 50.2 1 EBITDA 92.8 70.8 Exceptional IPO items 0.3 56.2 Non-recurring restructuring charges in 2003 3.7 2 Exchange impact 11.4 2 Adjusted EBITDA at constant exchange rate 96.8 138.4 43.0 2 Exchange impact 11.4 1 Adjusted EBITDA 96.8 127.0 31.2 Group Total operating profit 183.4 150.4 Depreciation and amortisation 120.9 119.6 1 Group EBITDA 304.3 270.0 11.3 Exceptional items and non-recurring restructuring charges in 2003 18.7 90.1 1 Group adjusted EBITDA 323.0 360.1 11.5 1 EBITDA comprises total operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, both being non-cash items.
EBITDA is not a measurement of performance under UK or US GAAP and you should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to a operating profit or net profit loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, b cash ows from operating, investing or nancing activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs or c any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles.
EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by the Groups cash ow statement and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results and is not meant to be predictive of our potential future results.
We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortisation, which can vary signicantly depending upon accounting methods particularly when acquisitions have occurred or non-operating factors.
Accordingly, EBITDA has been disclosed in this report to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our operating performance relative to other companies.
Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA identically, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
EBITDA is one of the key financial measures that we use to assess the success of our people in achieving growth in the business and operational efficiencies.
2 Constant exchange rate states current year results at the same exchange rate as that used to translate the previous years results.
45 Annual Report 2003 04 Adjusted EBITDA from the UK operations increased by 6.9 million, or 3.1%.
EBITDA from the UK operations decreased 5.8% to 199.2 million after charging 33.9 million in connection with the IPO and 14.7 million for the postponed initial public offering in July 2002.
Adjusted EBITDA growth primarily reects the increased profitability of Yell.
com reported EBITDA of 5.3 million operating profit of 3.6 million adding back depreciation of 1.7 million for the 2004 financial year as compared to 1.1 million operating loss of 1.3 million adding back depreciation of 2.4 million in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA from Yellow Book increased by 30.2 million, or 31.2%, compared to the 2003 financial year.
Including exceptional items, EBITDA from Yellow Book for the 2004 financial year decreased by 22.0 million compared to the 2003 financial year.
The adjusted EBITDA margin for Yellow Book increased to 23.0%, as we focused on increasing the benefit and yield from our directory investments.
We increased the profitability of our directories by leveraging our existing operations and administrative cost base to yield additional turnover from our directories without a corresponding increase in costs.
Group adjusted EBITDA increased by 37.1 million, or 11.5%.
Group adjusted EBITDA at a constant exchange rate increased by 48.5 million, or 15.0%.
Net Interest Payable Net interest expense was 194.5 million, comprising both cash interest and non-cash interest, in the 2004 financial year, compared to 236.6 million in the 2003 financial year.
Net interest before exceptional items was 136.1 million in the 2004 financial year, compared to 236.6 million last year.
The exceptional items of 58.4 million comprised 36.4 million accelerated amortisation of deferred financing costs in connection with the repayment of the senior credit facilities on 15 July 2003 and senior notes on 18 August 2003, 19.7 million early redemption of 35% of our senior notes on 18 August 2003, and 2.3 million arrangement fee on the undrawn revolving credit facility.
Net interest expense before exceptional items comprised 118.9 million of net interest paid or to be paid within a six-month period, 12.0 million of interest rolled-up into our long-term debt and 5.2 million of amortised financing costs.
Taxation Taxation before exceptional items was a charge of 44.2 million for the 2004 financial year and a credit of 10.3 million last year.
Taxation is determined on taxable profits that do not reflect certain amortisation charges.
Tax credits in the amount of 37.2 million in the 2004 financial year and 2.3 million last year were recognised as a benefit arising from exceptional items.
Our future taxation charge will depend on our taxable income in the UK and the US and our ability to use our net operating losses to offset our future taxable income in the US.
Profit Loss Before and After Tax After charging the exceptional costs, the loss on ordinary activities before tax was 44.1 million in the 2004 financial year as compared to a loss of 53.2 million in the 2003 financial year.
Excluding the effect of exceptional IPO costs, the profit before taxation and profit after taxation for the 2004 financial year would have been 104.4 million and 60.2 million, respectively.
Adjusted loss before taxation for the year ended 31 March 2003 is 34.5 million reflecting the loss before taxation on ongoing activities of 38.2 million excluding the 3.7 million charge for non-recurring restructuring costs as part of the integration of the former McLeod organisation in the US.
The effect on the loss after tax of excluding this item is 2.4 million bringing the adjusted loss after tax for the year ended 31 March 2003 to 25.5 million.
Liquidity Apart from significant acquisitions which we have funded through a combination of borrowings, cash from contributions from the investment funds from the former owners and cash flow from operations, we have funded our existing business largely from cash flows generated from our operations.
We believe that we have sufficient working capital to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements.
In addition, we have access to a 200.0 million revolving credit facility as part of the senior credit facilities, which expires on 7 July 2008, of which 5.0 million was drawn down at 31 March 2004.
Our net cash inflow from operating activities was 309.1 million in the 2003 financial year and 294.2 million in the 2004 financial year, or a 4.8% decrease.
46 Yell Group plc Our net cash inflow from operating activities before payments of exceptional costs 200314.3 million: 200433.8 million and after capital expenditure 200316.0 million: 200424.5 million decreased from 307.4 million in the 2003 financial year to 303.5 million in the 2004 financial year.
As a percentage of adjusted EBITDA cash conversion it fell from 95.2%, which benefited from one-off timing differences in the 2003 financial year to a more sustainable 84.3% in the 2004 financial year.
These cash flow measures are the measures that we use to manage the efficiency of our operations in converting earnings into cash.
Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance of 156.5 million for the 2004 financial year comprises 110.9 million of cash pay interest, 9.5 million rolled up interest settled, 19.7 million of premiums on early redemption of senior notes and 16.4 million finance fees paid.
Net cash outflow for capital expenditures and financial investment comprises capital expenditure on fixed assets and purchases of subsidiary undertakings, net of cash acquired.
Capital expenditure was 24.5 million in the 2004 financial year compared to 16.0 million last year.
The capital expenditure was principally in respect of the acquisition of fixed assets to support our sales force and central administrative staff.
We continued to augment our growth in the US with further selective acquisitions totalling 108.9 million in the 2004 financial year.
Capital Resources At 31 March 2004, we had cash of 18.7 million.
We expect that any significant acquisitions or other significant expenditures, including those related to the development of our online services, would in the future be nanced through any one or more of operating cash ows, credit facilities and the issue of new debt and equity securities.
We had net debt of 1,223.0 million at 31 March 2004, as set out below.
Payments due by period Debt Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Total m Long-term loans and other borrowings Term Loan A1denominated in sterling 80.0 190.0 354.0 624.0 Term Loan A2denominated in US dollars 323.8 323.8 Senior notes 308.2 308.2 Revolving loan under senior credit facilities and other 5.8 5.8 Total debt 85.8 190.0 677.8 308.2 1,261.8 Unamortised financing costs 20.1 Cash at bank 18.7 Net debt at end of the period 1,223.0 We are required to satisfy interest and principal payments on our borrowings as they become due.
To the extent we are not able to fund any principal payment at maturity or any interest payment when due from cash flow from operations, we would be required to refinance this indebtedness pursuant to credit facilities and or the issue of new debt and equity securities into the capital markets.
Any failure to raise additional funds necessary to achieve this would result in default under our debt covenants.
We anticipate that we will have to refinance in part the repayment of the senior notes at maturity.
No one has guaranteed our obligations under the senior notes or has any obligation to provide additional equity financing to us.
The terms of the senior credit facilities require us to maintain specified consolidated financial ratios for net total debt to EBITDA, EBITDA to net cash interest payable and, until 31 March 2005, net senior debt to EBITDA.
Certain of these financial ratios have to be prepared for the preceding 12-month period and reported to the providers of the senior credit facilities on a six-monthly basis from 31 March 2004.
We have maintained the financial ratios for the year ended 31 March 2004 in compliance with these debt covenants.
47 Annual Report 2003 04 Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and their maturity dates as at 31 March 2004: Debt Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Total m Long-term debt 80.0 190.0 677.8 308.2 1,256.0 Revolver loan 5.0 5.0 Operating lease obligations 18.9 27.7 17.1 27.2 90.9 Finance lease obligations 0.8 0.8 Total 104.7 217.7 694.9 335.4 1,352.7 There were no purchase commitments or other long-term liabilities as at 31 March 2004 other than those stated above.
Other Matters Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than the hedges discussed in this document.
Acquisitions In the year ended 31 March 2004, we acquired yellow pages directories in the US including Feist for an aggregate purchase price of $198.9 million 108.6 million plus expenses of $0.5 million 0.3 million.
These acquisitions gave rise to 100.4 million of goodwill recorded in the year.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, we acquired McLeod, one of the largest independent directory publishers in the US, for $600.0 million 417.0 million plus expenses giving rise to $475.0 million 330.0 million of goodwill.
The results of operations of McLeod are included in our results from the date of acquisition on 16 April 2002.
We also made other US acquisitions in the year for an aggregate purchase price of 47.4 million.
These additional acquisitions gave rise to 31.4 million of goodwill recorded in the year.
Effect of the IPO The IPO raised 433.6 million gross proceeds.
We used the proceeds to settle 109.5 million payable on the vendor loan notes: to pay share issue costs of 23.7 million: to pay 79.6 million of exceptional costs: to repay 48.3 million of debt under the senior credit facilities: and to redeem 35% 172.5 million of the senior notes pursuant to the optional redemption features under the indentures.
We also replaced our remaining senior credit facilities with new senior credit facilities of 664 million and $596 million and a revolving credit facility of 200 million.
As a result of the capital-raising, we incurred a number of exceptional or one-off costs, including: cash and non-cash interest charges relating to premiums paid in connection with the redemption of the senior notes and to the write-off of deferred finance costs: charges relating to option grants under existing share ownership plans: fees paid to the owners before the IPO: and other transaction fees and costs arising out of the IPO.
In addition, participants in a plan implemented for certain key employees of Yellow Book and its subsidiaries were entitled to a payment under the Yellow Book Phantom DDB Plan, under which the participants as a group are treated economically as if they had invested approximately 32 million in the Group in the same manner as the funds advanced by the owners before the IPO.
We recorded a compensation charge of $63 million 39 million in connection with this.
In satisfaction of those obligations, the participants in the Yellow Book Phantom DDB Plan exchanged their interests in the plan for Ordinary shares in the Company.
Net Pension Liability We currently operate a defined benefit pension scheme for our UK employees employed before 1 October 2001 that is accounted for on a Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24 basis.
At the last valuation date, 5 April 2002, under SSAP 24 and on an ongoing basis, the assets of the scheme were sufficient to cover 102% of accrued benefits.
Although there has been no formal valuation since this time, it is likely that the funding position has worsened due to recent adverse changes in the capital markets.
We have also complied with the transitional disclosure requirements of UK Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17.
Valuations of this scheme for the purposes of FRS 17 were carried out at 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.
The liability, net of tax, measured in accordance with FRS 17 was 48 Yell Group plc 46.5 million at 31 March 2004 200333.0 million.
The deficit at 31 March 2003 arose primarily as a result of adverse conditions in the capital markets.
The increase in the deficit in the 2004 financial year primarily reflects the increase in the liabilities of the scheme due to changes in inflationary expectations, which exceeded the gains in the asset values due to conditions in the capital markets.
Our employer pension contribution to the defined benefit pension scheme during the 2004 financial year was 9.4 million 20038.0 million.
We will continue to review the funding position of the scheme to determine whether future increases in contributions will be required.
Full details of the SSAP 24 and FRS 17 disclosures are given in note 24 of the notes to the financial statements.
Treasury Policy Our treasury operations primary role is to manage liquidity, investment funding and our financial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit risk.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
Our Board sets the treasury departments policy and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the investments and borrowings under its management.
Counterparty credit risk is closely monitored and managed within controls set by our Board.
It is likely that derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, if entered into, will be used only for hedging purposes.
Market-related Risks Interest is payable under our senior credit facilities at a variable rate.
We could, therefore, be adversely affected if interest rates were to rise significantly.
Under the senior credit facilities agreement dated 8 July 2003 we are required to have fixed or capped interest on at least 50% of net interest payments during the 21 months following each month end.
This requirement ceases once net debt falls below 3.5 times EBITDA.
We have fixed interest on nearly 55% of the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps falling to 50% over the period to March 2006, with a review of this strategy on a quarterly basis.
When combined with the fixed rate senior notes, we have fixed our interest rates on approximately 64% of our total gross debt until March 2006, falling to approximately 30% thereafter.
At 31 March 2004, we had 3.2 million net unrecognised losses on these instruments that will be recognised when the interest is paid.
All of these instruments are entered into for hedging purposes and, under UK GAAP, gains and losses on these instruments are deferred and only recognised in income when the underlying transaction is recorded.
Such instruments have not been designated and do not qualify for hedge accounting under the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for US GAAP purposes.
All significant cash inflows and outflows associated with our operations in the UK are denominated in pounds sterling, and all significant cash inflows and outflows associated with our operations in the US are denominated in US dollars.
However, our financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, and changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and pounds sterling will affect the translation of the results of our operations into pounds sterling.
The composition of our debt partially hedges exchange rate fluctuations, because 37.2% of our debt and 30.7% of our net interest expense are denominated in US dollars, thereby reducing our US EBITDA exposure by approximately 30%.
We do not currently intend to hedge any foreign exchange translation rate risk relating to US dollar-denominated notes or other US financial liabilities, although we will continue to review this practice.
At 31 March 2003, we had 462.0 million of borrowings denominated in US dollars net of deferred financing fees, and 941.6 million of borrowings, also net of deferred financing fees, that accrue interest at variable rates, before taking into account hedging arrangements.
The following examples illustrate the effect certain changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates would have had in the 2004 financial year.
The following discussion of estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis is forward-looking and involves risks and uncertainties.
If the amount or mix of long-term borrowings is different, then the following examples may not be indicative of the effects of changing exchange rates and interest rates.
If the variable interest rates had been a full percentage point higher or lower with no change in foreign exchange rates, then the interest payable with respect to our variable-rate indebtedness in the 2004 financial year would have been 4.5 million higher or lower, respectively, taking into account our hedging arrangements, or 9.9 million higher or lower, respectively, without taking into account hedging arrangements.
49 Annual Report 2003 04 If the average exchange rate of the US dollar as measured against the pound sterling had been 10% higher or lower, with no change in variable rates of interest, then the interest payable in the 2004 financial year would have been approximately 3.2 million lower or 3.9 million higher, respectively.
Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the amount of variable-rate indebtedness that we have outstanding and the extent of any hedging arrangements that we put in place.
Similarly, our exposure to currency fluctuations will depend on the mix of US dollar and pounds sterling-denominated indebtedness and the extent of any hedging arrangements.
Further information on financial instruments and our risk management is discussed in note 17 of the notes to the financial statements.
Significant Differences Between UK and US GAAP Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Differences result primarily from acquisition accounting, which affects the accounting for directories in progress, goodwill and other intangibles, and taxation.
Timing differences also arise when recognising certain costs associated with directories in progress, interest that is fixed by derivative financial instruments, and deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in the US.
Differences in accounting for pensions arise from the requirements to use different actuarial methods and assumptions.
Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in respect of which they are declared in the case of interim or any special dividends or proposed by the Board to the shareholders in the case of final dividends.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
See note 28 of the notes to the financial statements on differences between US GAAP and UK GAAP.
New UK Accounting Standards In December 2003, the Urgent Issues Task Force UITF issued Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
This Abstract is effective for periods ending on or after 22 June 2004, but earlier adoption is encouraged.
We have adopted UITF Abstract 38 in the year ended 31 March 2004 and accordingly have presented shares purchased by the ESOP Trust as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
In April 2004 the Accounting Standards Board, ASB issued Financial Reporting Standard 20 Share based payments, which is the same as IFRS 2, discussed below.
International Financial Reporting Standards In June 2002, the Council of Ministers of the European Union approved a regulation the Regulation requiring all companies that are governed by the law of a Member State of the European Union and whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Regulation is to be effective for each financial year starting on or after 1 January 2005.
Accordingly, we will adopt IFRS from 1 April 2005.
The International Accounting Standards Board IASB issued IFRS 1 a standard on transition to IFRS, in June 2003.
It is expected that there will be more developments in IFRS between now and the 2006 financial year, and consequently there remains some uncertainty about exactly what IFRS will require on 1 April 2005.
This uncertainty is being reduced as the IASB finalises and publishes its standards.
In the meantime, the UK Accounting Standards Board is adopting a phased transition to the conversion of existing UK GAAP.
It is possible that by the implementation date set by the European Union, UK GAAP will not be fully aligned with IFRS.
In February 2004, the IASB issued IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The standard deals with the accounting for transactions where an entity obtains goods or services in consideration for equity instruments or cash-settled amounts based on the value of the entity's equity instruments.
For transactions with employees for example, share option awards, the fair value of the employee services received should be measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date.
The standard is effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The Yell Group has an active programme to consider the effects of adopting IFRS on the Groups reporting systems and financial statements.
50 Yell Group plc Critical Accounting Estimates In general, our accounting policies under UK GAAP are consistent with those generally adopted by others operating within the same industry in the UK.
Our accounting policies are summarised in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, our management has made its best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality.
We regularly review these estimates and update them when required.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Unless otherwise indicated, we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below.
We consider the items to be the most significant estimates, which require our management to make subjective and complex judgements or to consider matters that are inherently uncertain.
Debtors are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectable in the future.
We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified.
We have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience.
Whilst such bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past.
If our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of turnover had been 1.0% higher or lower during the year ended 31 March 2004, then loss before tax would have varied by approximately 12 million.
Goodwill and tangible fixed assets.
Goodwill and tangible fixed assets are long-lived assets that are amortised over their useful lives.
Useful lives are based on managements estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue.
If the useful economic lives had increased or decreased by an average of one year during the year ended 31 March 2004, then our amortisation charge would have varied by approximately 5 million.
Our depreciation charge would have varied by approximately 6 million if the useful lives had increased by an average of one year, or by approximately 14 million if the useful lives had decreased by an average of one year.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable and at the end of the first full year following acquisition.
The determination of our obligation and expense for pensions is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts.
Those assumptions are described in note 24 of the notes to the financial statements and include, amongst others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation.
Whilst we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect the amount of our future pension obligations, future valuation adjustments in the statement of total recognised gains and losses and our future employee expenses.
The determination of our obligation and expense for taxes requires an interpretation of tax law.
We seek appropriate competent and professional tax advice before making any judgements on tax matters.
Whilst we believe that our judgements are prudent and appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience may materially affect our future tax charges.
We recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences where we have a taxable benefit or obligation in the future as a result of past events.
We record deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe they are more likely than not to be realised.
Should we determine that we would be able to realise our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.
In the year ended 31 March 2004, we reduced our net loss for the year by 14 million when we recognised previously unrecognised deferred tax assets that we believe we will realise in the near future.
At 31 March 2004, we had not recognised potential deferred tax assets totalling 8 million.
Current Trading and Prospects Since 31 March 2004, trading has developed favourably and in line with our expectations.
We have put in place substantial groundwork to ensure that our growth momentum continues in the current financial year.
Our strong cash generation should allow us to continue to finance acquisitions in the US and grow dividends in line with earnings.
51 Annual Report 2003 04 Dividend Policy As declared in the Listing Particulars relating to the IPO, the total dividend for the year ended 31 March 2004 will be 62.8 million.
An interim dividend of 3.0 pence per share was paid on 21 December 2003 to shareholders registered on 21 November 2003, and a final dividend of 6 pence per share will be paid to shareholders registered on 23 July 2004 subject to approval by the shareholders of the company.
