The groups core philosophy has been to build well-defined, value-added businesses focused on serving the needs of select market niches where the group can compete effectively.
Investecs strategic goals and objectives are motivated by the desire to develop an efficient and integrated business on an international scale through the active pursuit of clearly established core competencies in the groups four principal business areas, namely: Investment Banking Private Client Activities Treasury and Specialised Finance Asset Management In addition, Investecs head office provides certain group-wide integrating functions including Risk Management, Information Technology, Finance, Investor Relations, Marketing, Human Resources and Organisational Development.
It is also responsible for the groups central funding as well as other activities, such as its Property business, Trade Finance and Traded Endowments operations.
The business divisions are effectively managed as autonomous international business segments, enabling them to remain focused on trends and dynamics within their particular industries.
Notwithstanding, as a result of the inter-related nature of their target markets and activities, a degree of interaction takes place between each business to ensure clients benefit from dealing with the broader Investec group.
The groups services are supplemented by a common thrust consisting of the groups culture, mission and philosophies.
This helps the business segments across the jurisdictions to operate as an integrated network.
History of significant events Since Investec was founded in South Africa in 1974, it has expanded through a combination of substantial organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions in South Africa, the UK and other geographies in which Investec operates.

Integrated global management structure Investecs management structure, reporting lines and responsibilities have been built around geographic, product and functional roles.
It is structured around global divisional leaders, global roles and geographic business leaders.
This management structure enables the group to meet the challenge of regional responsiveness and global competence.
The integrated global model enables the group to take advantage of best economies of scale, leverage resources and core competencies, and exploit synergies across all regions in which the group operates.
The directors believe that the links between its overlapping parts, and the degree of effective integration, make the structure an effective model.
The quality of the links is a result of values-based behaviour and practice, which are key drivers of Investecs culture.

In the view of the directors it would not be meaningful to provide this information by class of business since economic capital of certain significant businesses of the group is not held in, or allocated to, these businesses, but is held centrally.

Segmental analysis continued The Statement of Recommended Practice on Segmental Reporting by Banks recommends, inter alia, net assets to be disclosed by class of business and geographical segment.
In the view of the directors it would not be meaningful to provide this information by class of business since the economic capital of certain significant businesses of the group is not held in, or allocated to, these businesses, but is held centrally.
Similarly, an analysis by geographical segment would not be meaningful, because of the way in which the Group has been structured and funded historically.
The Statement of Recommended Practice on Segmental Reporting by Banks and the Companies Act recommends the disclosure by geographical segment of gross income, consisting of interest receivable, dividend income, fees and commissions receivable, dealing profits and other operating income.
In the view of the directors, interest receivable and fees and commissions receivable are monitored on a net basis and an aggregate split of fees and commissions receivable and payable by geographical segment would not provide meaningful disclosure.
Consequently, gross income is not separately disclosed.
The Statement of Recommended Practice on Segmental Reporting by banks recommends that the geographical analysis be based on the location of the office at which the transaction was recorded or the location of the customer.
The group geographical analysis is based on the location of the office at which the transaction was recorded, except for the traded endowment business.
Although the traded endowment business is conducted and recorded in the United Kingdom, it has been allocated to the South African segment as the business is held by Investec Limited and managed as part of the South African operations.

Notes to the financial statements 9.
Non-operational exceptional items 2004 Losses of 5.1 million on termination of the group's operations in the US were recorded.
This charge was raised in the first half of the current financial year and to the extent that any costs are incurred in future periods inclusive of the second half of the 2004 financial year in excess of this charge, they will be treated as non-exceptional operating expenses.
There was no tax or minority effect on the above.
A 13.6 million profit on disposal of group operations relating to the sale of the companies, 100 Grayston Drive Property Pty Limited, Block E Power Station Properties Pty Limited, Westrust Pty Ltd, and Investec Bank Botswana Limited at market value.
The tax effect and minority interest in relation to the 13.6 million profit was 678 000 and 75 000 respectively.
2003 Losses of 28.5 million in respect of the disposal and termination of substantial components of the US operations.
Profit of 5.8 million on the termination of the Securities Investment Bank Limited.
Costs of 6.1 million relating to the fundamental reorganisation and restructuring of business units within the Group.
No tax credit is attributable to this cost in the year as the group has not recognised a deferred tax asset for all of its losses in the year due to the level of total deferred tax asset compared to forecast profit in the legal entities in which the tax losses reside.
These unrecognised losses have been treated as attributable to the reorganisation and restructuring costs.

Assumptions The economic assumptions are based upon a long-term view of economic activity in South Africa and are therefore not adjusted for market movements which are considered to be short term.
This approach is considered to be the most appropriate given the long-term nature of the portfolio of products and that the business is located in South Africa.
The economic assumptions are derived by adding appropriate long term risk equity margins to the benchmark gilt i. e. R153 South African government bond.
The principal economic assumptions which have been used are as follows: % % Risk-adjusted discount rate 12.8 13.4 Return on equities gross of tax 11.8 12.4 Return on fixed interest securities gross of tax 9.8 10.4 Return on property investments gross of tax 10.8 11.4 Return on cash held gross of tax 7.8 7.4 Inflation rate 6.8 6.4 195 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 000 2004 2003 25.

Staff Share Scheme The Bank operates a share option and a share purchase scheme for employees.
The number of ordinary shares conditionally allocated to employees are disclosed in note 23 Movements in the number of share options issued for 1 share each, held by employees are as follows: Each option is in respect of one share.
"Number Number Outstanding at 1 April 15 156 463 5 657 874 Issued during the year 2 062 413 10 667 827 Exercised 31 477 5 940 Lapsed 1 625 407 1 163 298 Outstanding at 31 March 15 561 992 15 156 463 The purpose of the Staff Share Scheme is to promote an ""esprit fide corps"" within the organisation, create an awareness of Investec's performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group."
The group makes shares or debentures available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the Group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the group and stock market conditions.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members a share allocation approximately equal to their annual package after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff, participants may not deal in any shares acquired in terms of the Scheme within two years of accepting them.
Thereafter they may acquire them over a minimum period of a further three years or maximum period of a further eight years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance, and contribution made by, the respective staff members.
In addition to the Staff Share Scheme, other incentive schemes are operated by the group.
Whilst the objectives of such schemes are identical to the Staff Share Scheme, membership of them is not extended to all staff members but to key members of the group whom executive management believe are in a position to add significant value to the group.
Whilst housed in different structures from the Staff Share Scheme the underlying assets in them are group instruments.
Any benefit derived by the members from such schemes is thus totally dependent on the performance of the group.
The extent of the directors interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on pages 129 to 133.
