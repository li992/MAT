In calculating the pension expense for the UK schemes and in determining the expected rate of return, the Group uses the value of assets at the start of the year.
The UK Schemes assets were allocated 48% to equities, 12% to corporate bonds, 18% to UK gilts, 10% to property and 12% to other investments at 31st December 2004 and 49% to equities, 11% to corporate bonds, 20% to UK gilts, 9% to property and 11% to other investments at 31st December 2003.
The year-end allocations are within the schemes target ranges.
Shareholders Interest in the Retail Long-term Assurance Fund Changes in the net present value of the profits inherent in the in-force policies of the retail long-term assurance fund are included in the profit and loss account.
In estimating the net present value of the profits inherent in the in-force policies, the calculations use assumed economic parameters future investment returns, expense inflation and risk discount rate, taxation, mortality, persistency, expenses and the required levels of regulatory and solvency capital.
The returns on fixed interest investments are set to market yields at the period end.
The returns on UK and overseas equities and property are set relative to fixed interest returns.
The expense inflation assumption reflects long-term expectations of both earnings and retail price inflation.
The risk discount rate is set to market yields on Government securities plus a margin to allow for the risks borne.
The mortality, persistency and expense assumptions are chosen to represent best estimates of future experience and are based on current business experience.
As with the pension calculation, there is an acceptable range in which these estimates can validly fall, and the income recognised in the accounts could be significantly altered if different estimates had been chosen.

113 Financial review Total assets and liabilities and capital resources Capital ratios Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Group, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed by the Basel Union on Banking Supervision the Basel Committee and European Union Directives, as implemented by the Financial Services Authority FSA for supervisory purposes.
These techniques include the risk asset ratio calculation, which the FSA regards as a key supervisory tool.
The FSA sets ratio requirements for individual banks in the UK at or above the internationally agreed minimum of 8%.
The ratio calculation involves the application of designated risk weightings to reflect an estimate of credit, market and other risks associated with broad categories of transactions and counterparties.
Regulatory guidelines define three Tiers of capital resources.
Tier 1 capital, comprising mainly shareholders funds and including Reserve Capital Instruments and Tier One Notes, is the highest tier and can be used to meet trading and banking activity requirements.
Tier 2 includes perpetual, medium-term and long-term subordinated debt, general provisions for bad and doubtful debts and fixed asset revaluation reserves.
Tier 2 capital can also be used to support both trading and banking activities.
Tier 3 capital also comprises short-term subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of two years.
The use of tier 3 capital is restricted to trading activities only and it is not eligible to support counterparty or settlement risk.
The aggregate of tiers 2 and 3 capital included in the risk asset ratio calculation may not exceed tier 1 capital.
b Subordinated liabilities are included in Tiers 2 or 3, subject to limits laid down in the supervisory requirements.
Barclays retains significant capacity to raise additional capital within these limits.
c Comprises revaluation reserves attributable to minorities 2m 2003: 2m, 2002: 2m.
d Includes 610m 2003: 478m, 2002: 867m of shareholders interest in the retail life-fund.
Net capital resources grew by 4.1% 1bn.
Tier 1 capital rose by 1.7bn with retained profits of 1.7bn and the issue of 0.7bn of preference shares being offset by share repurchases of 0.7bn.
Tier 2 capital fell by 3% 0.3bn and tier 3 capital remained broadly as reported at 31st December 2003.
The overall growth in weighted risk assets of 29.6bn comprised trading book weighted assets growth of 37% 10.9bn and banking book weighted assets of 11.7% 18.7bn.
