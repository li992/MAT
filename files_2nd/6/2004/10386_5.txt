Ruby McGregor-Smith GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR The maturity profile of banking facilities is reviewed regularly and the facilities are extended and replaced as appropriate, well in advance of their expiry.
Further details on financial assets and liabilities are given in Note 15 to the Accounts.
Accounting Developments FRS5 Application Note G The Group has adopted FRS 5 Application Note G during the year as this is the first year for which it is applicable.
It is considered appropriate under this Application Note that the Group now recognises revenue in respect of its performance under contracts as they progress where, in prior periods, revenue on certain contracts was only recognised for contract work completed in the year.
The Directors do not consider that the effect of implementing the Application Note is material in either period, with the consequence that the prior-year Profit and Loss Account has not been restated.
Where appropriate, contract work in progress, amounts recoverable on contracts and trade debtors have been restated in respect of the prior-year in order to make them comparable with the classifications being used this year.
