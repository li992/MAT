The Group adopted UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts with effect from 1 January 2004.
This requires that the 3.3 3.1 value of the shares held by the ESOP Trust and the associated share 3.7 scheme creditor are deducted from reserves.
As a result a prior 2.4 period adjustment of 4.1m has been made to reduce the net 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 assets at 31 December 2003.
Margins have increased from 2.4% in 2000, our first full year As part of the UKs convergence with International Financial as a purely automotive services group, to 4.2% in 2004.

Limits are in place which reduce credit risk by stipulating the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty dependent upon the applicable credit rating.
Credit ratings and the appropriate limits are reviewed regularly.
Currency risk The Group faces currency risk on its net assets and earnings, a significant proportion of which are in currencies other than sterling.
On translation into sterling, currency movements can affect the Group balance sheet and profit and loss account.
Group policy is to minimise balance sheet translation exposures, where fiscally efficient, by financing working capital requirements in local currency and maximising the remittances of overseas earnings into sterling.
The Group has transactional currency exposures where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than in that units reporting currency.
For a significant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local currency.
In particular, local billing arrangements are in place for many businesses with our principals.
For those businesses that continue to be billed in foreign currency, Group policy is that committed transactional exposures are hedged into the reporting currency of that business.
If possible, foreign exchange exposures will be matched internally before being hedged externally.
Hedging instruments are approved by the Board and are restricted to forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and foreign exchange currency swaps.
Foreign exchange currency swaps are also used to hedge transaction exposures arising on cross border Group loans.
