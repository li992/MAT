Significant changes in our approach Following the acquisitions of Prognoz, Nezhda and Amikan in the year and the related judgements associated with accounting for these transactions, we have added identified a key audit matter in respect of accounting for corporate transactions.
As noted above, we have also revised our scoping in 2018 with more testing performed centrally and fewer full scope audits at the component level.

To challenge managements recoverability assessment, we have analysed the metal inventory balances to identify adverse changes in costs per unit, and reviewed the production reports specifically focusing on unusual variances in grades of ore extracted, stockpiled and processed, achieved recoveries and technical losses in comparison to prior periods and approved life of mine plans.
Where a recoverability risk has been identified, we have recalculated the projected net realisable values based on expected commodity prices, technological recoveries and costs to complete.
We challenged managements assumptions against the achieved technological recoveries, actual processing costs in the year and the approved life of mine plans.

We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Key audit matter During the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group has completed a number of acquisitions resulting in description it obtaining control of the mining operations at Prognoz for a consideration of US$218 million, Nezhda for a consideration of US$144 million and Amikan for a consideration of US$19.7m.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: The accounting for these acquisitions involves a number of key judgements, specifically in respect of determining if Group materiality US$21 million 2017: US$22 million each of the acquisitions is a business combination or an asset acquisition, calculating the purchase price allocation PPA to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the business acquired, the gain arising on revaluation of pre-existing Basis for determining materiality We used the Groups adjusted profit before tax as a key benchmark, supported by a range of stake and specifically in relation to Prognoz estimating the fair value of the contingent consideration.

This approach is consistent with our 2017 audit and the selected materiality figure represents 4.9% of the adjusted profit We note that the PPA in respect of the Nezhda and Amikan acquisitions are still preliminary assessments, before tax figure 2017: 4.9% and 1.5% of net assets 2017: 1.7%.

We also evaluated the design and implementation of relevant controls relating to the acquisition process.

We reviewed whether the life of mine plans used in the NPV models are based on the most up-to-date Ore Component materiality range $18.9m to $8.4m Reserve and Mineral Resource reports prepared by managements experts.
We evaluated the consistency of the key assumptions used in the preparation of those reports with the assumptions used in the valuation models and assessed the competence, experience and objectivity of managements experts.
Specifically in respect of the Prognoz contingent consideration, we involved Deloitte valuation specialists to test the integrity and output of the valuation model used.
We have also checked that the inputs to the model are consistent with those tested in the NPV models or can be reconciled to third party documentation.

An overview of the scope of our audit The Group holds various mining assets in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia.
Our scoping identified 12 components Svetloye, Dukat, Omolon, Albazino, Voro, Kyzyl, Varvara, Amursk, Mayskoye, Okhotsk, Armenia, together with a single component comprising the support function corporate entities.
Our 2018 scoping differentiated between balances which, following increased centralisation and standardisation of the Groups processes and controls, could be tested centrally, and those which needed to be tested at the local component level.
For balances which were tested centrally, we have performed substantive audit procedures on all components.
We determined the scope of the procedures to be performed at each component on the balances not tested centrally.
We have performed full scope audits at Svetloye, Dukat, Omolon, Albazino, Voro and Kyzyl with focused procedures on specific risks performed at Varvara, Amursk, Mayskoye and the Corporate component, and an analytical review of the Okhotsk and Armenian components.
This represents a change from our 2017 scoping where all component were subject to a full scope audit with the exception of the Armenian component, where focussed procedures were performed.
The Group audit team was involved in the work of the component auditors at all stages of the audit process.
The signing partner and senior members of the Group engagement team visited the head office in St. Petersburg regularly throughout the year and during the final audit in 2019.
Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component, which were between US$8.4 million and US$18.9m 2017: US$8.8 million and US$19.8 million.
