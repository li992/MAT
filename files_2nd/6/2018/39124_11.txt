Despite the adjustments required to receivables, net assets and earnings, it is important to note that IFRS 9 only changes the timing ofprofits made on a loan.
The Groups underwriting and scorecards areunaffected by the change in accounting.
The ultimate profitability of a loan is the same under both IAS 39 and IFRS 9 and more fundamentally the cash flows and capital generation over the life of aloan remain unchanged.
The calculation of the Groups bank covenants are unaffected by IFRS 9, as they are based on accounting standards in place at the time the covenants were set.
Based on transitional arrangements, the regulatory capital impact of IFRS 9 isbeing phased in on a transitional basis over five years.
