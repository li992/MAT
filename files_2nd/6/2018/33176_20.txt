The differences arise from transactions with unconsolidated subsidiaries, with the total return for, and net asset value of, the Company being the same under either basis.
Derivatives relating specifically to the Oystercatcher subsidiary are reclassified as capital return in this analysis.
The size of this adjustment is expected to reduce in future periods as the derivatives relating to the interest rate exposure have been closed out during the year and the new Singapore dollar debt taken out by the subsidiary has created anatural hedge, which has reduced the requirement for Singapore dollar hedging.
Management fees paid directly to 3i plc by intermediate unconsolidated holding companies are shown as costs in this analysis, instead of a reduction of income or capital in the financial statements.
Following the sale of AWG and Elenia, the fees due from the entities holding these investments are no longer payable and the relevant cash balances in these entities will be distributed to the Company.
Some dividend income received from portfolio assets by unconsolidated Luxembourg subsidiaries was not paid up to the Company prior to the year end and is therefore not recognised as income in the financial statements but appears as a capital return in the financial statements.

These are reflected in capital returns or income as they have reduced either the carrying value, or the income distributed from these subsidiaries.
