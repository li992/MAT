The remainder of the movement represents various savings beyond synergies of $1.4m.
Adjusted Cost of Revenues represent the Groups cost of revenues adjusted for depreciation and amortisation charges, share-based payments charges, exceptional items, COGS deferral adjustment, gross-up adjustment and Piriform pre-acquisition costs.
The Groups statutory Cost of revenues increased by $ 11.1 m to $ 241.4 m primarily due to the increase in Revenue, partially off set by realised synergies and decrease in amortisation of acquisition intangibles.
The amortisation of acquisition intangibles represents intangible assets acquired through business combinations which does not re ect the ongoing normal level of amortisation in the business.

The increase was caused by negative FX impact of $ 3.1 m, additional PLC costs of $ 4.0 m, investment into personnel costs of $ 22.9 m, offi ce costs and equipment of $ 5.0 m, marketing and paid search of $ 5.1 m, consultancy and outsourced services of $ 3.6 m, IT services and maintenance costs of $ 2.9 m and other costs of $ 1.1 m. Adjusted Operating costs represent the Groups operating costs adjusted for depreciation and amortisation charges, share-based payments charges, exceptional items and Piriform pre-acquisition costs.
Avast annual report 2018 39 The increase in the Groups statutory operating costs of $ 20.3 m, from $ 298.3 m to $ 318.6 m, re ects an increase in share-based payments, and investment into personnel and non-personnel costs, off set by realised synergies and lower exceptional costs.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material and non-recurring items of income and expense which the Group believes should be separately disclosed to show the underlying business performance of the Group more accurately.
Exceptional items in 2018 represent mainly IPO costs related to one-time advisory, legal and other professional service fees see Note 10 Exceptional Items.
Total IPO costs comprise of $ 18.8 m recorded to income statement in 2018, $ 4.1 m accrued in trade payables in 2017 and additional $ 4.0 m direct share issue expenses recorded to equity, which gives total IPO costs of $ 26.8 m. The full cash impact of IPO costs was recorded in 2018 showing $ 4.0 m under the cash ows from nancing activities as directly linked to the share issue and the remaining $ 22.8 m is included in the cash ows from operating activities.
A smaller amount of exceptional items $6.8m in 2018 relates to restructuring programs in respect of business combinations with AVG and with Piriform and represents the run-off of programs implemented in prior periods.
Final items of restructuring and integration with AVG were recognised in Q4 2018 as the programme is now complete and no further costs will be recorded.
Finance income and expense Adjusted finance expense on a net basis was $92.3m in 2018, $2.1m higher compared to $90.2m in 2017.
The increase was driven by higher FX translation losses in 2018 by $13.4m, off set by lower total loan interest costs by $4.6m resulting from the repayment of $300m debt post IPO see Note 29 Term Loan, positive impact from revaluation of interest CAP of $5.0m and other savings in finance costs of $1.7m.
The Groups statutory net finance costs decreased by $87.3m to $65.9m in 2018 mainly due to unrealised foreign exchange gains in 2018 from the Euro denominated debt, compared to unrealised foreign exchange losses recognised in 2017.

The decrease in Income tax costs was primarily caused by the transfer of AVG E-comm web shop to Avast Software B. V. Avast BV on 1 May 2018.
Subsequently, the former Dutch AVG business from Avast BV including the web shop was sold to Avast Software s. r. o.
As a result, a deferred tax asset of $143.8m was recognised in Avast Software s. r. o.
In addition, an exit charge of $ 49.4 m has been agreed upon with the Dutch tax authorities to be paid in 1H 2019.
The total tax impact of the IP Intellectual Property transfer of $94.4m recognised in the statutory Income tax was treated as an exceptional item.
The Group recognised an additional deferred tax bene t of $5.6m as a result of the Piriform IP transfer into the UK.
The current tax expense related to the transaction was $0.7m.
The net tax eff ect of the transaction is a tax bene t of $4.9m and is treated as an exceptional item.
The gain from the Piriform IP transfer was off set by income tax costs, arising from the write-down of a deferred tax asset.
When reviewing previously recognised tax losses across the Group it was determined that it was not probable that the full amount of these losses will be recoverable against future taxable pro ts in relevant jurisdictions.
As a result, $5.6m was recorded as income tax costs, treated as an exceptional item as it relates to prior periods.
Income tax was further impacted by the tax bene t of foreign exchange movements on inter-company loans arising in the statutory accounts of the subsidiary concerned of $ 9.8 m $19.0m in 2017.
The bene t was treated as an exceptional item.
The tax impact of adjusted items represents the tax impact of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, deferred revenue haircut reversal arising from prior acquisitions, and exceptional costs and other adjusted items, which has been calculated applying the tax rate that the Group determined to be applicable to the relevant item.
40 Avast annual report 2018 Strategic report Governance Statements CFOs review Adjusted Income tax is $ 68.4 m for FY 2018, resulting in an adjusted eff ective tax rate of 20.2%.

Adjusted for the impact of renegotiation of payment terms with shopping cart and payment 1 processing partners, the cash conversion in FY 2018 would be 78% cash conversion in FY 2017 was 77%.
Capex in 2018 remained stable at 2% of Adjusted revenue 2% in FY 2017.
The increase in cash tax is driven by the increase in taxable income and the Czech Republic true-up system, where a company is obliged to make quarterly income tax advances based on its last known tax liability.
Upon ling a tax return, tax advances paid during the year for which the tax return is led off set the final tax liability.
As the taxable income for 2017 was signi cantly higher than the taxable income for 2016, the reported cash tax in H1 2018 was higher.
This true up occurs in H1 of each year and was as expected.

The cash impact of exceptional costs in 2017 was primarily driven by the payment of the outstanding amounts at the end of 2016 related to the acquisition and integration with AVG.
The Groups net cash out ow from investing activities of $28.8m was comprised of capex of $16.8m, consideration paid for InLoop acquisition net of cash acquired of $4.2m see Note 2 Business combinations in 2018, payment of the remaining portion of the consideration for the acquisition of AVG Technologies B.

Notes: 1 Under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, an acquirer must recognise assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date.
The process of determining the fair value of deferred revenues acquired often results in a signi cant downward adjustment to the targets book value of deferred revenues.
The reversal of the downward adjustment to the book value of deferred revenues of companies the Group has acquired during the periods under review is referred to as the Deferred Revenue Haircut Reversal.
2 The Gross-Up Adjustment refers to the estimated impact of the additional amount of 2015 and 2016 revenue and expenses and their deferral that would have been recognised by Avast had the contractual arrangements with certain customers quali ed to have been recognised on a gross rather than a net basis prior to 2017 AVG had historically recognised Billings and revenues on a gross basis, whereas Avast recognised them on a net basis.
Both businesses recognise revenue on a gross basis since 2017.
3 There was no deferred cost of goods sold COGS balance consolidated by the Group in the acquisition balance sheet of AVG in 2016 and thus no subsequent expense was recorded as the revenue in respect of pre-acquisition date billings was recognised.
The COGS Deferral Adjustments refers to an adjustment to re ect the recognition of deferred cost of goods sold expenses that would have been recorded in 2016 and 2017 in respect of pre-acquisition date AVG billings, had the AVG and the Groups businesses always been combined and had AVG always been deferring cost of goods sold.
