Free cash flow generation and the conversion of profits into cash continue to be a priority and are one of the Groups key performance indicators, providing flexibility for paying down debt, future investment and consistent Shareholder returns.
Free cash flow advanced to 503.2m in 2018.
The Groups stated target range for leverage is between 2.0 and 2.5 times, with the potential to reach around 3.0 times for acquisitions.
Given the strength of our cash flow generation, we are targeting to reduce leverage from 2.9 times at year end to within range by the end of 2019.

COM INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 79 Strategic Report Financial Review continued Income statement In 2018, the first year following the completion of the 2014-2017 Growth Acceleration Plan, we delivered a fifth consecutive year of growth in revenue, adjusted profit, adjusted earnings and cash flow.
Revenue increased by 34.9% to 2,369.5m and adjusted operating profit by 34.4% to 732.1m, with revenue growing by 3.7% on an underlying basis and adjusted operating profit by 2.3%.
2017 restated for the implementation of IFRS 15.
Measurement and adjustments In addition to the statutory results, adjusted results are prepared for the income statement, including adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
The Board considers these non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP measures as the most appropriate way to measure the Groups performance because it is comparable to the prior year.
This is also in line with the similarly adjusted measures used by peers and therefore facilitates comparison.
The adjusting items section provides a reconciliation between statutory operating profit and adjusted operating profit by Division.
Adjusted results are prepared to provide a useful alternative measure to explain the Groups business performance and include recurring and non-recurring items.
Underlying refers to results adjusted for acquisitions disposals, the phasing of events, including biennials, and the effects of changes in foreign currency.
Year-on-year growth from acquisitions disposals is included on a pro-forma basis from first day of ownership.
Reported figures exclude all such adjustments.
Underlying revenue and adjusted operating profit growth are reconciled to reported growth as follows: Underlying Phasing and Acquisitions Currency Reported growth other items and disposals change growth 2018 Revenue 3.7% 0.4% 35.4% 3.8% 34.9% Adjusted operating profit 2.3% 0.1% 37.6% 5.4% 34.4% 2017 Revenue 3.4% 0.1% 21.4% 5.7% 30.6% Adjusted operating profit 2.3% 0.4% 20.8% 8.4% 31.1% 80 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Adjusting items The adjusting items below have been excluded from adjusted results.
The total charge against operating profit for adjusting items rose to 368.9m in 2018 2017: 200.2m, mainly due to the combination with UBM, with the amortisation of acquired intangible assets comprising by far the largest item in both years.
2 2018 2017 m m Intangible amortisation and impairment: 1 Intangible asset amortisation 243.6 157.8 Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangibles 9.8 5.6 Acquisition costs 42.9 4.4 Integration costs 46.0 19.6 Restructuring and reorganisation costs: Redundancy and reorganisation costs 8.1 6.7 Vacant property costs 5.0 6.2 Remeasurement of contingent consideration 0.1 0.1 UAE VAT charge 9.1 Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP equalisation 4.5 Adjusting items in operating profit 368.9 200.2 Profit loss on disposal of subsidiaries and operations 1.1 17.4 Investment income 1.2 Finance costs 1.0 Adjusting items in profit before tax 367.6 217.6 Tax related to adjusting items 55.7 62.6 Tax adjusting item for US federal tax reform 85.4 Adjusting items in profit for the year 311.9 69.6 1.
Intangible asset amortisation is in respect of acquired intangibles and excludes amortisation of software and product development.
The increase in intangible asset amortisation in 2018 primarily reflects the six and a half months of amortisation of acquired intangibles relating to the UBM acquisition.
For the Group, other intangible amortisation relates to book lists and journal titles, acquired databases, customer and attendee relationships, and brands related to exhibitions and conferences.
Intangible asset amortisation arising from software assets and product development is not treated as an adjusting item and so not included in the table, as it is treated as an ordinary cost in the calculation of adjusted operating profit.
Acquisition costs of 42.9m included 41.1m of costs relating to the acquisition of UBM, with integration costs of 46.0m including 39.5m relating to the integration of UBM.
Following the introduction of Value Added Tax on 1 January 2018 in the UAE the Group identified and reported an underpayment during 2018 and made a correcting payment.
In January 2019 the UAE tax authorities assessed a tax penalty of 9.1m in relation to the late payment.
The Group is disputing this penalty assessment: however, an amount of 9.1m has been provided for within adjusting items in the year.
COM INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 81 Strategic Report Financial Review continued Following the completion of the Growth Acceleration Plan at the end of 2017, all four Operating Divisions delivered positive underlying revenue growth in 2018.
Combined with the stub period contribution from UBM, this produced Group underlying revenue growth of 3.7% and underlying profit growth of 2.3%, as illustrated in the following table: GE AP BI K&N UBM Total m m m m m m Revenue 575.8 533.2 385.6 261.4 613.5 2,369.5 Reported revenue growth 2.7% 0.6% 0.6% 7.6% n a 34.9% Underlying revenue growth 6.7% 2.2% 2.6% 2.3% 3.7% 3.7% Statutory operating profit 116.4 138.3 69.3 9.2 30.0 363.2 Add back: 1 Intangible asset amortisation 67.5 52.7 22.8 15.6 85.0 243.6 Impairment of intangibles 5.7 4.1 9.8 Acquisition costs 0.7 0.3 0.2 41.7 42.9 Integration costs 1.8 0.4 1.3 0.6 41.9 46.0 Restructuring and reorganisation costs 0.9 6.7 4.5 1.0 13.1 Remeasurement of contingent consideration 2.0 7.3 9.2 0.1 UAE VAT charge 9.1 9.1 GMP equalisation 0.3 0.2 4.0 4.5 Adjusted operating profit 200.1 198.4 91.1 39.9 202.6 732.1 Underlying adjusted operating profit growth 6.0% 0.3% 0.9% 2.1% 2.2% 2.3% 1.
Intangible asset amortisation is in respect of acquired intangibles, and excludes amortisation of software and product development.
Net finance costs Adjusted net finance costs, consisting principally of interest costs on US private placement loan notes, bond and bank borrowings, increased by 23.3m to 82.4m.
The increase mainly reflects the effect of higher average debt levels following the acquisition of UBM in June 2018.
This increased net debt by 1,211.9m, taking into account a cash consideration of 643.5m and 568.4m of net debt acquired.
Finance costs also increased due to higher US LIBOR rates in the year.
Net interest paid increased by 12.4m to 64.2m, primarily associated with the interest payment on the additional debt finance from the UBM acquisition.
Taxation Approach to tax The Group continues to recognise that taxes paid are part of the economic benefit created for the societies in which we operate, and that a fair and effective tax system is in the interests of taxpayers and society at large.
We aim to comply with tax laws and regulations everywhere the Group does business.
Informa has open and constructive working relationships with tax authorities worldwide and our approach balances the interests of stakeholders including Shareholders, governments, colleagues and the communities in which we operate.
Tax expense The Groups effective tax rate ETR reflects the blend of tax rates and profits in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
The decrease in the ETR principally relates to the impact of a lower tax rate in the US following recent US tax reform and the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions, primarily in relation to legacy UBM matters.
Tax payments During 2018, the Group paid 82.4m 2017: 45.3m of corporation and similar taxes on profits.
The increase relates to tax payments by UBM companies, the timing of which was weighted to the second half of the year.
82 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements A breakdown of the main geographies in which the Group paid tax is as follows: 2018 2017 m m UK 39.9 39.0 Continental Europe 7.7 2.3 United States 1.7 3.2 China including Hong Kong 25.2 3.3 Rest of World 7.9 3.9 Total 82.4 45.3 The reconciliation of the adjusted tax charge to cash taxes paid is as follows: 1 2018 2017 m m Tax charge on adjusted profit before tax PBT per Consolidated Income Statement 116.2 103.0 Movement in deferred tax including US tax losses 5.3 22.0 Current tax deductions in respect of adjusting items 29.4 39.4 Movement in provisions for uncertain tax positions 5.6 0.7 Taxes paid in different year to charged 4.7 4.4 Taxes paid per Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 82.4 45.3 Less: tax relating to Penton acquisition forward contract 11.8 Taxes paid per free cash flow 82.4 33.5 1.
At the end of 2018, the deferred tax asset relating to US tax losses was 106.0m 2017: 45.6m, which is expected to be utilised against future US profits.
Goodwill is not amortised, and as a result, there is no charge to adjusting items for goodwill amortisation.
However, there can be an allowable tax benefit for certain goodwill amortisation in the US and elsewhere, and so where this benefit arises, it reduces the tax charge on adjusted profits.
The amortisation of intangible assets is considered an adjusting item.
Therefore, the 16.7m 2017: 27.3m current tax deduction taken in respect of the amortisation of intangible assets is also treated as an adjusting item and is included in the current tax deductions in respect of adjusting items noted above.
Tax contribution The Groups total tax contribution, which comprises all material taxes paid out of profits and other material taxes paid by our businesses, was 139.1m in 2018 2017: 82.3m.
The geographic split of our total tax contribution was as follows: UK US Other Total m m m m Profit taxes borne 39.9 1.7 40.8 82.4 Employment taxes borne 23.6 17.8 7.5 48.9 Other taxes e. g. business rates 4.6 1.7 1.5 7.8 Total 68.1 21.2 49.8 139.1 In addition to the above, in 2018 we collected taxes on behalf of governments e. g. employee taxes and sales taxes amounting to 177.8m 2017: 126.1m.
COM INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 83 Strategic Report Financial Review continued Earnings per share Diluted adjusted earnings per share EPS increased 7.0% to 49.2p 2017: 46.0p, calculated on the adjusted earnings for the year of 519.8m 2017: 380.4m.
The increase reflects a 36.6% increase in adjusted earnings together with a 28.0% increase in the average number of shares.
Statutory diluted earnings per share decreased by 47.6% to 19.7p, principally reflecting the increased cost of adjusting items in the year.
The share increase comes from the time-pro-rated effect of the equity issued as part of Informas acquisition of UBM, with 427.5m shares issued to the Shareholders of UBM on 18 June 2018.

Dividends In 2018, 201.9m 2017: 162.0m of dividends were paid to external Shareholders and 8.6m 2017: 2.0m of dividends were paid to non-controlling interests.
On 28 June 2018, in the post-acquisition ownership period of UBM, there was also a special dividend payment of 59.0m to the former Shareholders of UBM.
This settled a dividend liability whose payment had been agreed prior to the acquisition date.
The Group maintains a progressive dividend policy, with the aim to grow dividends broadly in line with earnings year-on-year.
This approach aims to achieve a balance between sufficiently rewarding Shareholders, and retaining the financial strength and flexibility to reinvest in the business and pursue growth opportunities.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 14.85p per share 2017: 13.80p per share.
Subject to Shareholder approval at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 31 May 2019 to Ordinary Shareholders registered as at the close of business on 26 April 2019.
This will result in total dividends for the year of 21.90p per share 2017: 20.45p representing a 7.1% year-on-year increase.
The growth in earnings in 2018 means dividend cover against adjusted earnings was 2.2 times 2017: 2.2 times.
Translation impact As a result of the Groups strategic expansion in the US since 2014, the Group has a high exposure to US dollar revenues and costs.
In 2018, the Group received in its revenue approximately 61% 2017: 65% in USD or currencies pegged to USD, 6% 2017: 5% in Euro and 7% 2017: 2% in Chinese renminbi and incurred in its costs approximately 53% 2017: 55% in USD or currencies pegged to USD, 2% 2017: 4% in Euro and 6% 2017: 2% in Chinese renminbi.
Each one cent $0.01 movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa 11.4m 2017: 8.5m impact on annual revenue, a circa 4.5m 2017: 3.5m impact on annual adjusted operating profit and a circa 0.4p 2017: 0.3p impact on full-year adjusted diluted EPS, based on the 31 December 2018 closing rate.
The following USD rates versus GBP were applied during the year: 2018 2017 Closing rate Average rate Closing rate Average rate USD 1.27 1.33 1.35 1.29 For the purposes of testing debt covenant levels and calculating Informas leverage, both profit and net debt are translated using the average exchange rate during the relevant year.
84 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Free cash flow Cash flow generation remains one of the Groups priorities and strengths, providing the funds and flexibility for future investment.
The following table shows the adjusted operating profit reconciled to free cash flow.
Free cash flow is a key financial measure of cash generation and represents the cash flow generated by the business before cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals and their related costs, dividends, and any new equity issuance or purchases.
4 2018 2017 m m Adjusted operating profit 732.1 544.9 Depreciation of property and equipment 13.1 9.2 Software and product development amortisation and impairment 42.5 24.8 Share-based payments 8.1 5.4 Pension curtailment gain 0.8 Adjusted share of joint venture and associate results 1.0 1 Adjusted EBITDA 794.0 584.3 Net capital expenditure 59.4 79.0 2 Working capital movement 62.3 10.5 Pension deficit contributions 4.4 Operating cash flow 667.9 494.8 Restructuring and reorganisation 18.1 8.6 Net interest 64.2 51.8 3 Taxation 82.4 33.5 Free cash flow 503.2 400.9 1.
Adjusted EBITDA represents adjusted operating profit before interest, tax, and non-cash items including depreciation and amortisation.
Working capital movement excludes movement on restructuring, reorganisation, acquisition and integration accruals.
Tax payment for 2017 excludes 11.8m of tax relating to adjusting item for Penton derivative forward contract gain of 58.9m.
The Groups focus on cash generation led to another year of strong operating cash conversion at 91.2% 2017: 90.8%.
The 91.2% result is calculated by dividing the operating cash flow 667.9m by the adjusted operating profit 732.1m.
Net capital expenditure was 59.4m 2017: 79.0m, equivalent to 2.5% of 2018 revenue, and with the reduction year-on-year reflecting the end of the Growth Acceleration Plan investments.
Going forward, net capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% of revenue.
The working capital outflow of 62.3m was 51.8m higher than the outflow in 2017, largely due to the timing of the acquisition of UBM, with UBM working capital outflows of 84.5m in the post-acquisition period.
COM INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 85 Strategic Report Financial Review continued The following table reconciles net cash inflow from operating activities, as shown in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, to free cash flow: 2018 2017 m m Net cash inflow from operating activities per statutory cash flow 486.3 433.9 Interest received 2.1 0.2 Purchase of property and equipment 23.4 14.7 Proceeds on disposal of property and equipment 0.4 1.0 Purchase of intangible software assets 30.2 52.2 Product development cost additions 6.2 13.1 Add back: acquisition and integration costs paid 74.2 34.0 Add back: tax paid on Penton-related derivative forward contract 11.8 Free cash flow 503.2 400.9 The following table reconciles cash generated by operations, as shown in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, to operating cash flow shown in the free cash flow table above: 1 2018 2017 m m Cash generated by operations per statutory cash flow 635.0 531.2 Net Capex paid 59.4 79.0 Add back: Acquisition and integration costs paid 74.2 34.0 Restructuring and reorganisation costs paid 18.1 8.6 Operating cash flow per free cash flow statement 667.9 494.8 1.
The following table reconciles free cash flow to net debt, which increased by 1,308.8m to 2,681.9m during the year.
This included 1,211.9m related to the UBM acquisition, and a 150.9m adverse foreign exchange impact primarily due to a strengthening in the USdollar.

Our leverage strategy is to target a ratio of net debt to EBITDA in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 times, with the potential to increase to around 3.0times in the short term for a large acquisition.
We used the Balance Sheet efficiently in financing the UBM acquisition, increasing leverage to 3.1 times at completion, before starting to manage leverage down to our target range, reaching 2.9 times leverage by the end of 2018.
Before UBM, on 4 January 2018, the Group issued $400m of private placement loan notes, with a maturity of 7 years $200m and 10years $200m, at an average interest rate of 4.03%.
In March 2018 we extended a bank term loan facility for $200m, with a maturity of up to 12 months: this was subsequently repaid in February 2019.
Shortly after completing the acquisition of UBM, on 5 July 2018, we issued two Euro Medium Term Loan Notes, with an 8-year bond for 300m and a 5-year bond for 650m.
These bonds were used to refinance acquisition debt facilities used to acquire UBM.
On 15 February 2019 the Revolving Credit Facility RCF was replaced with a new facility with two tranches: 600m for a 5-year term to February 2024 and 300m for a 3-year term to February 2022.
The net impact of these actions is to increase the Groups overall debt capacity, whilst extending the average maturity to 5.2 years and reducing the weighted average cost of debt to 3.7%.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had 3.6bn of committed facilities 2.0bn at 31 December 2017, of which 0.8bn was undrawn.

The new RCF launched on 15 February 2019 has removed these covenants.
At 31 December 2018, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.9 times 31 December 2017: 2.5 times, calculated according to our facility agreements and using average exchange rates and including a full years trading for acquisitions.
The ratio of EBITDA to net interest payable was 9.5 times at 31 December 2017: 9.8 times.
COM INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 87 Strategic Report Financial Review continued Corporate development The Groups most significant acquisition in 2018 was UBM, with several other smaller additions to the portfolio.
Total net expenditure on acquisitions and disposals was 690.4m 2017: 250.6m, with 616.2m relating to acquisition and disposal of businesses and 74.2m to integration and acquisition costs.
Acquisition expenditure in the period relating to UBM was 509.3m, with a cash payment to UBM Shareholders of 643.5m, less cash acquired of 134.2m.
Total consideration was 4,190.0m, with the remaining 3,545.1m being satisfied through the issue of 427,536,794 shares in Informa at a price of 8.29 per share, and with 1.4m of deferred consideration relating to the settlement of UBM share save scheme awards that exercised after the acquisition date.
The first disposal under the Progressive Portfolio Management programme was signed on 19 December 2018, with the agreement to sell the Life Sciences media brands portfolio that was previously part of UBM to MJH Associates, for consideration of just over $100m.
The sale completed on 31 January 2019, and this business has been disclosed as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31December 2018.
Pensions The Group continues to meet all commitments to its pension schemes, which consist of six defined benefit schemes that are closed to future accrual.
The acquisition of UBM added two defined benefit schemes to the Group, adding a net pension liability of 12.5m at 31 December 2018.
At 31 December 2018, the Group had a net pension liability of 33.0m 2017: 23.6m, represented by a pension deficit of 37.5m 2017: 23.6m and a pension surplus of 4.5m 2017: nil.
Net pension liabilities increased by 4.5m in 2018 following the recognition of additional liabilities arising from the estimated financial impact of equalising Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP amongst members.
The net deficit remains manageable and relatively small compared with the size of the Groups Balance Sheet.
All schemes are closed to future accrual and there were 4.4m of employer deficit payments during 2018, with 4.7m payments expected to be paid in 2019.
Restatement of 2017 results Results for the year ended 31 December 2017 have been restated following the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in 2018.
There were also restatements to the 2017 income statement from amounts previously recognised on a percentage complete basis.
This resulted in reductions of 0.8m to revenue, 0.6m to profit before tax and 0.5m to profit after tax.
These adjustments only affected the Business Intelligence Division.
This resulted in basic EPS being restated from 37.8p per share to 37.7p per share, diluted EPS being restated from 37.7p to 37.6p and adjusted diluted EPS being restated from 46.1p to 46.0p.
This also resulted in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 December 2017 being adjusted for the reclassification of 72.1m of deferred income against trade receivables, for amounts that have been invoiced and where services have not yet been provided and amounts are not yet due.
The Group also adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018.
There was no material impact from the adoption of this standard and therefore there is no restatement to previously reported results.
88 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements New accounting standards The only impact from new accounting standards in 2019 is from the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases.
IFRS 16 Leases will replace the existing leasing standard, IAS 17 Leases.
It will treat all leases in a consistent way, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases, and will require lessees to recognise all leases on the Balance Sheet, except for low value leases and those with a term of less than 12 months.
The most significant effect of the new standard will be an increase in lease assets and lease liabilities for leases currently categorised as operating leases.
The new standard also changes the nature of expenses related to those leases, replacing the straight line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the right-of-use lease asset included within operating costs and an interest expense on the finance lease liability included within finance costs.
Adoption of IFRS 16 is expected to result in an increase in assets of between 300m and 320m and a corresponding increase in liabilities of between 300m and 320m as at 1 January 2019.
Operating profit for the year ending 31 December 2019 is estimated to increase by between 4m and 6m, being the difference between the lease expense and depreciation, and profit before tax will decrease by between 7m and 9m, reflecting a higher total lease interest expense in the initial years.
Profit after tax is estimated to decrease by between 6m and 8m and adjusted diluted EPS and diluted EPS will decrease approximately between 0.4p and 0.6p.
There are several practical expedients and exemptions available under IFRS 16.
The Group has elected to apply use of the modified retrospective method of implementation where there is no restatement of the comparative period and using the practical expedient where, at the adoption date, right-of-use lease assets are set to equal the lease liabilities.
The Group will exclude leases of low value assets and short-term leases, with a duration of less than 12 months, from the application of IFRS 16, with payments for these leases continuing to be expensed directly to the income statement as operating leases.
The major classes of leases impacted by the new standard are property and event space leases.
The half-year results for the six months ending 30 June 2019 will include an update on the actual impact of IFRS 16.
