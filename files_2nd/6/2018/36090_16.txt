Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 85 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL REVIEW The consolidated Financial Statements of Fresnillo plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the EU.
This Financial Review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance understanding of the Groups Financial Statements.
All comparisons refer to 2018 figures compared to 2017, unless otherwise noted.
The financial information and year-on-year variations are presented in US dollars, except where indicated.
The full financial statements and their accompanying notes can be found on pages 164 to 217.
By following strict controls on cash, costs and expenses and while adhering to our capex budgets, we have maintained a healthy 1 cash and other liquid funds position and a low leverage ratio.
This has enabled us to invest in profitable growth and deliver solid returns to shareholders.
The following report presents how we have managed our financial resources.
COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2018 was a year of challenges and opportunities for the Group.
This was also reflected in the financial performance for the year, with gross profit and EBITDA decreasing over 2017 by 15.6% and 13.7% respectively, while we nevertheless delivered healthy profit 1 margins.
We maintained a solid financial position, with US$560.8 million in cash and other liquid funds as of 31 December 2018 notwithstanding paying dividends of US$298.1 million in accordance with our policy, investing US$668.7 million in capex and spending US$172.8 million in exploration to underpin our future growth.
Adjusted revenue slightly increased year-on-year due to the increased volumes of silver, lead and zinc sold, primarily from the San Julin Disseminated Ore Body, offset by lower prices.
This increase, together with the positive effect of the re-assessment of gold content in the leaching pads and the higher ore grade at Herradura, was more than offset by the higher stripping ratio at Herradura and higher depreciation.
As a result gross profit decreased 15.6% over 2017 and, together with the higher exploration expenses, this contributed to the 13.7% decline in EBITDA.

86 Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED The Groups financial performance is largely determined by the quality of our assets, the skills of our people and the execution capabilities of management to achieve our strategic goals.
However, there are a number of macroeconomic variables that lie beyond our control and which affect financial results.
These include: PRECIOUS METAL PRICES In 2018, the average realised silver price decreased by 8.3% from US$16.9 per ounce in 2017 to US$15.5 per ounce in 2018.
In addition, average realised lead and zinc prices decreased 7.4% and 5.7% year-on-year, to US$0.99 and US$1.28 per pound, respectively.
The average realised gold price remained broadly stable at US$1,269.1 per ounce 2017: US$1,267.4.
HEDGING In the second half of 2014, Fresnillo plc initiated a one-off hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made in the Penmont acquisition.
The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 1,559,689 ounces of gold with monthly settlements until December 2019.
The table below illustrates the expired structures and the outstanding hedged position as of 31 December 2018.
Fresnillo plcs hedging policy remained unchanged for the remainder of the portfolio, providing shareholders with full exposure to gold and silver prices.
MX$ US$ EXCHANGE RATE The average spot Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate devalued by 1.6%, from $18.94 per US dollar in 2017 to $19.24 per US dollar in 2018.
This resulted in a favourable effect estimated at US$6.7 million on the Groups production costs, as costs denominated in Mexican pesos approximately 45% of total costs were lower when converted to US dollars.
HEDGING As previously reported, in 2016 Fresnillo plc decided to suspend its Mexican peso exchange rate hedging programme to hedge payment of certain peso denominated production costs.
However, the Group has continued to enter into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in Euro EUR, Swedish krona SEK and Canadian dollar CAD.
The aggregate effect on income in the year was a loss of US$321,873.
COST INFLATION In 2018, there was a cost inflation of 2.6% net of the 1.6% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar.
The main components of our cost inflation basket are listed below: LABOUR Unionised employees received on average a 7.0% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, and administrative employees at the mines received a 5.5% increase: when converted to US dollars, the weighted average labour inflation was 4.5%.
ENERGY ELECTRICITY The Groups weighted average cost of electricity decreased by 6.4% from 7.6 US cents per kW in 2017 to 7.1 US cents per kW in 2018.
This decrease was mainly due to the lower average generating cost of the Comisin Federal fide Electricidad CFE, the national utility.
DIESEL The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 7.7% to 82.4 US cents per litre in 2018, compared to 76.5 US cents per litre in 2017.
Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 87 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OPERATING MATERIALS Year over year change in unit price % Steel balls for milling 5.5 Other reagents 5.2 Sodium cyanide 1.1 Lubricants 0.9 Explosives 0.2 Tyres 0.6 Steel for drilling 1.1 Weighted average of all operating materials 1.4 Unit prices of the majority of operating materials remained broadly stable in US dollar terms, with the exception being the steel balls for milling and other reagents, which experienced year-on-year inflation of over 5%.
However, this was partly offset by the decrease in the unit price of tyres and steel for drilling.
As a result, the weighted average unit prices of all operating materials increased by 1.4% over the year.
There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the devaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollar-denominated.
CONTRACTORS Agreements are signed individually with each contractor company, and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others.
Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs.
In 2018, increases granted to contractors, whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulted in a weighted average increase of 2.9% in US dollars.
MAINTENANCE Unit prices of spare parts for maintenance remained broadly unchanged on average in US dollar terms 0.7% increase.
OTHERS Other cost components include freight, which increased by an estimated 7.7% in US dollars, partially offset by a 2.7% decrease in insurance costs.
The remaining cost inflation components experienced average inflation of 1.8% in US dollars over 2017.
The effects of the above external factors, combined with the Groups internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.

These favourable effects, net of the lower volume of gold sold, resulted in a positive impact on revenue of US$108.3 million.
This was offset by a US$98.2 million negative effect primarily resulting from the lower silver, lead and zinc prices.
The contribution of gold to Adjusted revenue decreased slightly from 50.4% in 2017 to 49.9% in 2018, reflecting the expected lower volumes of gold produced and sold, while silvers contribution to Adjusted revenue decreased to 36.3% as the increased volumes of silver sold were more than offset by the lower price.
As expected, the higher content of base metals at certain mines is changing the relative proportion of Adjusted revenue, with zinc increasing its contribution from 7.2% in 2017 to 9.1% in 2018, and lead representing 4.7%.
Herradura remained the main contributor to Adjusted revenue, primarily due to the higher volumes of silver sold during the year.
Saucitos and Fresnillos contribution declined from 22.6% and 18.9% in 2017 to 21.9% and 16.9% respectively in 2018, reflecting the decrease in silver ore grade and a lower silver price.
The San Julin mine continued to increase its contribution to the Groups Adjusted revenue from 12.9% in 2017 to 16.4% in 2018.
Noche Buenas contribution decreased to 9.4%, in line with the 1.9% decline in its Adjusted revenue, while Cinega maintained its contribution to the Groups Adjusted revenue at 8.3%.
The relative contribution to Adjusted silver revenue continued to change in 2018 with the San Julin mine representing 24.8% 2017: 18.6%, and the contributions of Saucito and Fresnillo decreasing as expected due to an expanded silver asset base.
The start-up of San Julin Disseminated Ore Body also affected the relative contribution to zinc adjusted revenues.
This new mine represented 25.7% of total zinc Adjusted revenues in 2018, helping to increase zincs relative contribution to the Groups Adjusted revenues.
The contribution by metal and by mine to Adjusted revenues is expected to change further in the future, as new projects are incorporated into the Groups operations and as precious metal prices fluctuate.

As of 31 December 2018 Concept Zinc Lead Weighted floor US$ tonne 2,591 2,370 Weighted cap US$ tonne 3,716 2,735 Expired volume tonne 21,168 5,760 Gain Loss US$ dollars 602,101 980,141 Total outstanding volume tonne 0 0 TREATMENT AND REFINING CHARGES 1 Treatment and refining charges are reviewed annually using international benchmarks.
Treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 13.3% and 7.5%, respectively, compared to 2017, while silver refining charges declined by 7.4% over the year.
This lower charge per tonne was offset by the increase in volumes of lead and zinc concentrates with high silver contents mainly shipped from Saucito and San Julin Disseminated Ore Body to Met-Mex, as well as the volumes of precipitates sold from the Pyrites plant.
As a result, treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement in absolute terms increased by only 0.9% over 2017.
The US$155.2 million increase is explained by the following combination of factors: An increase in Adjusted production costs US$182.8 million.
This was primarily due to: i higher stripping costs at Herradura US$82.6 million : ii additional Adjusted production costs associated with the first complete year of operations at San Julin Disseminated Ore Body US$49.6 million : iii the decrease in volume of ore processed from development works at Saucito, the costs of which were capitalised US$31.2 million : iv cost inflation US$26.4 million : and v the reassessment in the year of the number of mining components at Herradura from two to one, effective from July 2019, which increased stripping costs expensed US$21.9 million see page 62.
The increase was partly offset by the lower volume of ore processed mainly at HerraduraUS$19.6 million : and the favourable effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso vs.
US dollar and othersUS$9.3 million.
This is mainly due to the full year of operation at San Julin and the increased depreciation at the Saucito mine resulting from the start up of the Pyrites plant and the amortisation of capitalised mining works.
These negative effects were partly offset by: The increase in change in work in progressUS$70.4 million.
Change in work in progress was US$53.6 million in 2018 as a result of the re-assessment of the gold content in the leaching pads at Herradura see notes 2c and 5 in the financial information.
This compared favourably to the US$16.9 million costs recorded in 2017 as a result of the decrease in inventories in the leaching pads at Herradura.
COST PER TONNE, CASH COST PER OUNCE AND ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST AISC Cost per tonne is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine.
This indicator is calculated as total production costs, plus ordinary mining rights, less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects, divided by total tonnage processed.
We have included cost per tonne hauled moved as we believe it is a useful indicator to thoroughly analyse cost performance for the open pit mines.
1 Treatment and refining charges include the cost of treatment and refining as well as the margin charged by the refiner.
2 Adjusted production costs is calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and the effects of exchange rate hedging.

The particular variations in cash cost for each mine are explained as follows: FRESNILLO: US$0.46 OZ AG 2018 VERSUS US$0.71 OZ AG 2017, -35.2% Cash cost per ounce decreased, principally due to higher by-product creditsUS$0.97 oz and lower treatment chargesUS$0.24 oz, partially offset by the lower silver ore grade US$0.71 oz and the higher cost per tonne US$0.28 oz see page 52.
SAUCITO: US$0.97 OZ AG 2018 VERSUS US$1.50 OZ AG 2017, -35.6% The decrease was driven by the higher by-product credits per ounce of silver resulting from the increased volume of gold soldUS$2.29 oz, partially offset by the higher cost per tonne US$1.21 oz see page 55 and the lower silver grade US$0.55 oz.
CINEGA: US$25.88 OZ AU 2018 VERSUS US$163.74 OZ AU 2017, N A The increase in cash cost was primarily due to: the expected decrease in gold grade US$115.01 oz, the higher cost per tonne US$42.32 oz see page 61 and higher treatment and refining charges US$6.78 oz.
These unfavourable factors were mitigated by higher by-product credits per gold ounce due to the lower volume of gold producedUS$19.26 oz : and othersUS$3.96 oz.
HERRADURA: US$504.00 OZ AU 2018 VERSUS US$492.86 OZ AU 2017, 2.3% The increase in cash cost resulted from the higher cost per tonne US$261.13 oz see page 63 and the change from two mining components to one during the year see page 63 US$60.68 oz : mitigated by the higher gold gradeUS$247.39 oz : a favourable inventory valuation effect due to the increase in gold inventories on the leaching padsUS$34.32 oz : and higher by-product credits per gold ounce due to the increased volume of silver sold, albeit at a lower priceUS$29.75 oz.
NOCHE BUENA: US$735.41 OZ AU 2018 VERSUS US$793.48 OZ AU 2017, -7.3% The decrease in cash cost per ounce was mainly due to the lower cost per tonneUS$69.41 oz see page 65.
SAN JULIN VEINS: -US$3.64 OZ AG 2018 VERSUSUS$4.30 OZ AG 2017, 15.4% The increase in cash cost was explained mainly by the lower silver ore grade US$1.29 oz and higher cost per tonne US$0.04 oz see page 58, mitigated by lower by-product credits due to the decline in volume of gold soldUS$0.67 oz.
SAN JULIN DISSEMINATED ORE BODY As operations commenced in July 2017, year-on-year figures are not considered to be representative.
92 Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED In addition to the traditional cash cost described on the previous page, the Group is reporting all-in sustaining costs AISC, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the World Gold Council.
This cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs, community costs related to current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses.
We consider all-in sustaining costs to be a reasonable indicator of a mines ability to generate free cash flow when compared with the corresponding metal price.
We also believe it is a means to monitor not only current production costs, but also sustaining costs as it includes mine development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, as well as sustaining capex.
ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST All-in sustaining cost per ounce 2018 2017 Change % Fresnillo US$ per silver ounce 8.92 8.20 8.7 Saucito US$ per silver ounce 8.64 7.09 21.9 Cinega US$ per gold ounce 1,413.87 691.43 104.5 San Julin Veins US$ per silver ounce 5.05 0.83 100.0 1 San Julin Disseminated Ore Body US$ per silver ounce 10.01 7.88 26.9 Herradura US$ per gold ounce 806.73 807.66 0.1 Noche Buena US$ per gold ounce 1,029.68 870.05 18.3 1 Indicator may not be representative as it corresponds to the start-up period, when a significant volume of ore from the stock pile was processed.
Fresnillo: Higher, mainly due to capitalised mine development mitigated by lower sustaining capex.
Saucito: Higher, as a result of higher capitalised mine development and an increase in sustaining capex.
Cinega: Higher, primarily due to an increase in sustaining capex, higher capitalised mine development and a higher cash cost.
Herradura: Broadly stable, mainly due to the decrease in capitalised stripping costs following the reassessment of the number of mining components from two to one see pages 62 and 63 : offset by higher cash cost detailed on page 91.
Noche Buena: Higher, driven by the higher capitalised stripping, mitigated by the lower cash cost detailed on page 91.
San Julin: San Julin Veins : Higher, mainly due to increased sustaining capex and higher capitalised mine development.
San Julin Disseminated Ore Body : As operations commenced in July 2017, there are no comparable year-on-year figures.
GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses, is a key financial indicator of profitability at each business unit and the Fresnillo Group as a whole.
Total gross profit, net of hedging gains and losses, decreased by 15.6% to US$780.7 million in 2018.
The US$144.7 million decrease in gross profit was mainly explained by: i lower silver, lead and zinc pricesUS$97.7 million : ii the higher stripping ratio at HerraduraUS$82.6 million : iii the 17.5% decrease in volume of ore deposited at the Herradura heap leachUS$64.8 million : iv higher depreciationUS$44.2 million : v the decrease in volume of ore processed from development at Saucito, the costs of which were capitalisedUS$31.2 million : vi cost inflationUS$26.4 million : vii the adverse effect of recognising the entirety of the stripping in the income statement in 2H 2018 following the change from two components to one at Herradura, as opposed to partially capitalising it see pages 62 and 63 -US$21.8 million : viii lower production at San Julin VeinsUS$19.5 million : and ix othersUS$7.0 million.
These factors were partly mitigated by: i the re-assessment of gold inventories in the leaching pads at Herradura US$94.4 million : ii the higher ore grade from the inventory and improved speed of recovery at Herradura US$68.4 million : iii increased production at San Julin Disseminated Ore Body resulting from its first complete year of operations US$67.1 million : and iv the higher recovery rate at Saucito US$20.7 million.
Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 93 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As reflected in the table below, Herradura remained the largest contributor to the Groups consolidated gross profit, although there was a slight decrease in its gross profit when compared to 2017.
Gross profit at Saucito and Fresnillo declined by 22.1% and 24.5% over 2017 respectively, decreasing its contribution to the consolidated gross profit.
San Julin remained the fourth largest contributor.
Gross profit at Noche Buena increased 18.1% year on year, providing 8.7% of total gross profit, while Cinegas share of the Groups total gross profit decreased to 4.1%.

Corporate expenses increased 5.7% over 2017 to US$32.1 million mainly as a result of increased corporate services provided by Servicios Industriales Peoles, S. A.
B fide C. V. due to a larger number of mines and projects, and to a lesser extent, a 2.0% cost inflation.

An additional US$8.4 million was capitalised, mainly relating to exploration expenses at the Juanicipio project, Centauro Deep and Guanajuato.
As a result, risk capital invested in exploration totalled US$181.2 million in 2018, a 24.7% increase over 2017.
In 2019, total invested in exploration is expected to be approximately US$140 million, of which US$10 million is expected to be capitalised.

It is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation, less administrative, selling and exploration expenses.
In 2018, EBITDA decreased 13.7% to US$915.1 million mainly due to the lower gross profit.
As a result, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased, from 50.6% in 2017 to 43.5% in 2018.
OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE In 2018, a net gain of US$3.3 million was recognised in the income statement.
This compared unfavourably to the US$16.8 million net gain recognised in 2017 mainly as a result of the sale of non-strategic mining claims to Argonaut Gold Inc. SILVERSTREAM EFFECTS The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value.
The total revaluation effect recorded in the 2018 income statement was a gain of US$15.0 million.
This includes negative non-cash revaluation effects of US$22.5 million mainly as a result of the lower forward price of silver and a higher discount rate used, mitigated by the updating of the Sabinas production plan, which resulted from the updated estimate of reserves and resources.
This was more than offset by a US$37.5 million non-cash gain mainly generated by the unwinding of the discounted values.
In 2017, a US$113.7 million gain was registered mainly as a result of converting resources into reserves at the Sabinas mine.
Since the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$629.3 million.
The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract.
Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section on page 96 and in notes 13 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
FINANCE COSTS Finance costs reflected the interest on the US$800 million principal amount of 5.5% Senior Notes, net of interest received.
In 2018 finance costs decreased 21.8%, from US$34.0 million to US$29.6 million, mainly due to the decrease in borrowing costs capitalised in 2018 compared to 2017.
In 2018, following the adoption of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, the effects of the mark-to-market time value of the outstanding gold hedging programme are recognised in other comprehensive income, rather than in income as in 2017 see note 2c in the financial information.
This caused a favourable effect as a US$41.1 million loss was recognised in 2017.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE A foreign exchange loss of US$8.1 million was recorded as a result of the realised transactions in the year.
This compared negatively against the US$6.4 million foreign exchange loss recognised in 2017.
The Group enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in Euro EUR, Swedish krona SEK and Canadian dollar CAD.
At the end of 2018, the total EUR, SEK and CAD outstanding net forward position was EUR 12.67 million, CAD 0.0 and SEK 13.29 million with maturity dates from March through September 2019.
Volumes that expired during 2018 were EUR 26.41 million with a weighted average strike of 1.2024 USD EUR, CAD 1.10 million with a weighted average strike of 1.2847 CAD USD and SEK 69.70 million with a weighted average strike of 8.5762 SEK USD.
Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 95 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAXATION Corporate income tax expense decreased 21.4% from US$153.5 million in 2017 to US$120.6 million in 2018, reflecting the decline in profit before income tax.
The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 24.9%, which was below the 30% statutory tax rate.
This was mainly due to the inflationary uplift of the tax base of assets and liabilities, together with the tax credit related to the special tax on diesel.
Including the effect of the special mining rights, the effective tax rate was 27.7% in 2018.
The effective tax rate in 2017 was lower 20.7% in 2017 vs. 24.9% in 2018 mainly because in 2017 there was a 4.5% revaluation of the Mexican peso which had an important impact on the tax value of assets and liabilities that are denominated in Mexican pesos: together with a higher inflation rate which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base of assets and liabilities See note 10 to the financial statements.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR Profit for the year decreased from US$560.8 million to US$350.0 million in 2018, a 37.6% decline year-on-year as a result of the factors described above.
Excluding the effects of the Silverstream contract, profit for the year decreased from US$481.2 million to US$339.5 million.

Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital decreased by 13.3% to US$930.7 million, mainly as a result of the lower profits generated in the year.
Working capital increased US$127.9 million mainly due to increased ore inventories in the leaching pads at Herradura US$63.9 million : higher trade and other receivables resulting from an increase in VAT receivables US$60.4 million : and an increase in prepayments and other assets US$11.8 million.
This increase in working capital was partly offset by an increase in trade and other payables US$8.2 million.
Taxes and employee profit sharing paid decreased 30.7% over 2017 to US$214.4 million.
As a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities decreased 22.7% from US$761.5 million in 2017 to US$588.4 million in 2018.
Other sources of cash were the proceeds of the Silverstream contract of US$36.3 million and capital contributions from minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$23.6 million.
96 Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED The funds mentioned on the previous page were mainly used to purchase property, plant and equipment for a total of US$668.7 million, a 10.6% increase over 2017.
Capital expenditures for 2018 are further described below: PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2018 US$ million Fresnillo mine 121.1 Mine development and purchase of in-mine equipment, deepening of the San Carlos shaft and the construction of the second phase of the Pyrites plant Saucito mine 148.4 Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, construction of the Pyrites plant and deepening of the Jarillas shaft Herradura mine 116.0 Stripping activities, sustaining capex, construction of second line of the DLP and land acquisition San Julin mine 83.1 Mine development, purchase of in-mine equipment and construction of the third tailing dam Cinega mine 72.9 Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, construction of tailings dam and installation of high compact thickener Noche Buena mine 50.2 Mining works and sustaining capex Juanicipio project 46.9 Exploration expenditure and construction of ramps Other 30.1 Total purchase of property, plant and equipment 668.7 Dividends paid to shareholders of the Group in 2018 totalled US$298.1 million, a 26.0% increase over 2017, in line with our dividend policy which includes a consideration of profits generated in the period.
The 2018 payment included the final 2017 dividend of US$219.4 million and the 2018 interim dividend paid in September of US$78.8 million.
Net interest of US$15.7 million was paid, mainly reflecting the interest paid in relation with the issuance of the US$800 million principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a decrease in net cash of US$335.2 million net decrease in cash and other liquid assets, which combined with the US$896.0 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash and other liquid assets of US$560.8 million at the end of 2018.
BALANCE SHEET 1 Fresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position with cash and other liquid funds of US$560.8 million as of 31 December 2018, albeit decreasing 37.4% versus December 2017, as explained above.
Inventories increased 23.6% to US$335.0 million mainly as a result of the increase in inventories of gold on the leaching pads at Herradura.
Trade and other receivables increased 14.9% to US$462.0 million mainly as a result of the increase in value added tax recoverable.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$538.9 million at the beginning of the year to US$519.1 million as of 31 December 2018 reflects proceeds of US$34.8 million corresponding to 2018 US$31.4 million in cash and US$3.4 million in receivables and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US$15.0 million.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,693.1 million at year end, representing a 10.0% increase over 2017.
The US$244.5 million increase was mainly due to the advancement in the development projects: capitalised development works: purchase of additional in-mine equipment: and the construction of leaching pads at Herradura and Noche Buena.
The Groups total equity was US$3,128.3 million as of 31 December 2018, a 2.0% increase over 2017.
This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2017 profit and the net unrealised gains on cash flow hedges.
1 Cash and other liquid funds are disclosed in note 30 c to the financial statements.
Fresnillo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 97 STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIVIDENDS Based on the Groups 2018 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of 16.7 US cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 24 May 2019 to shareholders on the register on 26 April 2019.
The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars.
This is in addition to the interim dividend of 10.7 US cents per share amounting to US$78.8 million.
The corporate income tax reform introduced in Mexico in 2014 created a withholding tax obligation of 10% relating to the payment of dividends, including to foreign nationals.
Historically the Company has been making dividend payments out of retained earnings generated before the tax reform came into force and no withholding tax has therefore been applicable.
We expect that dividend payments relating to 2019 and future years will attract the withholding obligation.
However, foreign shareholders may be able to recover such tax depending on their tax residence and the existence of double taxation agreements.
GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY We aim to be transparent about our payments to governments.
Responsible mining can be a driver of economic and social development.
However, corruption and poor governance diminish the benefits that society should gain from the revenues of mining resources.
We support transparency and public scrutiny of the payments we make to governments.
The key activity of the year was evaluating our tax position and publishing a statement on our website to clarify our approach to risk management and governance arrangements in relation to UK taxation, in accordance with Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 2016.
