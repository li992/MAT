Our 4 continued focus on customers has resulted in growth of 4.5% in the year, higher than system growth of 2.5%.
Our market share increased from 1.73% to 1.77%.
The mortgage market in 2018 has been more subdued, with high remortgage activity, but lower levels of new lending and the competitive environment has continued to exert pressure on front book pricing.
In late 2017, we brought mortgage processing back onshore, as part of our customer journey improvement initiatives.
Some servicing and fulfilment delays arose resulting in our broker pipeline build being lower than we had hoped, with mortgage growth slower around the third quarter of the financial year when we felt the impact of lower applications at the start of 2018.
These issues are now resolved, with a return to a more normalised level of growth in the final quarter.
We continued to see customers favour fixed rate mortgage products, as they sought to further capitalise on the prevailing low interest rate environment against a backdrop of market sentiment that expects modest short to medium-term interest rate rises.
This, combined with our targeted customer retention strategy, has resulted in growth in the fixed rate book to 78% of total mortgage balances 2017: 73% and accounted for 96% of mortgages drawn in the year 2017: 95%.
Longer-term fixed rate mortgages are growing more popular with 5-year fixed mortgages now accounting for 27% of the portfolio 2017: 22%.
In line with our expectations, the buy-to-let BTL property market has been more subdued following last years changes in tax relief for landlords, an increase in Stamp Duty and the PRAs enhanced affordability assessments.
This has led to a shift in the mix of our mortgage book with BTL falling from 33% in the prior year to 31% with owner occupied accounting for a higher proportion of drawdowns in the year 79%, up from 70% in the year to 30 September 2017.
Reflecting this change in mix, the average loan to value LTV of new lending was 70% 30 September 2017: 71% and the average LTV of the mortgage book increased from 57.5% to 58.8%.
Our proportion of residential mortgages 90 days in arrears has remained stable at 0.56% 2017: 0.52%.
SME lending 5 Our core SME lending portfolio increased by 381m 5.6% in the year, in line with market guidance and ahead of system growth of 2.1%.
Growth has been delivered across term lending, asset finance and invoice finance.
We are outperforming the market, despite the subdued demand resulting from Brexit uncertainty, as a result of our strong propositions and sector focus, while maintaining high credit underwriting standards.
We are delivering on our pledge to support small and medium sized businesses across the UK as part of our commitment to lend 6bn in the three years to 2019.
Lending origination targets have been achieved or exceeded in each of our core regions and this, coupled with lower attrition in the year, has contributed to the overall increase in balances.
The SME portfolio remains well positioned.
Underlying asset quality is resilient and stable, reflective of the diversity within the portfolio as a result of controlled risk appetite and an economic environment which continues to support business performance.
The impaired asset portfolio has reduced to 83m 2017: 126m which is at its lowest level for more than 10 years.
In line with our strategy we continued to proactively run down our non-core portfolio, which reduced from 504m to 336m through the managed exit of non-core balances.
1 Includes financial assets at fair value of 362m September 2017: 477m.

38 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial results Financial performance review Unsecured personal lending Unsecured personal lending has grown by 3.5% or 41m in the year to 1,203m.
This has been driven largely by a focus on the fixed rate personal loans portfolio which increased by 13% from a low base of 658m to 743m.
We have improved our presence on aggregator websites and offered existing customers enhanced accessibility to our products, introducing in-app purchase functionality and allowing customers that are pre-assessed for credit worthiness to secure a loan at the click of a mouse.
The fixed rate personal loan market remains highly competitive, resulting in some margin erosion, as market rates have dipped to near historical lows and are yet to respond to the rising rate environment.
Growth in the fixed rate personal loan book was slightly offset by a fall in credit card balances of 15m to 381m 2017: 396m.
Variable rate personal loans and overdrafts fell by 32m in the year from 111m to 79m.
Variable rate loan balances continue to reduce as, although these products remain on sale, they are not actively promoted or targeted.
Current accounts Current account funding increased by 426m in the year from 13,798m to 14,224m due principally to continued growth in business current account balances up 328m with the Group continuing to see new customer recruitment from the 25-month fee free offer launched in December 2016.
An unprecedented number of new personal current accounts were opened following our high profile national personal current account recruitment campaign, which had a market leading customer switching incentive.
The B current account was the main beneficiary of the campaign with balances up 256m while there was a reduction of 158m in the Current Account Plus and other personal current account products.
The new B account openings were in line with our strategy to sustainably grow this portfolio in a way that recruits new customers with whom we have an opportunity to build a long-term relationship.
Variable rate savings accounts Funding from variable rate savings accounts increased by 547m principally driven by 783m of growth in B savings accounts and 116m in business savings accounts, the latter being driven through targeted relationship management.
Partially offsetting this is attrition of 228m in cash ISA balances following continued product simplification and repricing of the portfolio.
There has been a change in book mix, with a higher proportion of balances being held in longer-term notice products, providing an additional liquidity benefit.
Fixed rate term deposits Our fixed rate term deposit book increased by 219m to 6,202m as a result of deposit raising initiatives taken primarily in the first quarter of the year, including the successful launch of our second online digital bond along with two further cash ISA fixed rate bonds designed to retain maturing term deposits.
As a result of close margin management and deposit initiatives, funding costs have fallen as the number of longer-term higher priced products were allowed to mature without replacement.
Funding and liquidity The Group continues to maintain its strong funding and liquidity position and seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between profitability, liquidity risk and capital optimisation.
Reflecting our retail deposit-led funding strategy, our loan to deposit ratio was stable over the year at 115% 2017: 115%.
In addition to retail deposits, we ensure appropriate diversification in our funding base through a number of wholesale funding programmes.
In the first half of the year we made further drawings from the BoE Term Funding Scheme TFS, taking overall drawings at 30 September 2018 to 2.25bn.
We have accessed TFS judiciously we have not relied on it to fund our growth and our drawings are at a level that can be refinanced comfortably over time.
We have also maintained our access to public markets we successfully completed further issuances of mortgage-backed securities through the Groups Lanark programme across USD and GBP tranches, raising approximately 500m and 550m in January and July respectively.
The Groups liquidity surplus continues to comfortably exceed our regulatory minimum and internal risk appetite, with a Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR of 137% as at 30 September 2018 2017: 164%.
Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR was 119% at 30 September 2018 2017: 118%.
The issue of 500m of senior debt in September provided further funding to the Group and reflects our progression towards meeting the BoEs Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities MREL by 2022.

We guided to a reduction in NIM this year as we expected to see the impact of the shift in our mortgage mix towards a higher proportion of lower yielding owner-occupier lending, together with the continuation of competitive mortgage pricing over the last two years, all feeding through into lower average rates across the mortgage book.
Group NIM of 2.17% was in line with guidance of c. 220bps, down from 2.27% since FY2017.
Furthermore we continue to see mortgage customers favouring fixed rate deals and this customer preference, alongside proactive early retention programmes in the marketplace, continues to exert pressure on average mortgage margins through competitive fixed rate pricing.
Nonetheless, the Group continues to drive net interest income growth through its sustainable balance sheet growth strategy.
Pricing in the unsecured personal lending market remains very competitive and the total average gross yield across the book was 8.4% 2017: 9.0%.
Offsetting the margin pressure in our Retail asset portfolios we saw improved average customer rates in our SME book, benefiting from pricing discipline and a higher interest rate environment.
In addition we actively managed our funding volumes and pricing to support NIM.
Non-interest income Non-interest income reduced by 16m 9% in the year from 172m to 156m.
Net fee and commission income reduced by 5m in the year principally due to a 6m cost for the personal current account incentives campaign which resulted in increased current account volumes, supporting our customer growth strategy.
In addition, we saw net fair value losses of 3m in FY2018 compared to net fair value income of 6m in the prior year.
The swing of 9m included 2m of hedge ineffectiveness and 7m of other fair value items that are not expected to recur.
40 CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial results Financial performance review Impairment losses on credit exposures Impairment losses decreased from 48m to 41m.
Net cost of risk was 2bps lower reflecting strong portfolio quality and benign economic conditions.
The reduction includes a lower charge taken on our SME exposures primarily as specific provisions were lower than previous years offsetting an increase in the impairment charge for Retail exposures.
By contrast we have experienced increased impairment losses for our Retail unsecured portfolios resulting from the combined effect of personal loan portfolio growth, higher default rates on lending originated in earlier years and a lower level of recoveries.

In 2018, we completed our Sustain efficiency programme and achieved run rate benefits that exceeded our targets.
On an underlying basis, total operating and administrative expenses have fallen by 40m to 635m.
Personnel expenses fell from 248m to 216m, driven by headcount reductions following last years voluntary severance programme, as well as the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual on 1 August 2017.
This reduction has been delivered while building an improved reward package across CYBG which has been a key area of focus in 2018.
Improvements have included consolidated pay increases, enhanced defined contribution pension provision and the introduction of a flexible benefits account worth up to 5% capped at 2,500 of salary from 1 January 2018 for all colleagues below Executive Director.
In addition, in recognition of the delivery of an unprecedented level of change in FY2017, all eligible colleagues received 500 of free shares in December 2017 at a cost of 3m.
Costs related to the restructuring and streamlining of our business have fallen by 29m to 38m, largely due to a lower volume of restructuring initiatives in the year.
Costs have been of a similar nature to the prior year but on a smaller scale as the majority of the Sustain initiatives were undertaken in prior financial years.
Transaction related costs of 37m were recognised in regard to the acquisition of Virgin Money and 16m of costs were incurred relating to preparation for the RBS alternative remedies package.
Strategic report Financial results Governance Risk report Financial statements Additional information CYBG PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2018 41 Statutory operating and administrative expenses have increased by 410m driven largely by legacy conduct charges.
In line with the rest of the industry, the Group has experienced a sustained period of elevated Payment Protection Insurance PPI complaints during the year, ahead of the August 2019 industry deadline.
In addition to the 350m charge recognised in the first half of FY2018, the Group has reassessed the level of provision that is considered appropriate to meet current and future expectations in relation to the mis-selling of PPI policies.
The Board noted that weekly incoming complaint volumes have been reducing in the second half of FY2018.
Notwithstanding the improvement the Board concluded that an additional charge of 150m is required.
During the year the Group drew down the full amount of the remaining indemnity cover 148m as the increased provision was partially covered under the terms of the conduct indemnity deed entered into with National Australia Bank NAB.
The balance of 352m has therefore been recognised as a charge to the income statement.
We continue to expect a slowdown in complaint volumes into FY2019 due to the impact of the Financial Guidance and Claims Act that became effective in July which implemented a fee cap and limits to cold-calling for Claims Management Companies.
The Group has also recognised additional costs of 44m for other less significant conduct related matters.
The Group continues to assess the impact of resolving legacy conduct issues on an ongoing basis.

The reduction in the capital ratios related primarily to legacy conduct charges.
Underlying capital generation was 63bps, largely driven by strong underlying profits offset by growth in mortgages and SME lending with risk weighted assets RWAs increasing by 424m.
Investment spend absorbed 85bps as the Group has invested heavily in our digital proposition to improve the customer experience and drive operational efficiencies.
Formal IRB accreditation for the mortgages and SME portfolios was received in October 2018.
The adoption of IRB models is expected to result in a material reduction in the Groups credit RWAs and a consequential significant increase in the Groups CET1 ratio of 350bps.
The pro forma CET1 ratio on the IRB basis at 30 September 2018 was 14.0%.
The pro forma CRD IV leverage ratio on the IRB basis at 30 September 2018 was 5.5%.
On 15 October 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of Virgin Money.
Following the combination, the CET1 ratio is expected to be c. 15.2%.
