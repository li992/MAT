The increase in interest payable of 44.6m is driven by the new nancing facilities taken as part of the acquisition of the Ladbrokes Coral Group.
Whilst the Group has experienced 81.7m of foreign exchange losses on its debt facilities during the year, 58.3m of this has been mitigated through gains in financial derivatives that were taken out to hedge the exposure to the US dollar.
The Group is left with residual GBP Euro foreign exchange risk in its nancing facilities, however, this is largely offset by the net asset position on the Groups European subsidiaries.
