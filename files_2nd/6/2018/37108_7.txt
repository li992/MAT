Brexit On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union EU which began the member states withdrawal, commonly known as Brexit, from the EU.
The Board continues to monitor the progress of the UKs proposed exit from the EU.
In addition, and in view of the time scale, the Group has been assessing the implications and potential mitigating actions of a nodeal scenario.
NATURE OF RISK ASSESSMENT OF RISK Operations based in EU countries Very low.
0.4% of Group turnover from businesses outside of the UK and based in the EU.
Exports to customers based in the EU and the Low risk.
6% of revenue is delivered to EU countries.
risk of tariffs on exports and the risk of delays in delivery due to logistical issues at ports or airports Imports from suppliers and the potential cost of Low medium risk.
Purchases from EU countries are not signi cant.
Purchases of spares and tariffs and logistical issues at ports and airports consumables in the Tankships division of c. 1m per annum may be impacted.
Dry docking in that division may be carried out at EU shipyards and costs could increase by tariffs or if switched to other locations.
Administrative risks of compliance, certi cation, Low risk.
We anticipate a pragmatic solution even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, although time and visas for EU nationals costs may increase.
The Groups main exposure is to the USD and following the Brexit vote, Sterling sharply weakened against the USD.
This has been bene cial to the Groups sales and pro ts and there is a risk of this reversing after 29 March 2019.
The Group reduces earnings volatility by taking out forward contracts for 40%-60% of its exposure and this partly mitigates the risk.
Availability of finance Low risk.
The ability of banks to provide finance and for the banking market to continue to operate in the same manner after 29 March 2019 is expected to be unchanged.
James Fisher has a contract with the European Maritime Safety Agency EMSA to deliver emergency pollution response services should an accident occur in the UK, Irish or NorthWest European coast.
EMSA, post-Brexit, may choose to use EU vessels or companies to provide this service.
