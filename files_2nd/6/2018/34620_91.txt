2018 Executive Overview 2018 marked another strong financial performance, achieving double-digit ROIC and the highest full year earnings in the companys history.
Key information for 2018 compared to the prior year see Key Performance Non-GAAP Financial Indicators for definitions and reconciliations : Net income increased 21% to $3.2 billion from $2.6 billion in 2017 and diluted earnings per share increased to $4.44 from $3.59 in 2017.
Adjusted net income increased 9.3% to $3.0 billion from $2.8 billion in 2017 and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $4.26 from $3.82 in 2017.
Adjusted net income excludes for the full year 2018 unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives and other net gains, totaling $123 million in net gains and for the full year 2017 unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives of $227 million in net gains and impairments and other net charges of $390 million.
Revenues increased $1.4 billion to $18.9 billion from $17.5 billion in 2017.
Gross cruise revenues increased 7.7% to $18.6 billion from $17.3 billion in 2017.
In constant currency, net cruise revenues increased 5.7% to $15.1 billion from $14.3 billion in 2017.
In constant currency, net revenue yields increased 3.7%, comprised of a 3.2% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields and a 5.1% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.
Gross cruise costs including fuel per ALBD increased 3.9%.
Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD in constant currency increased 1.6%.
Changes in fuel prices including realized fuel derivatives and currency exchange rates decreased earnings by $0.21 per share.
We achieved double-digit ROIC and the highest full year earnings in our companys history, our fifth consecutive year of adjusted earnings growth and third consecutive record year.
Our 120,000 team members went above and beyond to deliver a more than doubling in ROIC and near tripling of adjusted earnings per share, in just five years, by executing on our strategy to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth while leveraging our industry leading scale, despite numerous headwinds.
Their efforts, combined with the strong support of our valued travel agent partners, enabled our record breaking results.
While the journey over the last five years to sustained double-digit ROIC was built on the foundation of exceeding guest expectations every single day, we had many other contributions that helped pave the way.
Our proactive public relations effort to increase understanding and reduce misconceptions has clearly had a positive impact.
The absolute number of positive media mentions are multiples of what they were five years ago and our brands consistently capture over 75 percent of all positive media in our industry.
38 Our brands marketing efforts have shared the spotlight with many well-known personalities who brought with them a greater audience of potential new-to-cruise to our respective brands, including Oprah Winfrey for Holland America Line, Shaquille ONeal for Carnival Cruise Line, Shakira for Costa, and Her Majesty the Queen for P&O Cruises UK.
Our brands were featured on television programs all around the world including The New Celebrity th Apprentice, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, ITV reality show, The Cruise, in its 6 season in the UK, and Ant & Dec, also in the UK.
We created our own original content TV programs which have already reached more than 400 million views airing on major U. S. networks.
Our proprietary shows, which include the Voyager with Josh Garcia, Ocean Treks with Jeff Corwin, Vacation Creation, and La Gran Sorpresa, are among the most popular travel series on TV.
With our history making voyage to Cuba in 2016, we became the first U. S. cruise operator in over 40 years to bring U. S. cruise guests directly from the U. S. to Cuba, and opened up an exciting new destination option for guests of Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line and Seabourn.
Our cruise brands continue to further the guest experience through new destinations like Cuba and Amber Cove and new terminals like Barcelona and Dubai.
Our ongoing fleet replenishment efforts are central to our strategy to create demand in excess of measured capacity growth.
Over the last five years, we welcomed 12 state-of-the-art, larger, more efficient vessels and exited nine less efficient ships from our fleet, building a more return resilient fleet.
We leveraged our scale to reduce costs, achieving cumulative savings of over $350 million in just five years.
We also created many innovations and made other investments along the way.
OceanMedallion debuted onboard CaribbeanPrincess and has received 36 billion favorable media impressions.
We have been recognized globally for our innovation efforts, including being recognized by Fast Company as one of the Top Ten Most Innovative Companies in the travel category.
Our state-of-the-art revenue management tool has been deployed across half the company to facilitate further yield growth.
Across many of our brands, we are in the process of rolling out new technology both onboard and shoreside.
This includes enhanced targeted marketing, improved CRM capabilities, new mobile apps and redesigned websites, which collectively contribute to an enhanced guest experience, added empowerment to our travel agent partners, increased revenues and reduced cost of sales.
We underwent multibillion dollar fleet wide reinvestment efforts, including Funship 2.0 for Carnival Cruise Line and Signature of Excellence for Holland America Line.
We signed a historic joint venture agreement with CSSC, China State Shipbuilding Corporation, forming a local cruise operating company and forging a significant long-term relationship to help build the cruise industry in China.
Over the past five years, we also had many notable achievements in our sustainability efforts including the opening of our significantly expanded Arison Maritime Center in the Netherlands, delivering state of the art maritime training through cutting-edge bridge and engine room simulators and curriculum.
We also opened three state-of-the-art Fleet Operations Centers around the globe to provide real time support, ship to shore.
On the environmental front, we exceeded our target unit fuel consumption reduction of 25 percent, three years ahead of schedule.
We are fully committed to continuous improvement in health, environment, safety and security.
Our strong and growing cash from operations, which reached $5.5 billion in 2018, allows us to internally fund our capital improvements, debt maturities and dividend payments.
In addition, we have $11.5 billion of committed export credit facilities available at attractive rates to fund the vast majority of our new ship growth capital.
39 Annex 1 DLC Annual Report Going forward, our fleet replenishment efforts are purposely designed to achieve greater economies.
Over the next five years, we expect net capacity growth of approximately five percent compounded annually.
The higher rate of capacity growth will enable us to better contain costs, leaving us less reliant on revenue yield growth to produce double-digit earnings growth over time.
This, in combination with our strategy of creating demand in excess of measured capacity growth, will allow us to continue to grow our earnings and to deliver sustainable and growing double-digit ROIC over time.

 Our critical accounting estimates are those we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
A discussion of our critical accounting estimates, the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows: Ship Accounting Our most significant assets are our ships, including ship improvements and ships under construction, which represent 78% of our total assets at November 30, 2018.
We make several critical accounting estimates with respect to our ship accounting.
First, in order to compute our ships depreciation expense, which represented 11% of our cruise costs and expenses in 2018, we have to estimate the useful life of each of our ships as well as their residual values.
Secondly, we account for ship improvement costs by capitalizing those costs we believe add value to our ships and have a useful life greater than one year and depreciate those improvements over its estimated remaining useful life.
The costs of repairs and maintenance, including minor improvement costs and dry-dock expenses, are charged to expense as incurred.
When we record the retirement of a ship component included within the ships cost basis, we may have to estimate the net book value of the asset being retired in order to remove it from the ships cost basis.
We determine the useful life of our ships and ship improvements based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us, including the impact of long-term vacation market conditions, marketing and technical obsolescence, competition, physical deterioration, historical useful lives of similarlybuilt ships, regulatory constraints and maintenance requirements.
In addition, we consider estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships major component systems, such as the hull, cabins, main electric, superstructure and engines.
Taking all of this into consideration, we have estimated our new ships useful lives at 30 years.
We determine the residual value of our ships based on our long-term estimates of their resale value at the end of their useful life to us but before the end of their physical and economic lives to others, historical resale values of our and other cruise ships and viability of the secondary cruise ship market.
We have estimated our residual values at 15% of our original ship cost.
Given the large size and complexity of our ships, ship accounting estimates require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain.
We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ships.
In addition, since we do not separately componentize our ships, we do not identify and track depreciation of original ship components.
Therefore, we typically have to estimate the net book value of components that are retired, based primarily upon their replacement cost, their age and their original estimated useful lives.
If materially different conditions existed, or if we materially changed our assumptions of ship useful lives and residual values, our depreciation expense, loss on retirement of ship components and net book value of our ships would be materially different.
In addition, if we change our assumptions in making our determinations as to whether improvements to a ship add value, the amounts we expense each year as repair and maintenance expense 40 could increase, which would be partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense, resulting from a reduction in capitalized costs.
Our 2018 ship depreciation expense would have increased by approximately $42 million assuming we had reduced our estimated 30-year ship useful life estimate by one year at the time we took delivery or acquired each of our ships.
In addition, our 2018 ship depreciation expense would have increased by approximately $213 million assuming we had estimated our ships to have no residual value at the time of their delivery or acquisition.
We believe that the estimates we made for ship accounting purposes are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied in all material respects and result in depreciation expense that is based on a rational and systematic method to equitably allocate the costs of our ships to the periods during which we use them.
In addition, we believe that the estimates we made are reasonable.
We applied our methods consistently in determining 1 the useful life and residual values of our ships, including ship improvements: 2 which improvement costs add value to our ships and 3 the net book value of ship component assets being retired.
Finally, we believe our critical ship accounting estimates are generally comparable with those of other major cruise companies.
Asset Impairments Impairment reviews of our cruise ships, goodwill and trademarks require us to make significant estimates to determine the fair values of these assets and reporting units.
For our cruise ships, we perform our impairment reviews, if required, at the individual cruise ship level, which is the lowest level for which we have identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of ship impairment reviews.
The determination of ship fair value includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, unless a comparable, viable actively-traded market exists, which is usually not the case for cruise ships, cruise brands and trademarks.
Our ships fair values are typically estimated based either on ship sales price negotiations or discounted future cash flows.
The principal assumptions used to calculate our discounted future cash flows include forecasted future operating results over the expected period.
We believe the ships, including their estimated residual values, will have economic benefit to us.
As of July 31, 2018, we performed our annual goodwill and trademark impairment reviews.
Refer to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our goodwill and trademark impairment reviews.
The determination of our reporting unit goodwill and trademark fair values includes numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
The principal assumptions, all of which are considered Level 3 inputs, used in our cash flow analyses consisted of: Forecasted operating results, including net revenue yields and net cruise costs including fuel prices Capacity changes and the expected rotation of vessels into or out of each of these cruise brands, including decisions about the allocation of new ships amongst brands, the transfer of ships between brands and the timing of ship dispositions Weighted-average cost of capital of market participants, adjusted for the risk attributable to the geographic regions in which these cruise brands operate Capital expenditures, proceeds from forecasted dispositions of ships and terminal values We believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments.
Changes in the conditions or circumstances may result in a need to recognize an additional impairment charge.
Contingencies We periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us, as well as for other known unasserted claims, including environmental, legal, regulatory, guest and crew and tax matters.
In 41 Annex 1 DLC Annual Report addition, we periodically assess the recoverability of our trade and other receivables and our charter-hire and other counterparty credit exposures, by financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business.
Our credit exposure also includes contingent obligations related to our guests cash payments received directly by travel agents and tour operators in Australia and Europe.
In most of Europe, we are obligated to honor our guests cruise payments made to their travel agents and tour operators regardless of whether we have received these payments.
While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these matters, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable, or more likely than not MLTN for income tax matters, that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable or MLTN loss, if any, can be made.
In assessing probable losses, we make estimates of the amount of probable insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets where appropriate.
We accrue a liability and establish a reserve when we believe a loss is probable or MLTN for income tax matters, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with U. S. GAAP.
Such accruals and reserves are typically based on developments to date, managements estimates of the outcomes of these matters, our experience in contesting, litigating and settling other similar non-income tax matters, historical claims experience, actuarially determined estimates of liabilities and any related insurance coverages.
Given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we may have made.
In addition, as new information becomes available, we may need to reassess the amount of asset or liability that needs to be accrued related to our contingencies.
All such changes in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
ResultsofOperations We earn substantially all of our cruise revenues from the following: Sales of passenger cruise tickets and, in some cases, the sale of air and other transportation to and from airports near our ships home ports and cancellation fees.
We also collect fees, taxes and other charges from our guests The cruise ticket price typically includes the following: Accommodations Most meals, including snacks at numerous venues Access to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club and sun decks Supervised youth programs Entertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs Visits to multiple destinations Sales of goods and services not included in the cruise ticket price are generally the following: Substantially all liquor and some non-alcoholic beverage salesInternet and communication services Casino gamingFull service spas Shore excursionsSpecialty restaurants Gift shop salesArt sales Photo salesLaundry and dry cleaning services These goods and services are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee.
We incur cruise operating costs and expenses for the following: The costs of passenger cruise bookings, which represent costs that are directly associated with passenger cruise ticket revenues, and include travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation and credit and debit card fees 42 Onboard and other cruise costs, which represent costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues, and include the costs of liquor and some non-alcoholic beverages, costs of tangible goods sold by us in our gift shops and from our photo packages, communication costs, costs of cruise vacation protection programs, costs of preand post-cruise land packages and credit and debit card fees Fuel costs, which include fuel delivery costs Payroll and related costs, which represent all costs related to our shipboard personnel, including bridge and engineering officers and crew and hotel and administrative employees, while costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in selling and administrative expenses Food costs, which include both our guest and crew food costs Other ship operating expenses, which include port costs that do not vary with guest head counts: repairs and maintenance, including minor improvements and dry-dock expenses: hotel costs: entertainment: gains and losses on ship sales: ship impairments: freight and logistics: insurance premiums and all other ship operating expenses Concession revenues do not have significant associated expenses because the costs and services incurred for concession revenues are borne by our concessionaires.

Nonoperating Income Expense Years Ended November 30, inmillions 2018 2017 Unrealized gains on fuel derivatives $ 94 $ 227 Realized losses on fuel derivatives, net 35 192 Gains on fuel derivatives, net $ 59 $ 35 47 Annex 1 DLC Annual Report Explanations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use net cruise revenues per ALBD net revenue yields, net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measures of our cruise segments and the companys financial performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with U. S. GAAP gross cruise revenues per ALBD gross revenue yields, gross cruise costs per ALBD and U. S. GAAP net income and U. S. GAAP earnings per share.
Net revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or ALBD changes from price and other changes that affect our business.
We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our U. S. GAAP consolidated financial statements.
Under U. S. GAAP, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings.
We believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings.
Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses.
We believe that gains and losses on ship sales, impairment charges, restructuring and other expenses are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance.
Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for gains and losses on ship sales, impairment charges, and restructuring and other non-core gains and charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items.
The presentation of our non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with U. S. GAAP.
It is possible that our non-GAAP financial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like-kind information presented by other companies, which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies.
Net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a companys cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes.
We use net cruise revenues rather than gross cruise revenues to calculate net revenue yields.
We believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs, which are travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees.
Net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues, net of commissions, transportation and other costs.
Net onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues, net of onboard and other cruise costs.
Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD is the measure we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments costs rather than gross cruise costs per ALBD.
We exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues as well as fuel expense to calculate net cruise costs without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non-GAAP financial measures.
Substantially all of our net cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed, except for the impact of changing prices once the number of ALBDs has been determined.
48 Reconciliation of Forecasted Data We have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs without fuel or forecasted U. S. GAAP net income to forecasted adjusted net income or forecasted U. S. GAAP earnings per share to forecasted adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful U. S. GAAP forecasts of gross cruise revenues, gross cruise costs, net income and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort.
We are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices.
While we forecast realized gains and losses on fuel derivatives by applying current Brent prices to the derivatives that settle in the forecast period, we do not forecast the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives because we do not believe they are an indication of our future earnings performance.
We are unable to determine the future impact of gains or losses on ships sales, restructuring expenses and other non-core gains and charges.
Constant Dollar and Constant Currency Our operations primarily utilize the U. S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition.
Functional currencies other than the U. S. dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk.
Our operations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency, which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk.
We report net revenue yields, net passenger revenue yields, net onboard and other revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD on a constant dollar and constant currency basis assuming the 2018 and 2017 periods currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2017 and 2016 periods rates.
These metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates.
Constant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations.
Constant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations as in constant dollar plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
Examples: The translation of our operations with functional currencies other than U. S. dollar to our U. S. dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported U. S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U. S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported U. S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U. S. dollar weakens against these foreign currencies.
Our operations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency.
If their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies, it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses.
If the functional currency weakens against these other currencies, it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses.
The increase was caused by: $545 million - 3.7% increase in constant currency net revenue yields $271 million - 1.9% capacity increase in ALBDs $236 million - foreign currency impacts including both foreign currency translational and transactional impacts The 3.7% increase in net revenue yields on a constant currency basis was due to a 3.2% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields and a 5.1% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.
The 3.2% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields was driven primarily by price improvements in our European, Australian, China and various other programs.
This 3.2% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields was comprised of a 2.4% increase from our NAA segment and a 4.8% increase from our EA segment.
The 5.1% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields was caused by similar increases in our NAA and EA segments.
Net cruise costs excluding fuel increased by $425 million, or 5.2%, to $8.5 billion in 2018 from $8.1 billion in 2017.
The increase was caused by: $155 million - 1.9% capacity increase in ALBDs $135 million - foreign currency impacts including both foreign currency translational and transactional impacts $134 million - 1.6% increase in constant currency net cruise costs excluding fuel Fuel costs increased by $374 million, or 30%, to $1.6 billion in 2018 from $1.2 billion in 2017.
This was driven by higher fuel prices, which accounted for $370 million.

The increase was caused by: $626 million - 4.5% increase in constant currency net revenue yields $381 million - 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs These increases were partially offset by foreign currency impacts including both foreign currency translational and transactional impacts, which accounted for $44 million.
The 4.5% increase in net revenue yields on a constant currency basis was due to a 4.9% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields and a 3.4% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.
The 4.9% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields was driven primarily by price improvements in our Caribbean, European and Alaska programs for our NAA segment and European programs for our EA segment, partially offset by decreases in our China programs.
This 4.9% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields was comprised of a 5.7% increase from our NAA segment and a 3.2% increase from our EA segment.
The 3.4% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields was caused by similar increases in our NAA and EA segments.
Gross cruise revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 6.9%, to $17.3 billion in 2017 from $16.2 billion in 2016 for largely the same reasons as discussed above.
Net cruise costs excluding fuel increased by $427 million, or 5.6%, to $8.1 billion in 2017 from $7.7 billion in 2016.
The increase was caused by: $222 million - 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs $216 million - 2.7% increase in constant currency net cruise costs excluding fuel These increases were partially offset by: $12 million - foreign currency impacts including both foreign currency translational and transactional impacts Fuel costs increased by $329 million, or 36%, to $1.2 billion in 2017 from $0.9 billion in 2016.
This was driven by higher fuel prices, which accounted for $313 million.
Gross cruise costs increased, by $1.2 billion, or 10%, to $12.6 billion in 2017 from $11.4 billion in 2016 for largely the same reasons as discussed above and the impairment of ships, which accounted for $304 million.
Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources Our primary financial goals are to profitably grow our cruise business and sustain and grow our double-digit ROIC, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong investment grade credit ratings.
We define ROIC as the twelve-month adjusted earnings before interest divided by the monthly average of debt plus equity minus .
Our ability to generate significant operating cash flow allows us to internally fund our capital improvements, debt maturities and dividend payments.
We have $11.5 billion of committed export credit facilities available to fund the vast majority of our new ship growth capital.
Other objectives of our capital structure policy are to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity through our available cash and cash equivalents and committed financings for immediate and future liquidity needs and to maintain a reasonable debt maturity profile.
56 Based on our historical results, projections and financial condition, we believe that our future operating cash flows and liquidity will be sufficient to fund all of our expected capital improvements, new ship growth capital, debt maturities and dividend payments over the next several years.
We believe that our ability to generate significant operating cash flows and our strong balance sheet, as evidenced by our strong investment grade credit ratings, provide us with the ability, in most financial credit market environments, to obtain debt financing.
We had a working capital deficit of $7.0 billion as of November 30, 2018 compared to a working capital deficit of $7.2 billion as of November 30, 2017.
The decrease in working capital deficit was driven by the increase in our cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in customer deposits and short-term borrowings.
We operate with a substantial working capital deficit.
This deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that, under our business model, substantially all of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date.
These advance passenger receipts remain a current liability until the sailing date.
The cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources, such as our borrowings and other cash from operations.
The cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses, pay down our debt, make long-term investments or any other use of cash.
Included within our working capital deficit are $4.4 billion and $4.0 billion of customer deposits as of November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In addition, we have a relatively low-level of accounts receivable and limited investment in inventories.
We generate substantial cash flows from operations and our business model has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating, investing and financing needs.
We expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future.
Sources and Uses of Cash OperatingActivities Our business provided $5.5 billion of net cash from operations during 2018, an increase of $227 million, or 4.3%, compared to $5.3 billion in 2017.
This increase was driven by an increase in customer deposits.
During 2017, our business provided $5.3 billion of net cash from operations, an increase of $188 million, or 3.7%, compared to $5.1 billion in 2016.
This increase was caused by an increase in our revenues less expenses settled in cash.
InvestingActivities During 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $3.5 billion.
This was caused by: Capital expenditures of $2.1 billion for our ongoing new shipbuilding program Capital expenditures of $1.7 billion for ship improvements and replacements, information technology and buildings and improvements Proceeds from sale of ships of $389 million Purchase of minority interest of $135 million Payments of $39 million of fuel derivative settlements During 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $3.1 billion.
This was caused by: Capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for our ongoing new shipbuilding program Capital expenditures of $1.5 billion for ship improvements and replacements, information technology and buildings and improvements Payments of $203 million of fuel derivative settlements During 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $3.3 billion.

Effective April 10 and August 27, 2018, the company approved modifications of the general authorization under the Repurchase Program, which replenished the remaining authorized repurchases at the time of the approvals to $1.0 billion.
The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued by our Boards of Directors at any time.
In addition to the Repurchase Program, we have programs that allow us to obtain an economic benefit when either Carnival Corporation common stock is trading at a premium to the price of Carnival plc ordinary shares or Carnival plc ordinary shares are trading at a premium to Carnival Corporation common stock the Stock Swap Programs.
For example: In the event Carnival Corporation common stock trades at a premium to Carnival plc ordinary shares, we may elect to sell shares of Carnival Corporation common stock, at prevailing market prices in ordinary brokers transactions and repurchase an equivalent number of Carnival plc ordinary shares in the UK market.
In the event Carnival plc ordinary shares trade at a premium to Carnival Corporation common stock, we may elect to sell ordinary shares of Carnival plc, at prevailing market prices in ordinary brokers transactions and repurchase an equivalent number of shares of Carnival Corporation common stock in the U. S. market.
During 2018 and 2017, there were no sales or repurchases under the Stock Swap Programs.
During 2016, under the Stock Swap Programs, a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation sold 0.9 million of Carnival plc ordinary shares for net proceeds of $40 million.
Substantially all of the net proceeds from these sales were used to purchase 0.9 million shares of Carnival Corporation common stock.
Any sales of Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
Funding Sources At November 30, 2018, we had liquidity of $14.6 billion.
Our liquidity consisted of $710 million of cash and cash equivalents, which excludes $271 million of cash used for current operations, $2.3 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities, net of our outstanding commercial paper borrowing, and $11.5 billion under our committed future financings, which are comprised of ship export credit facilities.
These commitments are from numerous large and well-established banks and export credit agencies, which we believe will honor their contractual agreements with us.
inbillions 2019 2020 2021 2022 Availability of committed future financing at November 30, 2018 $ 3.4 $ 2.9 $ 2.8 $ 2.4 59 Annex 1 DLC Annual Report At November 30, 2018, all of our revolving credit facilities are scheduled to mature in 2021, except for $300 million which matures in 2020.
Substantially all of our debt agreements contain financial covenants as described in the consolidated financial statements.
At November 30, 2018, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.
In addition, based on, among other things, our forecasted operating results, financial condition and cash flows, we expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants for the foreseeable future.
Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a discussion of our hedging strategies and market risks, see the discussion below and the consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks Operational Currency Risks Our operations primarily utilize the U. S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro or sterling as their functional currencies.
Our operations also have revenue and expenses denominated in non-functional currencies.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our financial statements.
Based on a 10% change in all currency exchange rates that were used in our December 20, 2018 guidance, we estimate that our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance would change by the following: $0.27 per share on an annualized basis for 2019 $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2019 Investment Currency Risks The foreign currency exchange rates were as follows: November 30, USD to 1: 2018 2017 AUD $ 0.73 $ 0.76 CAD $ 0.75 $ 0.78 EUR $ 1.14 $ 1.18 GBP $ 1.28 $ 1.33 RMB $ 0.14 $ 0.15 If the November 30, 2017 currency exchange rates had been used to translate our November 30, 2018 non-U.
S. dollar functional currency operations assets and liabilities instead of the November 30, 2018 U. S. dollar exchange rates, our total assets would have been higher by $615 million and our total liabilities would have been higher by $308 million.
60 As of November 30, 2018, we have a cross currency swap of $156 million which settles in September 2019.
This cross currency swap is designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign operations, which have a eurodenominated functional currency, thus partially offsetting the foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Based on a 10% change in the U. S. dollar to euro exchange rate as of November 30, 2018, we estimate that this cross currency swaps fair value and offsetting change in U. S. dollar value of our net investments would change by $16 million.
Newbuild Currency Risks At November 30, 2018, our remaining newbuild currency exchange rate risk primarily relates to eurodenominated newbuild contract payments, which represent a total unhedged commitment of $10.1 billion and substantially all relates to newbuilds scheduled to be delivered from 2019 through 2025 to non-euro functional currency brands.
The functional currency cost of each of these ships will increase or decrease based on changes in the exchange rates until the unhedged payments are made under the shipbuilding contract.
We may enter into additional foreign currency derivatives to mitigate some of this foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Based on a 10% change in euro to U. S. dollar exchange rates as of November 30, 2018, the remaining unhedged cost of these ships would have a corresponding change of $1 billion.
Interest Rate Risks The composition of our debt, including the effect of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, was as follows: November 30, 2018 Fixed rate 29% EUR fixed rate 29% Floating rate 6% EUR floating rate 28% GBP floating rate 8% At November 30, 2018, we had interest rate swaps that have effectively changed $385 million of EURIBORbased floating rate euro debt to fixed rate euro debt.
Based on a 10% change in the November 30, 2018 market interest rates, our annual interest expense on floating rate debt, including the effect of our interest rate swaps, would change by an insignificant amount.
Substantially all of our fixed rate debt can only be called or prepaid by incurring additional costs.
Fuel Price Risks Substantially all our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships.
We have been installing advanced air quality systems on our ships.
These efforts are mitigating much of the impact from the ECA requirements.
Given the installation schedule, we expect to use a greater percentage of low sulfur fuel in 2020, which may increase our fuel costs.
Based on a 10% change in fuel prices versus the current spot price that was used to calculate fuel expense in our December 20, 2018 guidance, we estimate that our adjusted diluted earnings per share December 20, 2018 guidance would change by the following: $0.21 per share on an annualized basis for 2019 $0.05 per share for the first quarter of 2019 61 Annex 1 DLC Annual Report
