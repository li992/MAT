The level of net annual management fee income depends on the level of client funds and the level of asset values.
In addition, around half of our business does not generate net Cash result in the first six years, which we describe as funds in gestation.
This deferral of cash generation means that the level of Group income will increase as a result of new business six years ago maturing from gestation to become cash generative.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 31 Section 1: Funds Under Management 1.1 FUM analysis Our financial business model is to attract and retain FUM on which we receive an annual management fee.
As a result, the level of income we receive is ultimately dependent on the value of our FUM, and so its growth is a clear driver of future growth in profits.
The key drivers for FUM are: Our ability to attract new funds in the form of Gross Inflows: Our ability to retain FUM by keeping unplanned withdrawals at a low level: and Net investment returns.
The following table shows how FUM evolved during 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 1 Investment Pension UT ISA & DFM Total Total Billion Billion Billion Billion Billion Opening FUM 28.31 36.15 26.29 90.75 75.31 Gross inflows 2.41 8.76 4.53 15.70 14.60 Net investment return 1.60 1.98 1.90 5.48 6.20 Regular income withdrawals and maturities 0.51 1.12 1.63 1.52 Surrenders and part surrenders 0.99 1.09 1.71 3.79 3.57 Matching strategy disinvestment 0.27 Closing FUM 27.62 40.72 27.21 95.55 90.75 Net inflows 0.91 6.55 2.82 10.28 9.51 Implied surrender rate as a percentage of average FUM 3.5% 2.8% 6.4% 4.1% 4.3% 1 Rowan Dartington Group FUM is included within UT ISA & DFM.
It had closing FUM of 2.31 billion at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 2.11 billion, grossinflows of 0.54 billion for the year 2017: 0.49 billion and outflows of 0.10 billion 2017: 0.10 billion.
The following table shows the robust growth in Net Inflows over the past six years, which combined with strong retention has resulted in consistent growth in FUM.

When we attract new FUM there is a new business margin that emerges at the point of investment, which is a surplus of income over and above the initial costs incurred at the outset.
Within our Cash result presentation, this margin arising from new business isrecognised as it arises, but it is deferred under IFRS.
Once the new business margin has been recognised the pattern of future emergence of cash from ongoing annual management fees differs by product.
Broadly, annual management fees from unit trust and ISA business begin contributing positively to the Cash result from day 1, whilst investment and pensions business enter a six-year gestation period during which no net income from FUM is included in the Cash result.
Once this business has reached its six-year maturity point, it starts contributing positively to the Cash result, and will continue to do soineach year that it remains with the Group.
The following table shows an analysis of FUM, split between mature FUM that is contributing net income to the Cash result and FUM in gestation which is not yet contributing, as at the year-end for the past five years: Gestation FUM that Mature FUM will contribute to the contributing to Cash result in the Cash result the future Total FUM Position as at: Billion Billion Billion 31 December 2018 62.1 33.5 95.6 31 December 2017 60.1 30.6 90.7 31 December 2016 50.2 25.1 75.3 31 December 2015 39.4 19.2 58.6 31 December 2014 35.9 16.1 52.0 The proportion of new business that moves into gestation has increased over the past five years as follows: Proportion of gross inflows into gestation % 2018 59.4 2017 56.5 2016 53.8 2015 53.5 2014 51.5 ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 33 The increasing proportion of Gross Inflows moving into gestation FUM is attributable to the strength of pensions inflows in recent years, in part reflecting the positive impact to our business from pensions freedom.
The long-term nature of this type of investment results in a long postgestation period of Cash result emergence.
The following table gives an indication, for illustrative purposes, of theway in which the gestation balance of 33.5 billion at 31December 2018 may start to contribute to the Cash result over the next six years and beyond.
It assumes a composite margin of 0.77% and that gestation FUM values at 31 December 2018 remain unchanged.
It does not factor in surrenders.

However, given the long-term nature of the business, the significant difference between IFRS profit and the way cash emerges from the business, and the complications of including policyholder tax, we believe the IFRS result does not provide an easy guide to performance.
We therefore present our financial performance and position under three different bases, using a range of alternative performance measures APMs to supplement our IFRS reporting.
The three different bases, which are consistent with those presented last year, are: International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS : Cash result: and European Embedded Value EEV.
APMs are not defined by the relevant financial reporting framework which for the Group is IFRS, but we use them to provide greater insight to the financial performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group and the way it is managed.
A complete Glossary of Alternative Performance Measures is set out on pages 227 to 229, in which we define each APM used in our Financial Review, explain why it is used and, ifapplicable, explain how the measure can be reconciled to the IFRS financial statements.
2.1 International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS IFRS reporting is a statutory requirement, and so although the level of non-cash accounting adjustments is such that IFRS does not reflect thepattern of cash emergence in the Group, there are two measures used that are based upon it.
These are: Profit before shareholder tax: and Underlying profit.
Further information on these IFRS-based measures is set out below, on pages 33 to 35.
PROFIT BEFORE SHAREHOLDER TAX This is a profit measure based on IFRS which removes the impact ofpolicyholder tax.
As a Group with a UK life insurance company at its heart, the Group is required to account for policyholder tax as part of its own corporation tax arrangements, despite it being unrelated to the performance of the business.
The policyholder tax expense or credit is matched by an equivalent deduction or credit from the relevant funds, which is recorded within fee and commission income in the IFRS statement of comprehensive income.
Policyholder tax does not therefore impact the Groups overall profit after tax.
As a result, profit before shareholder tax, but after policyholder tax, is a useful metric.
co. uk 34 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REV IEW C ON T I N U E D 2.1 International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS continued The following table demonstrates the way in which profit before shareholder tax is presented in the IFRS consolidated statement ofcomprehensive income on page 154: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Million Million IFRS loss profit before tax 84.6 342.1 Policyholder tax 296.5 156.0 IFRS profit before shareholder tax 211.9 186.1 Shareholder tax 38.4 40.3 IFRS profit after tax 173.5 145.8 Shareholder tax reflects the tax charge attributable to shareholders and is closely related to the performance of the business.
UNDERLYING PROFIT This is profit before shareholder tax as calculated above adjusted to remove the impact of accounting for deferred acquisition costs DAC, deferred income DIR and the purchased value of in-force business PVIF.
IFRS requires certain up-front expenses incurred and income received to be deferred.
The deferred amounts are initially recognised on the statement of financial position as a DAC asset and DIR liability, which are subsequently amortised to the statement of comprehensive income over a future period.
Substantially all of the Groups deferred expenses are amortised over a 14-year period, and substantially all deferred income is amortised over a six-year period.
The impact of accounting for DAC, DIR and PVIF in the IFRS result is that there is a significant accounting timing difference between the emergence of accounting profits and actual cash-flows.
For this reason, underlying profit is considered to be a helpful metric.
The following table demonstrates the way in which IFRS profit reconciles to Underlying profit: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Million Million IFRS profit before shareholder tax 211.9 186.1 Remove the impact of movements in DAC DIR PVIF 66.7 59.0 Underlying profit before shareholder tax 278.6 245.1 The impact of movements in DAC, DIR and PVIF on IFRS profit before shareholder tax is further analysed as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Million Million Amortisation of DAC 98.2 98.7 DAC on new business for the year 33.7 36.9 Net impact of DAC 64.5 61.8 Amortisation of DIR 149.9 150.4 DIR on new business for the year 148.9 144.4 Net impact of DIR 1.0 6.0 Amortisation of PVIF 3.2 3.2 Movement in year 66.7 59.0 ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 35 Net impact of DAC The scale of the 64.5 million negative overall impact of DAC on the IFRS result is largely due to changes arising from the 2013 Retail Distribution Review RDR.
After this change, the level of expenses that qualified for deferral reduced significantly, but the large balance accrued previously is still being amortised.
As deferred expenses are amortised over a 14-year period there is a significant transition period, which could last for another six to seven years, over which the amortisation of pre-RDR expenses previously deferred will significantly outweigh new post-RDR expenses deferred despite significant business growth, resulting in a net negative impact on IFRS profits.
Net impact of DIR Similarly to DAC, in 2013 the RDR reduced the amount of income that qualified for deferral.
This meant that amortisation of pre-RDR income has exceeded the post-RDR income deferred in each year since 2013 despite significant business growth.
However, as most ofthe deferred income is amortised over a six-year period, this effect is now reversing with income deferred expected to exceed income amortised in 2019.
This is reflected in the small net impacts from DIRin recent years: the impact was a positive 1.0 million in 2018 2017: positive 6.0 million.
2.2 Cash result The Cash result is used by the Board to assess and monitor the level of cash profit net of tax generated by the business.
It is based on IFRS with adjustments made to exclude certain non-cash items, such as DAC, DIR, deferred tax and non-cash-settled share option costs.
Further details, including the full definition of the Cash result, can be found in the Glossary of Alternative Performance Measures on pages 227 to 229.
Although the Cash result should not be confused with the IAS 7 consolidated statement of cash-flows, it provides a helpful supplementary view of the way in which cash is generated and emerges within the Group.
The Cash result reconciles to Underlying profit, as presented in Section 2.1, as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Before Before shareholder tax After tax shareholder tax After tax Million Million Million Million Underlying profit 278.6 227.9 245.1 193.9 Non-cash-settled share-based payments 33.4 33.4 30.5 30.5 Deferred tax impacts 31.8 15.0 Other 24.8 24.4 14.7 13.2 Cash result 287.2 268.7 290.3 252.6 The increase in non-cash-settled share-based payments reflects the recent strong performance of the Group, and more detail can be found in Note 19 on pages 197 to 201.
The most significant deferred tax impact in 2018 and 2017 is recognition in the Cash result of the benefit from realising tax relief.
This has already been recognised under IFRS, and hence Underlying profit, through the establishment of deferred tax assets.
More information can befound in Note 7 on pages 171 to 173.
Other predominantly represents the change in tax charge discounting.
This represents a timing difference between the tax liability due to HMRC and tax deductions charged to clients.
The size of the difference will increase as markets grow, and decrease as markets fall.
This timing difference is adjusted out of the Cash result, which therefore does not reflect the positive effect arising in the IFRS result as aconsequence of falls in markets during the year.
The following table shows an analysis of the Cash result using three different measures: Operating cash result This measure represents the regular emergence of cash from day to day business operations.
Underlying cash result This measure includes the cost of a number of strategic investments which are being incurred and expensed in the year, but which are expected to create long-term value.
Cash result This measure includes the short-term costs associated with the back-office infrastructure project together with other items of a one-off nature.

Previously they were included as part of Investments, which are outside of the Operating cash result.
This reflects the fact that the Academy is now a core part of the Groups adviser recruitment model and its graduates are contributing strongly to FUM growth.
To enable like-for-like comparison, the 2017 comparative has been restated accordingly.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 37 Notes to the Cash result 1.
The net annual management fee is the net manufacturing margin that the Group retains from FUM after payment of the associated costs for example, investment advisory fees and Partner remuneration.
Broadly speaking the Group receives an average net annual management fee of 0.77% post-tax of FUM 2017: 0.77% post-tax.
As noted on page 32 however, our investment and pension business product structure means that these products do not generate net Cashresult after the initial margin during the first six years, the gestation period.
This is reflected in the reduction in fees in gestation period line.
Further information is provided on pages 32 and 33.
Net income from FUM reflects Cash result income from FUM that has reached maturity.
Margin arising from new business is the net positive Cash result impact of new business in the year, reflecting gross inflows and production related expenses.
The driver for this income line is gross inflows and the result is expected to move broadly in line with the pattern of gross inflows attracted.
Establishment expenses, operational development expenses, regulatory fees and FSCS levy represent the expenses of running the Group.
Academy expenses represent the cost of running our Academy and Next Generation Academy.
More detail is provided in Section2.2.
Shareholder interest is the income accruing on the investments and cash held for regulatory purposes together with the interest received on the surplus capital held by the Group.
I n recent years, a deferred tax asset has been established in IFRS for historic capital losses which are regarded as being capable of utilisation over the medium-term.
The tax asset is ignored for Cash result purposes as it is not fungible, but instead the cash benefit realised when losses are utilised is shown in the tax relief from capital losses line.
Utilisation during the year of 29.7 million tax value 2017: 12.1 million was ahead of our expected rate of c. 10-12 million benefit in a year, largely because investment market conditions have meant thataccelerated relief has been available.
Miscellaneous represents the cash flow of the business not covered in any of the other categories.
It includes ongoing administration expenses and associated policy charges, utilisation of the deferred tax asset in respect of prior years unrelieved expenses due to structural timing differences in the life company tax computation and movements in the fair value of renewal income assets.
Asia, DFM, strategic development costs and back-office infrastructure costs reflect significant investments in developing our business for the future.
Each of these investments are expected to result in either additional funds Asia and DFM or operational improvements back-office infrastructure in the future.
Advice margin and fund management fees generated in Asia, and all fees generated by DFM, arealso reflected in these lines.
Variance reflects a number of small non-recurring items incurred during the year.
In 2017 this specifically included 25th anniversary costs, such as the impact of double matching for the Charitable Foundation.

1 DERIVATION OF THE CASH RESULT The Cash result is derived from the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position in a two-stage process: Stage 1: Solvency II Net Assets Balance Sheet Firstly, the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position is adjusted for a number of material balances that reflect policyholder interests in unit-linked liabilities together with the underlying assets that are held to match them.
Secondly, it is adjusted for a number of non-cash accounting balances such as DIR, DAC and associated deferred tax.
The result of these adjustments is the Solvency II Net Assets Balance Sheet and the following table shows the way in which it has been calculated for 2018.
Solvency II Solvency II Net Assets IFRS Balance Net Assets Balance Sheet: Sheet Adjustment 1 Adjustment 2 Balance Sheet 2017 31 December 2018 Million Million Million Million Million Assets Goodwill 15.6 15.6 Deferred acquisition costs 558.5 558.5 Purchased value of in-force business 24.0 24.0 Computer software 1.4 1.4 Property and equipment 28.5 28.5 26.4 Deferred tax assets 147.1 35.5 111.6 144.1 Reinsurance assets 82.8 82.8 Other receivables 1,952.3 1,059.1 3.1 890.1 1,122.4 Income tax assets 9.7 9.7 Investment property 1,820.7 1,820.7 Equities 56,077.9 56,077.9 Fixed income securities 21,966.0 21,960.6 5.4 46.1 Investment in Collective Investment Schemes 4,756.1 3,459.1 1,297.0 1,416.8 Derivative financial instruments 508.8 508.8 Cash and cash equivalents 6,877.6 6,629.1 248.5 274.7 Total assets 94,827.0 91,515.3 720.9 2,590.8 3,030.5 Liabilities Borrowings 348.6 348.6 279.9 Deferred tax liabilities 172.9 18.4 154.5 430.4 Insurance contract liabilities 508.1 421.2 86.9 Deferred income 648.3 648.3 Other provisions 22.7 22.7 20.0 Other payables 1,290.8 277.7 56.2 956.9 1,079.7 Investment contract benefits 67,796.1 67,796.1 Derivative financial instruments 517.4 517.4 Net asset value attributable to unit holders 22,502.9 22,502.9 Income tax liabilities 125.3 Preference shares 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total liabilities 93,807.9 91,515.3 809.8 1,482.8 1,935.4 Net assets 1,019.1 88.9 1,108.0 1,095.1 Adjustment 1 nets out the policyholder interest in unit-linked assets and liabilities.
Adjustment 2 comprises adjustment to the IFRS statement of financial position in line with Solvency II requirements, including removal of DAC, DIR, PVIF and their associated deferred tax balances, goodwill and other intangibles.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 39 Stage 2: Movement in Solvency II Net Assets Balance Sheet Secondly, there are a number of movements in Solvency II net assets that do not represent cash flows for inclusion within the Cash result.
Thefollowing table explains how the overall Cash result reconciles into the total movement: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Million Million Opening Solvency II net assets 1,095.1 1,070.0 Dividend paid 242.7 190.0 Issue of share capital and exercise of options 2.8 7.5 Consideration paid for own shares 6.0 11.3 Change in deferred tax 31.8 15.0 Change in tax discounting 23.4 16.2 Change in goodwill and intangibles 1.5 2.5 Cash result 268.7 252.6 Closing Solvency II net assets 1,108.0 1,095.1 2.2.
2 EXPENSES The table below provides a breakdown of the Groups expenses as presented directly in the Cash result: Year ended 31 December 2018 Year ended 31 December 2017 Before tax Tax rate After tax Before tax Tax rate After tax Million % Million Million % Million 1 Establishment expenses 210.6 19.0 170.6 186.3 19.3 150.4 Operational development costs 24.8 19.0 20.1 19.3 19.3 15.6 Regulatory fees and FSCS levy 25.7 19.0 20.9 29.5 19.3 23.9 Academy 10.4 19.0 8.4 8.2 19.3 6.6 Strategic development costs 8.8 19.0 7.0 6.7 19.3 5.4 Back-office infrastructure costs 44.1 19.0 35.8 26.8 19.3 21.7 Total Cash result expenses 324.4 262.8 276.8 223.6 1 Certain 2017 expenses have been reclassified to better reflect the nature of the expense.
This has resulted in a decrease of 5.5 million in Establishment expenses and increases of 2.8 million in Asia expenses and 2.6 million in Other.
Establishment costs have increased year on year as additional expenses are incurred to support the growth in the Partnership.
Operational development costs have increased in 2018 due to further investment in our infrastructure, resulting in enhanced security and improved remote access for advisers.
There has also been investment in our online communication tools to improve collaboration.
The costs of operating in a regulated sector include regulatory fees and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS levy.
On a post-tax basis, these are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Million Million FSCS levy 12.8 17.1 Regulatory fees 8.1 6.8 FSCS levy and regulatory fees 20.9 23.9 Our position as a market-leading provider of advice means we make a very substantial contribution to supporting the FSCS, thereby providing protection for clients of other businesses in the sector that fail.
Over the last few years, the levy has been at an elevated level but we remain hopeful that it will return to a more normalised level in future.
co. uk 40 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REV IEW C ON T I N U E D 2.2 Cash result continued For the 2018 19 funding year the FSCS shortened the compensation levy period from 12 months to nine months, which aligns the compensation levy period with the FSCSs financial year.
As a result, the post-tax levy expense of 12.8 million recognised in the year to31 December 2018 reflects the levy for a nine-month period, whereas the 17.1 million post-tax levy expense recognised in the year to 31December 2017 was in respect of a 12 month period.
From the 2019 20 funding year onwards, the compensation levy period will again be12 months.
Academy costs have increased in 2018 as a result of expansion of the programme both geographically and in terms of the number of individuals recruited into the programme.
Costs associated with our Bluedoor back-office infrastructure programme have increased in 2018 due to increased levels of migrations taking place during the year, alongside planning for the final key migration of bond business in 2019.
Reconciliation to IFRS expenses There are a number of other expenses which are included within the Cash result but not directly referenced.
This is because expense items that vary with business volumes are matched against the relevant income source.
For example, payments to Partners and other performance related costs are matched against net annual management fees and new business margin.
In addition there are other IFRS expenses that are not included in the Cash result by definition, such as non-cash-settled share-based payment expenses and DAC amortisation.
The following table reconciles the expenses presented explicitly in the Cash result to the IFRS expenses as set out in the statement of comprehensive income on page 154: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Million Million Total Cash result expenses before tax 324.4 276.8 1 Asia expenses 21.3 18.4 DFM expenses 24.5 18.7 Other performance related costs 137.2 133.5 Payments to Partners 781.9 709.0 Investment expenses 106.1 83.4 Third-party administration 100.4 89.9 Amortisation of DAC and PVIF, netofadditions 67.7 65.0 Share-based payments expenses 34.1 32.7 1 Other 43.9 40.2 Total IFRS Group expenses before tax 1,641.5 1,467.6 1 Certain 2017 expenses have been reclassified to better reflect the nature of the expense.
This has resulted in a decrease of 5.5 million in Establishment expenses and increases of 2.8 million in Asia expenses and 2.6 million inOther.
Asia expenses and DFM expenses have both increased during the year as investment is required to support their growth.
Such investment will continue going forwards.
Other performance related costs, for both Partners and employees, vary with the level of new business and the operating profit performance of the business.
Payments to Partners, investment expenses and third-party administration costs are met by corresponding charges to clients, and so any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not impact the profitability of the Group.
Other expenses include interest expense and bank charges, the operating costs of acquired independent financial advisers IFAs anddonations to the St. JamessPlace Charitable Foundation.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 41 2.3 European Embedded Value EEV Wealth management differs from most other businesses, in that the expected shareholder income from client investment activity emerges over a long period in the future.
We therefore supplement the IFRS and Cash results by providing additional disclosure on an EEV basis, which brings into account the net present value of the expected future cash flows.
We believe that a measure of total economic value of the Groups operating performance is useful to investors.
As in previous reporting, our EEV continues to be calculated on a basis determined in accordance with the EEV principles originally issued in May 2004 by the Chief Financial Officers Forum CFO Forum and supplemented in both October 2005 and, following theintroduction of Solvency II, in April 2016.
Many of the principles and practices underlying EEV are similar totherequirements of Solvency II.
In the prior year, we had made anumber of small changes to our EEV methods and assumptions toalign them as closely as possible to Solvency II.
These changes were reflected in the Economic assumption changes line.

The unwind of the discount rate for the year increased to 242.3million 2017: 209.5 million, reflecting the higher opening value of in-force business.
The experience variance during the year was 24.5 million 2017: 3.8 million, reflecting positive retention experience.
The impact of operating assumption changes in the year was a positive 25.9 million, reflecting economies of scale emerging from our administration tariff.
The more significant benefit of 44.0 million in 2017 also included a positive impact from higher retention assumptions.
Distribution business The distribution loss includes the positive gross margin arising from advice income less payments to advisers offset by the costs of investment in growing the Partnership, building the distribution capabilities in Asia and a charge of 11.3 million for the FSCS levy 2017:18.9million.
Investment return variance The investment return variance reflects the capitalised impact on the future annual management fees resulting from the difference between the actual and assumed investment returns.
Given the size of our FUM, a small difference can result in a large positive or negative variance.
The typical investment return on our funds during the period was negative 4.3% after charges, compared to the assumed investment return of positive 1.8%.
This resulted in a negative investment return variance of 460.9 million 2017: positive 340.8 million.
Economic assumption changes The negative variance of 15.1 million arising in the year 2017:positive 29.8 million reflects the negative effect from the increase in the longterm inflation rate.
NEW BUSINESS MARGIN The largest single element of the EEV operating profit analysed in the previous section is the new business contribution.
The level of new business contribution generally moves in line with new business levels.
To demonstrate this link, and aid understanding of the results, we provide additional analysis of the new business margin the margin.
This is calculated as the new business contribution divided by the gross inflows, and is expressed as a percentage.

ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 43 ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS The principal economic assumptions used within the cash flows at 31 December are set out below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 % % Risk-free rate 1.4 1.4 Inflation rate 3.4 3.2 Risk discount rate net of tax 4.5 4.5 Future investment returns: Gilts 1.4 1.4 Equities 4.4 4.4 Unit-linked funds 3.7 3.7 Expense inflation 3.8 3.6 The risk-free rate is set by reference to the yield on ten-year gilts.
Other investment returns are set by reference to the risk-free rate.
The inflation rate is derived from the implicit inflation in the valuation of ten-year index-linked gilts.
This rate is increased to reflect higher increases in earnings-related expenses.
EEV SENSITIVITIES The table below shows the estimated impact on the reported value of new business and EEV to changes in various EEV calculated assumptions.
The sensitivities are specified by the EEV principles and reflect reasonably possible levels of change.
In each case, only the indicated item is varied relative to the restated values.

This is the key economic basis change sensitivity.
The business model is relatively insensitive to change in economic basis.
Note that the sensitivity assumes a corresponding change in all investment returns but no change in inflation.
The 10% increase is applied to the withdrawal rate.
For instance, if the withdrawal rate is 8% then a 10% increase would reflect a change to8.8%.
For the purposes of this sensitivity all unit-linked funds are assumed to be invested in equities.
The actual mix of assets varies and in recent years the proportion invested directly in UKand overseas equities has exceeded 70%.
F or the purposes of this sensitivity only non-fixed elements of theexpenses are increased by 10%.
T his reflects a 100bp increase in the assumed RPI underlying the expense inflation calculation.

ANALYSIS OF THE EEV RESULT The table below provides a summarised breakdown of the embedded value position at the reporting dates: 31 December 31 December 2018 2017 Million Million Value of in-force business 4,763.5 4,552.6 Solvency II net assets 1,108.0 1,095.1 Total embedded value 5,871.5 5,647.7 Pence Pence Net asset value per share 1,109.0 1,067.5 The EEV result above reflects the specific terms and conditions of our products.
Our pension business is split between two portfolios.
Ourcurrent product, the Retirement Account, was launched in 2016 and incorporates both pre-retirement and post-retirement phases of thisinvestment in the same product.
Earlier business was written in our separate Retirement Plan and Drawdown Plan products, targeted atthe each of the two phases separately, and therefore has a slightly shorter term and lower new business margin.
Our experience is that much of our Retirement Plan business converts into Drawdown business at retirement, but, in line with the EEV guidelines, we are required to defer recognition of the additional value from the Drawdown Plan until it is crystallised.
If instead we were to assess the future value of Retirement Plan business beyond the immediate contract boundary in a more holistic fashion, in line with Retirement Account business, this would result in an increase ofapproximately 350 million to our embedded value.
Section 3: Solvency St. JamessPlace has a business model and risk appetite that results in underlying assets being held that fully match with our obligations to clients.
Our clients can access their investments on-demand and because the encashment value is matched, movements in equity markets, currency markets, interest rates, mortality, morbidity and longevity have very little impact on our ability to meet liabilities.
We also have a prudent approach to investing shareholder funds and surplus assets in cash, AAA-rated money market funds and highly rated government securities.
The overall effect of the business model and risk appetite is a resilient solvency position capable of enabling liabilities to be met even through adverse market conditions.
Our Life businesses are subject to the Solvency II capital regime which applied for the first time in 2016.
Given the relative simplicity of our business compared to many, if not most, other organisations that fall within the scope of Solvency II, we have continued to manage the solvency of the business on the basis of holding assets to match client unit-linked liabilities plus a Management Solvency Buffer MSB.
Thishas ensured that, not only can we meet client liabilities at all times beyond the Solvency II requirement of a 1 in 200 years event, but wealso have a prudent level of protection against other risks to the business.
At the same time, we have ensured that the resulting capital heldmeets with the requirements of the Solvency II regime, to which we are ultimately accountable.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 45 For the year ended 31 December 2018 we reviewed the level of our MSB, and concluded that it was appropriate to maintain the MSB for the Life businesses at 355.0 million.
The Groups overall Solvency II net assets position, MSB and management solvency ratios are as follows: Other 2017 1 2 Life regulated Other Total Total 31 December 2018 Million Million Million Million Million Solvency II net assets 366.4 200.6 541.0 1,108.0 1,095.1 MSB 355.0 136.0 491.0 461.9 Management solvency ratio 103% 147% 1 After payment of year-end intra-group dividend.
2 Before payment of the Group final dividend.
Solvency II net assets reflect the assets of the Group in excess of those matching clients unit linked liabilities.
It includes a 111.6 million 2017:144.1 million deferred tax asset which is not immediately fungible, although we expect it will be utilised over the next ten years.
Theactual rate of utilisation will depend on business growth and external factors, particularly investment market conditions.
Solvency II Balance Sheet Whilst we focus on Solvency II net assets and the MSB to manage solvency, we provide additional information about the Solvency II free asset position for information.
The presentation starts from the same Solvency II net assets, but includes recognition of an asset in respect of the expected value of in-force cash flows VIF and a risk margin RM reflecting the potential cost to secure the transfer of the business to a third party.
The Solvency II net assets, VIF and RM comprise the own funds, which is assessed against a solvency capital requirement SCR, reflecting the capital required to protect against a range of 1 in 200 stresses.
The SCR is calculated on the standard formula approach.
No allowance has been made for transitional provisions in the calculation of technical provisions or the SCR.
An analysis of the Solvency II position for our Group, split by regulated and non-regulated entities at the year end is presented in the table below: Other 2017 1 2 Life regulated Other Total Total 31 December 2018 Million Million Million Million Million Solvency II net assets 366.4 200.6 541.0 1,108.0 1,095.1 Value of in-force VIF 3,388.8 3,388.8 3,244.3 Risk margin 989.4 989.4 946.1 Own funds A 2,765.8 200.6 541.0 3,507.4 3,393.3 Solvency capital requirement B 2,364.7 82.6 2,447.3 2,449.2 Solvency II free assets 401.1 118.0 541.0 1,060.1 944.1 Solvency ratio A B 117% 243% 143% 139% 1 After payment of year-end intra-group dividend.

The solvency ratio is not very sensitive to changes in experience or assumptions, and can move counter-intuitively depending on circumstances, as demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis presented below: Solvency II Solvency II capital free assets requirement Solvency ratio Note Million Million % Value at 31 December 2018 1,060.1 2,447.3 143% 100bp reduction in risk free rates, with corresponding change in fixed interest asset values 1 959.1 2,452.2 139% 10% increase in withdrawal rates 2 1,091.4 2,298.3 147% 10% reduction in market value of equity assets 3 983.6 2,202.1 145% 10% increase in expenses 4 1,004.1 2,449.0 141% 100bp increase in assumed inflation 5 977.5 2,454.5 140% Notes to the Solvency II sensitivities 1.
The 10% increase is applied to the lapse rate.
For instance, if the lapse rate is 8% then a 10% increase would reflect a change to 8.8%.
The actual mix of assets varies and in recent years the proportion invested directly in UK and overseas equities has exceeded 70%.
For the purposes of this all expenses are increased by 10%.
