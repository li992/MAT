The marked improvement in ARW existing business operating profit of 9.0m mainly reflects strong growth in Nitrile latex volumes and unit margins, more than offsetting the adverse impact of the weaker USD reducing margins on products priced in Malaysia in USD 4.8m.
Underlying unallocated corporate expenses increased by 1.6m reflecting the annualisation of costs related to the strengthening of the management team in the London Head Office in 2017.
The continuing weakness of sterling during the year resulted in an increase in the Groups reported profit in sterling.
For the European businesses, the rate used for translating profit moved from 1:1.1430 in 2017 to 1:1.1284 in 2018, with a resulting uplift in the 2018 ENA operating profit of 0.9m.
For the Malaysian businesses the Malaysian Ringgit moved from 1:MYR5.5580 in 2017 to 1:MYR5.3661, with a resulting uplift in the ARW operating profit of 1.6m.

In 2017, it primarily related to the rationalisation of the Ribcourt France site and the initial onerous lease provision for the Ossett site.
Sale of business relates to the disposal of the Leuna Germany site and the disposal of 51% of our sales entities in Dubai.
Sale of land in 2018 relates to the Groups profit on disposal of the final tranche of Malaysian land at Kluang.
The profit on sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton UK.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles decreased significantly during 2018 due to the full amortisation during the year of the PolymerLatex customer relationships acquired during 2011.
The amortisation includes 1.4m in respect of intangibles relating to the acquisition of BASF Pischelsdorf Austria in 2018.
Ahead of the Group refinancing during the year a process was undertaken to issue fixed rate unsecured senior notes.
Despite a strong response from investors the Group decided not to complete the transaction due to unfavourable market conditions.
The costs of this process are not reflective of Underlying performance.
Following a UK High Court ruling during the year in relation to the equalisation of male and female Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP a pension plan amendment is deemed to have occurred.
The actuarial estimate of this irregular cost was 2.8m.

This was partly offset by the higher cost fixed Euro interest rate swap in the second half of the year.
As part of the refinancing in July 2018 the Group entered into swap arrangements to fix interest rates on the full value of the 440m committed unsecured revolving credit facility.
The fair value of the unhedged derivatives relates to the mark to market of the swap arrangements at 31 December 2018 in excess of the current borrowings of the Group.
This has been taken through Special Items as it is not reflective of the Underlying performance.

It is therefore helpful to consider the Underlying and Special Items affecting tax rates separately: The effective tax rate on Underlying performance reduced in the year as a result of changes in the geographic mix of profits, prior year items and decreases in tax rates in certain jurisdictions.
The effective tax rate for Special Items is principally driven by the deferred tax credit on the amortisation of acquired intangibles and the zero corporate tax rate on the profit on sale of Malaysian land.

This company and its subsidiaries are now a relatively minor part of the Group and hence the non-controlling interests impact on the Underlying performance is not significant.
The Special Items in 2018 reflects the non-controlling interests share 30% in the Malaysian land sale and restructuring costs associated with the Kluang site, referred to in the Special Items section above.
The land was owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, a 100% subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd.

The changes in Underlying and IFRS earnings per share shown in the table are therefore driven predominantly by the same factors that influence the change in profit before taxation and taxation described above.
Cash performance The Groups primary focus is on managing net borrowings rather than on cash.
The following summarises the movement in net borrowings and is in the format used by management: 2018 2017 m m Underlying operating profit excluding joint ventures 141.7 138.0 Movement in working capital 35.2 9.5 Depreciation and amortisation Underlying 38.9 37.2 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 75.7 60.3 Business cash flow 69.7 124.4 Interest paid net 4.5 4.8 Tax paid 23.0 26.1 IAS 19 Interest charge 3.2 4.3 Pension funding in excess of IAS 19 interest charge 13.8 12.5 Share based payments variance to IFRS2 charge 3.9 0.3 Non-controlling interest and joint venture dividends 0.4 1.5 Underlying operating cash flow 20.9 77.9 Cash impact of restructuring and site closure 3.3 6.0 Cash impact of aborted bond costs 1.2 Sale of property, plant and equipment 17.5 2.2 Purchase of business and acquisition costs 26.3 66.2 Sale of business 3.7 7.6 Dividends paid 42.5 39.1 Foreign exchange and other movements 2.3 6.6 Movement in net borrowings 33.5 30.2 Net debt increased by 33.5m 2017: 30.2m in the year, rising from 180.5m at 31 December 2017 to 214.0m at 31 December 2018.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 41 Chief Financial Officers review continued The rise in net debt reflects: An increased investment in working capital partly reflecting higher raw material prices in the final quarter of 2018 relative to the comparative period and higher inventories as a result of reduced sales activity in the same period.
Working capital remains at circa 10% of sales on a twelve month rolling basis.
The capital expenditure in 2018 reflects the cash spend on the previously announced Nitrile latex capacity expansion in Pasir Gudang Malaysia, the made-to-order speciality acrylic lines in Worms Germany, the increase in acrylic capacity in Roebuck USA, debottlenecking of Marl Germany for foam production and capacity expansion of SantAlbano Italy.
Our spend on sustenance capital expenditure is 24m compared with 20m in 2017.
The tax paid amount of 23.0m represents 17.0% of Underlying profit before tax and is broadly in line with the effective tax rate 2017: 20.1%.
The reduction in tax paid is consistent with the change in geographic mix of profits, with proportionately more profits generated in Malaysia in 2018 relative to 2017.
The amount shown as pension funding in excess of the IAS19 charge mainly reflects the UK defined benefit deficit recovery funding of 15.5m 2017: 14.7m.
The rise in the deficit recovery payment in 2018 reflects the schedule of contributions agreed with the Trustees in 2016 as a part of the 2015 triennial pension scheme valuation which was based on the forecast increase in the pension payroll, allowing for retiring employees.
Sale of property, plant and equipment primarily relates to the Groups Malaysian land sale proceeds in 2018, and the Hapton land sale in 2017.
The outflow for purchase of business principally relates to the purchase of BASF Pischelsdorf Austria for 25.8m completed on 31 January 2018.
The prior year outflow of 66.2m mainly relates to the acquisition of Speciality Additives Belgium.
The sale of business proceeds of 3.7m mainly relates to the proceeds from the disposal of 51% of the Dubai sales entities.
The prior year proceeds of 7.6m is the amount received from the disposal of Synthomer Leuna Germany.
Substantial amounts of the Groups borrowings have been maintained in Euros as a natural hedge against the net asset base in this currency.
With the devaluation of sterling referred to above, the translation at the year-end rates has resulted in an exchange loss recognised in reserves and therefore a higher borrowings amount offset by an increase in the Euro net asset base.
Financing and liquidity The Group refinanced in July 2018 securing lower interest margins and entering into a new committed unsecured four year multicurrency revolving credit facility of 440m expiring July 2022 RCF with an option to request an extension to July 2023.
At the same time we secured an additional committed unsecured short term bank loan facility of 55m expiring in July 2019.
The Group also entered into agreements to fix the Euribor interest rate on 440m of borrowings for a period of seven years expiring 2025, fixing the cost of borrowing at an historically low rate and insulating the Group from future increases in the Euribor interest rate.
2018 2017 m m Committed facilities 444.4 418.9 Drawn at 31 December 292.0 246.7 Facility headroom 152.4 172.2 In addition to the facility headroom, the Group had cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2018 of 96.9m 2017: 89.6m net of overdrafts of 20.7m 2017: 24.2m.
2018 2017 m m Cash and cash equivalents 96.9 89.6 Current borrowings including overdrafts 70.1 73.1 Non-current borrowings 240.8 197.0 Net borrowings 214.0 180.5 The financial covenant for the new RCF is that net borrowings must be less than 3.25 times EBITDA.
2018 2017 m m Net borrowings 214.0 180.5 EBITDA 181.0 176.2 Net borrowings EBITDA 1.2 1.0 The significant facility and covenant headroom demonstrate the continued financial strength of the Group, which is well positioned to fund future organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions.

The reduction in UK defined benefit pension liabilities of 25.1m primarily relates to an increase in the discount rate from 2.5% to 2.8% 16.9m combined with updated membership data 11.1m reduction and offset by the GMP equalisation increase of 2.8m.
Acquisition and disposal accounting For the acquisition, the assets and liabilities have been included at fair value with the balance of consideration shown as goodwill.
KPMG LLP were engaged to advise on the fair value of the property, plant and equipment PPE.
Overall their conclusion was that the total fair value of the PPE should be increased by 0.6m.
KPMG LLP also performed a valuation of the intangibles, which mainly comprised of customer relationships.
Accordingly on acquisition, the Group recognised goodwill and acquired intangibles of 1.2m and 17.6m respectively and the valuation is now final.
These intangibles are being amortised over periods of 5 to 15 years.
