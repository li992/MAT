A deferred tax liability of 1,285 million was also recognised in respect of the GKN intangible assets, which is not expected to give rise to a cash liability.
In addition to the independent valuations, external advisers carried out a comprehensive series of visits to all GKN sites to perform balance sheet reviews line by line.
These reviews identified a number of required adjustments, in particular in respect of net working capital and provisions.

In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets the recoverable amount is assessed as being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
The Board is comfortable that no impairment is required in respect of the goodwill and intangible assets of the recently acquired GKN businesses or the Nortek businesses.
Both Security & Smart Technology and Ergotron have manufacturing facilities located in China that export to the US and their results in 2018, and the ongoing market environment, have been negatively impacted by the increase in US tariffs placed on Chinese goods.
The intention is to pass any increased tariffs through to customers, but the uncertainty around how customers will react and or a further escalation of US tariffs on Chinese goods and the impact that this could have on the behaviour of competitors means that there is a risk that future forecasts could be negatively impacted.
In the previous year, the assets of the Brush business were impaired by 145 million to a value of 300 million, using the fair value less costs to sell basis.
This method of valuation, at the time, was higher than the value in use method, because that excluded the benefits of the restructuring announced in February 2018, and would have given a value of 178 million.
The restructuring of the Brush business that was announced in February 2018 followed a full review of the power generation industry and highlighted the surplus generator manufacturing capacity existing in the market.
The restructuring programme has been implemented in line with plan.
However, in 2018 the conditions in the generator services business have also become more challenging as the year has progressed, with competitors taking a decision to look to service opportunities to offset surplus capacity issues in the generator manufacturing market.
Alongside this, customers and competitors in the power generation sector have continued to reorganise and restructure in the second half of 2018.
These newly developed generator services market conditions and the decisions from significant market participants have had a direct impact on the trading of Brush and reduced forecasts in the Brush generator servicing business.
At 31 December 2018, the recoverable amount of the Brush assets, using the reduced forecasts and the value in use method, was 103 million, resulting in a further impairment to Brush goodwill of 123 million in the year.
