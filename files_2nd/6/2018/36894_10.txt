Record first-half revenue of 268.4 million was followed by a new record quarter for revenue in Q3 of 152.9 million, with Q4 revenue of 147.7 million, the Groups second-highest quarterly revenue performance.
OTC leveraged OTC leveraged revenue of 548.4 million was 16% higher than in the 2017 financial year.
The 144,600 active clients in 2018 were 2% lower than in the 2017 financial year, which was more than offset by the 18% increase in average revenue per client to just under 3,800.
The lower number of active clients in 2018 compared with the prior year reflects the boost to client numbers in the first half of the 2017 financial year as a result of the trading opportunities created by the EU referendum in the UK in June 2016, and the US presidential election in November 2016.
The number of active clients in the first half of the year was 5% lower than in the comparative period.
In the second half of the 2018 financial year the number of active clients was 1% higher than in the same period in the prior year.
In total, the number of new OTC leveraged clients who traded for the first time in the year was 39,179, with 18,027 new clients in the first half and 21,152 new clients in the second half.
The relatively low level of new client recruitment during the first half reflects the introduction of the new appropriateness test for prospective clients together with increased wealth hurdles, and a lower level of advertising and marketing.
The cost per first trade for OTC leveraged equivalent accounts, based on the external advertising and marketing spend in the year, was 1,400 the same as for the prior year.
The number of active clients in a quarter reached a new record of 99,500 in Q3 of 2018, including 12,500 new clients who traded for the first time in that quarter.
Interest in trading in that period was heightened by the excitement around cryptocurrencies and by a significant spike in financial market volatility in February.
Client trading in cryptocurrencies accounted for 7% of OTC leveraged revenue in the 2018 financial year.
The level of client activity in cryptocurrencies has slowed markedly since the end of January, and accounted for 3% of revenue in Q4.
Financial market volatility was relatively subdued during the year until February.
The interest in cryptocurrencies during Q3 and the increased level of volatility in Q4 created trading opportunities for clients, and the business experienced an increase in client trades in the second half compared with the first half.
Revenue per client has been strong throughout the year.
In the first half of the year, revenue per client was 15% higher than in the prior year at 2,290.
In the second half of the year, revenue per client of 2,497 was 21% higher than in the prior year, and 9% higher than in the first half.
In addition to the factors which drive client income, revenue per client is impacted by the Companys hedging efficiency, which determines the extent to which client income is converted into trading revenue.
Hedging efficiency has been good throughout the year.
IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 23 Strategic Report OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Revenue in the UK of 249.5 million was 12% higher than in the 2017 financial year, with the lower level of active clients offset by a 21% increase in revenue per client to 4,166 FY17: 3,446.
Revenue in EMEA, which comprises our branches in the EU and our subsidiaries outside the EU in Switzerland, Dubai and South Africa, increased 18% to 162.1 million FY17: 137.5 million.
The number of active clients was broadly flat compared to the prior period, with revenue per client up 17% to 3,519 FY17: 2,997.
Growth in revenue of over 25% from our subsidiaries in Switzerland and Dubai reflects our success in developing our business through establishing a local presence in attractive markets.
Revenue in APAC increased 20% to 136.8 million FY17: 114.1 million.
The number of active clients increased 3%, with revenue per client up 16% to 3,543 FY17: 3,051.
Our businesses in Australia and Singapore both had a particularly successful year.
OTC leveraged revenue by asset class FY18 FY17 % m m Change Indices 224.2 203.8 10% Foreign exchange 130.7 82.2 59% Equities 95.4 76.4 25% Commodities 55.0 68.2 19% Options 43.1 44.0 2% OTC leveraged 548.4 474.6 16% Revenue was higher in the 2018 financial year for indices, foreign exchange and equities.
The fall in commodities revenue can be largely attributed to a particularly strong year in 2017, reflecting the trading opportunities in the oil markets resulting from sustained high levels of volatility.
Revenue from foreign exchange in the 2018 financial year includes 36.5 million from cryptocurrencies FY17: 5.9 million with the growth in revenue from conventional FX pairs up by 23%.
Revenue from options includes OTC binaries, which are no longer offered to retail clients in the UK and EU.
US Revenue from Nadex, our exchange traded derivatives business in the US, was up 18% to 16.6 million FY17: 14.1 million.
A 1% drop in the number of active clients was offset by revenue per client rising 20% to 756 FY17: 630.
Share dealing and investments Revenue from our share dealing and investments services increased 67% to 4.0 million FY17: 2.4 million.
The number of active clients increased by 74%.
The share dealing and investments products help to retain existing OTC leveraged clients, and the share dealing product provides an acquisition channel to attract new clients, for whom it is appropriate, to OTC leveraged trading.
Multi-product clients those who trade OTC leveraged products and also hold stocks in a share dealing or investments account at the end of the period increased by nearly 40% at the end of the year compared with the same time last year, to just under 7,000.
This is an important metric for the Group, as it shows engagement of our client base in our whole product set, with multi-product clients having a higher value and lower rate of attrition than single-product clients.
OPERATING INCOME Net operating income increased 17% to 571.2 million, primarily reflecting the 16% increase in trading revenue.
Net interest income on client money increased to 4.5 million, driven by an increase in the amount of client money held.
Betting duties incurred by the Group decreased reflecting lower client losses.
The Group also bears Italian financial transaction tax FTT costs, which have increased in line with activity.
The increase in other operating income primarily reflects the full-year effect of the income from the sale of client leads generated by DailyFX in the USA.
This income has now ceased, as the Group prepares to launch its US OTC FX business.

Info OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses by cost type FY18 FY17 % m m Change Fixed remuneration 96.0 95.5 1% Advertising and marketing 58.7 64.5 9% IT maintenance and communications 13.3 14.2 6% Premises 12.6 13.2 5% Market data 9.7 9.7 Legal and professional fees 8.8 8.0 10% Regulatory fees 7.1 2.3 209% Irrecoverable VAT and other sales taxes 13.1 14.1 7% Credit card and alternative payment charges 5.5 2.2 150% Depreciation and amortisation 17.6 16.4 7% Other 11.8 12.4 5% Operating expenses 254.2 252.5 1% Headcount at year-end 1,677 1,546 8% Operating expenses increased 1% to 254.2 million FY17: 252.5 million.
Fixed remuneration costs were little changed despite an 8% increase in year-end headcount, reflecting a lower average cost per head as a result of offshoring a number of roles to our non-UK operational hubs.
Advertising and marketing spend reduced by 9% to 58.7 million.
Expenditure at the start of the financial year was reduced to allow the business to assess the impact of the revised appropriateness tests and wealth hurdles on client applications.
Additionally, expenditure in the prior year was elevated, reflecting the client recruitment opportunities around the EU referendum and the US election.
The Group is charged regulatory fees by the various regulators in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and in addition is required to make a contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS in the UK.
The increase in regulatory fees is due to the rebate of FSCS levies that the Group received in the prior year.
The 7.1 million charge in the 2018 financial year is more indicative of the ongoing annual cost.
The Group does not recover all of the input VAT and other sales taxes it incurs on costs.
The decrease in irrecoverable VAT and other sales taxes reflects the lower marketing and advertising costs in the 2018 financial year compared with the prior year.
Credit card and alternative payment charges increased to 5.5 million, reflecting the removal of charges to clients for credit card payments in a number of jurisdictions and the introduction of PayPal as a payment method in the 2018 financial year.
Depreciation and amortisation was 7% higher at 17.6 million FY17: 16.4 million, reflecting a full year of amortisation of DailyFX, which was acquired in October 2016.
Operating expenses by activity category FY18 Year-end FY18 FY17 % headcount m m Change Prospect acquisition 199 79.8 85.9 7% Sales and client service 463 33.1 30.2 10% Technology and innovation 762 88.5 90.6 2% Business administration 253 52.8 45.8 15% Operating expenses 1,677 254.2 252.5 1% The four key areas of activity in the business are prospect acquisition, sales and client service, technology and innovation, and business administration.
The analysis of operating expenses into these four areas provides additional information on the drivers of operating expenses.
IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 25 Strategic Report OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Prospect acquisition The purpose of this expenditure is to attract suitable prospects for conversion into new clients.
The majority of this expenditure is discretionary, and can be flexed according to market conditions and acquisition opportunities.
Prospect acquisition costs decreased by 7% to 79.8 million, primarily due to the lower advertising and marketing expenditure in the 2018 financial year.
Sales and client service The majority of the expenditure in this area relates to the costs of our client-facing staff, 30% of whom are directly involved in sales and conversion, with nearly two-thirds working in client service roles.
Sales and client service expenditure increased by 10% to 33.1million.
Staff costs remained flat, with the increased cost reflecting the higher credit card and alternative payment costs in the 2018 financial year.
Technology and innovation The expenditure in this area includes all the costs associated with the provision of the platform that our clients use to trade, and through which we manage our market risk.
It also includes our product and platform development costs, the costs of managing and running our internalisation and hedging processes and the costs of our office infrastructure.
Technology and innovation costs decreased 2% to 88.5 million.
These costs are largely fixed in nature, and do not directly flex with revenue.
Business administration The costs of this area includes our finance teams, our risk and compliance function, HR, legal and other corporate functions, and the legal, professional and regulatory fees we incur in administering and managing the Group.
Business administration costs increased 15% to 52.8 million, reflecting the higher cost of regulatory fees in the period, and an increase in fixed remuneration costs as we invested in our control and support functions.
VARIABLE REMUNERATION FY18 FY17 % m m Change Share-based compensation 8.8 7.5 17% Sales bonuses 4.5 3.6 25% General bonuses 22.6 12.5 81% Variable remuneration 35.9 23.6 52% Variable remuneration costs increased by 52% to 35.9 million.
Share-based compensation costs relate to the long-term incentive plans for senior management.
The costs reflect the size of these awards and the extent to which they are expected to vest, which is driven predominantly by EPS and relative TSR performance.
Sales bonuses increased by 25%, reflecting increased bonuses paid to sales staff based on new accounts opened and funded, and to some of our client service staff who manage our high-value client relationships.
The general bonus pool increased by 81% to 22.6 million.
The size of the general bonus pool is dependent upon the Groups annual performance against internal targets, which reflect both financial and non-financial measures.
It is not based on financial performance compared with the prior year.
NET FINANCE COSTS INCOME The Group earns interest income on its cash balances and on its holdings of gilts, which in the 2018 financial year totalled 1.6million, 0.3 million higher than in the prior year FY17: 1.3 million reflecting the higher average cash balances during the year.
The Group pays fees and interest relating to its revolving credit facility, which in the 2018 financial year totalled 1.8 million, 0.3million higher than in the prior year FY17: 1.5 million reflecting the higher average utilisation of the facility during 2018.
The Group earns and pays interest on its cash balances at hedging brokers.
Interest is earned on positive balances in each currency, and is paid on any negative balances in each currency, which occur as the Group frequently deposits GBP to cover margin requirements in USD and EUR.
In the 2018 financial year the Group earned nil net interest income on its balances at hedging brokers FY17: net charge 0.2 million.
26 IG GROUP HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Company Overview Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Shareholder and Co. Info In the 2017 financial year the Groups net finance costs income benefitted from the release of a provision related to interest payable on unpaid withholding tax in Australia.
The interest cost was settled at a lower rate than had been provided for, and the 0.7 million balance of the provision was released.
TAXATION The effective tax rate for the year is 19.4%, 1.4% points lower than the prior year FY17: 20.8%.
The vast majority of the Groups taxable profit arises in the UK.
The reduction in the effective tax rate reflects the full-year benefit of the reduction in the standard rate of UK corporation tax to 19% from 20% with effect from 1 April 2017.
In addition, the rate benefits from the recognition of a patent box claim that will be made in the UK tax filings for the 2018 financial year.
These benefits have been partly offset by the 1.4 million reduction in the value of the Groups deferred tax assets relating to its tax losses in the USA, asa result of the reduction in the US corporation tax rate enacted in the second half of the 2018 financial year.
The patent box claim relates to the grant of a patent by the UK Patent Office for the Groups invention in measuring latency.
Furtherpatents are expected to be granted by the European patent office for inventions relating to automatic pricing and for the synchronisation of independent systems.
The recognition of this claim has reduced the effective tax rate for the 2018 financial year by 1.2% points.
Half of that benefit relates to the 2017 financial year, the year in which the patent box election first had effect.
The Groups effective rate of tax remains dependent on the mix of taxable profit by geography, the tax rates levied in those geographies and the availability and use of taxable losses.
The Groups current estimate of the effective rate of tax for the 2019 financial year is 19.5%.
DIVIDEND The Board is recommending a final dividend of 33.51 pence per share, giving a full-year dividend of 43.2 pence per share, 34% higher than the 32.3 pence per share paid for the 2017 financial year.
If approved at the Companys AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 26 October 2018 to those members on the register at the close of business on 28 September 2018.
CASH GENERATION AND MOVEMENT IN OWN FUNDS The Group uses own funds, and net own funds, generated from operations as its key measures of cash generation.
OWN FUNDS FLOW FY18 FY17 m m Operating profit 281.1 213.4 Depreciation and amortisation 17.6 16.4 Share-based compensation 7.0 7.7 Change in working capital 15.2 8.3 Own funds generated from operations 320.9 229.2 As % of operating profit 114% 107% Taxes paid 48.9 45.3 Net own funds generated from operations 272.0 183.9 Cash generation remains strong, with own funds generated from operations of 320.9 million, 40% higher than in the prior year.
The high level of conversion of profit into cash reflects the non-cash charges in operating profit and the increase in the net credit balance in working capital due to the higher level of the bonus accrual at the end of the 2018 financial year, compared with the prior year.
Tax payments of 48.9 million reflect the payment of the 20.0 million balance of the UK corporation tax liability for the 2017 financial year outstanding at the start of the year, 24.8 million representing around half of the estimated UK corporation tax liability for 2018, and 4.1 million of overseas tax.

Capital expenditure in the year of 11.0 million relates primarily to internal IT development, third-party software and IT equipment.
Inthe 2017 financial year capital expenditure also included amounts related to the refurbishment of the London office.
Dividend payments to shareholders during the 2018 financial year of 119.6 million comprise the final dividend for the 2017 financial year of 84.0 million and the interim dividend for the 2018 financial year of 35.6 million.
The final dividend for the 2018 financial year of 123.1 million will, if approved, be paid on 26 October 2018.
The Groups own funds of 746.1 million at the end of the year are 131.8 million higher than at the end of the prior year, reflecting the 133.5 million own funds cash flow after investments and dividends, and 1.7 million of FX retranslation of own funds in nonUKbusinesses.

Info As at 31 May 2018, the Groups capital employed was 842.1 million 31 May 2017: 735.3 million, all of which was provided by shareholders funds.
The Groups capital is employed to fund the Groups operations.

The Group has access to additional liquidity through a committed revolving credit facility.
The Groups total liquid assets at the end of year were 872.3 million 31 May 2017: 731.4 million.
The increase in liquid assets primarily reflects the increase in own funds.
The Group requires liquidity to fund its day-to-day operations, primarily to fund the margin that its hedging brokers require to support the Groups hedging positions, the capital that its subsidiaries are required to maintain, and to fund the requirement to maintain adequate buffers in client money accounts.
The average broker margin requirement in the 2018 financial year was 372 million, 87 million higher than in 2017, with a peak broker margin requirement of 453 million during the year.
At 31 May 2018, the actual broker margin requirement was 387 million.
Throughout the year, the Group had access to a committed revolving credit facility RCF of 160 million to assist its liquidity risk management.
The Group seeks to manage its liquidity so that it will be able to meet all liquidity requirements without delay.
The Groups practice has been to draw down on its RCF during periods when broker margin is at elevated levels, and in advance of events that could result in an elevated broker margin requirement, in order to reduce liquidity risk, particularly during periods when the Groups available liquidity has been reduced as a result of the payment of the final dividend.
During the 2018 financial year, reflecting the increase in the peak and general level of broker margin requirement, the revolving credit facility was at least partly drawn for the period from the end of October 2017 through to the beginning of April 2018.
Subsequent to the year-end the Group cancelled the existing 160 million bank facility agreement and entered into a new 200million agreement consisting of a 100 million revolving credit facility and a 100 million three-year term loan.

The Group is required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital in accordance with the Individual Capital Guidance ICG periodically determined by the FCA, based on their supervisory review and evaluation process SREP of the Group, plus an amount equal to the higher of the internally calculated Capital Planning Buffer and the combination of the Conservation and Countercyclical buffers.
The FCA determines the ICG following review of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, through which the Group calculates the amount of capital that should be held against specific firm risks, in addition to the Pillar 1 requirements.
The FCA last undertook a SREP of IG Group in the first half of calendar year 2016, and advised the Board of the level of capital the Group is required to hold in August 2016.
The ICG advised in August 2016 replaced the ICG advised to the Board in May 2013.
The ICG advised by the FCA in August 2016 requires the Group to hold capital in addition to the Pillar 1 minimum equal to 9.4% of the Pillar 1 Risk Exposure Amounts.
The required minimum capital ratio at 31 May 2018 was 19.6%, including the effect of the Combined Buffers, being the Capital Conservation Buffer, which the Bank of England raised on 1 January 2018 to 1.875% in line with the transitional provisions laid out by the FCA in IFPRU TP 7, and the Countercyclical Buffer.
SEGREGATED CLIENT FUNDS At 31 May 2018, the Group held 1,386.9 million 31 May 2017: 1,215.3 million of client money in segregated trust bank accounts, and 945.0 million 31 May 2017: 499.8 million of client assets in third-party custodian accounts.
These amounts are segregated client money and assets, and are therefore excluded from the balance sheet.
