Rental value change excludes units materially altered during the year.
Over the year to 31 March 2018, we saw a small decline in values in a number of the categories within our Combined Portfolio.
Overall values were down 0.7%, with the like-for-like portfolio down 1.5%.
With the property sectors in which we operate experiencing limited change in rental values and equivalent yields, our valuation performance is more influenced by individual asset performance than wider market movements.
Within the like-for-like portfolio, our shopping centres fell in value by 3.0% as rental value growth was insufficient to offset a 10 basis points outward yield shift.
The largest movement was at Bluewater where the value was down 11% as the valuer moved its yield out by 50 basis points based on the limited transactional evidence available.
The value of our Retail parks was down 1.1% as rental values declined by a similar amount while our Leisure and hotel assets were up in value by 0.7% as rental values grew.
Rentalvalue declines and a 12% fall in the value of one of our oldest assets, Portland House, SW1 were behind the 1.5% reduction in London office values.
Outside the like-for-like portfolio, our pre-letting to Deutsche Bank at 21Moorfields, EC2 and completion of Westgate Oxford led to the 18.3%valuation surplus on our Development programme.
Completed developments were up 1.0% in value on the back of the successful letting of Nova, SW1 during the year, while the requirement to adjust for future purchasers costs was behind the 1.9% fall in the value of our Acquisitions, partly offset by rental growth at the outlets we acquired.
