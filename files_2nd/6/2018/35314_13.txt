Given the Groups lower reinsurance retention in recent years, the majority of the reserve release related to prior years.

These sensitivities are net of reinsurance and exclude the impact of taxation.
These sensitivities reflect one-off impacts at 31 December and should not be interpreted as predictions.
The sensitivities relating to an increase or decrease in the real discount rate used for PPOs illustrate a movement in the time value of money from the assumed level of 0% for reserving.
The PPO sensitivity has been calculated as the direct impact of the change in the real discount rate with all other factors remaining unchanged.
Ogden discount rate sensitivity has been calculated as the direct impact of a permanent change in the discount rate with all other factors remaining unchanged.
The Group will consider the statutory discount rate when setting its reserves but not necessarily provide on this basis, as is the case at the year ended 31 December 2018.
This is intended to ensure that reserves are appropriate for current and potential future developments.
