STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW The strong operational performance and the gain on the sale of a non-core royalty early in the year drove positive earnings and cash flow for 2018.
In an effort to minimise the impact of the current challenging operating environment, we increased our focus on cost control, cash flow management and capital allocation.
Jaco Maritz Chief Financial Officer Revenue of US$663.8 million was US$87.7 million lower than 2017, with the US$12 per ounce higher The Group financial average realised gold price potentially offset by the 12% lower sales base in line with lower production.
performance was Cash costs increased to US$680 per ounce sold in 2018 from US$587 per ounce sold in 2017, driven by the higher average cost valuation relating to the drawdown of lower grade stockpiles at Buzwagi resilient despite the compared to the higher-grade mined ounces in 2017, the lower production base and lower co-product revenue, partly offset by lower direct operating costs.
impact of the planned AISC of US$905 per ounce sold was 3% higher than 2017 US$875 per ounce sold, mainly due to transitioning to low higher cash costs, the impact of lower sales volumes on individual cost items and lower non-cash share-based payment revaluation credits, partly offset by lower capitalised development costs at grade stockpile Bulyanhulu and North Mara, lower sustaining capital expenditure driven by Bulyanhulu being on reduced processing at Buzwagi operations and lower corporate administration expenditure due to the restructuring of corporate and shared services offices.
and Bulyanhulu EBITDA decreased from US$257.2 million in 2017 to US$225.9 million in 2018, mainly due to the remaining on above-mentioned factors, partly offset by lower exploration expenditure and lower other charges.
Othercharges of US$36.1 million is lower than the prior year of US$90.4 million driven by the gain reduced operations.
onthe sale of a non-core royalty for US$45 million, partly offset by higher reduced operations costs atBulyanhulu and higher legal fees.
Impairment charges of US$28.9 million, mainly related to the Nyanzaga exploration project in Tanzania, following the agreement to sell the Groups stake in the project, combined with the impairment of historical exploration assets during the year end carrying value reviews.
The tax expense of US$37.9 million compared to the tax credit of US$2.3 million in 2017.
The tax expense for 2018 is driven by the current year profit generated at North Mara, partly offset by losses incurred at Bulyanhulu.
Included in the current year expense is a 2017 final North Mara tax charge of US$3.1million.
As a result of the above, net earnings amounted to US$58.9 million, compared to a net loss in2017 of US$707.4 million after a net impairment of US$644 million, with earnings per share ofUS14.4 cents compared to a loss per share of US172.5 cents after impact of impairment ofUS157.1cents.
Adjusted net earnings of US$44.3 million were US$101.9 million lower than 2017.
Adjustedearnings per share amounted to US10.8 cents, down from US35.7 cents in 2017.
Operational cash inflows of US$126.1 million compared to outflows of US$23 million in 2017, primarily as a result of lower working capital outflows due to the build-up of concentrate on hand which impacted 2017 compared to the draw-down of ore stockpiles at Buzwagi in 2018, partly offset by lower adjusted EBITDA.
