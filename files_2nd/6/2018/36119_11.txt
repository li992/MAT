2017 results have been restated for the effect of adopting IFRS 15 see note 3 u.
Revenue Revenue decreased by 4.0% compared with the prior year statutory results.
Of the decrease, 2.7% 211m was due to movements in exchange rates caused by the relative strengthening of the average sterling exchange rates affecting the Group.
Excluding the effects of movements in exchange rates, revenue decreased by 1.4% mainly due to a 190m reduction in revenue in respect of businesses disposed during the current and prior years including the Groups businesses in Hungary and Israel and its Youth Services business in North America.
Revenue from onerous contracts is slightly higher than the prior year at 118m 2017: 107m.
Excluding the effects of movements in exchange rates, revenue from disposed businesses and onerous contracts, revenue grew by 1.1% at constant exchange rates.
Business performance is discussed in more detail by service line and region on page 57.
Adjusted PBITA Adjusted PBITA of 460m 2017: 492m was down 6.5%.
Of the decrease, 2.0% 10m was due to movements in exchange rates.
Excluding the effect of movements in exchange rates, Adjusted PBITA decreased by 4.6%, reflecting Adjusted PBITA growth in Secure Solutions offset by lower revenue and increased business development and operating costs in the Cash Solutions division, as well as a reduction in Adjusted PBITA from disposed businesses of 17m.
Excluding the effect of movements in exchange rates, Adjusted PBITA from disposed businesses and onerous contracts, the Groups Adjusted PBITA remained in line with the prior year.
Specific items - charges The specific items charges of 32m 2017: 34m include 12m related to additional provisions in Asia in respect of historical employee gratuities and end of service benefits and 11m related to the reassessment of estimated settlement amounts in respect of historical workers compensation claims in the Americas.
Also included in specific item charges is a 9m onerous contract charge related to two UKCare & Justice Services contracts, reflecting the estimated losses over their expected remaining terms.
Specific items charges incurred during the year ended 31 December 2017 of 34m included 19m primarily relating to the anticipated total losses over the next 15 to 20 years in respect of certain UK government contracts, 6m related to the estimated cost of settlement of subcontractor claims from commercial disputes in respect of prior years, and 9m related mainly to the settlement of labour disputes inrespect of prior years in the Americas.
44 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 Specific items - credits The specific items credits of 10m 2017: nil include a 5m release of onerous contract provisions in the UK for which the related charges had previously been created as specific items, following the implementation of operational efficiencies in the contracts leading to a reduction in expected future losses.
In addition, a further 5m related to successful court claims made by the Group in the Americas has been credited as a specific item.
Guaranteed minimum pension equalisation charge Following the UK High Court Ruling in the case of Lloyds Banking Group Pension Trustees Limited v Lloyds Bank plc and others in October 2018, the Group recorded a charge of 35m 2017: nil in respect of the equalisation of benefits for historical Guaranteed Minimum Pension obligations between males and females in the UK.
California class action settlement In January 2019, the Group agreed the settlement of a class action relating to claims for employee meal and rest breaks for the period 2001 to 2010 in California.
This settlement is subject to the final approval of the Superior Court of the State of California.
The amount to be settled is between US$100m and US$130m with the precise amount to be determined during the settlement administration process.
Aprovision of 100m has been established in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 representing managements best estimate of the amount of the class action settlement and any related costs.
Restructuring costs The Group invested 31m 2017: 20m in restructuring programmes during the year ended 31 December 2018, relating to the 2018- 2020 strategic productivity programme announced in 2017 which is being implemented across the Group, mainly in Europe & Middle East, the Americas and Cash Solutions.
In addition, the Group incurred non-strategic reorganisation costs of 9m 2017: 10m which are included within Adjusted PBITA.
We expect to invest around 20m in restructuring the Cash Solutions business in 2019 and estimate that the costs of the cash separation review and separation process will be between 25m and 50m.
Loss profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries businesses The Group recognised a net loss on disposal and closure of subsidiaries businesses of 15m 2017: profit of 74m relating to the disposal of a number of the Groups operations including its businesses in Hungary and the Philippines, its archiving business in Kenya and the Cash Solutions businesses in the United Arab Emirates, Colombia and Saudi Arabia.
Disposals in 2017 included the Groups businesses in Israel and Bulgaria and the Groups Youth Services business in North America.
Acquisition-related amortisation Acquisition-related amortisation of 4m 2017: 10m is lower than the prior year as certain intangible assets recognised on a number oflegacy acquisitions became fully amortised in 2017.
Operating profit Operating profit for the year of 253m 2017: 502m was down 49.6% reflecting the 6.5% reduction in Adjusted PBITA together with the additional charges in the current year in respect of the California class action settlement and the UK guaranteed minimum pension equalisation charge: the loss on disposals in the year of 15m 2017: profit on disposal of 74m and the other specific and separately disclosed items described above.
Net interest costs Net interest payable on net debt was 92m 2017: 92m.
Net other finance costs were 7m 2017: 12m and the pension interest charge, related to the unwinding of the discount in relation to long-term pension liabilities, was 11m 2017: 11m, resulting in a total net interest cost of 110m 2017: 115m.
Tax The statutory tax charge of 55m 2017: 128m for 2018 included a tax charge of 93m 2017: 89m on the Groups underlying profits, as explained on page 51, a tax credit on onerous contracts of nil 2017: 4m, a tax charge of 1m 2017: 10m in respect of disposed businesses, a tax credit of 7m 2017: 4m in respect of restructuring costs and a net tax credit of 32m 2017: tax charge of 37m, which included 19m in respect of the tax impact of the US tax reform in respect of specific and other separately disclosed items.
The Groups statutory tax charge represents an effective rate of 38% 2017: 33% on profit before tax of 143m 2017: 387m.
The effective tax rate is a function of a variety of factors, with the most significant being i the geographic mix of the Groups taxable profits and the respective country tax rates, ii changes in the value, and recognition of, deferred tax assets and liabilities, iii permanent differences such as expenses disallowable for tax purposes, iv irrecoverable withholding taxes, v the level of provision required for potential tax liabilities not agreed with tax authorities, vi the impact of one-off items including tax claims, and vii the overall level of profit against which the preceding items are measured.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 G4S plc 45 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED The higher effective tax rate compared with the prior year is primarily driven by i an increase in profits taxed at a higher rate, ii the relative amount of non-deductible expenses, iii the reassessment of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, and iv the relative amount of irrecoverable withholding taxes.
This is offset by the one-off tax impact in 2017 of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and changes in 2018 in the level of provision required for potential tax liabilities not agreed with tax authorities.
At any point in time, the Group is typically subject to tax audits in a number of different countries.
In situations where a difference of opinion arises between the Group and a local tax authority in respect of its tax filings, the Group will debate the contentious areas and, where necessary, resolve them through negotiation or litigation.
The Group relies upon advice and opinions from the Group tax department, local finance teams and external advisors, to ensure that the appropriate judgments are arrived at in establishing appropriate accounting provisions in relation to such disputes.
Non-controlling interests Profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 8m in 2018, a decrease from 16m recorded in 2017, reflecting the non-controlling partners share of profit of certain businesses in Europe & Middle East.
Profit for the year The Group reported profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent statutory earnings of 82m 2017: 237m which reflects the lower Adjusted PBITA together with the loss on disposal and closure of subsidiaries businesses in the current year compared with the profit recognised in the prior year, and the additional charges in the current year in respect of the California class action settlement and the UK Guaranteed Minimum Pension equalisation charge.
Earnings per share Statutory earnings per share decreased to 5.3p 2017: 15.3p, based on the weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,547m 2017: 1,548m shares in issue.

REVIEW OF THE GROUPS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION Significant movements in the consolidated statement of financial position Current loan notes reduced to 464m 2017: 655m, reflecting the net repayment of certain loan notes during the year, as explained on page 47.
In addition, non-current bank loans increased to 293m 2017: 5m following the draw-down of the new US$350m committed term loan facility in November 2018.
The following movements in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position are set out elsewhere in this report, as follows: cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts are explained on page 47: retirement benefit obligations are explained in note 31: provisions are analysed in note 32 on page 195: and net debt is analysed in note 36.
Total equity Total equity at 31 December 2018 was 783m 2017: 843m.
The main movements during the year were: profit for the year of 90m 2017: 253m, other comprehensive income of 44m 2017: losses of 47m which included a re-measurement gain on defined retirement benefit schemes of 38m 2017: 26m as explained on page 49, an exchange gain on translation of foreign operations of 45m 2017: loss of 125m reflecting more favourable movements in currencies in the major countries in which the Group operates against sterling, a loss from changes in the fair value of net investment hedging financial instruments of 42m 2017: gain of 56m, a gain from changes in the fair value of cash flow hedging financial instruments of 11m 2017: nil and dividends paid in the year of 170m 2017: 179m.
46 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 Review of the Groups cash flow and financing Consolidated statement of cash flow Net cash flow from operating activities before tax was 413m 2017: 488m.
Net cash inflow from operating activities was 315m 2017: 402m reflecting lower operating cash flow generation in the Americas and Europe & Middle East.
Net cash used in investing activities was 48m 2017: cash generated 81m, including 45m 2017: 156m of net business disposal proceeds.
Net cash outflow from financing activities was 209m 2017: 570m with the difference compared with the prior year being mainly proceeds from borrowings of 761m 2017: 437m.
Cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts at 31 December 2018 were 673m 2017: 571m, a net increase compared with 31 December 2017 including the impact of exchange rate movements of 102m 2017: 101m.
The Groups statutory cash flow is presented in full on page 148.
Net debt The Groups net debt as at 31 December 2018 was 1,558m December 2017: 1,487m.
The Groups net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.7x 2017: 2.4x reflecting both the increase in net debt and the reduction in Adjusted PBITA as described above.
A detailed reconciliation of movements in net debt is provided on page 54.
In light of the expected cash costs of the settlement of the California class action, the costs of the Cash business separation review, spend in respect of onerous contracts and restructuring costs expected in 2019, we expect the Groups net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio to remain broadly unchanged during 2019.
Notwithstanding this, the Groups business plan supports a reduction in the ratio to 2.5x or below over the medium term.
Net debt maturity In April 2018, the Groups credit rating was affirmed by Standard & Poors as BBB-: however the outlook was revised from negative to stable.
As at 31 December 2018 the Group had liquidity of 1,423m 2017: 1,571m comprising cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts of 673m 2017: 571m and unutilised but committed facilities of 750m 2017: 1,000m.
During the year, the Group arranged a US$350m term facility, maturing in August 2021, which was fully drawn, and also amended the available Revolving Credit Facility, reducing it to 750m while extending the maturity for a further one and a half years to August 2023.
Asat 31 December 2018 there were no drawings from this facility.
In May 2018 the Group issued a 550m Public Bond which matures in May 2025 and pays an annual coupon of 1.875%.
During the year the Group also repaid 44m of GBP private loan notes, US$224m of US private loan notes and 500m of public Eurobonds.
The debt maturities in 2019 comprise the US$145m US Private Placement notes repaid in March 2019 and the 350m Public Bond due in May 2019 which will be financed primarily by utilising a 300m bridge facility arranged in January 2019.
The recent refinancings have secured around 20m of annualised interest cost savings per annum by the end of 2019.
The Group has good access to capital markets and a diverse range of finance providers.
Borrowings are principally in pounds sterling, US dollars and euros, reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets and earnings.
For fair value carrying amount see note 30. b.
Translated at exchange rates prevailing at 31 December 2018, or hedged exchange rates where applicable.
c. The revolving credit facility matures in August 2023.
As at 31 December 2018 there were no drawings from this facility.
The Groups average cost of gross borrowings in 2018, net of interest hedging, was 3.9% 2017: 4.1%.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 G4S plc 47 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED Financing and treasury activities The Groups treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance and for managing the Groups financial risk arising from currency and interest rate volatility and counterparty credit.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and is not permitted to speculate in financial instruments.
The treasury departments policies are set by the board and the treasury function is subject to the controls appropriate to the risks it manages, which are discussed in note 30 on pages 183 to 187.
To assist the efficient management of the Groups interest costs, the Group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an A-rated bank.
The Group presents pooled cash and overdrafts gross in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Other information Significant exchange rates applicable to the Group The Group derives a significant portion of its revenue and profits in the following currencies.
Closing and averagerates for these currencies are shown below: As at Year to 31 As at Year to 31 31 December December 2018 31 December December 2017 2018 average rates 2017 average rates US$ 1.2746 1.3336 1.3524 1.2964 1.1130 1.1294 1.1250 1.1453 South Africa Rand 18.3288 17.5598 16.7557 17.3187 India Rupee 88.8104 90.9294 86.3531 84.3570 Brazil Real 4.9461 4.8621 4.4794 4.1506 Applying December 2018 closing rates to the Groups underlying results for the year to 31 December 2018 would result in an increase in underlying revenue of 1.9% to 7,427m for the year ended 31 December 2017: increase of 1.9% to 7,353m and an increase in underlying Adjusted PBITA of 2.1% to 484m for the year ended 31 December 2017: increase by 2.1% to 484m.
Applying December 2018 closing rates to the Groups statutory results for the year to 31 December 2018 would result in an increase in statutory revenue of 1.9% to 7,653m for the year ended 31 December 2017: decrease of 1.0% to 7,746m and an increase in statutory Adjusted PBITA of 2.2% to 470m for the year ended 31 December 2017: no change, at 492m.
The strenghening of the average Sterling exchange rates compared with the prior year led to a decrease in statutory revenue of 2.7% and a decrease in statutory Adjusted PBITA of 2.0%.
The impact of exchange rate movements reduced the Groups net debt by 32m compared with the prior year.
Dividend In assessing the dividend, the board considers: future investment requirements: the Groups pension obligations: net debt to Adjusted EBITDA: the availability of distributable reserves in the parent company: and reward to shareholders.
The directors propose a final dividend of 6.11p DKK 0.5321 per share 2017: 6.11p per share: DKK 0.5097 reflecting the boards confidence in the Groups performance and prospects.
Our dividend policy is to increase the dividend in line with the long-term growth in earnings.
The interim dividend was 3.59p DKK 0.2969 per share and the total dividend, if approved, will be 9.70p DKK 0.8290 per share, in line with 2017 for the year ended 31 December 2017, the interim dividend was 3.59p: DKK 0.2948 and the total dividend was 9.70p: DKK 0.8045.
The proposed dividend cover is 1.7x 2017: 1.8x on underlying earnings.
48 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 Pensions As at 31 December 2018 the net defined benefit pension obligation in the consolidated statement of financial position was 364m 2017: 381m of which 248m 2017: 283m related to material funded defined benefit schemes.
Net of related deferred tax balances, the Groups net pension obligation was 302m 2017: 318m.
The most significant of the Groups pension schemes is in the UK and accounts for over 86% 2017: 88% of the Groups total material scheme obligations.
The scheme has approximately 26,000 members and further details of the make-up of the scheme are given in note 31 on page 187.
2018 2017 m m Scheme assets 2,219 2,345 Obligations 2,432 2,595 Net UK obligations 213 250 The UK schemes pension liabilities decreased compared with the prior year reflecting the payment of scheduled deficit-repair contributions of 41m 2017: 40m during the year, together with the impact of applying a higher discount rate assumption of 2.85% 2017: 2.55% to the valuation of scheme obligations and adopting the latest mortality base-rate tables.
These decreases were offset by an increase inthe pension liabilities of 35m 2017: nil following the equalisation of historical guaranteed minimum pension obligations after a recent UK court ruling.
The net reduction in the pension liabilities was partially offset by a loss incurred on the revaluation of the pension schemeassets.
The triennial valuation of the UK scheme is underway, during which we expect to agree the future deficit-repair contributions.
Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps The Groups investments and borrowings at 31 December 2018 were a mix of fixed rates of interest and floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The March 2007 and July 2008 private placement notes and the May 2009, November 2016, June 2017 and May 2018 public notes were all issued at fixed rates, whilst the Groups investments and bank borrowings were all at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR andEURIBOR.
The Groups interest-risk policy requires Treasury to maintain a proportion of the Groups debt at fixed rates within the range 25% to 75%, using the natural mix of fixed and floating interest rates emanating from the bond and bank markets and by utilising interest rate and crosscurrency swaps.
Part of the proceeds of the private placement and public notes have been swapped to floating interest rates, and accounted for as fair value hedges, with a net loss in the hedges at 31 December 2018 of 6m 2017: 14m.
The market value of the pay-fixed receive-variable swaps and the pay-fixed receive-fixed cross-currency swaps outstanding at 31 December 2018, accounted for as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, was a net asset of 32m 2017: 73m.
Foreign currency hedging The Group has many overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, denominated in various different currencies.
Treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt Adjusted EBITDA ratio by holding foreigncurrency denominated loans, cross-currency swaps and to a lesser extent forward currency contracts.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 74% and 84% respectively, hedged by foreign currency debt.
As at 31 December 2018, net debt held in US dollars and Euros, and in those currencies officially pegged to these two currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.5x Adjusted EBITDA generated from these currencies 2017: 2.3x Adjusted EBITDA.
Tax policy The Groups tax policy is set out at g4s.
Corporate governance The Groups policies regarding risk management and corporate governance are set out in the Risk management section on pages 64 to 71 and in the Corporate governance report on page 96.

c. The 2017 results have been restated for the effect of adopting IFRS 15 see note 3 u.
Revenue The Groups revenue increased by 1.1% year-on-year.
Secure Solutions revenues were 3.1% higher than the prior year, as explained on page 44.
Cash Solutions revenue decreased by 9.3% reflecting the mobilisation of a large Retail Cash Solutions contract in North America in2017.
Adjusted PBITA Adjusted PBITA of 474m 2017: 474m was in line with the prior year.
This reflects Adjusted PBITA growth of 6.9% in Secure Solutions offset by lower revenue and increased business development and operating costs in Cash Solutions.
Interest Net interest payable on net debt was 91m 2017: 90m.
Net other finance costs were 7m 2017: 11m and the pension interest charge, related to the unwinding of the discount in relation to long-term pension liabilities, was 11m 2017: 11m, resulting in a total net interest cost of 109m 2017: 112m.
Tax A tax charge of 93m 2017: 87m was incurred on profit before tax of 365m 2017: 362m which represents an effective tax rate of 25% 2017: 24%.
The effective tax rate is a function of a variety of factors, with the most significant being i the geographic mix of the Groups taxable profits and the respective country tax rates, ii changes in the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities, iii permanent differences such as expenses disallowable for tax purposes, iv irrecoverable withholding taxes, v the level of provision required for potential tax liabilities not agreed with tax authorities and vi the impact of one-off items including tax claims.
Non-controlling interests Profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 13m in 2018, a decrease from 17m in 2017, reflecting the non-controlling partners share of profit of certain businesses in Europe & Middle East.
Earnings The Group generated profit attributable to equity holders earnings of 259m 2017: 258m for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 G4S plc 51 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED Earnings per share Earnings per share was in line with the prior year at 16.7p 2017: 16.7p, based on the weighted average of 1,547m 2017: 1,548m shares in issue.
A reconciliation of profit for the year to earnings per share is provided below: 2017 at 2017 at constant actual exchange exchange 2018 rates rates Underlying earnings per share m m m Underlying profit for the year 272 275 281 Non-controlling interests 13 17 18 Underlying profit attributable to equity holders of the parent earnings 259 258 263 a Average number of shares m 1,547 1,548 1,548 Underlying earnings per share 16.7p 16.7p 17.0p a.
Stated net the average number of shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust of 5m 2017: 4m.
Onerous contracts The Groups onerous contracts generated revenues of 118m 2017: 107m for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Adjusted PBITA from onerous contracts of 5 million for the year 2017: nil mainly represents the write down of the value of the assets and the recognition of an onerous contract provision that were both individually below the threshold set to be classified as specific items, in respect of two UK Care & Justice Services contracts.
During the year the Group recognised a net 4m additional onerous contract provision recorded as a specific item.
This includes a 9m charge related to two UK Care & Justice Services contracts, reflecting the estimated losses over the expected remaining contract terms.
In addition, a 5m credit has been booked as a specific item following the implementation of operational efficiencies in respect of certain onerous contracts that has led to a reduction in expected future losses.
It is expected that around 60% of the Groups total provision for onerous customer contracts of 51m will be utilised by the end of 2019.
In the year ended 31 December 2017 the Group recognised additional provisions of 19m, classified as specific items, primarily related to the anticipated total losses over the next 15-20 years in respect certain UK government contracts.
Disposed businesses Businesses disposed of during the year ended 31 December 2018, including the Groups businesses in Hungary and the Philippines, an archiving business in Kenya and the Cash Solutions businesses in the United Arab Emirates, Colombia and Saudi Arabia, generated revenue of 105m and Adjusted PBITA of 9 m in the year ended 31 December 2018 year ended 31 December 2017: revenue 174m and Adjusted PBITA 3m.
Businesses sold during the year ended 31 December 2017 included the Groups businesses in Israel and Bulgaria and its Youth Services business in North America, and in total generated revenue of 121m and Adjusted PBITA of 5m for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Restructuring The Group invested 31m 2017: 19m in restructuring programmes during the year ended 31 December 2018, relating to the 2018- 2020 strategic productivity programme announced in 2017 which is being implemented across the Group, mainly in Europe & Middle East, the Americas and Global Cash Solutions.
In addition, the Group incurred non-strategic severance costs of 9m 2017: 8m which are included within Adjusted PBITA.
We expect to invest around 20m in restructuring the Cash Solutions business in 2019 and estimate that the costs of the cash separation review and separation process will be between 25-50m.

Specific items charges incurred during the year ended 31 December 2017 of 18m primarily comprised 6m related to the estimated cost of settlement of subcontractor claims from commercial disputes in respect of prior years, and 9m related mainly to the settlement of labour disputes in respect of prior years in the Americas.
The specific items credit of 5m 2017: nil relate to successful court claims made by the Group in the Americas.
Guaranteed minimum pension equalisation charge Following the UK High Court Ruling in the case of Lloyds Banking Group Pension Trustees Limited v Lloyds Bank plc and others in October 2018, the Group recorded a charge of 35m 2017: nil in respect of the equalisation of benefits for historical guaranteed minimum pension obligations between males and females in the UK.
California class action settlement In January 2019 the Group agreed the settlement of a class action relating to claims for employee meal and rest breaks for the period 2001 to 2010 in California.
Net loss profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries businesses During the year, the Group recognised a net loss of 15m 2017: profit of 72m relating to the disposal of a number of its operations including its businesses in Hungary and the Philippines, its archiving business in Kenya and the Cash Solutions businesses in the United Arab Emirates, Colombia and Saudi Arabia.
Acquisition-related amortisation Acquisition-related amortisation of 4m 2017: 9m is lower than the prior year as certain intangible assets recognised on a number of legacy acquisitions became fully amortised in 2017.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 G4S plc 53 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED Tax credits charges arising on specific and other separately disclosed items Tax credits arising on specific and other separately disclosed items were 32m 2017: charges of 17m which related primarily to the disposal of subsidiaries in the Americas region.
The Group expects amounts owed to class members and their advisors under the proposed California class action settlement to be deductible for US Federal and State tax purposes when paid and, in reognition of this, adeferred tax asset has been established in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Tax impact of the introduction of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act US tax reform The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced significant changes in US tax laws with effect from 1 January 2018.
For 2017, the changes in legislation resulted in a separately disclosed one-off charge to the income statement of 19m arising from the re-measurement and impairment of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the US Federal tax rate, and from the impairment of foreign tax credits which are no longer expected to be recovered in future periods against foreign source income.
Reconciliation between statutory operating profit and net debt A reconciliation between operating profit as presented in the Groups consolidated income statement to movement in net debt is presented below with 2018 amounts presented at actual rates for the year and the prior year amounts presented at 2017 average exchangerates.

54 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2018 Movement in net debt during the year Cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring spend was 413m 2017: 488m after pension deficit-repair contributions of 41m 2017: 40m during the year.
Cash outflow from businesses disposed of or closed was 3m 2017: 3m inflow, and cash outflow from onerous contracts was 11m 2017: 12, both of which were excluded from underlying operating cash flow.
Underlying operating cash flow reduced to 453m 2017: 516m and represents 95.6% 2017: 106.6% of underlying Adjusted PBITA.
The reduction compared with the prior year primarily reflects a lower level of operating cash flow generation in the Americas region, which was impacted by the US Federal Government shutdown in the run-up to the year-end, and in Europe & Middle East where the phasing of cash flows in respect of a small number of major contracts reduced cash conversion in the year.
The Group invested 102m 2017: 104m in net capital expenditure and received net proceeds of 45m 2017: 156m from the disposal of businesses.
The Group made no significant acquisitions during the year.
Net cash inflow after investing in the business was 333m 2017: 525m.
The Groups net increase in net debt before foreign exchange movements was 39m 2017: decrease of 162m after net interest paid which increased to 99m 2017: 78m primarily reflecting the initial annual interest payment in respect of the EUR500m bond issued in June 2017, tax paid of 98m 2017: 86m and dividends paid of 170m 2017: 179m.
The Groups net debt as at 31 December 2018 was 1,558m December 2017: 1,487m.
