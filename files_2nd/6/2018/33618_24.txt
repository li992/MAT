While the LME average market price increased by 5.7% to $2.96 lb 800 751 2017 $2.80 lb, this was offset by a negative provisional pricing 16 700 adjustment of $188.0 million.
The provisional pricing adjustment mainly reflected the decrease in the period-end copper price to 600 51 544 $2.71 lb at 31 December 2018, compared with $3.25 lb at 111 31December 2017.
500 210 Realised copper prices are determined by comparing revenue 400 grossof treatment and refining charges for concentrate sales with 300 sales volumes in the period.
Realised copper prices differ from market 480 prices, mainly because, in line with industry practice, concentrate and 200 38 45 cathode sales agreements generally provide for provisional pricing at 100 the time of shipment with final pricing based on the average market price in future periods normally around one month after delivery to 0 the customer in the case of cathode sales and normally four months after delivery to the customer in the case of concentrate sales.
Further details of provisional pricing adjustments are given in Note 6 to the financial statements.

This reflected EBITDA from 1 subsidiaries for the year of $2,118.8 million 2017 $2,430.5 million adjusted for the negative impact of a net working capital increase of $240.3 million 2017 working capital decrease of $12.5 million and a non-cash decrease in provisions of $1.6 million 2017 increase of $52.0 million.
The working capital increase was mainly due to a one-off short-term VAT payment of $265 million made in December 2018, with the same amount then being reclaimed and refunded to the Group in January 2019.
This resulted in a temporary increase in receivables asat 31 December 2018, resulting in a negative cash flow impact for 2018.
There will be a corresponding decrease in receivables and a positive cash flow impact in 2019.
Accordingly, there is nil net cumulative impact in respect of this transaction over the period from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019.
