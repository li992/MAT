The improvement in the UK & Ireland was primarily a reflection of actions taken at SIG Distribution from the middle of the year, including price rises across a broad range of products, resulting in a 200bps year-on-year increase in gross margin to 24.7% 2017: 22.7%.
As a result, underlying gross profit increased by 5.0m to 716.7m 2017: 711.7m, despite the weaker revenue.
The Group is replicating elements of this approach taken in SIG Distribution in other operating companies, notably SIG Exteriors, France and Germany, and is targeting further gross margin improvement across the Group in 2019.

30 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2018 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT UK and Ireland As previously reported, the UK construction market weakened during 2018 and became increasingly challenging towards the end of the year.
Commercial construction demand remained dampened by macro-economic uncertainty, house price inflation slowed and secondary housing market transactions continued to fall.
This weaker trading environment impacted on demand for SIGs products and is a key factor behind the lower LFL revenues in the UK and Ireland, down 5.6%.
Revenues at SIG Distribution also reflected the focus on improving profitability, which has delivered higher gross margins at the expense of lower revenue.

SIG Distribution, the core insulation and interiors business in the UK, delivered a substantial increase in profitability in 2018.
Underlying operating profit increased to 20.9m 2017: 3.5m, as the business took radical actions to deliver an operational and financial turnaround under new leadership.
Underlying revenue fell by 5.8% on a LFL basis, but this was more than compensated by increased gross margins, up 200bps to 24.7% 2017: 22.7%, reflecting price rises and reduced exposure to low margin business.
The business also reduced costs and inventory during the second half of the year, delivering a significant step up in profitability from 4.6m in the first half to 16.3m.
SK Sales, a specialist distributor of air handling products, reported as part of SIG Distribution in 2018, is being combined into the panEuropean Air Handling business in 2019.
SK Sales generated an operating loss of c. 2.1m on revenue of c. 21.1m in 2018.
SIG Exteriors primarily comprises the Groups market-leading roofing merchant in the UK.
In addition, it includes SIG Building Solutions, a small manufacturer and distributor of faades and claddings.
SIG Exteriors saw LFL sales reduce by 6.6% in the year, with poor weather conditions impacting performance at the start of the year and ongoing trading challenges in end markets weakening demand throughout the year.
Improved pricing discipline introduced by the new leadership in the second half enabled gross margins to recover to 28.3% 2017: 28.4%.
Underlying operating profit at SIG Exteriors ended the year at 17.3m 2017: 30.1m, reflecting the revenue shortfalls, but also the benefit in 2017 of 5.3m of operating profit related to a one-off sale of property that were not repeated in 2018.
Ireland & Other UK, predominantly comprising specialist distribution of insulation, interiors and other building products in Ireland from a large Dublin hub, performed well under new leadership.
LFL revenue for the year was in line at 0.1%, but underlying operating profit increased to 6.1m 2017: 4.8m as a result of higher gross margins up 20bps to 25.2% 2017: 25.0% and operating cost discipline.
Overall, the UK & Ireland delivered underlying revenue of 1,179.8m 2017: 1,244.1m and underlying operating profit of 44.3m 2017: 38.4m, at a return on sales excluding property profits of 3.8% 2017: 2.6%.
com Stock code: SHI 31 Financial review Mainland Europe As anticipated at the time of the interim results, trading conditions in construction markets across mainland Europe slowed in the second half of the year, notably in France and Germany.
Revenues in Germany were also affected by ongoing actions to reduce the Groups exposure to low margin business.
In contrast, the Group currently continues to see robust demand and good top-line growth in Poland, Air Handling and Benelux.

The Groups business in France comprises Larivire, the leading specialist roofing merchant, LiTT, a specialist distributor of insulation and interiors and Ouest Isol & Ventil, a specialist provider, manufacturer and distributor of air handling and technical insulation products.
France saw a small decline in LFL sales in the year, down 0.9 % on weakening market conditions, which was compensated through improved pricing discipline and higher gross margins, resulting in underlying operating profit of 27.8m 2017: 26.2m.
New leadership in France from December 2018 is looking at ways to build on the strong profit contribution from LiTT and Larivire through initiatives around sales effectiveness, pricing management and working capital reduction, building on the developing success of transformation at other Group businesses.
Ouest Isol & Ventil, reported as part of France in 2018, is being combined into the pan-European Air Handling business in 2019.
Ouest Isol & Ventil generated an operating profit of c. 6.7m on revenue of c. 140.8m in 2018.
Following the success at SIG Distribution in improving prices and gross margin, Germany started to manage pricing and profitability more actively towards the end of the year.
LFL sales in Germany declined by 0.8%, but gross margins increased to 26.7% 2017: 26.4%, reflecting some initial benefit from price increases and the commencement of an initiative to reduce the exposure to low margin business.
As a result, Germany delivered underlying operating profit of 9.1m in the year 2017: 12.0m, net of a reduction in underlying operating profit related to one-off sales of properties to 1.6m 2017: 4,5m.
The arrival of new leadership in Germany from October should deliver further transformation of that business in 2019.
The Groups Polish business had a very strong year, with LFL sales up 8.5%, benefiting from economic stability, infrastructure investment and corresponding growth in construction end markets.
In this environment, the Polish management team maintained its gross margin at 20.1% 2017: 20.0% and managed its cost base effectively to deliver an underlying operating profit of 3.3m in 2018 2017: 1.0m.
Air Handling, the Groups specialist provider of air handling solutions, which is managed from The Netherlands and focused on the Benelux and Central Europe, saw LFL sales growth of 2.6% in 2018.
The air handling market continues to grow at a faster rate than the wider construction sector, due to strong demand drivers, including higher energy efficiency and air quality standards.
The specialist focus of this division enabled it to generate gross margins of 38.1% 2017: 38.4%.
Air Handling delivered underlying operating profit in 2018, of 14.8m 2017: 14.4m at a return on sales excluding property profits of 10.0%.
In 2019, the Air Handling business is being combined with Ouest Isol & Ventil in France and SK Sales in the UK to establish a pan-European specialist provider of air handling solutions.
This creates an integrated platform with potential for growth and significant profit enhancement.
The combined business delivered underlying operating profit of c. 19.4m on revenue of c. 310.1m in 2018 at a return on sales excluding property profits of c. 6.3%.
The Board is reviewing strategic options for this business.
LFL sales in the Benelux region increased by 5.7% in the year reflecting strong demand in its end markets.
Adverse product mix towards cheaper alternatives meant management was unable to capitalise effectively on this growth, resulting in a decline in gross margins to 23.7% 2017: 25.8% and underlying operating profit of 4.5m 2017: 6.3m.
Overall, mainland Europe delivered underlying revenue of 1,503.4m 2017: 1,472.3m and underlying operating profit of 56.9m 2017: 54.8m, at a return on sales excluding property profits of 3.8% 2017: 3.7%.

Strategy in action Portfolio management Selling VJ Technology and Roofspace As part of the 2017 strategic review, the Group identified businesses associated with 13% of 2016 Group statutory revenue which it considered should be improved or exited, reflecting a combination of small scale, limited strategic fit or poor financial performance.
The Group has sold a number of businesses during the year, including VJ Technology and Roofspace, following competitive disposal processes.
VJ Technology is a UK distributor of technical fixings, fasteners and consumables to the infrastructure, commercial and wider construction industry, and was part of SIG Distribution.
Roofspace was part of SIG Distribution and the last remaining offsite manufacturing business of the Group.
The Group has now exited from 11% of the 13% of 2016 statutory revenue.
A further 2% remains under review associated with potential exit candidates.

com Stock code: SHI 39 Financial review Assessment of viability In order to assess the resilience of the Group to threats to its viability posed by those risks in severe but plausible scenarios, this model was subjected to thorough multi-variant stress and sensitivity analysis together with an assessment of potential mitigating actions.
This multivariant stress and sensitivity analysis included scenarios arising from combinations of the following: Variant Link to principal risks and uncertainties Delivery of the change agenda SIGs recent track record highlights the challenge in delivering lasting change.
On this basis, the sensitivity analysis has been Market downturn modelled as if the improvements from the Groups strategic levers will not be achieved during the assessment period.
Working capital management The implications of both a challenging economic environment and a Market downturn growing market on the Groups revenues both pricing and volume impacts have been modelled by assuming a severe but plausible reduction in sales volume throughout the period.
The potential implications of macro-economic uncertainty due to Brexit have also been considered.
The impact of the competitive environment within which the Delivery of the change agenda Groups businesses operate and the interaction with the Groups Market downturn gross margin has been modelled by assuming a severe but plausible reduction in revenue and gross margins throughout the period.
The impact of a severe and prolonged economic downturn on the Market downturn Groups financial results was modelled using a scenario based on the 2008 2009 global financial crisis.
The resulting impact on key metrics was considered with particular focus on solvency measures including debt headroom and covenants such as leverage.
The impact of a severe prolonged downturn in the markets in which the Group operates would affect the carrying value of the Groups assets and have an impact on the consolidated net worth covenant.
The Group has controls in place to monitor these risks.
In the case of these scenarios arising, various mitigating actions are available to the Group, including further cost reduction programmes, a reduction in non-essential capital expenditure and a moderation of dividend payments.
After conducting their viability review, and taking into account the Groups current position and principal risks, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment to 31 December 2021.
Going concern basis In determining whether the Groups 2018 Annual Report and Accounts can be prepared on a going concern basis, the directors considered all factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position, including cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and the risks and uncertainties relating to its business activities.
These are set out in the Chairmans Statement and Strategic report on pages 46 to 47 and in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
The key factors considered by the directors were: The implications of the challenging economic environment and the continuing weak levels of market demand in the building and construction markets on the Groups revenues and profits, including macro-economic uncertainty due to Brexit: Projections of working capital requirements taking into account normal seasonality trends and short term working capital management: The impact of the competitive environment within which the Groups businesses operate: The availability and market prices of the goods that the Group sells: The credit risk associated with the Groups trade receivable balances: The potential actions that could be taken in the event that revenues are worse than expected, to ensure that operating profit and cash flows are protected: and The committed finance facilities available to the Group.
Having considered all the factors above impacting the Groups businesses, including downside sensitivities, the directors are satisfied that the Group will be able to operate within the terms and conditions of the Groups financing facilities, and have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups 2018 Annual Report and Accounts.
