STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW During the 2018 financial year Wizz Air carried 29.6 million passengers, a 24.7 per cent.
increase compared to the previous year.
Revenues grew to 1,948.0 million, representing a 24.0 per cent.
Wizz Air again successfully balanced the pace of capacity growth and profitability.
Capacity growth measured in terms of available seat kilometres ASK of 23.6 per cent.
and seats of 23.0 per cent while delivering an increase in net profit by 22.1 per cent to 275.1m.
Notwithstanding this fast growth rate we were able to achieve a slight increase in unit revenues measured in terms of ASKs rose by 0.4 per cent to 3.76 Euro cents and unit costs grew by 1.3 per cent.
This increase in CASK was principally driven by an increase in the average fuel price.
CASK excluding fuel expenses was increased by 0.4 per cent to 2.26 Euro cents in 2018 from 2.25 Euro cents in 2017.
Net profit margins declined to 14.1%, down from 14.3% in 2017.

The proforma underlying earnings per share EPS is a fully diluted measure defined by the Company.
Its calculation differs from the IFRS diluted EPS measure in the following: } for earnings the underlying profit for the year is used, as opposed to the statutory IFRS profit for the year: and } for the fully diluted number of shares the year-end position was taken rather than the weighted average for the year.
While these factors had relevance until March 2017 they did not have relevance in the current year: therefore, the proforma earnings per share measure is now equal to the diluted earnings per share.
The proforma earnings per share measure is being disclosed only because of its relevance in the prior year.
1 The Group discloses revenues and expenses for its airline and tour operator business units separately.
Where a measure is reported for a business unit as opposed to the Group as a whole then this fact is explicitly stated.
All other measures and statements relate to the Group as a whole.

Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2018 18 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Return on capital employed and capital structure ROCE is a non-statutory performance measure commonly used to measure the financial returns that a business achieves on the capital it uses.
ROCE for the 2018 financial year was 16.2 per cent.
a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the previous year driven by different levels of growth in earnings before interest and tax EBIT, shareholders equity, net cash position, and capitalised leases.
The Companys leverage fell to a ratio of 1.5 2017: 1.7 at the end of the 2018 financial year.
The year-on-year comparisons of ROCE and leverage benefited from the translation effect of the weaker US Dollar compared to last year as capitalised US dollar aircraft leases are translated into a lower Euro value.
Liquidity, defined as cash and equivalents as a percentage of the last twelve months revenue, rose from 49.3 per cent.
at the end of the 2017 financial year to 50.3 per cent.
2018 2017 Change ROCE 16.2% 17.6% 1.4 ppts Leverage 1.5 1.7 0.2 ppts Liquidity 50.3% 49.3% 1.0 ppts ROCE: operating profit after tax average capital employed, where average capital employed is the sum of average equity excluding convertible debt and capitalised operating lease obligations, less average cash and cash equivalents.
Leverage: Net debt adjusted to include capitalised operating lease obligations, divided by EBITDAR earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft rentals.
Capitalised lease obligations: annual aircraft lease expenses multiplied by seven as an estimate of the total outstanding obligation.
Financial performance Revenues and operating expenses are analysed by business segment, compared to the same measures for the 2017 financial year.
The remaining measures financial income and expenses, taxation, other comprehensive income and expense are analysed for the Group, as the share of the tour operator business unit is immaterial or nil in these measures.
Airline revenue The following table sets out an overview of Wizz Airs revenue items for 2018 and 2017 and the percentage change in those items: 2018 2017 Total Percentage of Total Percentage of Percentage million total revenue million total revenue change Passenger ticket revenue 1,132.2 58.4% 915.5 58.6% 23.7% Ancillary revenue 646.4 41.4% 24.8% 806.8 41.6% Total revenue 1,939.0 100%% 1,562.0 100% 24.1% The 2017 numbers have been restated what regards the split between passenger ticket revenue and ancillary revenue.
1 The guided modest RASK increase of 0.4 per cent.
coupled with the 24.7% higher passenger number were the main drivers for passenger ticket revenue increasing by 23.7% per cent.
At the same time ancillary or nonticket revenue continued to outperform ticket revenue growth and increased by 24.8 per cent.
Average revenue per passenger decreased from 65.7 in 2017 to 65.4 in 2018, a decrease of 0.4 per cent which continued to stimulate higher passenger volumes.
Average ticket revenue per passenger declined from 38.5 in 2017 to 38.2 0.8 per cent.
while average ancillary revenue per passenger was unchanged at 27.2.
The slight decrease in average revenue per passenger was due to: } a decrease in average passenger ticket revenue per passenger in 2018 compared to 2017, which was the result of the Companys high pace of capacity growth and proactively managing load factors 1.3 percentage points higher to 91.3%: and } the combined impact of the modification of certain products, the introduction of a free large cabin bag policy, fare lock, flexible travel partner, enhanced priority service, and the increased customer penetration of existing products such as allocated seating and different checked-in luggage sizes.
Airline operating expenses Total airline operating expenses increased by 25.2 per cent.
Airline CASK grew by 1.3 per cent.
CASK excluding fuel expenses increased to 2.26 Euro cents in 2018 from 2.25 Euro cents in 2017 driven by the combined effect of higher staff related costs and higher depreciation and amortization expenses offset by further improvement of major cost items such as aircraft leasing, airport, handling and en-route charges.

The increase in overall staff costs reflected a 19.7 per cent.
rise in aircraft block hours and a structural crew salary increase of 5 per cent.
Fuel expenses increased by 27.9 per cent.
This was mainly driven by an increase of 23.6 per cent.
growth in ASKs, a 10.4% increase in the average fuel price after hedging offset somewhat by a 4.1 per cent.
depreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro.
The average fuel price, including hedging impact and into-plane premium, paid by Wizz Air in 2018 was US$611 per ton, an increase of 10.4 per cent.
from the previous years figure of US$553 per ton.
The average euro US dollar rate in 2018, including hedging, was 1.15 compared to a rate of 1.10 in 2017.

to 33.1 million in 2018 from 27.0 million in 2017 which is broadly in line with FY 2018 seat capacity growth of 23.0 per cent.
Maintenance, materials and repair costs increased by 32.0 per cent.
This cost increase was the combined result higher total component support payment driven by the increased numbers of hours flown and the timing of certain maintenance events.
Aircraft rental costs increased 18.1 per cent.

This category comprised 273.9 million of airport and handling fees and 191.8 million of enroute and navigation charges in 2018 and 224.2 million of airport and handling fees and 165.8 million of enroute and navigation charges in 2017.
The cost increase was due to a 18.7 per cent.
increase in the number of flights, and a 24.7 per cent.
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by 57.6 per cent.
to 90.6 million in 2018, up from 57.5 million in 2017 due to higher engine-related maintenance and component depreciation as in the last twelve months new maintenance fixed assets were capitalized and their depreciation started in relation to a significant number of future engine heavy maintenance events.
Net other expenses increased by 24.4 per cent.
Other expenses include cancellation and delay related costs of 20.1 million, an increase of 64.8 per cent yearon-year.
Extensive fleet growth during the financial year and in the early part of the 2019 financial year led to higher training costs and longer training times for the newly joined crew strengthening the Companys work force.
Airline operating profit The Airline delivered an operating profit of 293.0 million in 2018, an 18.4 per cent.
increase compared to 2017 of 247.4 million.

Revenues in FY18 were 18.0 million compared to 18.1 million in 2017 and operating expenses were 19.0 million compared to 18.9 million in 2017.
Operating expenses in both years comprise primarily the value of the flight tickets and hotel accommodation purchased.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2018 20 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Financial performance continued Net financing income and expense The Groups net financing expense was 5.8 million in 2018 after a gain of 9.1 million in 2017.
This change was driven primarily by the change in the time value of hedges in 2017, with the net impact of all other items being less significant, as shown in the table below: million 2018 2017 Change Net FX-related impacts 3.6 2.6 6.2 Change in time value of hedges exceptional - 14.3 14.3 Fuel cap impacts including exceptional item in 2017 4.5 4.5 - All other financial income and expenses, net recurring 3.3 1.1 2.2 Net financing income and expense 5.8 9.1 14.9 See also Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements.
Net FX-related impacts consisted primarily of unrealised FX differences 3.8 million loss in 2018 and 1.9 million gain in 2017, driven mainly by significant movements in the USDEUR FX-rate 15.0 per cent.
strengthening of the EUR during 2018 and 6.1 per cent.
Changes in the time value of hedges, as accounted for under IAS 39, resulted in significant gains in 2017.
With the Companys adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 April 2017 subsequent changes in the time value hedges are no longer booked to earnings.
Fuel caps resulted in 4.5 million net loss in 2017, there were no fuel caps expiring in 2018.
Taxation The Group recorded an income tax expense of 11.0 million in 2018 compared to 9.8 million in 2017.
The effective tax rate for the Group in 2018 was 3.8 per cent, unchanged compared to 2017.
The main components of this charge are local business tax and innovation tax paid in Hungary, and corporate income tax paid in Switzerland.
Profit for the year The Group generated a profit for 2018 of 275.1 million, an 22.1 per cent.
increase from the underlying profit of 225.3 million in 2017.
Other comprehensive income and expenses In 2018 the Group had other comprehensive income of 10.0 million compared to 15.5 million in 2017.
This change was driven by the movements in the balance of the cash flow hedging reserve in equity.
Cash flows and financial position Summary statement of cash flows The following table sets out selected cash flow data and the Companys cash and cash equivalents for 2018 and 2017: million 2018 2017 Change Net cash generated by operating activities 416.9 310.9 106.0 Net cash used in investing activities 208.9 179.7 29.2 Net cash used in financing activities 2.3 1.8 0.5 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 0.1 1.0 0.9 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 774.0 205.6 979.6 Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2018 21 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Cash flows and financial position continued Cash flow from operating activities The majority of Wizz Airs cash inflows from operating activities are derived from passenger ticket sales.
Net cash flows from operating activities are also affected by movements in working capital items.
Operating cash flows improved from 310.9 million in 2017 to 416.9 million in 2018 primarily due to the following factors: } Profit before tax and depreciation: Profit before tax in 2018 was 30.3 million higher than in 2017.
Depreciation and amortisation expenses were 33.1 million higher in 2018 than in 2017.
In 2017 there were also significant non-cash financial income items primarily relating to the time value of hedges.
These differences explain most of the 78.0 million increase in operating cash flows year on year before adjusting for changes in working capital. }
Changes in working capital: The movements in working capital items increased 2018 operating cash flows by 44.0 million.
The continued strength of the Companys balance sheet meant that less cash collateral on letters of credits were required.
Cash collateral balances increased by 10.6 million in 2018 compared to an increase of 52.4 million in 2017.
Cash flow from investing activities Net cash used in investing activities increased by 29.2 million from a net cash outflow of 179.7 million in 2017 to a net cash outflow of 208.9 million in 2018.
The two main drivers of investment in 2018 were: } Advances paid for aircraft pre delivery payments, PDP : The net PDP flows payments paid to Airbus less refunds received were 124.9 million in 2018, requiring 60.9 million more net cash investment than in 2017. }
Purchase of maintenance assets amounting to 84.1 million in 2018, consisting of maintenance related activities as well as advance payments made in relation to engine heavy maintenance scheduled to be performed in the future.
Cash flow from financing activities Net cash used in financing activities increased by 0.5 million resulting in a 2.3 million outflow in 2018 from a 1.8 million outflow in 2017.
Summary statement of balance sheet The following table sets out summary statements of financial position of the Group for 2018 and 2017: million 2018 2017 Change ASSETS Property, plant and equipment 684.5 505.7 178.8 Restricted cash 162.1 155.8 6.3 34.1 Derivative financial instruments 10.1 24.0 Trade and other receivables 239.0 208.7 30.3 Cash and cash equivalents 979.6 774.0 205.6 Other assets 42.7 42.1 0.6 Total assets 2,142.1 1,696.3 445.8 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Equity Equity 1,241.9 952.5 289.4 Liabilities Trade and other payables 254.7 197.7 57.0 Convertible debt and other borrowings 32.2 33.0 0.8 Deferred income 437.4 388.8 48.6 Derivative financial instruments 13.7 1.8 11.9 Provisions 153.0 113.7 39.3 Other liabilities 9.2 8.9 0.3 Total liabilities 900.2 743.8 156.3 Total equity and liabilities 2,142.1 1,696.3 445.8 Including both current and non-current asset and liability balances, respectively.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2018 22 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Summary statement of balance sheet continued Property, plant and equipment increased by 178.8 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017 see Note 13 to the financial statements.
This was driven by investments in the two most important fixed asset categories, as follows: i the gross book value of aircraft maintenance assets including advances paid for these assets increased by 124.2 million, mainly due to more engines being out of condition under the respective lease contract at the end of 2018 than a year before: ii PDPs increased by 125.0 million due to the growing number of future aircraft deliveries and their respective payments as well as the relatively higher PDP of the A321ceo compared to the A320ceo.
Restricted cash current and non-current increased by 6.3 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017.
Derivative financial assets current and non-current increased by 24.0 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017 see also Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
The asset in 2018 relates primarily to mark-to-market gains on open fuel hedges arising from the increase of the jet fuel prices since the inception of the hedges.
Trade and other receivables current and non-current increased by 30.3 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017, which is broadly consistent with the rate of increase of the business see also Note 18 to the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by 205.6 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017.
This change is explained in detail in the cash flow analysis above.
Trade and other payables increased by 57.0 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017.
This rate of increase is broadly consistent with rate of increase for the Groups business during the year.
Deferred income current and non-current increased by 48.6 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017 see Note 26 to the financial statements.
This was driven by the increase in unflown revenues 44.4 million or 17%, primarily due to the increase in offered seat capacity, somewhat reduced by the Eastereffect i. e. Easter falling to mid-April in 2017 but to end of March in 2018.
Derivative financial liabilities current and non-current increased by 11.9 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017 see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
The liability in 2018 relates to losses on open US dollar hedge positions arising from a weaker US$ compared to the Euro since inception of the hedges.
Provisions current and non-current increased by 39.3 million as at 31 March 2018 compared to 31 March 2017 see Note 29 to the financial statements.
The increase relates primarily to new provisions made for future heavy maintenance events, particularly engine LLP replacements.
