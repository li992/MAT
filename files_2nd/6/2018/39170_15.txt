Strategic report CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW GOOD REVENUE VISIBILITY AND A STRONG BALANCE SHEET Overview of full year results We delivered a strong financial performance in FY18, building on the strategic progress we have made over the past two years.
The performance is all the more encouraging given the well flagged headwinds we face in the UK on single-sourced work.
While we are making good progress, we continue to maintain our financial discipline and a rigorous focus on cost control and cash generation.
Consequently, we enter FY19 well positioned with good revenue visibility and a strong balance sheet, which provides the resources to continue to invest in our organic capabilities and take advantage of attractive bolt-on acquisitions where there is a strong strategic fit.
Revenue was up 6% at 833.0m 2017: 783.1m, including a strong contribution from the QinetiQ Target Systems QTS and RubiKon businesses which were acquired in FY17.
Revenue grew by 3% on an organic basis, with a 4% increase in EMEA Services more than offsetting a 4% decline in Global Products, reflecting its lumpy revenue profile.
David Smith Orders in the year excluding LTPA amendments totalled 587.2m 2017: 675.3m Chief Financial Officer and grew 15% excluding the 109m 11-year NCSISS contract and 55m Strategic Enterprise contracts awarded in the prior year.
This increase was driven by a strong performance in Global Products and the contribution of the QTS and RubiKon Financial highlights Revenue up 6%, 3% on an businesses acquired in FY17 offsetting a small decline in EMEA Services.
Key orders organic basis won in FY18 included US maritime systems contracts totalling more than US$50m Underlying operating profit up 5%, and 25m for a spacecraft docking mechanism with the European Space Agency.

At the beginning of the new financial year, 69% of the Groups FY19 revenue was under contract, compared to 74% at the same point last year.
The change is a reflection of lower value, shorter dated orders during FY18, an increasing international mix within the business, which is typically shorter dated, and an overall increase in expected revenues.
The FY19 revenue cover includes the work to be performed under the interim LTPA arrangement with the MOD for the 12 months beginning 1 April 2018.

Excluding these non-recurring trading items, the QTS and RubiKon acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange, underlying operating profit for the Group was broadly flat.
This included a 3.4m reduction in EMEA Services driven by the lower baseline profit rate for single source contracts, in line with our expectations.
Global Products underlying operating profit grew by 19% 6% on an organic basis driven by improved profitability in OptaSense and high margins in the Statutory Underlying QTS business.

Strategic report | Chief Financial Officers review QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 37 Strategic report CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED Tax The total tax charge was 6.7m 2017: 8.2m.
The underlying tax charge was 13.1m 2017: 12.3m with an underlying effective tax rate of 10.7% 2017: 10.6%.
The effective tax rate continues to be below the UK statutory rate, primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development expenditure credits RDEC in the UK.
We enter FY19 well The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any tax legislation changes, the geographic mix of profits, positioned and with the future recognition of unrecognised tax losses and the assumption that the benefit the resources to of net R&D expenditure credits retained by the Group remains in the tax line.
Future recognition of unrecognised tax losses will also affect future tax charges.
Deferred tax assets of 7.6m have been recognised in the period 2017: 3.7m, with the income statement credit classified as a specific adjusting item.
These assets are in respect of US net operating losses and the recognition of tax deductible intellectual property assets in the UK, whereas the prior year related to an element of the Groups UK non-trade loan relationship deficits.
Together with a 1.2m tax effect of the pre-tax specific adjusting items, the total specific adjusting items tax credit was 6.4m 2017: 4.1m.
At 31 March 2018, the Group had unused tax losses and surplus interest costs of 118.0m 2017: 141.7m which are available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of 17.0m of US net operating losses 2017: nil and 7.7m 2017: 20.2m of UK losses.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of the remaining 93.3m of losses interest costs due to uncertainty over the timing of their utilisation.
The current tax liability was 8.9m as at 31 March 2018 2017: 43.7m.
The decrease in the liability is primarily due to the settlement of a tax liability in the US related to an unfavourable court decision in respect of the tax treatment of the Groups acquisition of Dominion Technology Resources, Inc. in 2008.
The tax settlement was funded through a recovery under an insurance policy the receivable for which had previously been included within trade and other receivables.
Cash flow, working capital and net cash 31 March 2018 31 March 2017 Net cash flow from operations 126.5m 111.9m Cash conversion pre-capex 103% 96% Free cash flow 56.3m 76.4m Net cash note 24 266.8m 221.9m Underlying net cash flow from operations was 126.5m 2017: 111.9m.
This included a 14.2m working capital unwind, of which 6.8m was due to non-recurring trading items, and 12.4m of pension deficit repair contributions, which are expected to fall to c. 2.5m from FY19 onwards.
This resulted in a cash conversion of 103% 2017: 96%.
Net cash flow associated with capex increased to 54.5m 2017: 32.9m with an additional non-cash 25.9m capex creditor, which will be settled in the first half of 2019.
After paying tax and net interest of 15.7m the Group generated free cash flow of 56.3m 2017: 76.4m.
The increase was primarily due to the 56.3m free cash flow and 23.1m cash inflow from property disposals offsetting 34.5m of dividends.
Total committed facilities available to the Group at year end, consisting of a revolving credit facility which is currently undrawn, amounted to 237.3m 2017: 245.7m, the decrease being solely due to foreign exchange movements the facility containing a USD denominated component.

As at year end the Scheme is hedged against approximately 85% of the interest rate risk and 100% of the inflation rate risk, as measured on the Trustees gilt-funded basis.
Full details are set out in note 30, on page 125.
The adoption of accounting standard IFRS 15 for our FY19 financial year is not expected to have a significant impact on QinetiQs reported financial performance, given the nature of our contracts and the existing method of accounting using percentage of completion accounting for service contracts as opposed to milestone accounting.
The Group completed an assessment on FY18 revenue with the conclusion that the impact would not be material if the new standard was adopted for FY18.
David Smith Chief Financial Officer, 24 May 2018 Strategic report | Chief Financial Officers review QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 39 Test and evaluation enabling our customers to enhance their capabilities As part of our crucial role in the Eurofighter Typhoon enhancement programme, we demonstrated the nature of our critical work to support UK defence capability.
Working in partnership with the MOD and MBDA, and using our facilities at MOD Aberporth, we provided the capability assurance required to ensure that the Brimstone 2 missile system can be effectively integrated onto Typhoon.
In our role as independent technical evaluator we helped expand the overall capabilities of the Typhoon aircraft, allowing for the timely retirement of Tornado Employees from across multiple QinetiQ sites worked together to ensure that safe and effective Typhoon capability will be delivered to the Front Line on time and on budget.
Our work throughout the life of the project included Integrated Test Evaluation and Acceptance planning, the collection of valuable test evidence from trials, the independent technical evaluation of industry safety artefacts and support to the RAFs operational evaluation trials.
These tests are critical to ensure the Typhoon remains at the cutting edge of combat capability.
