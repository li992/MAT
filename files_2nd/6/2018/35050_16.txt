OverviewIFC Strategic report05 Governance72 Financial statements124 Additional information180 Financial review The commentary in the Chief Financial Officers review and this Finance review includes discussion of reported and alternative performance measures.
Management uses alternative performance measures as a meaningful supplement to reported measures.
These measures are disclosed in accordance with the European Securities and Markets Authority guidelines and are explained and reconciled to the most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS on pages 66 to 71.
Further detail on the Groups financial performance, measured in accordance with IFRS, is set out in the Financial Statements and Notes thereto on pages 133 to 171.
In addition, the discussion below and in the Chief Financial Officers review includes commentary on revenue on a constant currency basis and on an organic basis.
Constant currency removes the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates.
Organic removes the effect of fluctuations in exchange rate and the impact of acquisitions and disposals.
Both measures enable the Group to focus on the underlying revenue performance.
Constant currency information is calculated by applying the applicable prior period average exchange rates to the Groups revenue performance in the respective period.
Revenue growth on an organic basis is a non-IFRS financial measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of IFRS reported revenue.
Results of operations The following table summarises the Groups performance for each of the last two years on a reported and adjusted basis.
Th ese non-IFRS financial measures are explained and reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with IFRS on pages 66 to 71.
Revenue On a reported basis revenue increased by 3.8% to $1,832.1 million 2017: $1,764.6 million.
On a constant exchange basis revenue increased by 2.7% and 0.2% on an organic basis.
Reported revenue included a year-on-year increase of $43.5 million in the contribution from the acquisitions of Woodbury and J&R Medical, net of Symbius, and benefitted from $20.5 million favourable foreign exchange movements in 2018.
Revenue by franchise The following table summarises the Groups revenue by franchise for 2018 and 2017 and the percentage change on a reported, constant exchange rate and organic basis.
Organic growth was only 0.2% in 2018 with the remaining growth coming from favourable exchange rate movements.
The performance of the AWC franchise is discussed in detail in the Operational review on page 48.
Ostomy Care Revenue of $533.3 million grew 0.8% against the prior year on a reported basis but on an organic basis revenue declined by 0.5%, with the difference between reported and organic movements being entirely due to foreign exchange rate movements.
Our 2018 revenue performance was impacted, as expected, by the supply chain constraints that occurred in the second half of 2017 and underlying weakness in the US retail channel.
A full discussion of the performance of the Ostomy Care franchise is presented in the Operational review on page 50.
CCC On a reported basis revenue of $443.0 million grew 15.7%.
This includes a combined increase in revenue contribution of $43.5 million from the acquisitions of Woodbury Holdings acquired on 1 September 2017 and J&R Medical acquired on 1 March 2018, net of Symbius.
Revenue grew 4.1% on an organic basis, principally driven by HDG.
The revenue performance for the CCC franchise is further explained in the Operational review on page 52.
Infusion Devices Revenue of $268.3 million declined 2.4% on a reported basis and 3.5% on an organic basis.
Whilst underlying performance in 2018 was good, an unexpected change to the ordering patterns of our largest customer late in the year had a material negative impact on revenue growth.
A more detailed analysis of the revenue performance for Infusion Devices can be found in the Operational review on page 54.
Cost of goods sold and gross profit Reported Reported cost of goods sold increased 2.4% or $20.0 million to $858.3 million 2017: $838.3 million.
Performance benefits from our efficiency programmes have been more than offset by headwinds and cost increases.
These include negative product mix effects, inflation, higher depreciation and higher costs related to our recovery from the supply constraints of the last quarter of 2017, including increased freight as we fulfilled back orders, coupled with costs related to the CCC recalls and some additional inventory write-downs.
These increases were offset by favourable foreign exchange.
On a reported basis, gross profit increased by $47.5 million, 5.1%, and gross profit margin improved to 53.2% 2017: 52.5% due primarily to lower restructuring costs in relation to our pre-IPO MIP programme.
Adjusted Adjusted cost of goods sold of $729.9 million in 2018 increased 6.0% or $41.6 million compared to 2017, driven by headwinds and cost increases outlined above offset by favourable foreign exchange.
This led to adjusted gross margin for 2018 of 60.2%, compared with 61.0% for the prior year.
Overall, there was a net negative impact on adjusted gross margin of 100 bps of headwinds and cost increases, offset by a 20 bps foreign exchange benefit.
Operating costs and expenses The following is a summary of operating costs and expenses for 2018 and 2017 and the percentage of each category compared with total revenue in the respective period.
Reported Reported Adjusted Adjusted 2018 2017 2018 2017 $m $m $m $m Selling & distribution 418.0 377.5 415.3 377.2 % revenue 22.8% 21.4% 22.7% 21.4% General & administration 238.2 259.8 208.3 202.0 % revenue 13.0% 14.7% 11.4% 11.4% Research & development 49.9 41.2 49.2 40.3 % revenue 2.7% 2.3% 2.7% 2.3% Total operating costs 706.1 678.5 672.8 619.5 % revenue 38.5% 38.5% 36.7% 35.1% These non-IFRS financial measures are explained and reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with IFRS on pages 66 to 71.
60 ConvaTec Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 OverviewIFC Strategic report05 Governance72 Financial statements124 Additional information180 Reported Selling & distribution On a reported basis, selling & distribution expenses increased by $40.5 million to $418.0 million 2017: $377.5 million.
This increase was driven by continued investments in our commercial infrastructure to drive revenue growth in EMEA, the Americas and China as well as the inclusion of the cost base of Woodbury and J&R Medical.
We also increased freight spend as we both increased volume and fulfilled back orders.
General & administration On a reported basis, general & administrative expenses reduced by $21.6 million to $238.2 million 2017: $259.8 million principally reflecting the fall in the pre-IPO share-based payment charge $23.1 million partially offset by an increase in the cost base reflecting the inclusion of the Woodbury and J&R Medical acquisitions.
R&D R&D costs increased by $8.7 million to $49.9 million 2017: $41.2 million.
R&D expenses increased to support new product development, in particular the development of our next generation ostomy products, and project write-offs as part of our more focused approach to products, segments and markets.
Adjusted Selling & distribution Adjusted selling & distribution expenses increased $38.1 million or 10.1% in 2018 to $415.3 million.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted selling & distribution expenses were 22.7% and 21.4% for the years 2018 and 2017 respectively due to increased commercial investment and higher freight costs, as outlined above.
General & administration Adjusted general & administration expenses which exclude the pre-IPO share-based payment charges increased $6.3 million, or 3.1%, in 2018 to $208.3 million.
The increase in adjusted costs reflects the inclusion of the cost base of Woodbury and J&R Medical.
Excluding these costs, general & administrative expenses declined as IT and strategic project investments to support growth and productivity were more than offset by tight cost control across the Group and a reduction in employee bonuses.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted general & administration expenses were flat year-on-year at 11.4%.
R&D On an adjusted basis, R&D expenses increased $8.9 million, or 22.1%, in 2018 to $49.2 million.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted R&D expenses were 2.7% and 2.3% for the years 2018 and 2017 respectively.
Operating profit Reported On a reported basis, operating profit was $267.7 million, an increase of $19.9 million 2017: $247.8 million reflecting the increase in gross margin being partially offset by an increase in the Groups operating cost base.
The comparator in 2017 included restructuring costs in relation to the Groups MIP programme and pre-IPO share-based payment charges.
Reported operating profit in 2018 includes only $2.5 million in respect of costs in relation to the Groups MIP programme no further costs for this programme have been incurred since June 2018.
Adjusted Adjusted operating profit was $429.4 million, a reduction of $27.4 million 2017: $456.8 million.
This reflects the very small increase in revenue offset by the headwinds in gross margin previously discussed and an increase in the operating cost base.
Finance and other expenses The table below presents a summary of finance and other expenses, net on a reported and adjusted basis.
Reported Reported Adjusted Adjusted 2018 2017 2018 2017 $m $m $m $m Finance costs 65.2 62.1 65.2 62.1 Other expenses, net 1.3 21.7 3.2 24.3 Total 66.5 83.8 68.4 86.4 These non-IFRS financial measures are explained and reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with IFRS on pages 66 to 71.
61 ConvaTec Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial review continued Finance costs Finance costs consist of interest costs on bank and other finance debt, non-utilisation of finance facility fees and the interest cost on derivative financial instruments.
Reported Finance costs increased $3.1 million to $65.2 million in 2018 from $62.1 million in 2017.
This reflects an increase of 40 bps to 3.5% 2017: 3.1% in the weighted average borrowing cost for the year offset by the benefit of the interest rate swap and lower borrowings resulting from both scheduled and voluntary loan repayments.
Other expenses, net Other expenses, net primarily consists of net gains and losses resulting from: The remeasurement or settlement of transactions that are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of a transacting subsidiary: and Gains and losses on disposal of assets.
Reported Other expenses, net on a reported basis, decreased $20.4 million to $1.3 million in 2018 primarily due to a reduction in foreign exchange losses related to intercompany transactions, reflecting our improving management of such balances.
Offsetting the foreign exchange loss in 2018 is a net gain of $1.9 million which represents the profit on the sale of equipment at our Greensboro site and the loss on disposal of Symbius.
Adjusted On an adjusted basis, other expenses, net of $3.2 million 2017: $24.3 million, principally represent foreign exchange losses.
Taxation Reported Reported Adjusted Adjusted 2018 2017 2018 2017 $m $m $m $m Profit before taxation 201.2 164.0 361.0 370.4 Income tax benefit expense 20.4 5.6 56.5 54.4 Effective tax rate 10.1 % 3.4% 15.7% 14.7% Reconciliation of reported income tax benefit expense to adjusted tax charge 2018 2017 $m $m Reported income tax benefit expense 20.4 5.6 1 Tax effect of adjustments 11.2 12.2 2 Other discrete tax items 65.7 36.6 Adjusted income tax expense 56.5 54.4 1.
The tax effects of the adjustments relating to non-IFRS financial measures are explained and reconciled on pages 66 to 71.
Other discrete items in 2018 include income tax benefits of $30.4 million and $35.0 million respectively arising from the reassessment of deferred tax liabilities in respect of unremitted earnings and recognition of additional deferred tax assets resulting from the US tax reform respectively.
In 2017, other discrete items includes the tax effect of the benefits arising from US tax reform.
Refer to Note 10 of the Financial Statements for further information.
For the year ended 31 December 2018, on a reported basis the Group recorded an income tax benefit of $20.4 million 2017: expense of $5.6 million and an adjusted tax expense of $56.5 million 2017: $54.4 million on adjusted profits.
Further details on reported income tax are contained in Note 10 of the Financial Statements.
Reported income tax benefit expense The reported income tax benefit for 2018 of $20.4 million 2017: expense of $5.6 million is based on tax rates applicable in various jurisdictions across the world in which the Group operates.
The lower tax rates in Switzerland drive the overall tax expense down, partially offset by higher tax rates in other jurisdictions e. g. Denmark.
The reported income tax benefit for 2018 is also impacted by permanent disallowances and temporary adjustments, such as tax depreciation versus IFRS accounting depreciation.
The reported income tax also includes other discrete tax items that are not a direct result of the profits for the year.
In 2018 there were two discrete tax items totalling $65.7 million.
These were principally previously unrecognised deferred tax assets of $35.0 million in the US following the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22 December 2017, and released deferred tax liabilities of $30.4 million on unremitted earnings.
Excluding these two discrete tax items noted above, the reported income tax would be an expense of $45.3 million.
In 2017 there were also two significant discrete tax items, totalling $34.9 million, included within the reported tax expense of $5.6 million.
These were $25.0 million benefit from US Tax Reform and the recognition of a deferred tax asset of $9.9 million in respect of the Woodbury group acquisition.
Excluding other discrete tax items, the reported income tax would be an expense of $42.2 million.
The difference between the income tax benefit of $20.4 million in 2018 compared to the income tax expense of $5.6 million in 2017 is therefore mainly attributable to these other discrete tax items.
62 ConvaTec Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 OverviewIFC Strategic report05 Governance72 Financial statements124 Additional information180 Adjusted income tax expense The adjusted income tax expense for 2018 of $56.5 million 2017: $54.4 million excludes the discrete tax items noted above which total $65.7 million 2017: $36.6 million and a further annual tax credit of $11.2 million 2017: $12.2 million arising from deferred tax liabilities in relation to the amortisation of pre-2018 acquisition intangibles and restructuring costs.
All of these adjusted items generated a non-cash benefit to the Group.
Net profit Reported Reported net profit for 2018 was $221.6 million 2017: $158.4 million, an increase of $63.2 million, reflecting an increase of $37.2 million in reported profit before tax and the impact on the reported tax expense for the year of significant deferred tax asset and liability credits.
Adjusted Adjusted net profit decreased $11.5 million to $304.5 million in 2018.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted net profit was 16.6% and 17.9% for the years 2018 and 2017 respectively.
The decrease reflects the increase in revenue offset by the headwinds in gross margin and increase in operating costs described above.
Foreign exchange The table below summarises the exchange rates used for the translation of currencies that have the most significant impact on the Group results into USD: Average rate Currency Closing rate 2018 2017 EUR USD Average 1.18 1.13 Closing 1.15 1.20 GBP USD Average 1.34 1.29 Closing 1.28 1.35 DKK USD Average 0.16 0.15 Closing 0.15 0.16 Financial position The following table presents a summary of the Groups financial position at 31 December 2018 and 2017.
This reflects decreases arising from both the in-year amortisation of intangible assets of $152.6 million and the net effect of foreign exchange of $57.6 million, partially offset by increases relating to the acquisition of intangible assets and goodwill in relation to J&R Medical of $14.9 million and other additions of $13.4 million, including investment in data warehousing, as part of our financial and management reporting improvement plan, and continued roll out of our SAP platform.
Other non-current assets Other non-current assets, including property, plant and equipment, deferred tax assets, restricted cash, pension and other assets increased by $13.4 million to $379.7 million 2017: $366.3 million.
An increase in the deferred tax assets balance of $13.3 million to $22.9 million, together with an increase in the value of the interest rate swap of $3.9 million, are offset by a small reduction in the value of property, plant and equipment of $3.3 million due to depreciation being higher than our ongoing investment in our manufacturing lines.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2018 was $315.6 million 2017: $289.3 million.
The improvement of $26.3 million reflects good cash conversion, offset by the principal cash outgoings of tax payments of $35.8 million 2017: $46.9 million, $14.4 million investment in the J&R Medical acquisition, dividend payment of $74.9 million and $153.7 million of borrowing repayments, including the voluntary debt repayment on our Euro term loan.
63 ConvaTec Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial review continued Current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents Other current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.8 million to $587.6 million 2017: $585.8 million.
Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, the underlying increase was $28.8 million.
The key component of this movement is an increase in inventory of $18.8 million which represents an underlying increase of $32.7 million offset by foreign exchange movements of $13.9 million.
The increase in inventory held reflects changes in working capital policy by a key supplier in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a return to normal inventory levels following the back orders at the end of 2017.
During the year inventory write-offs increased to $22.8 million 2017: $11.8 million, principally reflecting inventory associated with the packaging recall in September 2018 and a review of inventory following the transition of manufacturing to Haina in 2017.
Current liabilities Current liabilities reduced by $7.6 million to $330.9 million 2017: $338.5 million.
A reduction in current borrowings of $15.2 million is offset by a net increase of $7.6 million across other current liabilities.
The decrease in current borrowings is discussed in the Chief Financial Officers review and disclosed further in Note 20 in the Financial Statements.
The decrease in other current liabilities and accruals is principally driven by foreign exchange movements of $8.5 million.
Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities have reduced by $226.3 million to $1,712.3 million 2017: $1,938.6 million.
This principally reflects a reduction in non-current borrowings of $163.2 million and a net reduction of $65.1 million in deferred tax liabilities.
The movement in non-current borrowings is discussed in the Chief Financial Officers review and disclosed further in Note 20 in the Financial Statements.
The reduction of $65.1 million in the net deferred tax liabilities is principally in respect of $35.0 million of tax losses now recognised following the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 22 December 2017 and the release of a $30.4 million deferred tax liability in respect of unremitted earnings.
The $35.0 million movement has been accounted for as a reduction in deferred tax liabilities which are in respect of indefinite life liabilities, rather than as an increase in deferred tax assets, as we offset deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities that relate to the same tax authority.
Equity Total equity has increased by $93.4 million to $1,617.2 million 2017: $1,523.8 million.
As disclosed on page 136, this is primarily a result of the net profit for the year of $221.6 million and $11.2 million shares issued under share-based payment awards, offset by dividends paid of $74.9 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of $66.6 million arising from the retranslation of Euro, GBP and DKK balances into USD.
Liquidity and capital resources Overview At 31 December 2018, the Groups cash and cash equivalents were $315.6 million 2017: $289.3 million.
Additionally, at 31 December 2018, the Group had $193.8 million 2017: $192.9 million of availability under the revolving credit facility.
Restricted cash was $4.4 million 2017: $5.7 million.
The Groups primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations.
Historically, the non-elective nature of the Groups product offerings has resulted in recurring cash inflows.
In 2018, the Group generated $352.0 million of cash from operating activities.
Significant cash uses in 2018 included i $14.4 million paid in connection with the J&R Medical acquisition net of cash acquired, ii property, plant and equipment expenditure of $70.9 million, iii interest payments of $61.3 million, iv income tax payments of $35.8 million, v scheduled 2018 loan amortisation payments of $56.3 million, vi $2.4 million mandatory loan repayments, vii $95.0 million voluntary prepayment on the Euro Term A loan and viii dividend payment of $74.9 million.
Cash flows The following table displays cash flow information for each of the last two years: 2018 2017 $m $m Net cash generated from operating activities 352.0 306.6 Net cash used in investing activities 80.9 182.6 Net cash used in financing activities 229.4 119.3 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 41.7 4.7 Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period 289.3 264.1 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 15.4 20.5 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 315.6 289.3 64 ConvaTec Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 OverviewIFC Strategic report05 Governance72 Financial statements124 Additional information180 Cash flows from operating activities Net cash generated from operating activities was $352.0 million and $306.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase of $45.4 million, principally reflects the reduction in payments relating to adjusted items other payments of $41.5 million.
The following summarises the components of net cash generated from operating activities for each of the last two years: Reported Reported Adjusted Adjusted 2018 2017 2018 2017 $m $m $m $m EBITDA 457.7 427.2 482.4 505.0 Cash interest payments 61.3 66.5 61.3 66.5 Cash tax payment 35.8 46.9 35.8 46.9 Other payments 11.6 53.1 Non-cash items 14.6 41.0 2.9 2.0 Working capital increase 23.2 48.2 24.6 33.9 Net cash generated from operating activities 352.0 306.6 352.0 306.6 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted working capital and adjusted non-cash items are explained and reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with IFRS in the cash conversion reconciliation on page 71.
Cash interest payments On a reported and an adjusted basis, cash interest payments decreased $5.2 million, to $61.3 million in 2018 2017: $66.5 million.
This reflects an increase in the weighted average borrowing cost for the year to 3.5% 2017: 3.1% offset by the benefit of the interest rate swap and lower borrowings resulting from both scheduled and voluntary loan repayments.
Other payments Other payments, which reflect cash outflows in relation to adjusted items, decreased $41.5 million, to $11.6 million 2017: $53.1 million.
This reflects a reduction in restructuring cash payments of $29.6 million, principally reflecting the reduction in MIP programme activity in 2018, $5.0 million payment in 2017 in relation to IPO-related costs and a reduction in remediation of controls and compliance costs as a result of IPO of $4.8 million.
Non-cash items Reported Non-cash items decreased by $26.4 million to $14.6 million 2017: $41.0 million.
This principally reflects the reduction in the share-based payment charge from $36.9 million in 2017 to $11.2 million in 2018.
For further information see page 71.
Adjusted Adjusted non-cash items increased by $0.9 million to $2.9 million 2017: $2.0 million and reflects the net adjustment for impairment and write-offs.
Working capital Reported The reported working capital increase of $23.2 million 2017: $48.2 million principally reflects an increase in inventory held in the US as inventory levels return to normal following back orders at the end of 2017, together with an increase in inventory held by Infusion Devices resulting from a change in working capital policy by one of our key suppliers.
In addition, other current liabilities and accruals decreased as a result of the reduction in bonus payments and the disposal of Symbius.
Adjusted On an adjusted basis, the working capital increase also includes an increase in the severance provision in relation to the transition of Group finance functions from the US to the UK and restructuring geographical sales teams partially offset by a reduction in accruals in relation to IPO related activity.
Cash flows from investing activities Net cash used in investing activities decreased $101.7 million, to $80.9 million, in 2018 2017: $182.6 million.
This reflects a comparatively lower investment in the J&R Medical acquisition of $14.4 million versus $105.5 million for Woodbury and EuroTec in 2017 and a return to normalised levels of investment in property, plant and equipment of $70.9 million 2017: $82.7 million following the investment in MIP in 2017.
Cash flows from financing activities Net cash applied in financing activities was $229.4 million 2017: $119.3 million in 2018, an increase of $110.1 million primarily due to i an increase of $48.6 million to $74.9 million in the dividend paid in the year 2017: $26.3 million, 2018 being the first full year of payment under our dividend policy ii an increase in the repayment of borrowings of $82.8 million, principally reflecting the voluntary debt repayment on our Euro borrowings offset by iii in 2017, the Company purchased own shares of $9.6 million and settled $10.5 million of accrued share capital costs.
These transactions were not repeated in 2018.
Th ese non-IFRS financial measures in relation to cash conversion are explained and reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with IFRS on pages 66 to 71.
Reported The effect of the cash flows described above generates a reported cash conversion of 82.6%, an improvement on the prior year 2017: 79.0%.
Adjusted Adjusted cash conversion improved to 80.8% in 2018 2017: 77.3%.
Non-IFRS financial information Non-IFRS financial information or alternative performance measures APMs are used as supplemental measures in monitoring the performance of our business.
These measures include adjusted cost of goods sold, adjusted gross margin, adjusted selling and distribution costs, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted research and development costs, adjusted operating profit adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted finance costs, adjusted other expenses, net, adjusted net profit, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted working capital and adjusted cash conversion and net debt.
The adjustments applied to IFRS measures reflect the effect of certain cash and non-cash items that Group management believe are not related to the underlying performance of the Group.
Reconciliations for these adjusted measures to measures determined under IFRS are shown on pages 68 to 71.
The definitions of adjusted measures are as calculated within the reconciliation tables.
In managements view, the APMs reflect the underlying performance of the business and provide a meaningful supplement to the reported numbers to support how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
Adjusted results exclude certain items because, if included, these items could distort the understanding of our performance for the year and the comparability between periods.
Adjusted measures also form the basis for performance measures for remuneration e. g. adjusted EBIT.
For further information see pages 68 and 69.
In determining whether an item should be presented as an allowable adjustment to IFRS measures, the Group considers items which are significant, either because of their size or their nature.
For an item to be considered as an allowable adjustment to IFRS measures, it must initially meet at least one of the following criteria: It is a one-off significant item, which may cross more than one accounting period.
It has been directly incurred as a result of either an acquisition, divestiture, or arises from termination benefits without condition of continuing employment related to a major business change or restructuring programme.
It is unusual in nature e. g. outside the normal course of business.
If an item meets at least one of the criteria, the Group then exercises judgement as to whether the item should be classified as an allowable adjustment to IFRS measures.
Key adjustments for adjusted EBIT also known as adjusted operating profit are pre-IPO costs, IPO related costs and the post-IPO improvement programme together with restructuring and related costs.
Further adjustments, which include amortisation of pre-2018 acquisition intangibles and adjustments to intangible and fixed assets are also made in arriving at adjusted EBIT.
The tax effect of the adjustments is reflected in the adjusted tax expense to remove their effect from adjusted net profit and adjusted earnings per share.
66 ConvaTec Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 OverviewIFC Strategic report05 Governance72 Financial statements124 Additional information180 Adjusted EBITDA, which is used to calculate our metric of adjusted cash conversion and the effective use of our working capital, is calculated by adding back pre-IPO costs, IPO related costs and the post-IPO improvement programme together with restructuring and related costs to our reported EBITDA.
These adjustments are detailed below.
Adjusted items These include the following credits or costs that are reflected in the reported measures: acquisition-related amortisation of intangible assets relating to acquisitions pre 1 January 2018. share-based compensation expense arising from pre-IPO employee equity grants.
change and restructuring programme related costs.
costs in relation to a control and compliance remediation programme required as a direct result of the IPO.
gains losses in relation to the sale, impairment or write-off of intangible and fixed assets, the sale, write-off or impairment arising as a result of a major change or restructuring programme or an unusual circumstance.
These items are excluded, from the adjusted measures, to reflect performance in a consistent manner and are in line with how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis.
They are typically gains or losses costs arising from events that are not considered part of the core operations of the business or are considered to be significant in nature, and may cross several accounting periods.
We also adjust for the tax effect of these items.
Net debt, which is used to monitor the leverage of the business, is calculated as the carrying value of current and non-current borrowings on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, less the carrying value of finance leases Note 20 net of cash and cash equivalents.
Acquisition related amortisation of intangible assets Our adjusted measures exclude the amortisation of acquisition intangibles arising from acquisitions made before 1 January 2018.
After 1 January 2018, amortisation in relation to incremental bolt-on acquisitions is not excluded as smaller acquisitions are part of our Group strategy and should be included in our reported and adjusted measures.
We will review significant acquisitions on a case by case basis to determine whether the exclusion of the amortisation of acquired intangibles would provide a more meaningful comparison of our results.
Adjustments to intangible and fixed assets Gains and losses from the disposal of fixed assets, together with accelerated depreciation and impairment and write-offs in relation to intangible and fixed assets, are adjusted when management consider the circumstances surrounding the adjustment unusual and not reflective of our core business.
Change and restructuring programme related costs These arise from Group-wide initiatives to reduce the ongoing cost base and improve efficiency in the business.
We consider each project individually to determine whether its size and nature warrants separate disclosure.
Where there has been a significant change in the organisational structure of a business area or a material Group-wide initiative, these costs are highlighted and are excluded from our adjusted measures.
Pre-IPO, IPO related costs and post-IPO remediation programmes In order to provide greater comparability and reflecting the changes within the Group as a result of the IPO October 2016, certain IPO related costs have been excluded from adjusted measures.
These are: Expenses directly related to the IPO.
Pre-IPO shared based payment expense.
Pre-IPO margin improvement programme MIP.
Post-IPO control and compliance remediation programme, which included regulatory compliance costs in relation to FDA activities, IT enhancement costs and professional service fees associated with activities that were undertaken in respect of the Groups compliance function and to strengthen the control environment within the finance function.
These costs were incurred as a direct result of the standards required by the IPO.
These costs were incurred and concluded in the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017 with the exception of the pre-IPO share-based payment expense which concluded in 2018.
There will be no adjustments in future years in relation to IPO related costs.
