New International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments are applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, and have therefore been adopted by the Group.
IFRS 15 provides a principles-based approach to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, focussing on the identification of performance obligations in a contract and requiring revenue to be recognised when or as those performance obligations are satisfied.
The new standard affects certain revenue streams in the Groups Utilities segment where revenue that was previously recognised at the point of delivery of products to customers is now recognised over the period of manufacture of those products.
Further details of the impact are set out in the accounting policies on pages 104 and 105, and in note 1 to the financial statements on page 114.
The implementation of IFRS 9, which replaces IAS 39, has resulted in the Group adjusting the treatment of debt modifications in prior years as explained in note 1 to the financial statements.
The standard has not had any other material impact on the Group.
IFRS 16 Leases will be applicable to the Group in the year ending 31 December 2019.
The Groups preparations for the introduction of IFRS 16 are at an advanced stage and a summary of the expected impacts is set out in note 1 to the financial statements.

Consequently it was decided that new buildings to the new should incorporate more protection from the elements.
crown jewel of Atlantic Leading the way on this new initiative is the world renowned Hard Rock Casino and Hotel.
Creating one of their largest venues in the country a new casino and hotel has been built complete with a front faade including a 10 storey-high Gibson Guitar.
Built from structural tubular steel this modern artsy pop design welcomes guest to the new venue.
The steel needed to be protected beyond a basic paint system as in the past the storms have brought flying debris, sand, and ocean salt water to ravage local buildings.
Given theses circumstances hot-dip galvanizing was regarded as the best choice for corrosion protection for all the structural steel used, not only this new location, but all building restoration and new construction work in this area of New Jersey.
