Organic net sales growth of 5% was broad based across regions and categories and delivered through both volume growth and positive price mix.
Our productivity programme, which is now embedded in the fabric of the organisation, provides the firepower to increase investment behind our brands to fuel future growth as well as expand margins.
Marketing spend increased 7%, ahead of net sales, and organic operating margin expanded 78bps.
