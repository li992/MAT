Adjusted EBITDA was 101.8m 2017: 94.7m an Organic growth of 3.8% or 12.5% growth on a Proforma basis.
We also delivered strong cash flow in 2018 with free cash flow from continuing operations after tax and capex of 77.1m 2017: 80.1m, a free cash flow conversion of 76%.

goal of the Company is Organic revenue growth A core KPI and strategic goal of the Company is Organic revenue growth as this is the most as this is the most efficient efficient method of growth, measures the method of growth, measures underlying health of the business and is a key driver of shareholder value creation.
Organic the underlying health of revenue growth eliminates the impact of the business and is a key acquisitions counting them only once they driver of shareholder have been owned for 12 months and disposals and that element of growth which is driven value creation.
by changes in foreign exchange rates.
It is an alternative performance measure and is Mandy Gradden Chief Financial Officer discussed in more detail on page 30.
Proforma growth is measured in a similar way to Organic growth but assumes that the Companys acquisitions were all made on 1 January 2017 and is therefore a measure of the rate of growth of the brands owned today.
Adjusted EBITDA is also an alternative performance measure and is used in the day-to-day management of the business to aid comparisons with peer group companies, manage banking covenants and provide a reference point for assessing our operational cash generation.
It eliminates items arising from portfolio investment and divestment decisions, and from changes to capital structure.
Such items arise from events which are non-recurring or intermittent, and while they may generate substantial income statement amounts, do not relate to the ongoing operational performance that underpins long-term value generation.
