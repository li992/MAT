In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of the intangible asset of 11.2m 2017: 11.2m arising on entering into the energy supply arrangements with npower in December 2013 has also been excluded from adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic EPS.
For ease of comparability, following the sale of the Groups 20% shareholding in Opus Energy Group Limited Opus in February 2017 resulting in Opus becoming a discontinued operation, the contribution from Opus and the 62.3m exceptional profit from its sale in 2017 have been excluded in the above table.
SUMMARY 1 Adjusted profit before tax increased by 1.8% to 54.3m 2017 continuing operations: 53.3m on higher revenues of 792.9m 2017: 740.3m.
These profits included a 1.2m recovery credited to cost of sales of Electricity Market Reform levy costs incurred in prior years under our energy supply contract 2017: 4.2m one-off recovery of costs incurred in prior years relating to the smart meter rollout programme, 70% credited to cost of sales and 30% to administrative expenses.
The increase in revenue during the year has been principally driven by higher average energy prices and increased usage during a cold winter, partly offset by a reduction in average energy usage reflecting the progressive impact of industry-wide energy efficiency measures over the last few years, enhanced by our successful LED light bulb replacement service.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits continuing operations mainly reflects the modest organic growth over the last three years in the number of services we are providing to our Members and improved terms from certain key suppliers, partially offset by increased investment in staff headcount and higher IT costs.
Within our Customer Acquisition operating segment, losses remained broadly stable at 18.0m 2017: 18.3m, consistent with a broadly similar number of new Members joining during the year.
Distribution expenses increased to 21.9m 2017: 21.1m, mainly reflecting an increase in commissions paid to Partners on the larger number of services being provided to our membership base compared to the previous year.
Administrative expenses increased during the year by 8.0m to 63.2m 2017: 55.2m mainly as a result of continued investment in growing staff headcount to sustain our current high standards of customer service as the business grows particularly in relation to the smart meter roll out and higher IT costs.
Adjusted earnings per share continuing operations increased by 3.4% to 55.1p 2017: 53.3p, statutory EPS continuing operations 38.8p 2017: 38.0p.
The increase in adjusted EPS reflects higher profits, the lower number of shares in issue following the tender offer in July 2017 and the lower corporation tax rate this year.
In accordance with previous guidance and our strong cash position, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 26p 2017: 25p per share, making a total dividend of 50p 2017: 48p per share for the year.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 21 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED MARGINS Our overall gross margin for the year was 17.6% 2017: 17.6% mainly reflecting the improved terms from our key suppliers, offset by a lower recovery of previously incurred costs relative to the prior year.
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT We delivered further albeit modest growth in the number of services we are supplying, with an increase of 52,000 services during the course of the year, taking the total number of services provided within our Discount Club to over 2.3 million.
We continue to focus on making it easier for Partners to gather new Members by simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our prices more competitive, and improving the quality of service and support we provide to our membership base.
As a result, all our core services have continued to see organic growth in a challenging competitive environment.
Revenues increased due to higher energy prices and usage through a cold winter, partly offset by a reduction in average underlying energy usage, with growing revenues in all other service areas following increases in the number of services being provided and changes to our pricing structures: m 2018 2017 Electricity 337.5 310.4 Gas 280.3 265.8 Landline and Broadband 114.0 106.7 Mobile 30.8 27.5 Other 13.5 12.4 TOTAL 776.1 722.8 CUSTOMER ACQUISITION Our Customer Acquisition operating segment loss remained broadly flat during the year at 18.0m 2017: 18.3m, reflecting the modest growth in the number of new members joining our discount club during the year.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution expenses include the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Partners, together with other direct costs associated with gathering new Members which are included as part of the Customer Acquisition Segment result for the year.
These rose to 21.9m 2017: 21.1m, reflecting increases in Partner commission resulting from the industry wide electricity price increases in spring 2017, and growth in the number of services we are providing.
Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year remained broadly flat at 1.1% of revenues 2017: 1.1%, rising in absolute terms to 8.8m 2017: 7.8m, mainly reflecting higher energy prices.
The number of prepayment meters we installed during the year, many of which were provided at the Members own request, fell to 4,556 2017: 5,357, partly due to delays in fitting prepayment meters following service level issues with one of our meter operators MOPs in the first half of the year as previously 22 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements highlighted.
At the end of the year we had an installed base of 71,796 2017: 69,828 prepayment meters, representing approximately 7.1% of the energy services we supply: this remains significantly below the average level of prepayment meters within the industry of around 16% source: CMA.
DELINQUENT MEMBERS Delinquency the proportion of Members who have at least two energy bills outstanding has increased to 1.34% 2017: 1.15%.
This is largely due to delays in fitting prepayment meters during the second half of the prior year resulting from operational challenges with our MOPs.
The average number of employees increased from 1,049 to 1,177.
This reflects our ongoing commitment to deliver the best possible experience to our Members a rising proportion of whom are taking multiple services from us and a significant ongoing investment in strengthening both our IT resources and our management structure.
Personnel expenses excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive schemes increased by 16.6% during the year to 41.1m 2017: 35.3m.
During the year, administrative expenses were also impacted by 2.2m in respect of the non-recovery of customer debts relating to VAT and CCL liabilities, which were mostly offset by other one-off credits.
Overall, administrative expenses increased during the year by 8.0m to 63.2m 2017: 55.2m mainly as a result of higher staff costs and increased investment in IT, together with higher regulatory costs including GDPR preparation, and including the impact from the recovery of previously incurred smart meter rollout costs in the prior year mentioned above.
CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE, WORKING CAPITAL AND BORROWINGS We ended the period with a net debt position of 11.2m 2017: 18.7m net cash, mainly reflecting the 25m tender offer made to shareholders in July 2017 following the sale of Opus: the Groups Net Debt EBITDA ratio remains low at around 0.2x.
As expected, our net working capital position showed a year on year cash outflow of 11.7m primarily due to timing differences related to our energy purchasing arrangements with npower, the Quick Income Plan we launched for Partners earlier in the year, and the ramp-up in the smart meter roll-out programme.
Capital expenditure of 3.8m 2017: 5.5m related primarily to our continuing IT development programme.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2018 23 2012 1.46% 2013 1.23% 2014 1.15% 2015 1.10% 2016 1.09% 2017 1.15% 2018 1.34% FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Under the terms of our energy supply arrangements, the npower billing profile to the Group broadly equates to our customer billing profile and this limits our need for working capital.
DIVIDEND AND SHARE BUY-BACK The final dividend of 26p per share 2017: 25p will be paid on 3 August 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13 July 2018 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting which will be held on 26 July 2018.
This makes a total dividend payable for the year of 50p 2017: 48p, an increase of 4.2% compared with the previous year.
We believe our strong underlying cash flow, rising adjusted earnings and strong credit profile will enable us to refinance any remaining borrowings as they fall due, whilst maintaining a progressive dividend policy.
In the light of the steadily improving quality of our membership base and the good visibility it provides over future revenues and margins, we expect to increase our dividend to not less than 52p per share for the current year.
Our intention going forward remains to bring our dividend pay-out ratio back to around 85% of adjusted EPS over the medium term, whilst maintaining our long-standing progressive dividend policy.
In our interim management report we announced our intention to use any retained profits from this and any future financial periods to buy back shares in the market, to prevent the level of excess capital on our balance sheet continuing to increase.
We will therefore shortly be buying back shares with an aggregate value of 4.7m.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of 2.0m 2017: 1.2m.
These relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2 and the increase reflects the issue of growth shares made during the year under the new LTIP 2016.
As a result of the relative size of share incentive scheme charges as a proportion of our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits and earnings so that the underlying performance of the business can be clearly identified.
Our current adjusted earnings per share have also therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
The tax charge for the year is 10.5m 2017: 10.4m.
The effective tax rate for the year was 25.6% 2017: 25.5% excluding the sale of our 20% shareholding in Opus at a profit of 62.3m: no tax was paid on this, as it was eligible for the substantial shareholding exemption.
