Introduction 2018 has been a year marked by mixed conditions in financial markets with increased levels of volatility.
From a TP ICAP perspective we have reset our integration targets and are now focused on ensuring that the integration programme is completed by the end of 2019.

Broking and Data & Analytics contribution are defined in the Contribution section.
Average broker headcount decreased 4% to 2,727 in 2018 from 2,842 in 2017 and with a 4% increase in average revenue per broker, the resulting broking revenue was in line with 2017 and 2% higher at constant exchange rates.
The period-end broking support headcount of 1,704 was 5% lower than at the end of 2017, primarily reflecting actions taken as part of the integration programme.
The tables below analyse revenue by business division as well as revenue and underlying operating profit by region for 2018 compared with the equivalent period in 2017, at constant exchange rates.
A significant portion of the Groups activity is conducted outside the UK and the statutory revenue is therefore impacted by the movement in the foreign exchange rates used to translate the revenue from non-UK operations.
The comparative data in the tables below therefore shows revenue for 2017 translated at the same exchange rates as those used for 2018, with growth rates calculated on the same basis.
The statutory revenue figures as reported for 2017 are shown in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 23 Revenue Total revenue of 1,763m in 2018 was 3% higher than 2017 at constant exchange rates, and in line as reported.

Volatility and a steepening yield curve are positives for our business and Global Broking, and the Rates and Equities divisions in particular, benefited from these conditions.
Global Broking revenue grew by 3% on a constant exchange rate basis with the Rates and Equities divisions growing by 5% and 18% respectively.
Conditions in credit markets continue to remain challenging, with a lack of new issuance as well as restrictions on clients balance sheets, resulting in a reduction in Credit revenue of 11%.
FX & Money Markets and Emerging Markets both saw revenue declines of 3% compared with prior year due to subdued activity.
Energy & Commodities revenue was 1% lower than 2017 at constant exchange rates.
Market conditions were good in gas, environmental products, European power, metals, and softs, but the benefit of these was offset by weaker US power markets, the closure of some non-core desks and bulks, where challenging iron ore and coal markets saw volume move away from our core offering.
Oil revenues were flat and while the market experienced high volatility caused by the US China trade war, Iranian sanctions and US mid-term elections, many of our clients have had a difficult year.
Institutional Services revenue has grown by 16% compared to 2017 at constant exchange rates driven by the performance of the COEX business, which grew significantly and benefited from strong growth in the US as well as within its global FX offering.
Data & Analytics revenue was 8% higher than 2017 at constant exchange rates with the business executing a number of targeted organic growth opportunities during the year that have enabled it to monetise more proprietary data by releasing new products with a restructured salesforce.
com 24 Strategic report Financial and operating review continued EMEA Revenue for the region was 886m and increased by 2% relative to 2017 at constant exchange rates.
Global Broking revenue increased overall by 2% driven primarily from strong performance within the Rates and Equities divisions.
Market conditions were supportive of increased trading in these products due to volatility created from the macroeconomic environment, which included: interest rate increases in the US and UK and the speculation preceding them: US & China trade worries: Brexit uncertainty: and Eurozone slowdown expectations.
Revenue from Energy & Commodities was flat in the region year-on-year with the ICAP brand in particularly benefiting from investments made in expanding the product suite.
Liquefied Natural Gas LNG markets have grown strongly, whilst the European power and gas markets have benefited from tightening in the EU Emissions scheme, and have largely offset weaker oil and coal revenues, and the closure of some non-core business.
Institutional Services has seen a 4% decrease year on year resulting from a decline in the Mirexa business, which saw the Euro Government Bonds and FX Options desks close in 2018.
This was partially offset by gains in Real Estate and COEX, which saw favourable market conditions and increased volatility, along with onboarding of a number of new clients.
Americas Americas increased revenues by 5% in 2018 versus 2017 at constant exchange rates.
The Americas have reduced underperforming broker headcount over the course of 2017 and 2018, increasing revenue per broker by 7%, which positioned the business to take advantage of the stronger market conditions and increased volatility seen in 2018.
Within the Global Broking business, general market conditions improved during 2018 leading to increased trading.
Rates revenue increased by 7% as interest rate rises benefited trading across interest rate derivatives, government bonds and repos.
Rates continues to be Americas largest asset class.
Americas Equities revenue was up 27% on the back of significantly increased volatility relative to historically low levels of volatility in US Equity markets in 2017.
Equities continues to be an area of investment and new product expansion.
FX & Money Markets businesses saw flat revenues in 2018 as Forward FX and derivatives offset subdued conditions in the Money Markets area.
A more subdued market in the second half of 2018 led to decreased volumes in Local Markets resulting in a slowdown in revenues in the period.
US Credit markets remained subdued despite heightened activity in other areas of financial markets.
However, given the large number of US market participants as well as strategic fits within the competing Tullett Prebon and ICAP brands, Credit continues to be a growth opportunity for the Americas.
The Americas Energy & Commodities business had flat revenues in 2018.
The region saw increased revenue in Oil products on the back of the acquisitions of SCS Commodities in January 2018 and Axiom in November 2018.
However, these gains were offset by poor year-on-year comparables in US Power and Natural Gas.
The Americas also saw growth in the Institutional Services business with a full year performance of the COEX business, which was acquired in November 2017.
This business continues to perform well and is a growth opportunity for the region.

com 26 Strategic report Financial and operating review continued Asia Pacific Revenue in Asia Pacific declined by 2% in 2018 versus 2017 at constant exchange rates, reflecting difficult conditions in the Energy & Commodities business as well as within certain products in Global Broking.
Global Broking revenue in the region was up 1% year-on-year with the benefit of business development in the Tullett Prebon brand, where revenue grew by 11%, but this was offset by a loss of revenue in the ICAP brand, where revenue fell by 14% largely as a result of brokers moving to competitors in late 2017.
Within specific countries the Global Broking business performed well, such as in Hong Kong, as a result of the hire of a new equities derivatives desk, as well as within the Rates business, which benefited from movements in the US dollar yield curve.
The Singapore business had a good year with both the FX & Money Markets and Rates businesses in particular performing well.
During the year the region restructured its operations in Indonesia and Korea so that both countries now operate under a single Tullett Prebon brand.
Overall, conditions in the Energy & Commodities markets in the region were unfavourable and revenue from these products declined by 13% year-on-year.
The ICAP iron ore business suffered a steep decline in revenue due to the migration of liquidity from the OTC market onto exchange.
Revenue from oil and gas and their related products fell by around 13% due to a shift of gasoil market activity from Asian hours to the London market, together with some disruption to the Tullett Prebon branded naphtha desk.
However, the Australian energy business, mainly power, gathered momentum and achieved a 17% increase in revenue and the Singapore based precious metals desk grew by 30%.
Underlying administrative expenses Total underlying administrative expenses of 1,498m in 2018 were 1% lower than 2017 as reported and 1% higher at constant exchange rates.

Front office costs tend to have a large variable component to them and are directly linked to the output of our brokers.
The largest element of this is broker compensation as well as other front office costs, which include travel and entertainment, telecommunications and information services, clearing and settlement fees as well as other direct costs.
The remaining cost base represents the management and support costs of the Group, and includes the costs associated with the Data & Analytics business.
The presentation above is different from Note 5 of the accounts as we have split out front office and management and support costs and we have shown this on a constant exchange rate basis.
The reconciling items between the presentation above and Note 5 included within other front office costs are: 94m of technology costs: 2m of depreciation and amortisation and 87m of other administrative costs.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 27 Overall, the underlying cost base has seen a 1% increase at constant exchange rates to 1,498m in 2018 compared with 2017.
This has been substantially driven by an increase in total front office costs.
Broker compensation costs increased by 50m during the period reflecting the 2% increase in broking revenue at constant exchange rates and an increase in the broker compensation ratio from 50.5% to 52.2%.
The increase in broker compensation reflects the impact of the increase in revenue between the two periods in the underlying business, the acquisitions of COEX and SCS Commodities and higher amortisation relating to initial contract payments made to brokers to secure their services against increased competition for their talent.
Offsetting this increase has been a 31m reduction in other front office costs that includes lower travel and entertainment spend, a reduction in legal fees and a 14m reduction reflecting the removal of the Groups obligation to rebate revenue to COEX following their acquisition in November 2017.
The 1m increase in other staff costs is driven by offsets to the impact of synergy savings, principally relating to the acquisitions of COEX and SCS Commodities, the establishment of the Institutional Services division, the Belfast centre, our Early Careers programme, strengthening corporate functions and severance payments.
Technology and related costs includes the costs of all external technology services, including maintenance contracts, consultancy, market data services and communications costs.
During 2018 these costs increased 6% against 2017 with a modest amount of synergy savings being offset by acquisitions and new initiatives.
Premises costs increased by 4% in 2018 compared with 2017 reflecting office relocations in London, New York, Singapore and Belfast partly offset by synergy savings achieved in all regions.
The reduction in other administrative costs reflects a significant reduction in the use of contractors and the reduction of legal fees in the US relative to the prior year.
Synergy savings and administrative expenses As at the end of December 2018 the cumulative annualised synergy savings achieved from the integration programme were 71m, an increase of 19m on the annualised 52m of synergy savings reported at the end of 2017.
Of the 19m additional run rate synergies, 13m were recognised in the period.
The table below shows the movement in administrative expenses between 2017 and 2018 re-categorised to reflect the impact of the movement in synergy savings against other costs between the two periods.

Net costs show an increase of 7m, which includes increased internal audit and professional fees audit and insurance and increased premises costs in London, New York, Singapore and Belfast.
One off increases of 12m include Brexit costs 2.5m, severance costs 4m, MiFiD II costs 1m, and the impact of a reduction in the capitalisation of staff costs on IT projects 3m.
The remaining 24m movement in costs comprises increases of 19m in total front office costs as explained above and 5m in additional costs acquired with the acquisition of COEX and SCS Commodities.

An improvement in the absolute level of contribution is an important metric in driving earnings growth for the Group.
In 2018 the overall level of contribution increased by 8m or 12% to 75m.
The overall gross contribution margin increased by 2.1 percentage points to 64.1% driven by an 8% increase in revenue at constant exchange rates.
Underlying operating profit The underlying operating profit of 276m is 5% higher than the prior year, with an underlying operating profit margin of 15.7% which is 0.7 percentage points higher than 2017.
Underlying earnings per share for 2018 of 34.2p are 0.9p higher than for 2017.
Statutory operating profit of 93m was 9% lower than in 2017, and the statutory operating profit margin of 5.3% is 0.5 percentage points lower than 2017.
Statutory operating profit is after exceptional and integration, acquisition and disposal related items, and is described further below.
Statutory earnings per share of 5.7p are 10.1p lower than in 2017, reflecting the impact of the 65m impairment of goodwill.

These improvements reflect growth in the contribution margin of the business due to a reduction in other front office costs as well as the growth in revenue.
Americas In the Americas, the underlying operating profit of 81m is 27% higher than 2017 and the underlying operating profit margin has improved by 2.5 percentage points to 12.7% reflecting higher revenue growth and contribution as well as cost savings from the integration.
Asia Pacific Underlying operating profit in Asia Pacific decreased by 7m to 22m in 2018, while the underlying operating profit margin has reduced by 2.4 percentage points to 9.1% with reductions in management and support costs as a result of the integration being more than offset by increases in broker compensation.
These increases were in response to competition for our brokers increasing the level of initial contract payments the region paid at the end of 2017 into the beginning of 2018.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 31 Exceptional and acquisition, disposal and integration items The Group presents its Consolidated Income Statement in a columnar format to aid the understanding of its results by separately presenting its underlying operating profit before acquisition, disposal and integration costs and exceptional items.
Underlying operating profit is reconciled to profit before tax in the Consolidated Income Statement and is disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups underlying trading results.
Acquisition, disposal and integration costs are excluded from underlying results as they reflect the impact of acquisitions and disposals rather than underlying trading performance.
The 44m charge for integration costs related to the acquisition of ICAP includes professional fees and staff costs relating to planning, setting up and running the integration workstreams and staff severance costs.
We have incurred 44m in respect of integration costs in 2018 and we are forecasting no more than 160m of total integration costs by the end of the integration programme.
The major elements of the integration costs in 2018 continued to be staff costs 22m, which include 8m of severance costs, and other costs of 22m which include fixed term contractors 7m and consultancy costs 14m.
The 14m of consultancy cost charged in 2018 is primarily in respect of reviews of the technology strategy and scope for cost reduction, project management support and analysis, software development and quality assurance and support for the project to reduce and rationalise the legal entity structure.
A further charge of 40m has been charged through the income statement reflecting the amortisation of intangible assets other than goodwill arising on acquisitions, reflecting brand value, the value of customer relationships and other intangible assets.
This non-cash item is excluded from underlying results to present the performance of the Groups acquired businesses consistently with its organically grown businesses where such intangible assets are not recognised.
In accordance with its obligations under IAS 36 see also Note 13, the Group has undertaken an impairment review of the carrying value of its regional cash generating units CGU to which goodwill arising on acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of ICAP, has been allocated.
In determining whether goodwill is impaired under IAS 36, the resulting value of each CGU has been estimated based on its value in use.
As a result of the review, the carrying value of the Americas CGU has been written down by 58m and the carrying value of the Asia Pacific CGU has been written down by 7m, both of which are included as acquisition related items.
This non-cash impairment does not have an impact on the regulatory capital position, which excludes the carrying value of intangible assets in the calculation of the Groups allowable resources.
Other acquisition, disposal and integration costs include a 5m charge for adjustments to acquisition consideration, principally due to an increase in the expected deferred consideration on the COEX acquisition due to its strong performance.
There are also 3m of other minor acquisition and disposal items that have been excluded from underlying results.
The 3m exceptional charge in 2018 reflects an exceptional legal provision in connection with a regulatory investigation in the US offset by the release of a legal provision in relation to the ICAP Yen Libor case in 2013 2014 see Note 16.
Other exceptional items include 2m in relation to a charge relating to employee long-term benefits associated with the ICAP acquisition and 18m in relation to a charge for business reorganisation that is a one off onerous lease provision associated with office moves the Group has undertaken.
Exceptional items have been excluded from underlying results as they are non-recurring and do not relate to the underlying performance of the business.
Net finance expense The underlying net finance expense of 31m is 1m higher than the 30m charged in 2017.
The finance expense of 36m comprises 30m of interest expense on the Groups Sterling Notes 26m of which relates to the 500m Sterling Notes issued in January 2017, 1m of fees relating to the amortisation of debt issue and bank facility costs, 4m relating to the drawdown of the revolving credit facility during 2018 and another 1m of settlement interest expense.
The expense is offset by 4m of interest income and 1m of non-cash income on the retirement benefit asset.
com 32 Strategic report Financial and operating review continued Tax The effective rate of tax on underlying profit before tax is 25.8% 2017: 26.0%.
The rate is slightly lower than the prior year despite the reduction in the US federal rate of tax due to offsetting measures that broaden the US tax base in this reporting period.
The effective rate of tax on reported profit before tax is 62.9% 2017: 4.2 %, reflecting the tax deductibility of certain exceptional expenses.
The outlook for the underlying effective tax rate in 2019 is for a potential reduction of 1% to around 25%, as the initial impact of measures broadening the tax base in the US is expected to reduce.
Basic EPS The average number of shares used for the basic EPS calculation of 558.5m reflects the 563.3m shares in issue less the 2.7m shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust at the beginning of the year, less the difference between the time apportionment elements of the 1.0m of shares acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy deferred share awards made to senior management, and the 1.1m of deferred shares meeting their vesting requirements in May.
The Employee Benefit Trust has waived its rights to dividends.
The calculation also reflects the time apportioned element of the 9.2m shares paid in deferred consideration to the owners of PVM in March 2018. Dividend The Groups dividend policy is to maintain a full year dividend of 16.85p throughout the integration period.

The impact on EBITDA of acquisition, disposal and integration costs and exceptional items was 65m during the period principally relating to the costs of the integration.
During the period there was a 10m movement in initial contract prepayments reflecting the increased expenditure incurred to retain broking staff due to competitive pressures.
The working capital outflow of 29m has fallen since the half year when it was 59m but still reflects an increase in trade receivables, reflecting the higher revenue in December 2018 compared with the prior year, together with an increase in debtor days as we continue to face challenges of expediting payment for our broking services from our customers.
Capital expenditure has increased to 73m reflecting the impact of office moves in New York, London, Singapore and Belfast.
The capital expenditure on these office moves amounted to 46m as the Group implemented its co-location strategy in London, New York and Singapore and expanded its operations in Belfast.
After interest paid and underlying taxation paid, the underlying free cash flow for the Group was 130m, a decrease on the 151m generated in 2017.
This decrease is driven by higher capital expenditure associated with the office moves as well as higher interest paid in 2018 reflecting the Group paying a full years worth of interest on the 500m 2024 bond.

The scheme is closed to new members and future accruals.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 30 April 2016 was concluded in April 2017.
The actuarial funding surplus of the scheme at that date was 61m and under the agreed schedule of contributions the Company will continue not to make any payments into the scheme.
In 2017 the Group reported that the Trustees had insured the defined benefit liabilities of the scheme through a bulk annuity buy-in with Rothesay Life.
The policy is in the name of the scheme and is a scheme asset.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 19.
The fair value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2018 was 243m 31 December 2017: 260m.
The decrease reflects the investment return on the assets less amounts paid as benefits and transfers.
The present value of the schemes liabilities at the end of December 2018, calculated in accordance with IAS 19, was 188m 31 December 2017: 203m.
The valuation of the schemes liabilities at the end of the period reflects the demographic assumptions adopted for the most recent triennial actuarial valuation and a discount rate of 2.7% 31 December 2017: 2.4%.
Under IAS 19, the scheme shows a surplus, before the related deferred tax liability, of 55m at 31 December 2018 31 December 2017: 57m.
Regulatory capital The Groups lead regulator is the FCA.
The Group has a waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy requirements under CRD IV.
The Groups current waiver took effect on 30 December 2016, following the acquisition of ICAP, and will expire on 30 December 2026.
Under the terms of the waiver, each investment firm within the Group must be treated as either a limited activity or a limited licence firm and comply with its individual regulatory capital resources requirements.
TP ICAP plc, as the parent Company, must continue to maintain capital resources in excess of the sum of the solo notional capital resources requirements for each relevant firm within the Group the Financial Holding Company test.
The terms of the waiver require the Group to eliminate the excess of its consolidated own funds requirement compared with its consolidated own funds Excess Goodwill over the ten-year period to 30 December 2026.
The amount of the Excess Goodwill must not exceed the amount determined as at the date the waiver took effect the Excess Goodwill Ceiling.
The Excess Goodwill Ceiling is reduced to nil in line with a schedule over ten-years to December 2026, with the first reduction of 25% occurring at the end of June 2019.
The Excess Goodwill Ceiling continues to reduce 25% every 2.5 years on a straight line basis.
The Group expects to reduce its Excess Goodwill in accordance with the declining Excess Goodwill Ceiling.
The waiver also sets out conditions with respect to the maintenance of financial ratios relating to leverage, debt service and debt maturity profile.
The Groups regulatory capital headroom under the Financial Holding Company test calculated in accordance with Pillar 1 was 1,605m 2017: 1,702m.
Many of the Groups broking entities are regulated on a solo basis, and are obliged to meet the regulatory capital requirements imposed by the local regulator of the jurisdiction in which they operate.
The Group maintains an appropriate excess of financial resources in such entities.
Information disclosure under Pillar 3 is available on the Groups website: www.
IFRS 16 leases In line with International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group will apply IFRS 16 for the year ending 31 December 2019.
The impact of this change is set out in Note 2 e of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
