com 35 25675 8 June 2018 10:59 AM Proof 10 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OUR GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW Chief Financial Officers Report Revenue for the Retail business of 977.2m reflected, on a constant-currency basis, a like-for-like LFL sales increase of 2.3%.
Non LFL revenue in the year included sales from the Tredz and Wheelies businesses prior to the annualisation of the acquisition date, alongside the contribution from Cycle Republic stores that have been open for less than 12 months.
Please refer to the Retail Operational Review in the Chief Executives Statement for further commentary on the trading performance in the year.
Like-for-like revenues and total sales revenue mix for the Retail business are split by category below: FY18 FY17 FY18 Total sales Total sales LFL % mix % mix % Motoring 1.9 61.0 62.0 Car Maintenance 3.7 31.6 31.4 Car Enhancement -2.2 18.2 19.0 Travel Solutions 3.6 11.2 11.6 Cycling 2.9 39.0 38.0 Gross profit for the Retail business at 463.6m FY17: 456.6m represented 47.4% of sales, 123bps down on the prior year FY17: 48.6%.
This movement is explained as follows: Gross impact of the weaker pound against the US dollar pre-mitigation -270 bps First time inclusion of Tredz and Wheelies for the period prior to annualisation of the acquisition in May 2016 -20 bps The mix effect of relatively faster cycling sales growth, partially offset by Sat Nav sales decline and higher margin service sales growth -30 bps Mitigation of FX impact and other 197 bps Total Retail gross margin movement -123 bps As previously guided, in the first half of FY18 the impact of the depreciation of the pound against the US dollar, pre-mitigation, reached its highest level of any half year period since the EU referendum.
If exchange rates remain at around current levels, we do not anticipate further adverse impact in FY19.

Store Colleague costs increased by 3.9% and reflected the continued inflation in the living and minimum wage rates, additional labour hours, the impact of additional Cycle Republic stores and also the first-time inclusion of a full-year of Tredz & Wheelies costs.
Store Occupancy costs increased by 2.7%, principally driven by the write-off of assets no longer required, increased utility costs driven by the cold weather in the early Spring and additional costs associated with the store refreshes and new Cycle Republic stores.
Rent and rates on the existing estate were broadly flat.
Warehouse & Distribution costs increased by 5.5%, driven by a combination of wage inflation, an increase in storage costs and also additional courier costs, resulting from our improved home delivery proposition.
There was also an impact of greater demand for more bulky items, such as roof boxes, cycle carriers, camping products and metal storage.
Support Costs increased by 0.5%, reflecting the impact of pay rises and increased depreciation, partially offset by savings elsewhere as costs were tightly controlled.

Autocentres generated total revenues of 157.9m FY17: 156.6m, an increase of 0.8% on the prior year with a LFL increase of 0.2%.

38 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 30 March 2018 25675 8 June 2018 10:59 AM Proof 10 Brexit Principal Risks and Uncertainties As we have previously explained, the decision of the UK to leave the The Board considers risk assessment, identification of mitigating European Union Brexit presents significant uncertainties to the actions and internal control to be fundamental to achieving Halfords Group as a result of the impact on the wider UK economy.
We have strategic corporate objectives.
In the Annual Report & Accounts the previously set out the main areas in which we considered Brexit was Board sets out what it considers to be the principal commercial and likely to impact the Group.
We reaffirm and update our assessment financial risks to achieving the Groups objectives.
The main areas of these below: of potential risk and uncertainty in the balance of the financial year are described in the Strategic Report on page 40 of the 2018 Annual 1.
The Group buys a significant Report and Accounts.
These include: proportion of its goods in US dollars: between $250m and $300m a year.
As previously guided, the majority of our US dollar Economic risks: including market risks sourcing is for cycling products, and, in 2017, bike prices rose Business strategy risks across the cycling market, both from suppliers into retailers and Competitive risks then onto customers.
We have also increased some of our bike Compliance prices, but we maintained good value against the competition.
Our bike volumes declined, but this was more than offset by the Supply chain disruption increase in average selling prices.
Product and service quality Information technology systems and infrastructure We have now experienced a cumulative additional 40m of input Dependence on key management personnel costs compared to FY16, in respect of the weaker pound against the US dollar.
Our plans to offset the gross impact through Specific risks associated with performance include Christmas supplier negotiations, operational efficiencies and pricing trading as well as weather-sensitive sales, particularly within the Car have worked well and the net impact on Retail gross margin Maintenance and Cycling categories in the Retail business.
visibly improved over the year with a year-on-year movement in Jonny Mason gross margin of -182bps in H1 and -48bps in H2.
We have now Chief Financial Officer recovered over half of the gross impact and at current exchange 22 May 2018 rates we do not anticipate any further FX headwind in FY19 or FY20.
As explained in the CEO statement, we now expect the remaining unmitigated amount to be recovered through the improved exchange rates rather than through further price rises.
Given our hedging policy, this benefit will be mostly felt in FY20 rather than in FY19.
Prolonged uncertainty over exit terms and continued weakness in Sterling could lead to a slowdown in the UK economy, and consequent loss of consumer confidence, impacting trading conditions for the Group.
However, Halfords has strong positions in fragmented Motoring and Cycling markets, and a service-led offer that differentiates us from our competitors, physical and online.
Much of our sales are in needs-based categories that are more resilient to macro-economic cycles and our discretionary categories, such as cycling, camping and travel solutions, could benefit from an increase in the number of people choosing to stay at home rather than holidaying abroad: a trend that we observed in 2009.
