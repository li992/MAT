At the beginning of May, the bookings position for Summer holidays was 7% higher than the previous year, with average selling prices up 5%.
However, bookings and margins declined significantly in the fourth quarter, as many consumers chose to enjoy the prolonged good weather at home, rather than travel abroad.
As a result, while revenue for the year grew by 9% reflecting overall higher volumes and pricing, full year underlying EBIT fell by 2 million to 95 million FY17: 97 million.
CONTINENTAL EUROPE Our Continental Europe business also ended the Winter in a strong position, with a 3 million lower seasonal EBIT loss for the first half, and a positive bookings and pricing position for Summer.
However, due to weak demand in the fourth quarter on account of the heatwave, underlying EBIT for the year as a whole declined by 30 million to 73 million FY17: 103 million.
Our German business was also impacted by the effects of the widespread flight disruption, processing a higherthan-usual number of flight changes, re-bookings and cancellations.
In our Dutch and Eastern European businesses, volumes and profits declined as capacity was reduced.
By contrast, Belgium continued to perform well, following the transfer of our Belgian airline business to SN Brussels in November 2017.
Russia and France grew significantly during the year, with customer numbers up by 13% and 18% respectively.
Russian growth was mainly due to increasingly strong demand for Turkey, while France benefited from strong growth in demand for North African destinations, together with the effect of significant cost-cutting over recent years.
