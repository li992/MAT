com Financial review Group performance A robust financial performance despite high levels of claims and a low investment return Martin Bride Finance director Profit Profit before tax in 2018 was $76.4m 2017: $168.0m.
The groups combined ratio improved slightly to 98% 2017: 99% thanks to an improving expense ratio in what was another year of high claims activity.
By recording an underwriting profit we once again demonstrated the resilience of our portfolio.
Our investment team achieved an investment return of 0.8% 2017: 2.9% or $41.1m 2017: $138.3m.
Premiums Gross premiums written have increased by 12% in 2018 to $2,615.3m 2017: $2,343.8m.
We are confident of the quality of this growth, which is the fruit of sustained investment in our underwriting teams and our patience in waiting for the appropriate conditions, market by market, before growing.
Rates on renewal business on average increased by 3% across the portfolio 2017: decreased by 1% with our catastrophe exposed lines obtaining the largest increases.
Our portfolio mix is broadly unchanged from 2017.

com Financial review continued Group performance continued Reinsurance purchased Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and non-natural catastrophes such as cyber attacks: to enable the group to put down large lead lines on the risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
The amount the group spent on reinsurance in 2018 was $366.8m 2017: $365.0m.
As a percentage of gross premiums written it decreased to 14% from 16% in 2017 due to a desire to keep reinsurance spend flat year on year.
Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims and expenses to total net earned premium.
A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio reduced in 2018 to 98% 2017: 99% thanks to an improvement in the expense ratio.
Claims Claims activity in 2018 was very similar to that seen in 2017.
Hurricanes Florence and Michael hit the US, while Typhoons Jebi and Trami affected Japan.
Added to this, wildfires broke out in California for the second year in a row causing widespread damage.
Whilst these natural disasters were not quite at the level of the catastrophes experienced in 2017, they combined with higher attritional claims particularly in our property account and the lower reserve releases compared to 2017 that we had signalled, to cause the claims ratio to increase slightly to 59% 2017: 58%.
com Annual report 2018 Beazley 43 Reserve releases Beazley has a consistent reserving philosophy, with initial reserves being set to include risk margins that may be released over time as and when any uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range of 5-10% above our actuarial estimates, which themselves include some margin for uncertainty.
The margin held above the actuarial estimate was 5.6% at the end of 2018 2017: 5.0%.
Whilst the margin is higher than year end 2017, it is still towards the low end of the range that management targets, which is in part a result of the above average natural catastrophe activity again in 2018.
As a consequence, reserve releases in 2019 are likely to be below the long term average level particularly in the short tail classes affected by the natural catastrophes.
However, it is important to recognise that while there is strong correlation between the level of margin and future reserve releases, current year developments can also affect releases either positively or negatively.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
Our property division strengthened its reserves materially.
Approximately half of this was driven by increasing the reserves for the 2017 catastrophes, notably Hurricane Irma, and the balance was due to higher than expected attritional claims in our property division, particularly in relation to the 2016 and 2017 underwriting years.
Our overall reserves for the 2017 catastrophes proved sufficient and the downward revisions in our reinsurance division that counter balanced the increases in the property division were the major driver of that divisions release.
Our specialty lines division maintained a strong level of reserve release in 2018 at $111.2m 2017: $121.4m including meaningful amounts from the 2015 2016 cyber portfolio.
This part of the specialty lines portfolio is effectively short tail and will show more year on year variability than the balance of the division.

com Financial review continued Group performance continued Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased during 2018 to $812.6m from $774.4m in 2017.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2018 2017 $m $m Brokerage costs 461.1 431.1 Other acquisition costs 100.8 88.6 Total acquisition costs 561.9 519.7 Administrative expenses 250.7 254.7 Total acquisition costs and administrative expenses 812.6 774.4 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premiums they have decreased slightly to 22% in the current year 2017: 23%.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with the groups accounting policy.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity e. g. underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
Beazleys overall expense ratio was down by two percent from 41% in 2017 to 39%.
It is also flat five years on from 2013 when it was also 39%.
The company has always stressed that improving the expense ratio during the phases of stronger growth was a key objective.
It is encouraging that this outcome has been achieved whilst at the same time maintaining investment in future growth opportunities.
Foreign exchange The majority of Beazleys business is transacted in US dollars, which is the currency we have reported in since 2010 and the currency in which we hold the companys net assets.
Changes in the US dollar exchange rate with sterling, the Canadian dollar and the euro do have an impact as we receive premiums in those currencies and a material number of our staff receive their salary in sterling.
Beazleys foreign exchange loss taken through the statement of profit or loss in 2018 was $13.2m 2017: loss of $3.1m.
Investment performance 2018 proved to be a difficult year for investments and many asset classes have produced negative returns.
Whilst our absolute return was disappointing, most of the portfolio performed well relative to its benchmarks and the management actions of Stuart Simpson and his team had a positive effect at the margin.
US interest rates were increased four times as the Federal Reserve continued to reverse the easing monetary policies of recent years and officials indicated that interest rates would continue to rise through 2019.
As a result US bond yields rose throughout most of the year, generating capital losses on these securities.
These developments, combined with continuing tensions over international trade and signs that global economic growth may be slowing, has led to growing pessimism about prospects for global economic activity, culminating in a significant correction in risk asset values, including equities and credit, in the final quarter of the year.
We reduced our exposure to more volatile capital growth investments from 14.8% to 12.1% of assets during the year, which was beneficial as these exposures produced a negative return in this period, with equities the worst performing asset class as the global equity index declined by more than 7%.
We halved our equity exposure, from 3.4% to 1.7% of assets, during the period.
Our fixed income investments grew from 76.0% to 81.1% of assets in 2018 and this portfolio returned 1.3%, held back by rising interest rates and widening credit spreads, but helped by the significant decline in US bond yields during December.
Our overall investment return for the year ending 31 December 2018 was 0.8%, or $41.1m 2017: 2.9%, $138.3m.
Rising yields in 2018 have increased the average yield of our fixed income investments to 3.3% and this should support better investment returns in future periods.

The chart below shows the increase in our group funds since 2014.
Tax Beazley is liable to corporation tax in a number of jurisdictions, notably the UK, the US and Ireland.
Beazleys effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate mainly driven by the Irish, UK and US tax rates.
The weighted average of the statutory tax rates for the year was 18.6% 2017: 18.7%.
The effective tax rate has decreased in 2018 to 10.7% 2017: 22.6%.
The decrease has been possible thanks to the revision of prior years US tax returns to incorporate additional tax deductions for staff costs, including share based payments.
The application of the diverted profits tax legislation passed by the UK government early in 2015 still remains uncertain.
We have considered the implication of this and retain the view that this tax should not apply to Beazley see note 9 to the financial statements.
Whilst the uncertainty around the legislation remains, the quantum of our earnings that could theoretically fall within its scope grows as the period since the legislation started to apply lengthens.
