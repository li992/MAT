Annual report & accounts 2018 Financial review Statement of operations In its full-year financial results for 2018, EVRAZ reported an increase of 18.6% year-on-year in consolidated revenues, which were US$12,836 million compared with US$10,827 million in 2017.
This performance was driven mostly by an upswing in prices for vanadium and steel products amid more favourable market trends.
EVRAZ consolidated EBITDA amounted to US$3,777 million in the period, compared with US$2,624 million in 2017, boosting the EBITDA margin from 24.2% to 29.4% and free cash flow to US$1,940 million.
The improvement is primarily attributable to higher vanadium and steel product prices, lower expenses in US dollar terms because of the effect that rouble weakening had on costs in 2018 versus 2017, as well as the impact of cost-cutting initiatives on efficiency.
This was partly offset by an increase in prices for raw and auxilliary materials, including scrap, electrodes and ferroalloys.
The Steel segments revenues including inter-segment climbed by 14.7% year-on-year to US$8,879 million, or 62.2% of the Groups total before elimination.
The growth was mainly attributable to higher revenues from sales of vanadium products, which rose by 111.4% year-on-year, 124.6% increase was attributed to surges in average sales prices.
Ongoing vanadium production restrictions together with Chinas new high-strength rebar standard and strong global demand from steelmakers has severely affected stockpiles and pushed up price indices.
Sales of steel products also increased by 5.8% due to higher sales prices, primarily for finished products.
