Case study Stronger together bringing our values to life Anita Hughes Internal  2018 was a challenging and exciting year for the Internal Communications team, which included us supporting the launch of our new Mission, Vision and Values with colleagues across both the UK and India.
Our Mission, Vision and Values were designed using insight gathered from colleagues across all areas of the business, so when the time came to share them, it was important we did this in a meaningful way by bringing everyone together, sharing real life stories, videos and creating activities that brought our values to life.
The response to our light-hearted teaser campaign and employee events was very positive: but it was a truly collective effort.
We engaged the support of colleagues across the business to help create our campaign and embed it within our different locations, ensuring maximum impact, which as it turned out saw one of our new values already in action stronger together!
