36 Strategic Report J Sainsbury plc Annual Report 2018 Sainsburys underlying Group sales including VAT were up 9.0 per cent to 31,735 million mainly as a result of the impact of consolidating a full year of Argos.
Financial On a 52-week rolling basis Sainsburys market share as measured by Kantar declined 27 basis points, due to further price investment and the continuing new store expansion from discounters, whose combined market share increased by 132 basis points.
By contrast the big four declined by 96 basis points.
Our General Review Merchandise sales continued to outperform the market with strong growth in many of our key categories, as we maintained market share as measured by the British Retail Consortium, BRC despite challenging market conditions.
During the year, we worked hard to protect our customers from the impact of cost price inflation and rising commodity prices by continuing to partner with our suppliers in looking at ways to reduce our sourcing and end-toDear Shareholder end supply chain costs.
Against this backdrop we were pleased to record an 2017 18 has been another year of significant improving food margin trend whilst General Merchandise margin remains under pressure in challenging market conditions.
In 2017 18, retail underlying change, with continued progress in delivering EBITDAR margin increased 4 basis points to 7.44 per cent and retail underlying operating margin declined 18 basis points to 2.24 per cent primarily as a result our strategic priorities, strong cash generation, of the consolidation of a full year of Argos results.
Underlying profit before tax cost saving and synergy outperformance, UPBT increased by 1.4 per cent to 589 million 2016 17: 581 million.
Profit before tax of 409 million 2016 17: 503 million was down 18.7 per cent as a the consolidation of a full year of Argos, result of a 180 million charge recognised outside underlying results.

of 500 million by 2020 21 as we continue to simplify the business and we expect to achieve savings of around 200 million in 2018 19.
Sainsburys Bank profits increased by 11 per cent to 69 million, primarily due to a full-year consolidation of Argos Financial Services results.
Good sales growth across the product range was offset by a reduction in margins in the competitive unsecured lending market and an increase in bad debt charges, as expected.
Next year, we expect lending margins to remain under pressure.
Accordingly, we have decided to take a more cautious approach to unsecured lending and will focus on growing our mortgage book and our commission products.
Together with the impacts of new accounting standards and the cost of the external capital we raised in November 2017, we expect Bank profits to reduce to around 30 million in 2018 19.
The balance sheet remains strong with a further reduction in net debt.
Net debt was 1,364 million as at 10 March 2018 11 March 2017: 1,477 million, a decrease of 113 million in the year, mainly as a result of continuing strong cash generation from our retail operations and further working capital improvements, offset by pension payments, capital expenditure and dividends paid.
The Group has facilities of 4.1 billion with only 2.5 billion drawn at the end of the year.
The discount rate applied to the Groups pension schemes has been increased this year to use a revised approach that we believe better reflects expected yields on high quality corporate bonds over the duration of the Groups pension schemes.
In addition, future mortality assumptions have been updated from CMI 2015 projections at 2017 year end to CMI 2017 projections.
These changes have contributed to the reduction in our Group pension scheme IAS 19 accounting deficit net of deferred tax to 261 million 2016 17: 850 million deficit as at 10 March 2018.
Underlying basic earnings per share decreased 6.4 per cent to 20.4 pence 2016 17: 21.8 pence, reflecting the full-year impact of the additional shares issued as a result of the Home Retail Group HRG acquisition.
Basic earnings per share decreased 24.0 per cent to 13.3 pence 2016 17: 17.5 pence, lower than the underlying earnings per share due to the 180 million charge recognised outside of underlying results.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 7.1 pence 2016 17: 6.6 pence, resulting in an unchanged full-year dividend of 10.2 pence per share 2016 17: 10.2 pence per share.
