FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2018 43 Financial review continued Viability statement In accordance with provision C. 2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period, taking into account the Groups current position and the potential impact of the principal risks set out on page 36 onwards.
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 March 2021.
Whilst the Directors have no reason to believe the Group will not be viable over a longer period, the period over which the Directors consider it possible to form a reasonable expectation as to the Groups longer term is the three year period to 31 March 2021.
This period reflects the Groups corporate planning processes and is considered appropriate for a fast-moving competitive environment such as passenger transport.
The Groups corporate planning processes include completion of a strategic review, preparation of a medium term business plan and aquarterly re-forecast of current year business performance.
The plans and projections prepared as part of these corporate planning processes consider the Groups cash flows, committed funding and liquidity positions, forecast future funding requirements, banking covenants and other key financial ratios, including those relevant to maintaining the Groups existing investment grade status.
It also considers the ability of the Group to deploy capital.
A key assumption underpinning these corporate planning processes is that debt andasset-backed financing markets will be sufficiently available to the Group.
In making their assessment, the Directors took account of the potential financial and operational impacts, in severe but plausible scenarios, of the principal risks which might threaten the Groups viability during the three-year period to 31 March 2021 and the likely degree of effectiveness of current and available mitigating actions that could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of such risks.
Thescenarios considered were: 1 weak economy, adverse operating environment and forfeit of rail franchises: 2 low growth economy, heightened terrorism and increased environmental pressures: and 3 weak economy and credit market shock.
The Board confirms that in making this statement it carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Going concern statement The Group has established a strong balanced portfolio of businesses with approximately 50% of Group revenues secured under medium term contracts with government agencies and other large organisations in the UK and North America.
The Group has a diversified funding structure with average debt duration at 31 March 2018 of 4.1 years 2017: 3.6 years and which is largely represented by medium term unsecured bank facilities and long term unsecured bond debt.
The Group has an 800m committed revolving banking facility of which 603m 2017: 800m was undrawn at the year end.
This facility has a maturity of July 2021.
The Directors have carried out a detailed review of the Groups budget for the year to 31 March 2019 and medium term plans, with due regard for the risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed, the uncertain economic climate and the impact that this could have on trading performance.
Based on this review, the Directors believe that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
