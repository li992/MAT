Attributable underlying EBIT was $5.2 billion 2017:$5.1billion, reflecting higher prices, improved salesvolumes at Metallurgical Coal and Copper and the continued delivery of cost-efficiency programmes across the Group, offset by inflation and the Minas-Rio production stoppage.
Average attributable capital employed was constant at $27.4 billion owing to capital expenditure being largely offset by depreciation and amortisation.
LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING The Groups liquidity remains conservative at $13.9 billion 2017: $16.8 billion, made up of $6.5 billion of cash 2017:$7.8 billion and $7.3 billion of undrawn committed facilities 2017: $9.0 billion.
The reduction in Group liquidity, in line with our strategy of lowering the cost of the overall capital structure, was driven primarily by a continued focus on debt reduction and the refinancing of a number of credit facilities outlined in the transactions below.
These were partially offset by strong positive attributable free cash flow.
In March 2018, the Group completed the repurchase of $1.5billion including the cost of unwinding associated derivatives of USand Euro-denominated bonds with maturities from April 2019 to April 2021.
The Group also issued a $0.7 billion 10-year bond in the US bond markets.
In May 2018, the Group completed the repurchase of $0.6billion including the cost of unwinding associated derivatives of US-denominated bonds with maturities between May 2020 and September 2020.
These transactions, as well as $1.3 billion of bond maturities during 2018, have reduced short term refinancing requirements, increased the weighted average maturity ofoutstanding bonds by approximately one year to 5.0 years and reduced gross debt.
In March 2018, the Group replaced a number of credit facilities maturing between March 2019 and March 2020, with a total value of $5.4 billion, with a $4.5 billion credit facility maturing in March 2023.
