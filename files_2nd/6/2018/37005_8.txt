20 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 BUSINESS MARKETPLACE GROUP GROUP RESOURCES AND MODEL AND STRATEGY PERFORMANCE RISKS RELATIONSHIPS Finance AND operating review Financial information enables management to monitor the performance of the business and inform decision making in support of delivering the Groups strategic objectives.
The financial information prepared for, and reviewed by, management and the Board is on a non IFRS basis and therefore as it differs from the IFRS financial statements on pages 110 to 166 are alternative performance measures as defined in the glossary on p167.
The Board believes that presenting the financial information in this review on a non GAAP basis assists shareholders in assessing the delivery of the Group's strategy through its financial performance consistent with the approach taken by management and the Board.
The Groups profit before tax on an IFRS basis was below last year at 199.1m 2017: 252.4m, detailed in the table below: 2018 2017 Internally Internally IFRS reported Adjustments IFRS as reported reported Adjustments as reported Income statement m m m m m m Revenue Fee and other operating revenue 173.9 16.7 157.2 146.6 12.5 134.1 Finance and dividend income 139.0 50.8 189.8 174.4 29.8 204.2 Net gains on investments 144.7 108.3 253.0 201.4 85.4 286.8 Total revenue 457.6 142.4 600.0 522.4 102.7 625.1 Finance costs 63.1 103.3 166.4 55.2 98.2 153.4 Impairments 25.2 6.4 18.8 48.0 22.7 25.3 Administrative expenses 201.0 15.0 216.0 183.0 11.3 194.3 Other 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Profit before tax 168.3 30.8 199.1 236.2 16.2 252.4 A full reconciliation between the internally reported financial information and the IFRS consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows is provided in note 3 to the financial statements.
The adjustments can be summarised as follows: Consolidated structured entities IFRS deems the Group to control funds where it can make significant decisions that can substantially affect the variable returns of investors.
There are 14 credit funds and CLOs required to be consolidated under this definition of control.
This has the impact of including the assets and liabilities of these funds in the consolidated statement of financial position and to recognise interest income and gains or losses on investments in the consolidated income statement.
The Group is not exposed to the liabilities and cannot access the assets of the CLO entities except for the investment made by the Group into these structured funds.
Financial information prepared for internal reporting purposes includes the fair value of the balance sheet investment in the statement of financial position, and includes the management fee and dividend income received from these entities in the income statement.
This is consistent with the treatment of the CLOs for regulatory reporting purposes.
The consolidated financial statements of ICG Group presented in accordance with IFRS include the financial statements of the CLO entities which meet the requirements for consolidation of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
CLOs are structured as tranches of debt, of which control is essentially determined by reference to ownership of the most subordinated tranche of debt.
This is not equity, and hence no non-controlling interests arise on the consolidation of these entities.
Upon consolidation, all intragroup balances and transactions, including any related intragroup profits and losses, are eliminated in full.
The difference in profit between the internally reported and IFRS consolidated measures is solely due to a difference in valuation assumptions applied for the asset held by ICG and the corresponding liability held by the CLO entity.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 21 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reclassification of income The Group invests in its European, Asia Pacific and North American Private Debt mezzanine strategies either through a fund structure or directly into the underlying assets, depending on the fund.
This impacts the presentation of the income statement for investments in debt instruments under IFRS.
For those investments made directly, the Group generates interest income and is subject to impairment risk, whereas for the investments made through a fund structure the income is recognised as a net gain on investment.
Regardless of the investment mechanics, internal financial information is presented on an asset by asset basis for all European, Asia Pacific and North American Private Debt mezzanine strategies.
This is presentational only and has no impact on the profit of the Group.
As previously indicated, for the financial year beginning 1 April 2018 our internal financial information will report our Investment Company income at a Net Investment Returns level, thereby increasing the alignment between our internally reported and IFRS GAAP reporting.
Non GAAP measures are denoted by throughout this review.
The definition, and where appropriate, reconciliation to a GAAP measure, is included in the glossary on page 167.
OVERVIEW The Groups internally reported profit before tax for the period was 29% lower at 168.3m 2017: 236.2m, with Fund Management Company FMC profit of 95.3m 2017: 74.0m and Investment Company IC profit of 73.0m 2017: 162.2m.
Our principal profit metric is FMC profit which has benefitted from the increase in assets under management, increased fee income and a slower increase in operating costs.
IC profits have, as expected, normalised after the prior year included the one off recycling of 54.4m of realised capital gains from reserves and include the impact of the fair value charge on hedging derivatives of 6.5m 2017: 1.3m.
31 March 2018 31 March 2017 Change Income statement as internally reported m m % Fund Management Company 95.3 74.0 29% Investment Company 73.0 162.2 55% Profit before tax 168.3 236.2 29% Tax 55.7 34.9 n a Profit after tax 224.0 201.3 11% The effective tax rate is lower than the standard corporation tax rate of 19%, as detailed in note 12 to the financial statements.
This is in part due to a significant proportion of the Investment Companys assets being invested directly into funds based outside the United Kingdom.
Investment returns from these funds are paid to the Group in the form of non-taxable dividend income.
This outcome is in line with other UK investment companies.
The Investment Companys taxable costs can therefore be used to offset the taxable profits of our UK Fund Management business, reducing the overall Group charge.
In addition, there are two deferred tax accounting adjustments in the current year which have further reduced the tax charge: 1.
Finance Act 2017 widened the definition of the Substantial Shareholder Exemption rules which exempt companies from tax on the disposal of an investment in which 10% of the shares are held and certain other conditions met.
As a result there are a small number of legacy assets, dating from when ICG was a principal investor, that will now qualify for SSE and be exempt from tax.
As tax had previously been expected to be paid on these balances, a deferred tax liability of 15.4m had been accrued which has been released in the current year.
The Group has reviewed, and updated, its transfer pricing policy to reflect current business practices and in line with the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS guidelines.
The updated methodology was prepared in conjunction with our corporate tax advisers and the use of external benchmarking.
Following this exercise, and in light of the Groups ongoing low risk tax status in the UK and no open enquiries elsewhere, the Directors reassessed the necessity for a tax risk provision.
The Directors concluded that whilst there remains an inherent risk of challenge by UK and overseas tax authorities this was not sufficient to maintain the provision of 27.1m.
Based on the internally reported profit above, the Group generated an ROE of 19.1% 2017: 18.0% and adjusted earnings per share for the period of 79.3p 2017: 68.9p.
Net current assets of 228.1m are down from 594.1m at 31 March 2017.

New AUM inflows is our best lead indicator to sustainable future fee streams and therefore increasing sustainable profits.
In the year to 31 March 2018, the net impact of fundraising and realisations increased third party AUM by 22% to 26.5bn.
AUM by strategic asset class is detailed below.

Fundraising in the period related to our Senior Debt Partners and North America Private Debt strategies.
Capital Market Investments Capital Market Investments third party funds under management increased 25% to 7.7bn, with new third party AUM of 2,161m raised in the year.
During the year we raised three CLOs, one in Europe and two in the US, raising a total 1,173m, including 65m committed from the balance sheet to meet regulatory requirements, thereby further increasing the operating leverage of this strategy.
The remaining 1,053m was raised across our other liquid credit funds, a substantial increase on the 153m raised in the prior year and a reflection of the investment made into these strategies.
Real Asset Investments Real Asset Investments third party funds under management increased 7% to 3.5bn, with new AUM of 431m raised in the year for our UK real estate senior debt programme and a 150m first close for ICG Longbow Fund V, our UK real estate partnership capital strategy.
Fundraising for this strategy is ongoing with further closes expected in the new financial year.
Secondary Investments Secondary Investments third party funds under management decreased 5% to 1.5bn, with new AUM of 74m raised in the period for our Strategic Equity strategy offsetting the negative impact of FX.
The new AUM in the period resulted in a final close for our Strategic Secondaries Fund at $1.1bn, including a $200m commitment from the balance sheet, in excess of its target size of $1bn.
Fee earning AUM The investment rate for our Senior Debt Partners strategy, Real Estate funds and North American Private Debt Fund has a direct impact on FMC income as fees are charged on an invested capital basis.
The total amount of third party capital deployed on behalf of the direct investment strategies was 4.9bn in the year compared to 4.0bn in the last financial year.

The remaining 5.9m 2017: 1.3m primarily related to our Alternative Credit and Strategic Equity strategies.
Performance fees are an integral recurring part of the fee income profile and profitability stream of the Group.
The weighted average fee rate, excluding performance fees, across our fee earning AUM is 0.86% 2017: 0.91%.
This slight decrease is due to the successful investment of our Senior Debt Partners and growth in our Capital Markets funds during the year.

Operating expenses Operating expenses of the FMC were 114.8m 2017: 105.7m, including salaries and incentive scheme costs.
Salaries were 42.1m 2017: 39.0m as average headcount increased 6% from 238 to 252.
This increase is directly related to investing in our capital markets and senior debt strategies.
Other administrative costs have decreased to 31.9m 2017: 32.9m as the amortisation cost of historic placement fees reduces.
The FMC operating margin was 45.4% up from 41.2% in the prior year, as a result of average fee earning AUM increasing 14% to 19.1bn for the year thereby increasing the operating leverage of our existing strategies.

In the period 288.0m was invested alongside our Corporate Investments strategies for new and follow on investments.
Of the remaining 284.4m, 118.2m was invested in CLOs in accordance with regulatory requirements, 102.3m in our European liquid strategies and 55.6m in our Strategic Equity strategy.
The Sterling value of the portfolio decreased by 55.0m due to FX movements.
The portfolio is 43% Euro denominated, 30% US dollar denominated and 17% Sterling denominated.
The Group minimises the FX impact of non-Sterling assets through asset liability management and derivative transactions.
The balance sheet investment portfolio is weighted towards the higher returning asset classes as detailed below: As at As at 31 March 2018 31 March 2017 Return profile m % of total m % of total Corporate Investments 15-20% 1,257 66% 1,120 66% Capital Market Investments 5-10% 370 19% 333 19% Real Asset Investments c10% 111 6% 107 6% Secondary Investments 15-20% 161 9% 152 9% Total balance sheet portfolio 1,899 100% 1,712 100% In addition, 107.2m 2017: 89.7m of current assets are held on the balance sheet with the intention of being transferred to third party funds once their fundraising is complete.
The use of the balance sheet in this way enables our investment teams to continue to source attractive deals whilst a fund is being raised, and in turn facilitates the fundraising as potential investors can see the types of assets they will be investing in.
At 31 March 2018, these assets primarily related to our Capital Markets strategies.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 25 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Net investment returns Net investment returns of 240.1m 2017: 312.8m represents the total return generated from the balance sheet portfolio in the year, analysed as follows: 31 March 2017 Change 31 March 2018 Investment returns m m % Interest income 113.2 144.7 22% Other income 7.4 14.7 50% Capital gains 144.7 201.4 28% Investment income 265.3 360.8 26% Asset impairments 25.2 48.0 48% Net investment returns 240.1 312.8 23% Interest income was below the prior year due to the average interest bearing portfolio weighted more towards lower risk and lower return assets.
Cash interest income has decreased to 37% 2017: 38% of the total.
Capital gains were, as expected, lower than the prior financial year when the income statement benefitted from the recycling of 54.4m of capital gains from reserves on realisation of the underlying assets.
Excluding this one off item, capital gains were in line with the prior year as the valuation of the portfolio benefitted from the modest increase in global stock markets over the financial year and the improved performance of a number of portfolio companies.
Net realised capital gains in the period were 159.8m 2017: 235.3m, of which 154.7m 2017: 150.9m had previously been recognised as unrealised gains in the P&L with the remaining 5.1m 2017: 84.4m recognised in the current year, including the recycling from reserves.
Fair valuing the equity and warrants gave rise to a further 123.7m 2017: 112.5m of unrealised gains in the current period.
Of this, 139.6m 2017: 117.0m is recognised in the income statement and a 15.9m unrealised loss in reserves 2017: 4.5m.
During the period we took asset specific impairments against our weaker assets of 32.6m compared to 57.6m in the last financial year.
With write backs of 7.4m 2017: 9.6m, net asset impairments were 25.2m 2017: 48.0m.
As previously indicated, for the financial year beginning 1 April 2018 we will report our Investment Company income at a Net Investment Returns level, thereby removing asset specific impairments as a key performance indicator.
This will align our reporting with that of our third party clients and reflects the total performance of our investments.
Interest expense Interest expense of 56.6m was 2.7m higher than the prior year 2017: 53.9m, due to the increase in private placement debt borrowings.
Operating expenses Operating expenses of the IC amounted to 86.2m 2017: 77.3m, of which incentive scheme costs of 64.0m 2017: 54.2m were the largest component.
The 9.8m increase is due to higher bonuses payable as a direct result of realisations.
Other staff and administrative costs were 22.2m compared to 23.1m last year, a 0.9m decrease.
GROUP CASH FLOW AND DEBT The balance sheet remains strong, with 729.7m of available cash and debt facilities at 31 March 2018.
The movement in the Groups unutilised cash and debt facilities during the period is detailed as follows: m Headroom at 31 March 2017 970.8 Bank facilities matured 42.6 Movement in cash 242.3 Movement in drawn debt 97.9 FX 54.1 Headroom at 31 March 2018 729.7 Total drawn debt at 31 March 2018 was 1,021m compared to 1,119m at 31 March 2017, with unencumbered cash of 248m compared to 490m at 31 March 2017.
26 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2018 BUSINESS MARKETPLACE GROUP GROUP RESOURCES AND MODEL AND STRATEGY PERFORMANCE RISKS RELATIONSHIPS Finance AND operating review CONTINUED The movement in unencumbered cash in the year of 242.3m reflects that this has been a strong year for deployment for our funds and balance sheet, compared with the prior year which saw a high level of realisations.
Capital position Shareholders funds increased by 145.0m to 1,317.6m 31 March 2017: 1,172.6m, as the retained profits in the period were offset by the payment of the ordinary dividend.
Total debt to shareholders funds gearing as at 31 March 2018 decreased to 0.77x from 0.95x at 31 March 2017.
Access to permanent capital enables us to accelerate growth by investing in the development of new scalable strategies.
With a number of new ideas in the pipeline we expect gearing to increase during the new financial year.
