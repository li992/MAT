The dam is constructed on flat topography and the method of construction is the Modified Centreline methodology.
The dam is split into three sections with each section subdivided into smaller sections of 400 meters by 400 meters.
The walls of the dam and of the sections within the dam are constructed using engineered fill, including siliceous rock.
Due to this structure, if a breach occurs the leakage is unlikely to occur from all sections at the same time.
This means that the amount of possible damage should be limited.
