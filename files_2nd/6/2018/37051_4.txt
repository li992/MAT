Investec plc silo excluding Investec Limited annual financial statements 2018 21 Financial review Financial review continued continued An overview of the principal risks relating to our operations The most material and significant risks we face, which the board and senior management believe could have an impact on our operations, financial performance, viability and prospects are summarised briefly below with further details provided in section three of this annual report.
The board, through its various sub-committees, has performed a robust assessment of these principal risks.
For additional information pertaining to the management and monitoring of these principal risks, see the references provided.
Regular reporting of these risks is madeto senior management, the executives and the board at the group risk and capital committee GRCC and board risk and capital committee BRCC.
The groups board approved risk appetite framework is provided on page 49.
The board recognises that, even with sound appetite and judgement, extreme events can happen which are completely outside of the boards control.
It is however, necessary to assess these events and their impact and how they may be mitigated by considering the risk appetite framework if necessary.
It is policy to regularly carry out multiple stress testing scenarios which in theory test extreme, but plausible events and from that assess and plan what can be done to mitigate the potential outcome.

income and high net worth individuals, established corporates, and medium-sized enterprises.
Our risk appetite continues to favour lower risk, income-based lending, with exposures well collateralised and credit risk taken over a short to medium term.
Investec has a limited appetite for unsecured debt, thus the credit risk mitigation technique most commonly used is the taking of collateral, with a strong preference for tangible assets.
Portfolio reviews including stress testing analyses are undertaken on all material businesses, where the portfolios are analysed to assess any migration in portfolio quality, highlight any vulnerabilities, identify portfolio concentrations and make appropriate recommendations, such as a reduction in risk appetite limits or specific exposures.
