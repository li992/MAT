Of the total tax charge of 3.9m, approximately 2.8m relates to the UK and 1.1m relates to the Groups overseas operations.
Taxes paid in the period of 4.5m were primarily due to payments on account for the wider Equiniti UK Group companies.
During the year, amounts totalling 2.0m were received relating to repayments of overpaid 2016 taxes and payable R&D expenditure credits.

IFRS 15 IFRS 15 became effective from periods commencing 1 January 2018 and we have adopted it on a fully retrospective basis.
IFRS 15 gives rise to changes in the timing of revenue and cost recognition but will not impact upon the lifetime revenue and profitability of contracts, the cash flows of contracts and does not affect the majority of the Groups revenue streams.
The main changes from the adoption of IFRS 15 are on its fixed period software contracts and transition periods of multi-period contracts, in particular: Revenue recognised from sales of fixed term rights to use software licences will be recognised at a point in time, rather than over the licence term when there is nothing else to deliver.
In some multi-period pensions administration contracts, there is a transition phase where significant costs are incurred in transitioning customers from a previous supplier to Equiniti.
Under previous accounting, revenue would be recognised in line with the cost and effort to provide these transitional services.
Under IFRS 15, transition activities are not a separate performance obligation, and therefore these costs and associated revenue are spread over the life of the contract.
