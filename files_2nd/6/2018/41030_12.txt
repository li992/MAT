The Directors have concluded that the going concern basis remains appropriate.
Risks and uncertainties The directors have reconsidered the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group and these remain largely unchanged from those reported in the Annual Report and Accounts 2017.
The risk of a wider macro-economic effect as a result of the UK leaving the EU, including foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, is addressed by the Groups existing economic climate risk.
The risks relating to change have been updated to reflect the potential impact of the proposed demerger of Costa.
Going forward any potential areas of risk will be closely monitored and evaluated.
