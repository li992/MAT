FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL OVERVIEW 2018 CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT Turnover declined by 5.1% to 51.0 billion including an unfavourable currency impact of 6.7% 2017: 2.1% unfavourable currency impact mainly due to weakening of currencies in key emerging markets such as Brazil, Argentina and India.
Underlying sales growth was 2.9% 2017: 3.1%, with a positive contribution from all divisions.
Underlying volume growth was 1.9% 2017: 0.8% and underlying price growth was 0.9% 2017: 2.3%.
The net impact of acquisitions and disposals was a reduction in turnover of 1.0% 2017: 0.9% increase with the impact of recent acquisitions such as Carver Korea and Quala outweighed by the disposal of the spreads businesses.
Emerging markets contributed 58% of total turnover 2017: 58% with underlying sales growth of 4.6% 2017: 5.9% coming from price growth of 1.7% and volume growth of 2.8%.
Developed markets underlying sales growth was 0.5% coming from volume growth of 0.7% slightly offset by price decline of 0.2%.
Underlying operating margin improved by 0.9 percentage points to 18.4%.
Gross margin improved by 0.5 percentage points driven by marginaccretive innovations and continued strong delivery from our 5-S savings programmes.
As a percentage of turnover, overheads and brand and marketing investment were down by 0.3 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points respectively as a result of productivity gains from zero-based budgeting.
Operating profit was up 41.5% to 12.5 billion 2017: 8.9 billion as a result of 3,176 million from non-underlying items.
Non-underlying items within operating profit comprised a gain on spreads disposal of 4,331 million, a credit from the early settlement of contingent consideration related to the Blueair acquisition of 277 million, partially offset by restructuring costs of 914 million, acquisition and disposal related costs of 201 million and impairment and one-off items of 317 million.

The cost of financing net borrowings was 57 million higher than 2017.
The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net debt which was partially offset by lower interest rates and a prior year one-off in Brazil relating to the interest element of an indirect tax amnesty programme.
The average interest rate on net debt reduced to 2.2% from 2.7% in 2017.
The pensions financing charge was 25 million, down from 96 million in 2017 reflecting a lower pension deficit at the beginning of 2018.
A monetary gain of 122 million was recorded following adoption of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies in Argentina see note 1 from 1 July 2018.
The effective tax rate was 21.1% compared with 20.8% in the prior year.
In both years the rate was low relative to longer term norms, due to the significant impact on tax of the disposals of our spreads businesses in 2018 and US tax reform in 2017.
Net profit from joint ventures and associates was up 19% at 185 million, with the increase coming mainly from a gain on disposal of the spreads business of the Portuguese joint venture.
Other income from non-current investments was 22 million versus 18 million in the prior year.
Diluted earnings per share were up 62.0% at 3.48.
The increase was mainly driven by the 4,331 million gain on disposal for the spreads businesses, improvement in operating margin and the impact of the share buyback programmes.

UNDERLYING SALES GROWTH Underlying Sales Growth USG refers to the increase in turnover NON-GAAP MEASURES for the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from Certain discussions and analyses set out in this Annual Report acquisitions, disposals and changes in currency.

Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries performance, and our ability to retire debt and invest in new business where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such opportunities.
Our management uses these financial measures, turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in network than the acquisition itself.
Also excluded is the impact of price evaluating our operating performance and value creation.

Consequently, price growth in Venezuela OF NON-GAAP MEASURES has been excluded from USG since Q4 2017.
The second is Argentina, Unilever uses constant rate and underlying measures primarily for which from Q3 2018 has been accounted for in accordance with IAS internal performance analysis and targeting purposes.
We present 29, and thus from Q3 2018 Argentina price growth is excluded from certain items, percentages and movements, using constant exchange USG.
The adjustment made at Group level as a result of these two rates, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exclusions was a reduction in price growth of 32.4% for the year.
We calculate constant currency values by translating treatment for both countries will be kept under regular review.
both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using Prior to Q3 2018 USG only excluded the impact of price changes in the prior period average exchange rates into euro, except for countries countries where consumer price inflation has escalated to extreme where the impact of consumer price inflation rates has escalated to levels of 1,000% or more.
However, given the need to account for our extreme levels.
In these countries, the local currency amounts before Argentinian business in accordance with IAS 29, we have now also the application of IAS 29 are translated into euros using the period excluded price changes in countries that need to be accounted for in closing exchange rate.
Prior to Q3 2018 there were no countries that were accounted for under IAS 29, so no restatements are necessary.
