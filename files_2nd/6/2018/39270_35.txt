We continue to monitor the potential implications of geopolitical change on our trading and financing environment and in relation to Brexit we are taking short-term measures to ensure we have access to adequate stock and equipment in both the UK and Europe in Q2 of 2019.
We remain of the view that the defensive nature of our core categories, combined with the geographic location and spread of our operations, place us in a relatively strong position to mitigate such risks going forward and to take advantage of any potential opportunities that the changes may bring.
