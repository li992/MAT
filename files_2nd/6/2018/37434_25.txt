Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 117 Financial Statements 1 Basis of preparation Legal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom UK, operates in three broad business areas of investing and annuities, investment management and insurance through its subsidiaries and associates in the UK, the United States and other countries throughout the world.
i Significant accounting policies The group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the  Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The group financial statements also comply with interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the European Union.
The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period.
Theaccounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
Accounting policies that relate specifically toa balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis.
Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.
ii New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the group The group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, is the new revenue recognition reporting standard, which became effective from 1 January2018.
IFRS 15 has replaced all of the previous revenue standards and interpretations in IFRS, in particular IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 .
The standard introduces a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers, the core principle of which is that an entitywill recognise revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods orservices to a customer in the reporting period.
The standard also specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.
The group has adopted IFRS 15 using the full retrospective method.
Revenue arising from insurance contracts, financial instruments and leases isout of scope of the standard.
There are two categories of revenue in the groups Consolidated Income Statement that remain in scope: i Fees from fund management and investment contracts: and ii Components of the account Other operational income.
There has been no material impact on the groups consolidated financial statements from the implementation of IFRS 15 and therefore the groupsfinancial statements have not been restated.
Please refer to Note 28 for details on accounting policies for these revenue streams.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial Instruments which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
The standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, it includes new principles around classification and measurement of financial instruments, introduces an impairment model based on expected credit losses replacing the current model based on incurred losses and new requirements on hedge accounting.
The IASB subsequently issued Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts which allows entities which meet certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 until adoption of IFRS 17 or 1 January 2021, whichever is the earlier.
In November 2018 the IASB agreed to issue an exposure draft proposing to extend the deferral by one year to 1 January 2022, to align with the proposed delay in the adoption date of IFRS 17.
For an insurer to apply this deferral: i Total liabilities related to insurance must exceed 90% of total liabilities: or ii Total liabilities related to insurance are greater than 80% of total liabilities but less than 90% of total liabilities so long as the insurer does not engage in significant activity unconnected to insurance.
Total liabilities connected to insurance within the group at the initial assessment date 31 December 2015 were 99% of total liabilities.
The group therefore qualifies for the deferral of IFRS 9 and is making use of this option.
The group is required to retest its eligibility for deferral of IFRS 9, if, and only if, there is a significant change in business activities in the year.
There have been no indicators of such a change in 2018 and therefore the group continues to apply the deferral.
The sale of the Mature Savings business, announced in 2017, is not expected to change this conclusion.
All entities within the group whose activities are not primarily insurance related and which prepare financial statements on an IFRS basis including UK entities qualifying for disclosure exemptions under FRS 101, Reduced Disclosure Framework have implemented IFRS 9 in 2018.
The financial statements of these entities will be made available through Companies House through 2019.
118 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Primary statements and performance As required by the amendments, the disclosures below are presented in order to provide users of the financial statements with information whichallows them to compare financial assets with those of entities applying IFRS 9.
The impact of IFRS 9 on the groups consolidated financial statements will depend on the interaction of the asset classification and measurement with the insurance contract measurement at the date oftransition, particularly for liabilities which are measured using locked-in discount rates.
i Fair value of financial assets with contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments ofprincipal andinterest on the principal amount outstanding i. e. passing the SPPI test : As at 31 December 2018 Financial assets All other passing financial 1,2 3 the SPPI test assets m m Equity securities 177,566 Debt securities 1,766 252,686 Accrued interest 12 1,623 Derivative assets 10,065 Loans at fair value 9,206 Total financial investments at fair value 1,778 451,146 Loans at amortised cost 456 Reinsurance receivables 24 Insurance and intermediaries receivables 205 Other financial assets 2,860 4 Total fair value of financial assets 5,323 451,146 1.
Financial assets classified as held for trading or that are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis do not require an SPPI test to be performed.
These assets are reported in Other financial assets.
For financial assets which pass the SPPI test held at 31 December 2018 there was a change in the fair value in the year of 112 m. 3.
For all other financial assets held at 31 December 2018 there was a change in the fair value in the year of 17,918 m. 4.
Financial assets excludes cash and cash equivalents and receivables under finance leases.
ii Credit risk information of financial assets passing the SPPI test: As at 31 December 2018 1 2 AAA AA A BBB BB or below Other Total m m m m m m m Debt securities 361 141 707 510 47 1,766 Accrued interest 2 1 4 5 12 Total financial investments at fair value 363 142 711 515 47 1,778 Loans at amortised cost 219 1 135 101 456 Reinsurance receivables 24 24 Insurance and intermediaries receivables 205 205 Other financial assets 12 14 381 17 2 2,434 2,860 Total carrying value of financial assets 375 375 1,093 667 49 2,764 5,323 3 passing the SPPI test 1.
Financial assets classified as BB or below are considered to be lower than investment grade, and therefore are not deemed to have low credit risk under IFRS 9.
The fair value of these assets approximates to their carrying value.
Other financial assets are made up of unrated and short term receivables for which a formal credit rating is not assigned.
The fair value of financial assets inthiscategorythat are not deemed to have low credit risk as at 31 December 2018 is 106m.
Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 119 Financial Statements 1 Basis of preparation continued ii New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the group continued Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property The amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development, into or out of investment property.
The amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.
A mere change in managements intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use.
These amendments do not have any impact on the groups consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction: the classification of a share-based payment transaction with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations: and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash-settled to equity-settled.
On adoption, entities are required to apply the amendments without restating prior periods, but retrospective application is permitted if elected for all three amendments and other criteria are met.
The group already accounts for netsettlement features as equity-settled and therefore there is no impact on the groups consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Clarification that measuring investees at fair value through profit or loss is an  choice The amendments clarify that an entity that is a venture capital organisation, or other qualifying entity, may elect, at initial recognition on an  basis, to measure its investments in associates and joint ventures at fair value through profit or loss.
If an entity, that is not itself an investment entity, has an interest in an associate or joint venture that is an investment entity, the entity may, when applying the equity method, elect to retain the fair value measurement applied by that investment entity associate or joint venture to the investment entity associates or joint ventures interests in subsidiaries.
This election is made separately for each investment in an associate or joint venture, at the later of the date on which: a the investment in an associate or joint venture is initially recognised: b the associate or joint venture becomes an investment entity: and c the investment in an associate or joint venture first becomes a parent.
IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advanced Consideration The interpretation clarifies that when applying IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, to currency transactions involving anadvance payment or receipt, the transaction date for translating recognised amounts is the date on which the entity initially recognises the prepayment asset or the deferred income liability.
This Interpretation does not have any impact on the groups consolidated financial statements.
iii Changes in accounting policy LGIA Legal & General Insurance America Term Assurance During the year, the group has changed its accounting policy for term assurance liabilities on business transacted by its US subsidiaries, which waspreviously based on recognised actuarial methods reflecting US GAAP.
From 1 January 2018, the group has calculated such liabilities on the basis ofcurrent information using the gross premium valuation method, which is in line with how similar products are accounted for in other parts ofthebusiness.
The group believes the new policy is preferable as it more closely aligns the accounting for this business with that of business written in the UK, andtherefore results in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information about the impact of term assurance business onthe groups financial position, financial performance or cash flows, in line with IFRS requirements.
This represents a voluntary change in accounting policy and has been applied retrospectively, with prior year retained earnings adjusted accordingly.
The principal impact of the change on the prior year consolidated financial statements is in the non-participating insurance contract liabilities and indeferred acquisition costs, which have been derecognised, and the associated cash flows now recognised within the insurance contract liabilitycalculation.
The group reported an initial best estimate of the impact of this change in accounting policy as part of its 2018 half year report.
During the second half of 2018 we have continued to refine the calculation of the retrospective impact based on enhanced historic information.
The final impact on each line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2017 is shown in the table below: As reported at As restated at 31 December 2017 Adjustments 31 December 2017 m m m Deferred acquisition costs 1,507 1,367 140 Reinsurers share of contract liabilities 5,703 158 5,545 Non-participating insurance contract liabilities 62,318 1,010 61,308 Overseas deferred tax liability 337 116 221 Other liabilities 563 72 491 Retained earnings 6,578 327 6,251 As a consequence of the change highlighted above, the group has reclassified as at 1 January 2017 164m of financial investments backing termassurance business from designated as available-for-sale to designated as fair value through profit or loss.
This represents a further change inaccounting policy permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.
120 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Primary statements and performance UK Whole of Life and Term Assurance Mortality Assumptions During the year, the group changed its accounting policy for UK whole of life and term assurance mortality improvers.
This change has arisen following the change in the regulatory regime to Solvency II.
The old regime only allowed improvers to be added where reserves would be increased, in line with INSPRU 1.2.
Under the new policy mortality improvement assumptions can now be applied consistently across all types of mortality business.
The change covers all UK whole of life and term assurance products, and results in the group no longer needing to comply with INSPRU.
The group believes that the new policy better reflects the risks that the business is exposed to, providing more reliable and relevant information to users of the financial statements.
This represents a voluntary change in accounting policy.
However, because the impact of this change on prior period is considered insignificant, thegroup has applied the change prospectively.
iv Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards which are not yet effective Certain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 or later periods and which the group has not adopted early, as disclosed below.
IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16, Leases, issued in January 2016, is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, and replaces all existing lease requirements and guidance under IFRS, including IAS 17, Leases, IFRIC 4, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, SIC-15, Operating Leases Incentives and SIC-27, Evaluating the Substance of Transactions in the Legal Form of a Lease.
IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for virtually all lease contracts, bringing many commitments in relation to operating leases as currently defined in IAS 17 onto the balance sheet.
The impact of the standard on lessor accounting is significantly smaller with the provisions remaining closely aligned to those in IAS 17, although the IASB have issued updated guidance on the definition of lease modifications and sub-lease arrangements.
The group plans to adopt IFRS 16 by using the modified retrospective approach, and not restate comparative financial information.
At the date of theinitial application the group will recognise a lease liability and a right-of-use asset of an equal amount adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the group Consolidated Balance Sheet immediately before the date of initial application, as allowed by the standard.
Additionally the group plans to elect to apply the standard to contracts that were previously assessed asleases applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
On transition, the group will therefore not apply the standard to contracts that were not previously identified ascontaining a lease applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
The group is planning to elect to use the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease contracts for which the lease terms ends within 12 months as of the date of initial application, and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value.
During 2018, a detailed impact assessment was performed, and it is expected that on transition the impact on the group Consolidated Balance Sheet will not be material.
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 subject to EU endorsement.
In November 2018 the IASB agreed to issue an exposure draft proposing a one year delay in the adoption date which, if approved would delay the date of application to 1 January 2022.
The standard will be applied retrospectively, subject to the transitional options provided for inthe standard, and provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their measurement, income statement presentation and disclosure.
The group has mobilised a project to assess the financial and operational implications of the standard, and work will continue throughout 2019 to ensure technical compliance and to develop the required system capability to implement the standard.
IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments was issued in June 2017 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January2019.
The Interpretation clarifies the application of recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12, Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
The group does not expect the impact to be significant.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle These improvements were issued in December 2017 and consist of minor amendments affecting IFRS 3 Business combinations, IFRS 11, Joint arrangements, IAS 12, Income taxes and IAS 23, Borrowing costs.
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits These amendments were issued in February 2018 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
The amendments require entities to use updated assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder ofthe period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement: they also clarify how the requirements for accounting for a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement affect the asset ceiling requirements.
The impact of these amendments on the group will depend on the future occurrence of plan amendments, curtailments or settlements.
Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures These amendments, titled Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures were issued in October 2017 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
The amendments clarify the accounting for long-term interests in an associate orjoint venture, which in substance form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture, but to which equity accounting is not applied.

v Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, material adjustments could be made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements associated with and the application of significant accounting policies.
The significant accounting issues considered by the Audit Committee are included within the Audit Committee Report on page 66.
The major areas of critical accounting judgement on policy application are considered below: Insurance and investment contract liabilities Notes 20 and 21 : Product classification and the assessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the group in determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract.
Contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the group are classified as insurance contracts.
Contracts that transfer financial risk e. g. change in interest rate or security price to the group but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.
Judgement is required in order to assess the significance of the transfer of insurance risk within a contract.
This assessment is based on whether the occurrence of an insured event could cause the group to make significant additional payments, i. e. if the occurrence of the event causes significantly higher cash out flows for the group than its non-occurrence.
Certain contracts, which are both insurance and investment, contain discretionary participating features representing the contractual right to receiveadditional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits under certain conditions, being: that the additional benefits are a significant portion of the total contractual benefits: the amount and timing of the additional benefits are at the discretion of the group: and that the additional benefits are contractually dependent upon the performance of a company, fund or specified pool of assets.
Insurance contracts and investment contracts with such discretionary participation features are accounted for under IFRS 4, while investment contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments under IAS 39.
Judgement is therefore required in order to establish whether any additional benefits in an insurance or investment contract meet the above requirements for being considered discretionary participation features.
Consolidation Notes 42-44 : Assessment of whether the group controls underlying entities and should therefore consolidate them.
The assessment takes account of various criteria, including decision making ability, equity holding and the rights to a variable return from the entity.
Control arises when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
For operating entities this generally accompanies a shareholding of 50% or more in the entity.
Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital structured entities, are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature ofits relevant activities, voting rights including potential voting rights and substantive and protective rights.
The group invests in various fund and unit trust entities where it also acts as the asset manager to those entities.
In these instances, in determining whether the group controls the entities, the assessment focuses on the aggregate economic interests of the group direct interest and expected management fees and on whether the group acts as a principal or agent.
This includes an assessment of the removal rights of other investors theirpractical ability to allow the group not to control the fund.
Additionally, holdings in such investments can fluctuate on a daily basis according tothe participation of the group and other investors in them.
As a result, in determining control, we look at the trend of ownership over a longer period rather than at a point in time to mitigate the impact of daily fluctuations which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the groups involvement.
This is performed in line with the following principles: where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the groups ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50%, the group is judged to have control over the entity: where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the groups ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 50%, the facts andcircumstances of the groups involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from theentity, in forming a judgement as to whether the group has control over the entity: and where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the groups ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the group is judged tonot have control over the entity, but again the facts and circumstances of the groups involvement in the entity are considered.
122 Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Financial Statements Primary statements and performance The following sets out information about the critical accounting assumptions made by the group about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts ofassets and liabilities within the next financial year: Valuation of insurance and investment contract liabilities Notes 18-21 Determination of longevity, mortality and morbidity assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities.
The assumptions for therate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the groups internal experience and judgements about how experience may vary inthefuture.
This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data.
Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit default ofthebacking assets.
These assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic internal data.
Valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property Note 11 Determination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets, and investment property involves judgements to model valuations, through the incorporation of both observable and unobservable market inputs, which include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible valuations for financial assets.
Defined benefit pension plan Note 23 Determination of pension plan assumptions including mortality, discount rates and inflation.
These assumptions have been set in accordance withthe requirements of IAS 19 and include consistent judgements with those in setting the annuity liabilities where possible.
Note 23 includes asensitivity analysis to alternative assumptions.
vi Consolidation principles Subsidiary undertakings The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the group directly or indirectly has control i. e. when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee Note 42.
Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
Puttable instruments held by external parties in consolidated investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Associates and joint ventures The group has interests in associates and joint ventures Note 43 which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities.
In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, Investments in associates, these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Associates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost.
The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reflect the groups share of total comprehensive income after the date of the acquisition.
Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 123 Financial Statements 1 Basis of preparation continued vii Product classification The groups products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts participating and non-participating or investment contracts participating and non-participating.
The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 20 and 21 respectively.
The following table summarises the classification of the groups significant types of non-participating insurance and investment contracts as described in Note 6 for each applicable reportable segment.
All of the groups participating business is classified as held for sale, and hence no additional information inrelation to these products has been provided.
Reportable segment Non-participating insurance contracts Non-participating investment contracts LGR Pension risk transfers Lifetime mortgages Individual annuities Fixed term individual annuities Longevity insurance LGI UK Retail protection UK Group protection US protection US Universal life US Individual annuities General Insurance Household Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU Pet LGIM Workplace savings Institutional pension Segregated investment management mandates Collective investment schemes viii Fiduciary activities Assets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements.
Where the group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.
ix Foreign exchange and exchange rates Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
The functional currency of the groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The assets and liabilities of all of the groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the groups presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges.
The closing exchange rates at 31 December 2018 were 1.28 United States dollar and 1.11 euro 31 December 2017: 1.35 United States dollar and 1.13 euro.
The average exchange rates for the year ended 31 December 2018 were 1.34 United States dollar and 1.13 euro 31 December 2017: 1.29 United States dollar and 1.14 euro.

Operating profit therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the groups insurance businesses and shareholder funds, except for LGCs trading businesses which reflects the IFRS profit before tax and LGIA non-term business which excludes unrealised investment returns to align with the liability measurement under US GAAP.
Variances between actual and smoothed investment return assumptions are reported below operating profit, which include any differences between investment return on actual assets and the long-term asset mix.
Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the period, such as merger and acquisition, and start-up costs, are also excluded from operating profit.

Legal & General Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 129 Financial Statements 5 Earnings per share Earnings per share is a measure of the portion of the groups profit allocated to each outstanding share.
It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the company, derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.
