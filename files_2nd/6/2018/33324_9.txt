Financial Review A strong set of results with both top and bottom line growth The following is based on results for the 52 weeks ended 27 January 2018.
Comparatives, unless otherwise stated, are for the 52 weeks ended 28 January 2017.
Overview We measure performance across a range of financial and non-financial measures and are pleased to report significant progress across a broad range of these metrics: Revenue up 8.0% to 277.7m Gross margin up 20bps to 47.1% Profit before tax up 4.2% to 44.9m Profit before tax and exceptional items up 4.0% to 44.1m Operating margin before exceptional items down 60bps to 16.2% Operating margin down 50bps to 16.5% Net cash from operating activities down 6.6m to 42.2m Net cash balance up 5.3m to 15.0m Basic earnings per share before exceptionals EPS up 3.4% to 31.30p Basic earnings per share EPS up 4.8% to 32.25p Proposed final dividend of 11.84p per share 2017: 10.87p to give a proposed total dividend for the year of 15.55p per share, an increase of 8.0% over the prior year.
This is a good set of results in a challenging environment that reflects the benefits of strong brands, an agile organisation and a talented team.
The combined benefit of core brand revenue growth, exciting innovation and supply chain cost management have enabled both top and bottom line gains and gross margin improvement.
We have made significant investment in our brands, new products, marketing and people, all of which reinforce our confidence that the business can deliver future value creation.
Our revenue growth was broad-based, driven by innovation underpinned by both core brand distribution gains and the achievement of some price increases following a period of category price deflation.
The year was not without challenge.
The level of change and uncertainty from regulation, customer consolidation and consumer trends has been considerable, and has necessitated significant management focus.
Our strong volume growth, driven in part by higher levels of innovation, put pressure on our supply chain in the first half of the year and led to some supply disruption, particularly impacting our export sales.
These temporary supply issues were quickly resolved and we enter 2018 19 with confidence and positive momentum.
28 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts Segmental performance We have successfully grown market share through price and distribution gains on our core portfolio with additional support from our new products initially launched in 2016.
Our core carbonates business has performed well, with both our IRN-BRU and Rubicon brands in growth.
IRN-BRU XTRA has continued to establish itself as a key component of the IRN-BRU range and it is therefore especially pleasing to report that regular IRN-BRU grew in both volume and value terms despite an element of cannibalisation from XTRA.
The overall IRN-BRU brand was up 5.7% in volume and 8.0% in revenue.
Rubicon Spring continues to grow at pace, building distribution and adding new formats.
Barr Flavours, KA, Sun Exotic and OMJ!
have all delivered volume growth and, with the exception of Barr Flavours, have all achieved value growth.
The Rockstar brand had a particularly strong year delivering double digit volume gains while successfully maintaining pricing, through a combination of new product introduction and distribution successes, in the face of strong price competition.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 29 Financial Review continued Segmental performance continued Our stills and water business performed well, despite some supply driven constraints for Snapple in the earlier part of the year, in what was a mixed market environment, where fruit drinks in particular were challenged.
While overall revenue was down 2.3%, our continued focus on value improved margins by 270bps.
After several years of double digit revenue growth, our International business grew revenue by 3.8% in the year ended January 2018, as a result of the continued export drive by the Funkin business, tempered by complexities created by our reformulation programme and some local distributor changes.
Our Funkin business reported within our Other segment continues to perform very strongly.
With sales growth of 25%, the business is now more than 50% bigger than when we acquired it in 2015.
The key on-trade business has grown volume and margins in each of its product segments syrups, mixers and pures benefiting from continued cocktail growth.
Our drive into take-home with the Funkin brand has commenced with the launch of the shaker pack in both supermarkets and a limited number of impulse outlets.
We expect to drive further distribution growth across 2018.
As previously disclosed, and following the achievement of certain post-acquisition targets, a 4.5m cash earn-out, which was accrued at the time of the acquisition, was paid to the previous Funkin shareholders during the financial year.
Margins Disciplined revenue management has delivered gross margin gains despite rising input costs.
Sterling weakness led to higher input costs across a number of core commodities in the period.
A robust procurement strategy combined with lower overall sugar costs alongside some operational improvements have led to a gross margin improvement of 20bps at 47.1%.
We remain focused on risk mitigation through our procurement, commodity and treasury policies.
Operating margin before exceptional items was down 60bps to 16.2% reported operating margin was down 50bps to 16.5% despite the benefits of our reorganisation programme coming through.
This reflects the decision to invest heavily behind our already successful innovation launches and to support the growth of our core brands in a year of significant reformulation activity.
In addition, we have continued to refresh and refocus talent and resources to build our capabilities in growth areas including out of home consumption, e-commerce and Funkin.
The 4.0% increase to 44.1m in profit before tax and exceptional items, and our strong market share gains, give us confidence that this committed approach to growth will provide a robust platform for the future and sustainable value creation for shareholders.
Interest Net finance charges, totalling 1.0m, largely comprised finance costs associated with the pension deficit.
Debt facility charges remain minimal, reflecting our net cash position which has continued to improve this year.
The constituent elements of the interest charge comprised: 2017 18 2016 17 m m Finance income Finance costs 0.3 0.2 Interest related to Group borrowings 0.3 0.2 Finance costs related to pension 0.7 0.5 Net finance costs 1.0 0.7 Taxation Excluding the exceptional items, the tax charge for the year of 8.0m is 0.6m higher than the corresponding prior year charge, due to increased profits subject to tax.
The effective tax rate of 17.2% 2017: 17.4% after exceptional items has decreased by 20bps from the prior year.
This primarily reflects the impact of the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% during the year.
Balance sheet, cash flow and net debt The Groups balance sheet continues to strengthen, with net asset growth of 21.7m to 201.9m across the financial year.
This represents a combination of a 12.2m reduction in the pension deficit under IAS 19, our continued investment in our asset base, some phasing impacts within working capital and the continued profitable and cash generative growth of the business.
The key balance sheet highlights can be summarised as: Non-current assets increased slightly to 198.8m up 3.4m after several years of sustained investment in assets and infrastructure.
Our major capital programme in 2018 was the installation of a new flexible PET line at our Milton Keynes facility.
In addition to delivering key capacity to support our innovation agenda, the new line provides us with production risk mitigation and logistical savings from dual site PET production capability.
30 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts Trade and other receivables at 56.6m 2016 17: 51.4m were up 5.2m 10.1%.
The increase is driven both by the overall growth in sales and by the impact of our reformulation programme.
The challenging economic environment has put some customers under pressure and, while the aging profile of trade debt has improved, we have had only minimal impact from bad debt in the period.
We currently have selective trade insurance in place and are monitoring commercial activity closely.
ROCE improved marginally from 20.2% in 2016 17 to 20.4% in 2017 18 as profit delivery was partially offset by working capital phasing and the reduced IAS 19 pension deficit.
Cash flow The improved net cash position of 15.0m 2017: 9.7m highlights the strong cash generative nature of our business.
It has been delivered in addition to the payment of the Funkin earn-out 4.5m and the commencement of the share repurchase programme 8.2m.
We are committed to efficient, sustainable and flexible production at the highest quality standards and have continued to invest behind our infrastructure in support of this goal.
Our major expenditure in the year has been on our newly commissioned 10m PET bottling line at Milton Keynes and the commencement of a replacement upgrade to our syrup room in Cumbernauld.
Capital expenditure in 2018 19 is anticipated to be at a slightly higher level than in 2017 18, primarily driven by phasing of the last payment on the new PET line, the continuation of the syrup room upgrade and our ongoing maintenance and optimisation programmes.
We renegotiated our banking facilities during the year to provide a broader base of relationship banks and higher facility headroom.
A strong balance sheet and accessibility to cost-effective and flexible debt facilities provide us with optionality and we are confident that we have the ability and the funding to take advantage of any opportunities that we may identify in the future.
We believe that EBITDA and Free Cash Flow offer a further meaningful analysis of the underlying performance of the Group.
EBITDA increased to 53.3m up 3.1%, representing an EBITDA margin of 19.2% and delivering a strong cash generating performance, with EBITDA to free cash flow conversion of 74.9%.
Free cash flow, at 39.9m, was 3.3m below last year, a creditable performance as the prior year recognised a significant one-off phasing benefit within payables of 7.2m.
2017 18 2016 17 Free cash flow statement m m Operating profit before exceptional items 45.1 43.1 Depreciation and amortisation 8.2 8.6 EBITDA 53.3 51.7 Increase in inventories 1.0 1.7 Increase decrease in receivables 5.2 1.3 Increase in payables 4.4 10.2 Movement in pension liability 2.1 2.2 Share-based payment costs 1.0 0.9 Exceptional cash items 2.2 4.2 Net operating cash flow 52.6 56.0 Net interest 0.1 0.2 Taxation 6.6 7.2 Cash flow from operations after interest 45.9 48.6 Maintenance capex 6.4 5.5 Capex proceeds 0.4 0.1 Free cash flow 39.9 43.2 Expansionary capex 4.4 6.9 Dividends 16.9 15.6 Finance lease payments 0.1 Acquisition of subsidiary 4.5 Net purchases sales of shares by employee benefit trusts 0.3 0.3 Repurchase of own shares 8.2 Loans repaid incl arrangement fees 0.2 17.5 Cash flow from financing 34.6 39.7 Net increase in cash 5.3 3.5 Opening cash and cash equivalents 9.7 6.2 Closing cash and cash equivalents 15.0 9.7 Closing net cash 15.0 9.7 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 31 Financial Review continued Cash flow continued Strong cash generation and our robust balance sheet have enabled the Group to return significant cash to shareholders in the form of 16.9m of dividends and also supported the repurchase of 8.2m of shares.
Shares with a net value of 0.3m were purchased on behalf of various employee benefit trusts to satisfy the ongoing requirements of the Groups employee share schemes.
Given the current net cash position, the relatively benign outlook for short-term interest rates and the expectation of continued strong free cash generation, no interest rate hedging activity has taken place during the year.
Exceptional items An exceptional operating credit of 0.8m has been recorded in the year ended 27 January 2018 2016 17: 0.7m.
As a result of receiving a significant offer, we sold our Walthamstow depot during the year and are undertaking a managed exit of the site.
The size and one-off nature of the gain on sale of the site makes it appropriate that it is taken as an exceptional item.
During the year the business has undertaken significant technical development activity to create and commercialise new reduced sugar products across our portfolio.
While R&D is a normal part of our business, the breadth and scale of this activity is unprecedented and therefore it is appropriate that the related costs be recognised as exceptional items for reporting purposes.
We believe that this treatment of these gains and costs permits a more meaningful analysis of the underlying performance of the Group.
A net credit of 0.8m pre-tax 1.1m post tax for exceptional items included: Gain on sale of distribution site 2.5 m Reformulation programme 1.4m Reorganisation and capability refresh programme 0.3m Net exceptional credit 0.8 m In the prior year an exceptional credit of 0.7m 0.6m post tax was recognised, comprising primarily the net impact of the closure to future accrual of our defined benefit pension scheme and the cost of our Company-wide reorganisation and talent refresh programme.
UK referendum and exit from the European Union While the impact of Brexit to date remains unclear, we have conducted several planning workshops to consider and prepare for possible outcomes.
Given the largely UK focus of our commercial activities, our current assessment is that the specific issue of the UKs future exit from the European Union will not have a significant impact on our business other than through its effects on foreign exchange and increased administration documentation.
The current value of sterling has created inflationary pressure on our commodity cost base, primarily euro or US dollar denominated.
We have a well developed risk management framework in place at both functional and corporate levels of the business and we will continue to closely monitor political and commercial developments and react accordingly to these.
Share repurchase programme The Board approved a share repurchase programme of up to 30m in March 2017, as part of the Groups approach to capital allocation and under the authority to repurchase up to 10% of its own shares granted at the AGM in May 2017.
This programme commenced in May 2017 and remains on schedule to complete by May 2019.
During the year ended 27 January 2018 the Company purchased 1.3m shares at a total cost of 8.2m.
The repurchase activity has continued since the year end.
Between the balance sheet date and the date of approval of the financial statements 27 March 2018, a further 744,135 shares have been repurchased at a cost of 4.8m.
Shareholders at the forthcoming AGM in May 2018 will be requested to approve the renewal of the authority for the Board to repurchase up to 10% of the Companys own shares to enable the repurchase programme to continue to its conclusion.
Pensions The Group continues to operate two pension plans, the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Pension Scheme and the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a defined benefit scheme based on final salary, which also includes a defined contribution section for pension provision to senior managers.
The defined benefit scheme the scheme has been closed to new entrants since 5 April 2002 and to new executive entrants since 14 August 2003 and closed to future accrual for members in May 2016.
Existing and new employees have been invited to join the Company-wide defined contribution scheme.
32 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Accounts The scheme triennial actuarial valuation as at April 2017 was approved by the Trustees on 8 March 2018.
This valuation identified a 4.8m deficit based on an agreed range of demographic and financial assumptions.
Since the year end, the Company and pension trustees have agreed a funding programme that would eliminate this deficit within 4 years.
This plan has been submitted to the Pension Regulator.
On an IAS 19 valuation basis the deficit reduced from 27.4m at the end of 2016 17 to 15.2m at the balance sheet date.
The deficit reduction in the current financial year is primarily as a result of a higher net discount rate used to value the schemes liabilities in the year, and an updating of other assumptions.
The Company continues to work proactively with the Pension Trustee to fide-risk the pension liabilities and secure the commitments to employee benefits as part of the Groups ongoing strategic risk management.
The Group is comfortable that the overall pension deficit is supportable.
Implementation of IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 establishes a new framework for determining and recognising revenue as well as requiring new additional disclosures.
The new standard is effective for A. G. BARR p. l. c. for the year ending 26 January 2019 and we will be implementing its requirements in our interim Report for the 6 months ending 28 July 2018.
The primary impact will be a reclassification of certain payments and customer incentives.
These are currently recognised as selling and distribution costs and going forward will be set against revenue.
The adoption of the standard is not expected to impact profit before tax.
Had the standard been adopted in the current year the impact would have been a reduction in revenue in the range of 10m to 13m and a decrease of selling and distribution costs of the same amount.
Profit before tax would be unchanged and gross margin would have been between 2.0% and 2.6% lower.
Share price and market capitalisation At 27 January 2018, the closing share price for A. G. BARR p. l. c. was 6.29, an increase of 25.3% on the closing January 2017 position.
The Group is a member of the FTSE 250, with a market capitalisation of 726m at the year end.
