Strategic report Financial review Our results for the year show a resilient operating performance in a challenging economic environment Overview We have recorded underlying earnings of 193.1 million in 2018, down from the 201.0 million recorded in 2017.
This reflects the impact of disposals and developments in 2018 partially offset by a 0.6 per cent growth in like-for-like net rental income.
Underlying earnings per share of 14.4 pence has reduced 0.6 pence in the year.
The deficit on property revaluations of 1,405.0 million in 2018 is the primary driver of the loss for the year attributable to owners of intu properties plc of 1,132.2 million, compared to a surplus on property revaluations of 47.3 million and a profit of Presentation of information We account for our interests in joint ventures using the equity method as required by IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
This means that the income statement and the balance sheet as prepared in accordance with IFRS include single lines for the Groups total share of post-tax profit loss and the net investment in joint ventures respectively.
Management reviews and monitors performance as well as determines the strategy of the business primarily on a proportionately consolidated basis.
This includes the Groups share of joint ventures on an individual line-by-line basis rather than a post-tax profit loss or net investment basis.
The figures and commentary presented are consistent with our management approach as we believe this provides a more relevant and reliable analysis of the Groups performance to users.
The other information section provides reconciliations of the income statement and balance sheet between the two bases.
Figures and commentary presented on a proportionately consolidated basis are alternative performance measures APMs see glossary as they are not defined in IFRS.
In presenting APMs within these results, we have applied the European Securities and Markets Authority Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures.
The most significant APMs used to measure the Groups performance including the rationale for their use are summarised below.
EPRA performance measures, which are industry standard APMs, are detailed in the EPRA section within other information.
APM Rationale Like-for-like Like-for-like amounts are presented as they measure operating performance as distinct from the impact of acquisitions or disposals.
In respect of property, the like-for-like measure relates to property which has been owned throughout both periods without significant capital expenditure amounts in either period, so that income can be compared on a like-for-like basis.
For the purposes of comparison of capital values, this will also include assets owned at the previous reporting period end but not throughout the prior period.
Further analysis is presented in the other information section and in the operating review.
NAV diluted, NAV per share diluted, adjusted as presented is based on EPRA NAV per share, an industry standard APM considered a key measure of the Groups performance, but adjusted for certain items listed below which management believes are necessary in order to better present the adjusted Groups performance.
The key differences to EPRA NAV per share relate to the following adjustments: fair value movements on interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt referred to as unallocated swaps are included in EPRA NAV but excluded from the Groups measure of NAV diluted, adjusted.
The Group does not hold unallocated swaps for speculative purposes.
Management currently intends to hold these unallocated swaps until maturity, therefore the volatility created by their fair value movements will not crystallise fair value movements on convertible bonds which are excluded from EPRA NAV but included in the Groups measure of NAV diluted, adjusted.
Management reviews and monitors the Groups debt to assets ratio based on the book value of debt and therefore management believes it is appropriate to include the book value of debt within the Groups measure of NAV diluted, adjusted A reconciliation of NAV diluted, adjusted to NAV attributable to owners of intu properties plc as well as EPRA NAV is provided in note 13.
The EPRA section within the other information section provides additional details on EPRA and related measures provided.
Underlying Underlying earnings per share as presented is based on EPRA earnings per share, an industry standard APM considered a key measure of recurring performance, but adjusted for certain items listed below which management believes are necessary in order to better present earnings the Groups recurring performance and therefore provide an indication of the extent to which dividend payments are supported by underlying operations see underlying profit statement in the other information section.
Underlying earnings per share excludes property and derivative movements, exceptional items and related tax.
The key differences to EPRA earnings per share relate to the following adjustments: with the exception of termination costs on allocated interest rate swaps and costs related to acquisitions, which are both excluded from EPRA earnings and underlying earnings, exceptional finance costs as detailed in note 9 and exceptional administration expenses as detailed in note 5 are included in EPRA earnings but are excluded from the Groups measure of underlying earnings.
In accordance with the Groups definition for exceptional items as detailed in the glossary, the Group considers these costs to be exceptional based on their nature and incidence, which create volatility in earnings fair value movements on interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt referred to as unallocated swaps are included in EPRA earnings but are excluded from the Groups measure of underlying earnings.
Management currently intends to hold these unallocated swaps until maturity, therefore the volatility created by their fair value movements will not crystallise A reconciliation of underlying earnings to loss profit for the year attributable to owners of intu properties plc as well as EPRA earnings is provided in note 12.

175 In January 2018 we continued our programme of recycling capital, completing the 50 per cent sale of intu Chapelfield to a new joint venture partner, LaSalle Investment Management acting on behalf of Greater Manchester Pension Fund and West 150 Yorkshire Pension Fund, for initial net consideration of 148.0 million.
In accordance with IFRS, following the completion date, intu Chapelfield is now presented as a joint venture in our financial statements.
125 We have refinanced or entered new facilities of over 500 million in 2018.
Our interest cover ratio of 1.91x is slightly lower in the year 31 December 2017: 1.94x with 100 satisfactory headroom above our target minimum level of 1.60x.
Income statement Underlying earnings and underlying earnings per share of 193.1 million and 14.4 pence respectively in 2018 have decreased from 201.0 million and 15.0 pence respectively in 2017.
The key movements of underlying earnings are shown in the chart to the left.
Net rental income decreased 9.5 million in 2018 to 450.5 million primarily due to the part disposal of intu Chapelfield in January 2018 and the acquisition and part disposal of intu Xanad in 2017, partially offset by growth in like-for-like net rental income.
Like-for-like net rental income increased by 2.3 million, 0.6 per cent in the year, driven by rent reviews and new lettings partially offset by administrations and CVAs see operating review.
Administration expenses increased by 2.4 million during the year to 44.0 million, predominantly from increased corporate overheads and depreciation on IT capital projects.

Our ratio of total costs to income, as calculated in accordance with vacancy costs 15.3% 15.1% EPRA guidelines, remains low at 15.3 per cent see other information section.
Balance sheet The Groups net assets attributable to shareholders are 3,811.7 million, a decrease from 5,075.0 million at 31 December 2017, while net assets diluted, adjusted are 4,190.9 million, a decrease from 5,522.7 million at 31 December 2017.
NAV per share diluted, adjusted at 31 December 2018 has decreased 99 pence during the year to 312 pence: the key movements are shown in the chart to the left.
This was driven principally by the deficit on property revaluations in the year of 102 pence.
As noted previously, our measure of NAV per share continues to include a timing impact within retained earnings of 4 pence in relation to our Spanish development partner Eurofunds expected future equity interest in the intu Costa del Sol development.
The positive impact on retained earnings is expected to reverse, once these Net asset value per share pence arrangements are concluded.
In this event NAV per share would be 308 pence.
312 411 14 -14 -102 5 -2 450 Investment and development property has decreased by 1,062.4 million due to a deficit on revaluation of 1,405.0 million, partially offset by capital expenditure of 201.0 million during the year and the recognition of the retained 50 per cent interest in intu Chapelfield, of which 100 per cent was classified as an asset held for sale at 31 December 2017.

The 2018 movement broadly reflects the addition of intu Chapelfield from 31 January 2018 following the 50 per cent part disposal, which is now accounted for as a joint venture rather than as a 100 per cent owned subsidiary partially offset by a deficit on property valuations of 72.4 million.
Investment in associates of 65.6 million represent our interests in India, which comprises a 32 per cent interest in Prozone 45.1 million, a shopping centre developer listed on the Indian stock market, and a direct interest in Empire 20.5 million.
Prozone and Empire own and operate shopping centres in Coimbatore and Aurangabad.
Net external debt of 4,867.2 million has increased by 31.7 million, the main movements due to capital expenditure in the year partially offset by proceeds from the part disposal of intu Chapelfield.
Cash including the Groups share of joint ventures is in line with 2017, reducing slightly by 3.9 million to 274.3 million and gross debt has increased by 27.8 million to 5,141.5 million.

The net liability at 31 December 2018 is 284.0 million, a decrease of 65.8 million in the year, due to cash payments in the year and increases in interest rates, with the Sterling five-year and 10-year swap rates increasing by 24bps and 13bps respectively.
Cash payments in 2018 totalled 44.9 million, 28.1 million of which has been classified as an exceptional finance cost as it relates to payments in respect of unallocated swaps see below.
The balance of the payments has been included as underlying finance costs as it relates to ongoing allocated swaps used to hedge debt.
We hold a number of interest rate swaps, entered into some years ago, which are unallocated due to a change in lenders practice.
Lenders previously would allow the allocation of existing long-dated swap cover to new debt: however, this practice changed where lenders began to require lender specific swaps on new debt to be put in place as a hedge when entering into new variable interest rate debt.
As a consequence of our significant refinancing activity carried out in recent years see financing section, this historical long-dated swap cover is no longer acting as a hedge to any debt interests and is therefore unallocated.
At 31 December 2018 these unallocated swaps have a market value liability of 184.4 million 31 December 2017: 235.4 million.
It is estimated that we will be required to make cash payments on these unallocated swaps of around 26.7 million in 2019, reducing to below 20 million per annum in 2021.
Cash payments on these unallocated swaps will continue until their maturity dates, which range between 2020 and 2037, but will cease in the event a swap is closed early.
Management intends to hold these until maturity as there is currently no economic benefit to closing these unallocated swap contracts early as this would require an upfront cash settlement in full.
The non-controlling interest at 31 December 2018 relates primarily to our partners 40 per cent stake in intu Metrocentre.
We are exposed to foreign exchange movements on our overseas investments.
At 31 December 2018 the exposure is 15.0 per cent of net assets attributable to shareholders of the Group 31 December 2017: 10.6 per cent, with the increase from 31 December 2017 being primarily due to the declines in our UK property valuations during the year.
Once the Eurofund expected future interest in the intu Costa del Sol development concludes, we expect the exposure to reduce to 13.9 per cent, after which the appropriate level of exposure will be assessed.

Covenants Further details of the debt financial covenants are included in the other information section of this report.
We are in compliance with all of our covenants and regularly stress test them for changes in capital values and income.
By way of example, a 10 per cent fall in capital values would create a covenant shortfall of only 1 million.

In addition to the committed expenditure, we have an identified uncommitted pipeline of active asset management projects, major extensions and developments that may become committed over the coming years see operating review.
Other Tax policy position The Group has tax exempt status in the UK REIT and for two of our joint ventures in Spain SOCIMI which provide exemption from corporation tax on rental income and gains arising on property sales, with tax instead being paid at shareholder level.
See glossary for further information on REITs.
The Group looks to minimise the level of tax risk and at all times seeks to comply fully with our regulatory and other tax obligations and to act in a way which upholds intus reputation as a responsible corporate citizen.
This is achieved through regularly carrying out risk reviews, seeking pre-clearance from taxing authorities in complex areas and actively engaging in discussions regarding proposed changes in the taxation system that might affect the Group.
We have updated intus Approach to Tax for 2018 which is published on the Groups website intugroup.
co. uk and provides further information about the Groups tax strategy.
Despite being a REIT, we pay tax directly on non-SOCIMI overseas earnings, any UK non-property income, business rates and transaction taxes such as stamp duty land tax.
In 2018 the total of such payments to tax authorities was 28.2 million 2017: 28.5 million, of which 25.4 million 2017: 26.0 million was in the UK and 2.8 million 2017: 2.5 million in Spain.
We also collect VAT, employment taxes and withholding tax on dividends for HMRC and the Spanish tax authorities.
Dividends The Directors are not recommending a final dividend for 2018.
The total paid in respect of 2018 is 4.6 pence, a reduction of the 14.0 pence paid in respect of 2017.
A UK REIT is expected to pay dividends PIDs of at least 90 per cent of its taxable profits from its UK property rental business by the first anniversary of each accounting date.
In view of the announced short term reduction of dividends it is expected that there will be an underpayment of the minimum PID, and so for the Group to incur UK corporation tax payable at 19 per cent.
Any corporation tax payable would form part of underlying earnings and in 2019 we would expect this to be in the range of 15 million to 20 million.
The Group intends to remain a UK REIT for the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2018, the Company has distributable reserves of 604 million.
