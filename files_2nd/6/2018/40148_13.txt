with our strategic objective to build a high quality industrial and logistics business, we are developing these schemes with people and wellbeing at their heart.
With the proportion of employers investing in workplace wellbeing initiatives at its highest ever increasing from 36% in 2017 to 42% in 2018 we have turned great attention to how our sites can prioritise employee wellbeing initiatives and enable tenants to retain a motivated and skilled workforce.
Our industrial and logistics sites across the West and Wales from Gloucester to Newport are leading the way in high-quality space, carefully designed to help prospective tenants meet essential wellbeing initiatives for their employees.
Not just a case of well-placed benches and flowerbeds, St. Modwens schemes are unique environments.
They incorporate green infrastructure that preserves open water and greenery, offering the likes of running and cycling tracks and provisions for lunch time yoga sessions.
Whilst still a work in progress, Access 18 in Avonmouth already prides itself on its integration of green landscaping, ponds and reens for the conservation of wildlife habitats, and cycle and running paths.
Currently home to 15 companies, including Nisbets, Hermes Parcelnet, GB Liners and Auto Windscreens, the site boasts green areas that provide relaxing outdoor space and a home for regular fitness classes.
At Gateway 12 in Gloucester, land was set aside for the use and enjoyment of the occupiers of the site.
We handed over an area of land adjacent to retail giant Amazons book depository, working closely with it to enable the creation of an outdoor area for its staff to enjoy their breaks.
A walking and jogging route forms part of the masterplan at St. Modwen Park, Chippenham.
Incorporated within 13 acres of strategic landscaping, the 79-acre scheme in Wiltshire will provide up to 1m sq ft of prime employment space and is expected to create up to 1,000 jobs.

St. Modwen Properties PLC 46 Annual report and financial statements 2018 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Group Construction The breadth of skills and experience within St. Modwens in-house construction team has enabled the successful delivery of projects across the group.
With construction contracts in excess of 200m in the year, the team has provided land and infrastructure to support the construction of over 3,300 new homes, delivered almost 1m sq ft of industrial and logistics space and reached significant milestones on major projects at St. Andrews Park in Uxbridge, Swansea Universitys Bay Campus and New Covent Garden Market in London.
The teams ability to unlock value in brownfield and greenfield sites has enabled it to provide sought-after oven-ready land to both St. Modwen Homes and third-party housebuilders, which accounted for 53m of land sales last year.
We have secured a reputation for delivering high-quality land that accelerates the delivery of new homes and we count some of the UKs most notable housebuilders as our partners.
Responding to occupier demand, the team was able to swiftly deliver a new 114,000 sq ft facility for global automotive supplier Grupo Antolin.
Having secured a contract to supply components to Jaguar Land Rover, Grupo Antolin urgently required a larger site.
We were able to deliver the facility, which included production space and three-storey offices, in just 38 weeks, with the manufacturer occupying the site after just 21 weeks.
The team also reached practical completion of new teaching facilities at Swansea Universitys Bay Campus well ahead of schedule: in Uxbridge, the first phase of 207 private rented sector PRS units at St. Andrews Park were handed over to housing provider Annington and in London, work commenced on the next phase of the new fruit and vegetable market at New Covent Garden Market.
The construction teams expertise in remediation of land saw it again win a Brownfield Briefing Award in the Best Brownfield Infrastructure Project category for our mixed-use development in Littlecombe, Gloucestershire, whilst being highly commended in the Best Biodiversity Enhancement category for Coed Darcy in Wales.
It also became a client partner of the Considerate Constructors Scheme, to participate in improving standards across the construction industry.
