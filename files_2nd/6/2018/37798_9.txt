Taxation The tax charge of 55 million represents an effective tax rate of 19.0% of underlying profit before tax.
This has fallen from 22.9% in 2017, primarily due to the impact of changes in tax legislation in the USA.

The significant investment in attractions or accommodation which have yet to open, including new LEGOLAND parks, or into attractions which have yet to mature, such as the new Midway brands or existing brands opening in new markets, has been a major contributor to the reduction in ROCE in recent years.

How we report our results Financial KPIs and Alternative Performance Measures APMs we adopt certain APMs that in our view help present our trading performance in the most helpful and meaningful way, and that we use consistently each year.
These can be summarised as follows: We refer to EBITDA as it is a profit measure we use internally to measure the performance of our attractions.
It is the KPI that we feel most appropriately captures the ongoing ability of our attractions to generate operating cash flows.
We refer to underlying results, which remove the impact of any exceptional items and provide a more direct comparison of trading performance.
Details of exceptional items are provided in note 2.2 to the financial statements.
We refer to operating free cash flow, which is underlying EBITDA less existing estate capital expenditure and which is then available to contribute to capital reinvestment to support further growth, service the Groups debt facilities, settle our tax obligations and provide a return to our shareholders.
We therefore also refer to operating free cash flow conversion, which calculates operating free cash flow as a percentage of underlying EBITDA, thereby providing insight as to our cash conversion performance.
To provide a more direct comparison of trading performance in the existing estate, we refer to like for like performance.
This represents growth between two years at constant currency and accounting standards, including all businesses owned and operated before the start of the earlier year 2017 in this Annual Report.
To provide insight into the Groups overall performance, including the impact of our new business development programme, we refer to organic growth.
This represents growth from like for like businesses and new business development at constant currency and accounting standards and excludes growth from acquisitions.
In 2018 these adjusted measures mean that the growth in revenue is calculated as if IFRS 15 had not been implemented, so adopting consistent accounting with 2017.
IFRS 15 has had a negligible impact on profit and therefore profit metrics would be unchanged.
In our 2019 reporting, both years will reflect the impact of IFRS 15.
Period under review in most years we report on a 52 week period.
In certain years an additional week is included to ensure that the statutory financial year end date stays in line with the end of December.
All balance sheet, and therefore cash flow, information is reported as at the statutory year end date.
