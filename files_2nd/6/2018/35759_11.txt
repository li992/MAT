Strategic Report Operating and financial review 2018 was a successful year forEuromoney Revenue Underlying revenue grew 3%, driven by a strong performance in our Pricing, Data & Market Intelligence segment as we continue to evolve towards a 3.0 business model.
Total revenue for the year decreased by 3% to 414.1m, largely because of the disposal of GMID in April 2018 and stronger sterling compared to the US dollar.
Statutory revenue increased by 1% to 390.3m.
Underlying revenue The Groups businesses focused on price discovery, data grew3%, driven by a and market intelligence, performed strongly, with underlying operating profit growing 18%.

Wendy Pallot Structural and cyclical industry issues facing investment research continued to affect our Asset Management segment.
This led to a Chief Financial Officer decline in revenues and profits in the segment.
The performance of Institutional Investor where revenues are sourced from assetmanagement marketing rather than research budgets, improved during the year.
We have conducted a strategic review to help our investment research businesses BCA and NDR adapt to this challenging business environment.
This review has delivered significant cost savings of around 7m across the investment research businesses, which have been partly reinvested in sales and marketing, digital technology and product development.
The outlook for our investment research businesses continues to be challenging, but our strategic review should mitigate some of the revenue downsides in 2019.
We transitioned Institutional Investor magazine to digital-only during 2018.
Institutional Investor is now largely a membership, events and research business, with publishing making up just 9% of its revenue.
The Commodity Events and Banking & Finance segments, which together accounted for 22% of total revenue, returned to growth following the strategic measures taken during 2017, which focused events revenues on large core events and eliminated low-margin events and training courses.
In October 2018, we sold Mining Indaba as it did not align with our strategy.
Following this disposal, the Commodity Events segment will be removed for reporting purposes, with the remaining commodity events being moved into the Pricing, Data & Market Intelligence segment, reflecting how they will be managed in future.
In line with disclosure in 2017, GMID which was sold in April 2018, has met the recognition criteria of discontinued operations and therefore has been presented as such in the Groups Financial Statements.
As the division was managed as part of the Group up until disposal in April, its results have been included in the Groups review of its adjusted performance until disposal.
Total and adjusted measures combine the results from the Groups continuing and discontinued operations.
The underlying results only include results pertaining to continuing operations.
Detailed reconciliations of the Groups statutory, adjusted and underlying results are set out on pages 27 to 29.
