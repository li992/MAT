As a global commodity, its price can vary with supply and demand and RPC has arrangements with many of its customers to pass on polymer price changes which serves as a hedge against price volatility.
As there is a time lag in passing on polymer price adjustments to the customer, typically around three months, this can have a negative or positive Simon Kesterton impact on revenue and adjusted operating profit depending on whether prices Group Finance Director are increasing or reducing.
During the first half of the year, polymer prices were relatively stable overall, with modest increases in euro and sterling at the end of the period.
Larger increases were encountered in the USA at the end of the first half due to the disruptive effect of hurricanes on the supply chain.
In the second half of the year, there was a steady increase in euro, sterling and US dollar indices, leading to a further headwind in the second half.
Overall, there was an adjusted operating profit headwind of 9m in the year.
This compares to a 3m headwind at the end of 2017 which has resulted in a negative pass-through variance of 6m impacting adjusted operating profit.
