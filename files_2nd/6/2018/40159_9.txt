In 2018 alone, we ran 21 academies for a total of 335 client banks, with 1,173 attendees.
Our 2018 academies included new modules on anti-human trafcking, new payment methods, illegal wildlife trafcking and illicit antiquities.
Over 95 per cent of attendees said they would recommend the programme to members of their institution, and 97 client banks have signed up to the related e-learning portal.
In addition, regulators have participated in 35 of our workshops, demonstrating the support weve had from the sector.
