Ross Jerrard Chief Financial Officer Director 1 March 2019 Centamin plc Annual report 2018 75 STRATEGIC REPORT Financial review continued Non-GAAP financial measures Four non-GAAP financial measures are used in this report: 1 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the following from profit before tax: finance costs: finance income: and depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the Groups ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures.
EBITDA is also frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or EBITDA multiple that is based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a company.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and does not have any standardised definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
EBITDA excludes the impact of cash cost of production and income of financing activities and taxes, and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS.
Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently.
The following table provides a reconciliation of profit for the year before tax to EBITDA: Reconciliation of profit for the year before tax to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA: 2 Restated Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 1 1 2018 2017 US$000 US$000 Profit for the year before tax 152,702 207,365 Finance income 4,815 2,729 Depreciation and amortisation 110,047 104,562 EBITDA 257,934 309,197 3 Add back: impairments of non-current assets Adjusted EBITDA 257,934 309,197 1 Profit before tax, depreciation and amortisation and EBITDA includes a charge to reflect the removal of fuel subsidies refer to note 2.7 to the financial statements for further details.
3 Adjustments made to normalise earnings, for example impairments on non-current assets i. e. net realisable value, stockpiles, exploration and evaluation assets etc.. 2 Cash cost of production per ounce produced and sold and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold calculation Cash cost of production and AISC are non-GAAP financial measures.
Cash cost of production per ounce is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a period by the total gold production over the same period.
Operating costs represent total operating costs less administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortisation.
Management uses this measure internally to better assess performance trends for the Company as a whole.
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use such non-GAAP information to evaluate the Companys performance and ability to generate cash flow.
The Company believes that these measures provide an alternative reflection of the Groups performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its expected performance in future periods.
Cash cost of production is intended to provide additional information, does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
This measure is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP.
Other companies may calculate these measures differently.
76 Centamin plc Annual report 2018 Introduction Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information STRATEGIC REPORT During June 2013 the World Gold Council, an industry body, published a Guidance Note on all-in sustaining costs metric, which gold mining companies can use to supplement their overall non-GAAP disclosure.
AISC is an extension of the existing cash cost metric and incorporates all costs related to sustaining production and in particular recognising the sustaining capital expenditure associated with developing and maintaining gold mines.
In addition, this metric includes the cost associated with developing and maintaining gold mines and the cost associated with corporate office structures that support these operations, the community and rehabilitation costs attendant with responsible mining and any exploration and evaluation costs associated with sustaining current operations.
AISC US$ oz is arrived at by dividing the dollar value of the sum of these cost metrics by the ounces of gold sold as compared to using ounces produced which is used in the cash cost of production calculation.
On 14 November 2018 the World Gold Council published an updated Guidance Note on all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs metrics per their press release it is expected that companies may choose to use the updated guidance from 1 January 2019 or on commencement of their financial year if later.
The Group will apply the updated guidance from 1 January 2019.
