Tax Tax charge Underlying tax In 2018 we recognised a tax charge of 20.6m on underlying trading profits after finance cost.
The effective tax rate 26.0% is lower than in 2017 34.8%.
This is mainly due to a fall in the rate of tax incurred by our overseas operations, primarily driven by the fall in US tax rate, together with lower underlying UK tax losses on which no accounting tax credit is available which is only partially offset by a lower adjustment in respect of prior years.

Although the Board is committed to resuming dividend payments as soon as judges it prudent to do so, in assessing whether we should resume dividend payments in respect of 2018, we have been mindful of the fact that 2019 is the last year of significant outflows of cash related to OCPs and exceptional costs, which together will mean that net debt is likely to increase again in 2019, albeit modestly.
The Board will continue to keep the dividend policy under careful and regular consideration as we progress with completing the transformation stage and driving forward with the growth stage of our strategy.
