Net rental income increased by 7.2 million or 7.7 per cent primarily due to the acquisition of the formerly listed IHL business which added ninehotels to the Groups hotel portfolio.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals, net rental income increased 2.1 per cent on a likeforlike basis.
UK Commercial experienced the strongest likeforlike performance, with net rental income up 6.3 per cent yearonyear.
This follows strong rent review activity, particularly at the Groups Camino Park Distribution Centre in Crawley and within the London office portfolio.
UK Hotels achieved 3.4 per cent likeforlike growth in net rental income.
At the operating level, occupancy has held steady at 84 per cent with continued growth in RevPar, which was a good result given the backdrop of increased supply and underlying operational costs.
Despite the challenges in UK Retail, like-for-like income held firm at 34.6 million, largely the result of maintaining occupancy levels at 95.9 per cent versus 96.8 per cent in the prior year.
Net UK Shopping Centre income increased 0.4 million year-on-year, but this was offset by vacancies at the Groups retail parks, largely the result of CVAs and tenants in administration.
Like-for-like net rents in Europe were marginally down 1.2 per cent in Euro terms and up 0.4 per cent in Sterling terms following a strengthening in the average exchange rate during the year.
In local currency terms the fall in net rent was attributable to marginally lower occupancy levels compared to the prior year.

These can therefore be considered recurring in nature.
In the prior year, other income comprised a non-recurring performance fee generated on disposal of the VBG portfolio of German offices.
Administrative costs have reduced by 1.2 million, largely due to the non-recurring termination fee charged in the previous financial year in respect of a legacy asset management contract.
The growth in rental income and the Groups careful management of operational costs resulted in the EPRA cost ratio falling from 17.2 per cent to 15.6 per cent.
Net finance costs have held steady despite the enlarged portfolio, reflecting both lower leverage and the full year impact of refinancing activity completed during the prior year.
Non-controlling interests reflects the share of income attributable to the minority shareholders, most notably within the newly acquired IHL hotel portfolio 25.9 per cent, the London Serviced Office portfolio 20.0 per cent and the non IHL hotel portfolio 17.5 per cent.
Due to market expectations of rising interest rates, a significant gain has been recorded on the fair value of the Groups interest rate derivative contracts.
This credit is removed from both the Groups underlying earnings measure and EPRA earnings.

EPRA NAV increased 3.4 per cent to 42.8 pence per share, largely attributable to disposals which were completed, on the whole, at premiums to book value.
On a likeforlike basis, the property portfolio valuations were up by 0.1 per cent overall, with strong valuation gains recorded on the UK Commercial portfolio being offset by a decline in the valuation of the UK Retail portfolio.
UK Commercial continues to perform well, recording a 23.1 million or 7.5 per cent increase in likeforlike values.
This was driven by rent review activity in the London offices and the distribution warehouse portfolio.
Ongoing challenges in the UK retail market have continued to weigh on investor sentiment, with an outward yield shift driving a 6.3 per cent decline in the Groups UK Shopping Centre portfolio during the second half of the year, a decline of 9.2 per cent across the full year.
UK Retail Parks experienced an improved rental outlook following successful letting activity.
Hotels continued a steady valuation performance in the second half, recording a 2.1 per cent likeforlike increase across the full year.
The strongest performance being achieved by those hotels located in London and Edinburgh.
In local currency terms, the Groups investments in Germany were valued up 2.2 per cent, benefiting from a strong investment market and low interest rates.
The strength of the Euro at the prior year end eased during the year such that, in Sterling terms, the portfolio recorded a marginal decline in value.

52 RDI REIT P. L. C. Annual Report 2018 Net debt has reduced by over 40.0 million since the prior year end reflecting continued efforts to reduce the Groups LTV.
A net 65.0 million was prepaid against the Groups revolving credit facility while refinancing activities and scheduled amortisation reduced various other facilities by 17.0 million.
The Group acquired debt facilities of 54.4 million via the acquisition of IHL, which was geared to 52 per cent at acquisition and 73.5 million on acquisition of the London Serviced Office portfolio which was initially geared at 45.5 per cent.
The Groups LTV continues to move downwards towards the lower end of the Groups medium term target range.
On a pro forma basis, after incorporating transactions completed shortly after 31 August 2018, it stood at 47.3 per cent.
Debt maturity, average cost of debt, interest cover and debt with interest rate protection remain comfortable and in line with strategic targets.
Refinancing of the Groups largest facility, the 303 million AUK facility, is underway and we expect to conclude this during the first half of the 2019financial year.
Although two significant acquisitions which completed in September 2018 have reduced this to 100.6 million, this provides considerable operational flexibility.
Operating cash flows were 58.8 million, an increase of 7.2 million on the prior year, comfortably covering the cash dividends paid of 41.1 million.
Cash outlays on acquisitions, development and debt repayments were balanced by proceeds from disposals.
Dividend The Directors have declared a second interim dividend of 1.35 pence per share for 2018.
When paid, taken together with the first interim dividend paid to shareholders in June, this will represent a yield of 6.3 per cent on EPRA NAV at 31 August 2018 or 8.0 per cent based on the Companys closing share price on 31 August 2018.
The full year dividend of 2.7 pence per share represents a 95.1 per cent payout ratio on underlying earnings of 2.84 pence per share and is coveredby operational cash flows.
Details of the forthcoming payment will be announced separately today.
The dividend payment date has been set for 18 December 2018, with a record date of 30 November 2018.
Due to the Companys share price trading at a discount to net asset value, the Board has decided to suspend the scrip alternative.
The dividend willtherefore be paid entirely in cash.
Going concern At 31 August 2018, the Groups cash and undrawn facilities were 134.8 million and its capital commitments were 9.5 million.
Mindful of transactions occurring post the balance sheet date and having considered severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors are satisfied that the security of the Groups income taken together with an average debt maturity profile of 6.7 years, headroom against financial covenants and strong interest cover, continue to provide a reasonable expectation that the Group will have the resources it requires to meet ongoing and futurecommitments.
Accordingly, the 2018 consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
