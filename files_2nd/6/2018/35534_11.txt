BREXIT Our assessment of the impact of Brexit on our business and customers has been monitored throughout the year and whilst the specific details and timing of Brexit remain unclear, we have proactively managed our supply chain in order to minimise the impact on our customers.
In addition, we continue to monitor the impact of sterling in respect of interest rate and cost of capital and are taking steps to ensure there is continuity in the REACH registrations which apply to our manufactured and imported products.
The Boards assessment remains that the impact of Brexit on the Group is expected to be of low materiality, however, we will continue to monitor political developments and modify plans accordingly.
Further information on how we have assessed and are mitigating the risks associated with Brexit can be found in the principal risks section on page 43.
