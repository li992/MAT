STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS In the 2018 financial year, easyJet flew 88.5million passengers 2017: 80.2 million and delivered a headline profit before tax for the year of 578 million 2017: 408 million or 6.07 per seat 2017: 4.71 per seat.
Total reported profit before tax for the yearwas 445 million 2017: 385 million or4.68 per seat 2017: 4.45 per seat.
ANDREW FINDLAY Chief Financial Officer On 15 December 2017 easyJet completed the acquisition of part of Air Berlins operations at Berlin Tegel Airport.
Its flying programme started on 5 January 2018, operating a winter schedule with a fleet of mainly wet leased aircraft.
As anticipated, Tegel flying resulted in a dilutive impact to overall load factor performance, revenue per seat and profit per seat whilst the operation was being established.
The impact of the Tegel operation has therefore been split out in the financial overview below to provide visibility of the existing business.
Tegel headline loss before tax in the year of 112 million relates to our flying activities in Tegel, including the use of lower gauge wet leased aircraft, combined with anticipated initially lower loads and yields as we commenced our operations.
Tegelnon-headline costs represent the parallel integration of our dry lease operation, including fleet conversion and training costs, aswell as transaction-related costs.
The headline profit before tax excluding Tegel for the year ended 30 September 2018 was 690 million 2017: 408 million and the total profit before tax excluding Tegel was 597 million 2017: 385 million.
Total profit before tax includes the impact of a 65 million non-headline charge resulting from our change in approach to technology development during the year.
Excluding Tegel, seats flown increased by 4.2% and load factor increased by 1.0 percentage point to 93.6%.
Total revenue per seat grew by 6.4% to 61.94 2017: 58.23, an increase of 4.7% at constant currency.
Revenue per seat performance excluding Tegel grew by 6.7% at constant currency.
The increase in revenue per seat is a consequence of the positive trading environment based on the strength of our network and customer offer, competitor capacity reductions and lower growth in easyJet markets, in particular as a result of the bankruptcies of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia, as well as the impacts from Ryanairs winter flight cancellations and summer strike action.
Tegel generated 198 million of revenue in the period: Tegel revenue per seat was 40.69 which had a dilutive impact on total revenue per seat.
30 easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Total headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 5.3% to 43.43 and increased by 4.8% at constant currency.
Headline cost per seat excluding fuel was 43.00 excluding Tegel, an increase from last year of 3.8% at constant currency.
The increase was mainly due to higher disruption costs which have been driven by the high number of disruption events through the year, mainly as a result of significant third-party industrial action, air traffic control restrictions and adverse weather conditions across Europe.
Crew costs were also higher than last year due to agreed inflationary increases in pay along with the impact of the significant disruption on crew productivity, combined with the increase in accrued employee incentive costs as a result of our strong financial performance.
These were partially offset by cost benefits from synergies at our larger airports, the up-gauging of fleet to larger and more efficient aircraft, savings obtained from airport cost programme initiatives, and navigation price benefits.
Tegel headline costs were 310 million in the year and Tegel headline cost per seat was 63.76, which had an adverse impact on total cost per seat.
Total fuel costs grew by 122 million, and increased from 12.25 to 12.44 per seat.
At constant currency fuel cost per seat decreased by 4.3%.
Despite an increase in the market price of fuel, the operation of easyJets hedging policy resulted in a reduction in the effective US dollar fuel price.
Total headline profit before tax per seat increased by 28.7% to 6.07 per seat 2017: 4.71, which includes an 8 million favourable movement from foreign exchange.
Total non-headline costs of 133 million 2017: 23 million were recognised in the year, consisting of: a 65 million charge for thewrite-down of IT investments and associated commitments the business will no longer require: a 40 million charge for the integration of the Berlin Tegel operation: a 19 million charge as a result of the sale and leaseback of 10 A319 aircraft in the first quarter: a 7 million charge for Brexit-related preparation activity: a 1 million charge associated with the completion of the organisational review: and a 1 million charge for fair value adjustments associated with the cross-currency interest rate swaps inplace for the Eurobonds issued in February 2016 and October 2016.
Total profit before tax per seat increased by 5.2% to 4.68 per seat 2017: 4.45, which includes a 1 million favourable year-onyear movement from foreign exchange 0.01 per seat.
The total tax charge for the year was 87 million 2017: 80 million.
The effective tax rate for the year was 19.7% 2017: 20.8%, higher than the standard UK rate of 19.0% 2017: 19.0%, due to the impact of Swiss and Austrian income being taxed at higherrates.
EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDENDS PER SHARE 2018 2017 Change in pence per pence per pence per share share share Basic headline earnings per share 118.3 82.5 35.8 Basic total earnings per share 90.9 77.4 13.5 Diluted headline earnings per share 117.4 81.9 35.5 Proposed ordinary dividend per share 58.6 40.9 17.7 Basic headline earnings per share increased by 43.4% to 118.3 pence 2017: 82.5 pence and basic total earnings per share increased by 17.4% to 90.9 pence 2017: 77.4 pence.
The increases were as a consequence of the increases in both headline and total profit after tax for the year.
In line with the stated dividend policy of a payout ratio of 50% of headline profit after tax, the Board is recommending an ordinary dividend of 233 million or 58.6 pence per share which is subject to shareholder approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 7 February 2019.
This will be paid on 22 March 2019 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 1March 2019.
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED ROCE 2018 2017 Change Headline ROCE 14.4% 11.9% 2.5ppt Total ROCE 11.5% 11.3% 0.2ppt Headline ROCE for the year was 14.4%, an improvement of 2.5 percentage points on the prior year and total ROCE for the year was 11.5%, an improvement of 0.2 percentage points from last year.
The increase in both headline and total ROCE was due to the increase in profits for the year, partially offset by a 13.9% increase inthe average adjusted capital employed including lease adjustments.
This is primarily due to the acquisition of 28 aircraft during the year and the entry into the fleet of 19 leased aircraft as part of the Air Berlin transaction.
The ROCE calculation excludes borrowings, cash and money market deposits and includes an adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements.
The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven.

An 8 million favourable 2017: 101 million adverse impact on headline profit was more than offset by a 9 million adverse 2017: 16 million favourable impact on the non-headline loss.
The adverse impact of the Sterling US dollar exchange rate movement on fuel costs was partially offset by a favourable impact on revenue mainly driven by the weakening ofSterling against the Euro.
Foreign exchange rate movements arise as easyJets foreign currency risk management policy is to hedge between 65% and 85% of the next 12 months forecast surplus cash flows on a rolling basis, and hence a portion of cash flows remains unhedged.
Additionally the Groups foreign currency risk management policy is aimed at reducing the impact of a fluctuation in exchange rates on future cash flows, however the timing of cash flows can be different to the timing of recognition within theincome statement resulting in foreign exchange movements.
Amounts presented at constant currency are an alternative performance measure and not determined inaccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Tegel flying generated 198 million of revenue in the year.
The number of passengers carried increased by 10.2% to 88.5 million 2017: 80.2 million, driven by a growth in capacity of 9.8% to 95.2 million seats 2017: 86.7 million and load factor increasing by 0.3 percentage points to 92.9% 2017: 92.6%.
Increase in capacity has been lower than originally planned due to disruption, which resulted in 6,814 cancellations during the year 2017: 2,502.
Revenue per seat increased by 6.4% to 61.94 2017: 58.23, and increased by 4.7% to 60.96 at constant currency.
Tegel revenue per seat was 40.69, which had an anticipated dilutive impact on total revenue per seat.
32 easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 easyJet saw a positive trading environment based on the strength of our network and customer offer, capacity reductions and lower growth in easyJet markets, in particular as a result of the bankruptcies of Monarch, Air Berlin and Alitalia as well as the impacts from Ryanairs winter flight cancellations and summer strike action.
Ancillary revenue per seat continued to perform well, and increased by 11.7% to 12.71 2017: 11.38.
The momentum from lastyears product and pricing initiatives, particularly bags and allocated seating, continued into this year, along with greater conversion and attachment rates from improved website functionality.
Performance benefitted from higher loads as well as further product offerings brought to market.
HEADLINE COSTS EXCLUDING FUEL Headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 5.3% to 43.43 2017: 41.27 and increased by 4.8% at constant currency.
Excluding Tegel, thesecosts increased by 0.8% at constant currency, highlighting the impact of higher than average costs at Tegel Airport and the lower gauge of the wet leased aircraft used to launch the operation.
The relatively flat movement excluding Tegel is a result of inflationary increases in ground handling charges in the UK, Germany and Spain, as well as the impact of the new DHL contract at Gatwick, substantially offset by the cost benefits from synergies which have been achieved as we deliver growth at our larger airports and airport cost savings obtained as a result of easyJets cost programme initiatives.
Headline crew cost per seat increased by 6.4% to 7.92, and by 6.2% at constant currency.
This was driven by agreed inflationary increases in crew and pilot pay combined with the accrual of expected crew incentive payments, due to our strong financial performance.
Other factors included: a higher retention of crew over the winter to build for peak summer growth: an investment in resilience for the summer: and high levels of disruption impacting crew productivity related costs.
Headline navigation cost per seat decreased by 4.4% to 4.20, and by 5.1% at constant currency, driven by the annualisation of reduced charges, primarily in France and Germany, and the impact of the change in fleet mix.
Headline maintenance cost per seat increased by 6.3% to 3.28, and by 5.5% at constant currency.
The increases were driven byhigher costs associated with the increased level of lease returns, additional aircraft recovery resilience and inflation on supply chain contracts.
These were partially offset by the impact of up-gauging the fleet.
Headline selling and marketing cost per seat increased by 6.0% to 1.50, and by 5.8% at constant currency.
This was largely driven by marketing and advertising expenditure in the year in relation to the new Tegel routes and expenditure for the new advertising campaign in the year.
Headline other operating costs per seat increased by 22.0% to 5.22 per seat, and by 21.9% at constant currency.
An increase indisruption costs was the main driver due to the high number of disruption events through the year, mainly as a result of significant third-party industrial action, air traffic control restrictions, adverse weather conditions across Europe and increased congestion at airports.
This was combined with an increase in wet lease charges resulting from the Tegel integration and delays to Airbus deliveries, and the increase in accrued employee incentive costs due to our strong financial performance.
Headline aircraft dry leasing cost per seat increased by 25.4% to 1.59, and by 19.7% at constant currency.
The adverse variance was mainly driven by the 10 aircraft sale and leasebacks that occurred earlier in the year.
Depreciation costs have increased by 0.3% on a per seat basis driven by the annualisation of 23 aircraft deliveries last year and 28 new aircraft deliveries this year, which more than offset the decrease from the 10 sale and leasebacks and the impact of increased capacity.
The average number of owned aircraft increased by 6.9% to 211.
Headline net finance charges decreased by 30.4% to 0.16 per seat.
The variance was driven by higher dividends received in the year, along with higher interest receivable from higher cash balances and favourable interest rates.
com STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED FUEL 2018 2017 million per seat million per seat Fuel 1,184 12.44 1,062 12.25 Total fuel cost for the year was 1,184 million 2017: 1,062 million, of which 60 million related to Tegel.
Fuel cost per seat of12.44 was 1.5% higher than last year, but decreased by 4.3% at constant currency.
During the year the average market jet fuel price increased by 32.5% to $664 per tonne, from $501 per tonne in the previous year.
The operation of easyJets fuel hedging policy meant that the average effective fuel price decreased by 1.0% to $590 per tonne, from $596 per tonne in the previous year.
The impact of Sterling US dollar exchange rate movement on fuel costs was 68 million adverse 2017: 85 million, resulting inan actual cost of 434 per tonne, a 5.3% increase compared to 412 per tonne in the previous year.
The increase in fuel costs also reflects the increase in the price of Emissions Trading System ETS permits from 7.07 at 30 September 2017 to 21.21 at 30September 2018.

After allowing for the impact of aircraft operating leases calculated as seven times operating lease costs incurred in the year, adjusted net debt increased by 325million to 738 million, mainly due to the increase in total lease costs as a result of the sale and leaseback of10 aircraft in the year and the leases entered into for ex-Air Berlin aircraft.
The movement in net working capital has increased by 124 million year on year, driven by an increase in trade and other payables as a result of an increase in activity, partially offset by an increase in trade and other receivables.
Net capital expenditure includes the acquisition of 28 A320 family aircraft 2017: 23 aircraft, the purchase of life-limited parts used in engine restoration and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases.
The number of aircraft in the fleet increased from 279 at 30 September 2017 to 315 at 30 September 2018.

The movement on the hedging reserve was predominantly due to the favourable mark-to-market movement on jet fuel forward contracts.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment increased by 615 million, driven principally by the acquisition of 28 A320 family aircraft and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases.
Net derivative financial instruments have increased by 272 million due to mark-to-market gains on jet fuel contracts, gains on USdollar contracts and gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps, partially offset by losses on Euro contracts.
Unearned revenue increased by 150 million due to the increased revenue activity year on year, driven by the changes in trading conditions and the competitor landscape.
Net working capital comprising trade receivables, trade payables and current provisions increased by 190 million, primarily as a result of the timing of invoice receipts and payments as well as an increase in activity year on year.
Current and deferred taxation increased by 73 million, mainly driven by the deferred tax liability arising from movements in hedge positions.
Other non-current assets and liabilities have moved from a net asset position of 10 million to a net liability position of 50million, mainly driven by the reduction in deposits held by aircraft lessors as a result of lease returns in the year.
