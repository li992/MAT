The effect of acquisitions made in the year was material: the reported segmental performance is analysed between existing and acquisition businesses, and at AER and CER in the table below.
The acquisition elements capture the additional base business coming into the Group, the growth Dechra generated in them during the year, and the synergies that have already been realised by the Group since acquisition.
This analysis becomes less definitive the further in time from the completion of the acquisition, as the acquisition business is progressively integrated with the existing business.
The existing business grew by 3.7% including like for like Apex revenue: excluding third party contract manufacturing, which is being reduced in line with our strategy and replaced with own product manufacturing, revenues increased by 4.4%.
This growth was driven by the strong contribution from market penetration and new product launches in the Companion Animal Products CAP, Equine, Food producing Animal Products FAP and Nutrition.
The acquisitions of Apex like for like year on year, acquired in October 2016 and RxVet Limited Dechra Veterinary Products International business, acquired in December 2017, and AST Farma B. V. and Le Vet Beheer B. V. acquired in February 2018 contributed a combined 18.1 million to revenue and are reported within EU Pharmaceuticals.
Operating Profit from existing business grew 9.7%, with operating margin expanding to 28.1% and consolidated operating margin increasing to 29.8% as a result of operating leverage and the accretive operating margin of AST Farma and Le Vet, partially offset by increased investment in our Dechra Veterinary Products International business to drive growth in new international markets.
All of the growth was in the existing business, with no acquisitions in NA Pharmaceuticals within the current or prior year.
The growth came from market penetration and product launches in CAP and Equine, slightly offset by a reduction in FAP as older non-strategic ex-Brovel FAP products were withdrawn from the market in Mexico, and replaced with Dechra CAP portfolio products which have been successfully registered.
Operating Profit from the business grew by 18.3% with the EBIT margin constant at 32.5%, as further investments were made in the commercial team to drive future growth.

Return on Capital Employed ROCE ROCE fell to 15.4% in the year 2017: 17.7%.
This is largely due to the inclusion in the metric of 100% of the assets acquired from AST Farma and Le Vet in mid February in the Capital Employed element, but only 4.5 months profit in the Return element.
We expect this to rise in the coming year as the Group consolidates a full year of profit from the acquisition.
Acquisitions The Group has made several acquisitions in recent years.
Performance of the acquisitions made during the 2018 and 2017 financial years is separately summarised compared to the existing business in the sections above.
In December 2017, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of RxVet Limited, a small CAP business in New Zealand.
RxVet has been Dechras distributor in New Zealand since 2010, with revenue in the year to March 2017 of NZ$1.4 million: sales of Dechra products account for about half of this.
The business has been successfully integrated into the Group, has been renamed Dechra Veterinary Products NZ Limited, and is performing in line with management expectations.
The acquisition was financed from the Groups existing working capital resources.
In February 2018, we completed the acquisition of AST Farma B. V. and Le Vet Beheer B. V. for a total consideration of 307.3 million 340.0 million on a debt-free and cash-free basis.
The combined revenue in the year ended 31 December 2016, excluding business with Dechra prior to the acquisition, was 36.9 million.
The total consideration was satisfied as to approximately 75% in cash and 25% in new Dechra shares, which are subject to a two year lock-in.
The acquisition was financed from the 102.3 million proceeds of an equity placing, issuance of new consideration ordinary shares, and debt drawn from a new Term Loan facility see Borrowing Facilities above.
Integration has proceeded in line with plan, and the ongoing synergy realisation programme is on schedule.
