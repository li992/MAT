Interest income grew by GEL 250.3 million, or 24.2%, YoY to GEL 1,284.2 million.
This was mainly driven by an increase in interest income from loans and advances to customers of GEL 204.2 million, or 22.2%, which is primarily related to a rise in the gross loan portfolio by GEL 1,819.4 million, or 21.3%, YoY.
This effect was further magnified by a 0.2 pp increase in loan yields to 12.3%, which was driven by a rise in rates on GEL denominated loans of 0.9 pp.
This in turn was partially offset by the decrease in yields on FC denominated loans by 0.6 pp.
Another contributor to the increase in interest income was the interest income from investment securities comprising of investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, investment securities available for sale and bonds carried at amortised cost, which was up by GEL 21.6 million, or 28.4%.
This resulted from an increase in respective portfolio by GEL 552.0 million, or by 49.8%.
Yield on investment securities remained stable on YoY basis.
Yields on interest earning assets expanded by 0.3 pp to 11.4%, compared to FY 2017.
The YoY growth in interest expense by GEL 76.3 million, or 17.7% to a GEL 506.2 million in FY 2018 was mainly due to 25.1% increase in interest expense on amounts due to credit institutions by GEL 39.4 million and a rise in interest expense on customer accounts by GEL 32.9 million, or 14.0%.
The higher interest expense on amounts due to credit institutions was mainly due to an increase in the respective portfolio by GEL 410.8 million, or 15.7%, and a 0.7pp higher effective rate, which stood at 7.2%, mainly related to the rise in Libor rate.
The higher interest expense on customer accounts was attributable to a GEL 1,535.3 million, or 19.6%, growth in the respective portfolio, partially offset by a 0.2 pp decline in the cost of deposit, down to 3.2%, which resulted from a 0.3 pp and a 0.4 pp decrease in cost of deposits of LC and FC denominated deposits, respectively.
As a result, the cost of funding decreased by 0.1 pp on a YoY basis and stood at 4.4%.
Consequently, NIM was 6.9% in FY 2018, compared to 6.5% in FY 2017.
This mainly resulted from an increase in net fee and commission income from card operations of GEL 14.0 million, or 38.7% and an increase in net fee and commission income from settlement transactions of GEL 9.7 million, or 18.6%.
The rise in net fee and commission income from card operations is related to the increased number of active cards and POS terminals by 17.8% and 15.0% respectively.
The increase in net fee and commission income from settlement transactions was mainly related to our subsidiary, TBC Pay, driven by a higher number of transactions, the growth in net fee and commission income from our affluent retail sub-segment, TBC Status and the increased number and volume of money transfer transactions.

This mainly resulted from the rise in net income from foreign currency operations by GEL 15.4 million, or 16.8%, mainly due to an increased number and volume of FX transactions.
Another contributor was gross insurance profit up by GEL 5.5 million, or 81.2%.
The increase in gross insurance profit was mainly related to increased cross selling of various insurance products and improved efficiency levels.

This mainly resulted from an increase in: staff costs by GEL 17.3 million, or 8.5%: depreciation and amortisation by GEL 8.5 million, or 22.7% and administrative expenses by GEL 19.4 million, or 16.0% mainly related to the growth of advertising and marketing services.
The growth across the board resulted from the overall expansion of the business scale, the higher performance and the costs of the mandatory deposit insurance, which was introduced at the end of 2017.
Without the mandatory deposit insurance expenses, total operating expenses and administrative & other operating expenses would have increased by 12.9% and 11.6% respectively.
As a result, cost to income ratio was 37.8% in FY 2018, 3.9 pp lower than the 41.7% in FY 2017.
TBC BANK annual report and accounts 2018 95 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Income tax In FY 2018, TBC Bank reversed the one-off deferred tax gain, which was recognised in 2016 due to the recent amendment to the Georgian Tax Code in relation to corporate income tax.
The amendment, which came into force on 12 June 2018, postponed the tax relief for re-invested profit from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2023 for financial institutions.
This reversal has resulted in a GEL 17.4 million expense on the profit and loss statement and a GEL 5.1 million reduction in equity in FY 2018.
Net income Net income for FY increased by GEL 77.5 million, or 21.5%, YoY and stood at GEL 437.4 million, while underlying net income without reversal of one-off deferred tax gain mentioned above increased by GEL 85.6 million or 23.2% YoY and amounted to GEL 454.9 million.
As a result, underlying ROE stood at 22.8%, up by 1.4pp YoY, while underlying ROA stood at 3.3%, up by 0.1pp YoY.
Reported ROE stood at 22.0%, up by 1.1pp YoY, and reported ROA remained broadly stable on YoY basis and stood at 3.2%.
The increase was mainly due to a rise in net loans to customers by GEL 1,713.1 million, or 20.6%, YoY.
Other contributors to the increase were a GEL 552.0 million, or 49.8%, rise in financial securities and a GEL 132.1 million, or 5.3%, increase in liquid assets comprising cash, due from banks and mandatory cash balances with NBG, compared to 31 December 2017.
As of 31 December 2018, the gross loan portfolio reached GEL 10,372.6 million, up by 21.3% YoY, while the proportion of gross loans denominated in foreign currency increased by 0.4 pp on a YoY basis and accounted for 60.1% of total loans.

MSME The MSME segments PAR 30 increased by 0.3 pp YoY, mainly attributable to SME.

MSME The MSME NPLs decreased by 0.4 pp on a YoY basis and stood at 4.2%.
This was driven by the improved performance in NPLs in both the micro and SME portfolios.
TBC BANK annual report and accounts 2018 97 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Dec-18 Dec-17 NPLs Coverage Exc.
This was primarily due to a GEL 410.8 million, or 15.7%, increase in amounts due to credit institutions and a hike in customer accounts of GEL 1,535.3 million, or 19.6%.
Total liabilities also expanded, due to an increase in subordinated debt by GEL 224.1 million, or 52.5%.
LIQUIDITY As of 31 December 2018, the Banks liquidity ratio, as defined by the NBG, stood at 33.3%, compared to 32.5% as of 31 December 2017 and above the NBG limit of 30%.

TOTAL EQUITY As of 31 December 2018, TBCs total equity amounted to GEL 2,206.0 million, up by GEL 315.5 million or by 16.7% from GEL 1,890.5 million as of 31 December 2017.
This YoY change in equity was mainly due to net profit contribution of GEL 437.4 million during the last 12 months, which was mostly offset by dividend distribution of GEL 88.9 million in May 2018 and by IFRS 9 transition effect in the amount of GEL 63.6 million as of 1 January 2018.
REGULATORY CAPITAL According to the newly introduced methodology, as of 31 December 2018 the Banks Basel III Tier 1 and Total Capital Adequacy Ratios CAR stood at 12.8% and 17.9%, respectively, compared to the minimum required levels of 11.8% and 16.7%.
In 31 December 2018, The Banks Basel III Tier 1 Capital amounted to GEL 1,678.7 million, up by GEL 241.5 million or 16.8%, compared to December 2017, due to increase in net income.
The Banks Basel III Total Capital totalled GEL 2,351.3 million, up by GEL 466.0 million, or by 24.7%.
The increase in total capital was attributable to the increase in net income and the growth in subordinated loans.
At the end of 2018, the bank attracted GEL 230.5 million subordinated loan, out of which GEL 160.6 million was converted from existing senior loans and the remaining GEL 69.9 million was additionally raised.
Risk weighted assets amounted to GEL 13,154.9 million as of 31 December 2018, up by GEL 2,401.7 million, or by 22.3%, compared to December 2017, mainly related to the rise in loan book.
