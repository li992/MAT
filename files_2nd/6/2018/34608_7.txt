Chief Financial Officers Review Subject to trading performance, the Board currently expects to declare a special dividend at the time of the Companys interim results in the range of 5 to 10p per ordinary share Kris Lee Chief Financial Officer The FY18' accounting period refers to the year ended 31 January 2018 and the comparative period FY17' refers to the year ended 31 January 2017.
REVENUE Total Group revenue during the year grew by 6.0% to 422.1m FY17: 398.2m, driven by growth in the Card Factory store network: FY18 FY17 Increase m m Decrease Card Factory 404.3 380.5 6.3% Getting Personal 17.8 17.7 0.5% Group 422.1 398.2 6.0% The Groups established new store roll out programme continues to be an important driver of sales growth for the business.
In the year under review, 50 net new UK stores were opened FY17: 51, bringing the total UK estate to 915 stores, with a further six trial stores opened in the Republic of Ireland at the year-end.
Like-for-like LFL' sales growth was broken down as follows by retail channels: FY18 FY17 Card Factory stores 2.6% 0.4% Card Factory online 67.5% 49.4% Card Factory combined 2.9% 0.6% Getting Personal 0.3% -2.4% Total online combined 5.9% 0.5% As expected, the ongoing improvements to the depth, quality and merchandising of our complementary non-card product offering led to a continuation of the mix shift to this category, a trend we have seen for a number of years.
The full year mix for FY18 was 53.7% single cards FY17: 55.3%, 44.0% complementary non-card FY17: 42.3% and 2.3% Christmas Box Cards FY17: 2.4%.
We expect some continuation in this trend as we further improve our complementary non-card offering to drive incremental sales.
Revenue from the Card Factory transactional website grew by 67% FY17: 50%.
As previously announced, the FY18 performance at Getting Personal was disappointing, with the sector impacted by heavy discounting and promotional activity.
We continue to target revenue growth at Getting Personal in the year ahead, but recognise the ongoing pressures in its market.

20 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Strategic Report Governance Financials COST OF SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES Cost of sales and operating expenses can be analysed as follows excluding non-underlying items detailed below : FY18 FY17 % of % of Increase m revenue m revenue Decrease Cost of goods sold 138.0 32.7% 119.7 30.1% 15.4% Store wages 74.9 17.7% 68.9 17.3% 8.7% Store property costs 65.5 15.5% 64.8 16.3% 1.1% Other direct expenses 18.6 4.4% 18.2 4.5% 2.1% Cost of sales 297.0 70.3% 271.6 68.2% 9.4% Operating expenses 31.1 7.4% 28.1 7.1% 10.8% excluding depreciation and amortisation.
The overall ratio of cost of sales to revenue has increased to 70.3% on an underlying basis FY17: 68.2% with the following movements in sub-categories: Cost of goods sold: principally comprises cost of raw materials, production costs, finished goods purchased from third party suppliers, import duty, freight costs, carriage costs and warehouse wages.
The increase in this cost ratio, as also seen in the first half of the year, principally reflects the impact of foreign exchange headwinds and an element of margin impact from the strong performance of our complementary non-card range, partly offset by business efficiencies.
The effective exchange rate for FY18 was c$1.38 compared to c$1.64 for FY17.
The rate for FY19 is anticipated to be c$1.34, though this remains subject to any significant shift in Sterling impacting the structured trades that form part of the hedging portfolio.
The additional foreign exchange headwinds for FY19 are expected to be significantly mitigated by further business efficiency initiatives.
Foreign exchange headwinds are then expected to ease for FY20 with a substantial proportion of hedging in place at slightly favourable rates compared to FY19.
Store wages: includes wages and salaries including bonuses for store based staff, together with national insurance, pension contributions, overtime, holiday and sick pay.
As reported with the interim results, this cost has increased as expected as new stores have been opened and pay increases have been awarded, including the impact of the national living wage.
Store property costs: consists principally of store rents net of rental incentives, business rates and service charges.
As reported at the interim stage, this cost has increased in absolute terms as new stores have been opened but as a ratio of revenue has reduced due to rent reductions achieved on lease renewals and the benefit of rates reassessments following the business rates review.
We continue to target improvements in our overall rent roll as we reach break points or expiries on existing leases and expect further rates savings of c0.6m in FY19.
Other direct expenses: includes store opening costs, store utility costs, waste disposal, store maintenance, point of sale costs and marketing costs.
This cost category is largely variable in respect of existing stores and increases with new store openings.
The ratio of other direct expenses to revenue has decreased slightly from 4.5% to 4.4% reflecting ongoing business efficiency initiatives.
The Board anticipate some additional cost pressures for FY19 arising from higher electricity prices and transaction costs from an increasing proportion of debit credit cardpayments.
Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation include items such as support centre remuneration, costs relating to regional and area managers, design studio costs and insurance together with other central overheads and administration costs.
The Group has continued to invest in central infrastructure and people in recent years to support the planned growth and operational improvements: whilst this investment in infrastructure is largely complete there will be an element of cost annualisation in FY19.
Total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by 10.8% to 31.1m FY17: 28.1m representing an increase from 7.1% to 7.4% as a percentage of revenue.
Within the year we resolved a historic national minimum wage position with HMRC.
A payment of c1m was agreed, for which provision had already been made, and therefore had no impact on the FY18 EBITDA result.
Depreciation and amortisation remained broadly in line with prior year at 10.6m FY17: 10.7m.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE With approximately half of the Groups annual cost of goods sold expense relating to products sourced in US Dollars, the Group takes a prudent but flexible approach to hedging the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
The Board adopts the policy of using a combination of vanilla forwards and structured options to hedge this exposure.
The Group has used structured options and similar instruments to good effect for a number of years.
The Board continues to view such instruments, structured appropriately, to be commercially attractive as part of a balanced portfolio approach to exchange rate management, even if from a technical accounting perspective, they may not be deemed to meet the IFRS hedge effectiveness test.
At the date of this announcement, cover is in place for 100% of the anticipated FY19 US Dollar cash requirement with approximately two-thirds covered by vanilla forwards and the balance under structured options.
The effective P&L rate for FY19 is anticipated to be c$1.34 FY18: c$1.38, though this remains subject to any significant shift in Sterling impacting the structured trades that form part of the hedging portfolio.
Cover is in place for approximately two thirds of the anticipated FY20 US Dollar requirement at an average rate of $1.37, predominantly through vanilla forwards with a lower proportion of structured options.

strong operating margins, limited working capital absorption and the relatively low capital expenditure requirements of its PROFIT BEFORE TAX expansion programme.
Underlying profit before tax for the financial year amounted to 80.5m FY17: 85.1m, a decrease of 5.5%.
Cash conversion, calculated as underlying EBITDA less capex and underlying working capital movements divided by underlying EBITDA, decreased slightly to 85.3% FY17: 90.4%.
This decrease reflects slightly higher capex due to the investment in EPOS with a smaller element due to favourable working capital movements last year.

The Board has considered further the capital structure of the Group and continues to recognise the benefits of financial leverage, whilst also wanting to ensure that the Company has sufficient flexibility to invest in the growth of the business.
The Board also notes the underlying leverage of the Group given its lease portfolio, although the Board believes that the Companys average break period for its portfolio is shorter than its peers.
