Alternative performance measures APMs In October 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA published guidelines about the use of APMs.
These are financial measures such as KPIs that are not defined under IFRS.
In our Strategic report we describe our financial performance under our Investment basis, which is itself an APM, and use a number of other measures which, on account of being derived from the Investment basis, are also APMs.
Further information about our use of APMs, including the applicable reconciliations to the IFRS equivalent where appropriate, is provided at the end of the Financial review and should be read alongside our Investment basis to IFRS reconciliation.
Our APMs are gross investment return as a percentage of the opening investment portfolio value, cash realisations, cash investment, operating cash profit, net cash debt and gearing.

Carried interest is paid to participants when the performance hurdles are passed in cash terms and then only when the cash proceeds are actually received following a realisation, refinancing event or other cash distribution.
Due to the length of time between investment and realisation, the schemes are usually active for a number of years and their participants are both current and previous employees of 3i.
During the period, 43 million was paid to participants in the Private Equity plans 2017: 127 million.

At 31 March 2018, EFV investments had generated proceeds of 3.5 billion, including the proceeds from the upcoming sale of Scandlines, and the fund was over 75% of the way towards its cash hurdle.
However, given the relative size and performance of Christ, Etanco and OneMed, the actual payment of carried interest receivable is dependent on the funds realisation of Action.
At 31 March 2018, the EFV investment in Action was valued at 1,815 million 31 March 2017: 1,540 million.
Given the strong performance of Action, and its forecast growth profile, and consistent with our investment strategy for and valuation of the asset, our current assessment is that we do not expect the adoption of IFRS 15 to have a material impact on our recognition of carry receivable from EFV.

The Board will maintain its conservative balance sheet as the Group remained a net divestor in FY2018.

Key accounting judgements and estimates A key judgement is the assessment required to determine the degree of control or influence the Group exercises and the form of any control to ensure that the financial treatment of investment entities is accurate.
The introduction of IFRS 10 resulted in a number of intermediate holding companies being presented at fair value, which has led to reduced transparency of the underlying investment performance.
As a result, the Group continues to present a non-GAAP Investment basis set of financial statements to ensure that the commentary in the Strategic report remains fair, balanced and understandable.
The reconciliation of the Investment basis to IFRS is shown on pages 39 to 42.
In preparing these accounts, the key accounting estimates are the carrying value of our investment assets, which are stated at fair value, and the calculation of carried interest receivable and payable.
Given the importance of the valuation of investments, the Board has a separate Valuations Committee to review the valuation policy, process and application to individual investments.
However, asset valuations for unquoted investments are inherently subjective, as they are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.
At 31 March 2018, 87% by value of the investment assets were unquoted 31 March 2017: 84%.
The valuation of the proprietary capital portfolio is a primary input into the carried interest payable and receivable balances, which are determined by reference to the valuation at 31 March 2018 and the underlying investment management agreements.
