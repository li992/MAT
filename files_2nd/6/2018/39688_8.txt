Within this, our Hedge business, which is our open-ended alternatives platform, accounted for 4.8% of the Groups total.
This was down from 6.5% in 2017 and results from the market headwinds seen in the South African Hedge industry.
Revenues from our Corporate services client base represented 8.9% compared with 10.7% in 2017.
This reduction in relative contribution was purely down to the businesss lower growth rate than seen in Alternatives.
Finally, revenues from Private Clients represented 4.5% of Group sales, down from 6.5% in 2017 with the reduction in overall revenues from Private Client causing this relative fall.

Net finance expense was 1.8 million 2017: 1.1m.
The increase in the year was driven by the increase in leverage as a result of the Overheads performance acquisitions undertaken in the year.
Despite these acquisitions, theGroup continues to maintain a low gearing ratio.

The Group has changed how it presents the alternative profit measure of underlying earnings per share for 2018 and restates the 2017 result on the new accounting treatment.
Had the Group not changed the presentation of underlying diluted earnings per share, the result for 2018 would have been 25.7 pence 2017: 23.7 pence.
The change is presentational only and has no cash impact.
In prior years, the Group calculated underlying earnings per share using the reported tax charge, not adjusting for non-underlying costs, such as amortisation of intangibles.
Historically, the difference between the reported and underlying tax charge was not considered to be material.
However, the correction resulting from the prior period errors increases the tax impact of non-underlying items.
In 2017 the impact increases from approximately 1.6 million to 2.2 million.
The table below shows the tax charge used in arriving at diluted underlying earnings per share both under the old calculation and the revised calculation.
The Board believes that this calculation of EPS is more relevant as it takes into account the tax impact of non-underlying items.
This increase was seen most acutely Cash flow and funding in the Groups highest growth jurisdictions such as Asia-Pacific and The acquisitions of LIS, CP and AgenSynd completed within the Luxembourg where exceptionally strong double-digit growth has year have led to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible resulted in a focus on the delivery of new clients at the expense of assets rising to 255.1 million 2017: 167.3m.
This value represents cash collection.
Trade and other payables rose to 34.5 million 2017: the assets of the acquired companies that are not separately 8.5m.
The increase relates in the main to the increase in deferred identifiable and the value attributed to the acquired customer consideration payments for the LIS, CP and AgenSynd acquisitions.
The Board have established key controls for monitoring the carrying value of these assets.
