Mark Jones Chief Financial Officer MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2018 20 STRATEGIC CORPORATE FINANCIAL SHAREHOLDER REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INFORMATION Our regulatory surplus capital is $265 million at 31 December 2018.
Our proforma surplus capital is $340 million, including the impact of the new lease accounting standard applicable from 1 January 2019 which reduces our surplus capital by approximately $100 million.
This accounting change has no impact on our cash flows, however it is expected to increase the total premises costs recognised in our income statement by up to $5 million each year over the next five years.
It may also result in significant unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses as a result of the revaluation of our sterling lease commitments, which we expect to classify as an adjusting item from 2019 onwards see further discussion on pages 24 and 107.
