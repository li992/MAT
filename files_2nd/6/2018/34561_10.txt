Group share long-term value to shareholders.
The Group has strengthened its financial position further during 2018, including through the sale of the Empress State Building, reducing loan to value to 18 per cent and increasing Group undrawn facilities and cash to 854 million.
The Group has continued to invest in the Covent Garden business through 19 million of acquisitions and 42 million of capital expenditure in the Covent Garden portfolio, predominantly at Floral Court.
At the year end Covent Garden accounted for 80 per cent of the Groups property portfolio by value.
The value of the Covent Garden estate increased by 1.6 per cent like-for-like as a result of rental growth achieved during the year and stable yields, with ERV up by 3.0 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
The Empress State Building was sold at a 30 million premium to valuation.
Market uncertainty continued to impact the London residential market and has resulted in a further decline in land valuations at Earls Court.
The market value of Earls Court Properties, which represents the Groups interests at Earls Court, has decreased by 15.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
Overall, the Group share of total property value has decreased by 2.4 per cent like-for-like.
EPRA net asset value per share also decreased by 2.4 per cent during the year, from 333.8 pence at 31 December 2017 to 325.7 pence.
Combined with the 1.5 pence dividend paid to shareholders during the year, the total return for 2018 is -2.0 per cent.
Underlying earnings from continuing activities increased by 9.6 per cent to 8.0 million with continued net rental income growth at Covent Garden and reduced underlying administration expenses.
Basis of preparation As required by IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements the Group presents its joint ventures under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements.
The Groups interest in joint ventures is disclosed as a single line item in both the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement rather than proportionally consolidating the Groups share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line by line basis.
The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures APMs, financial measures which are not specified under IFRS, to monitor the performance of the business.
These include a number of the Financial Highlights shown on page 3.
Many of the APMs included are based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations reporting framework which aims to improve the transparency, comparability and relevance of published results of public real estate companies in Europe.
A summary of EPRA performance measures and key Group measures included within these financial statements are shown on page 136.
34 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Internally the Board focuses on and reviews information and reports prepared on a Group share basis, which includes the Groups share of joint ventures but excludes the non-controlling interest share of our subsidiaries, as this represents the economic value attributable to the Companys shareholders.
Therefore, to align with the way the Group is managed, this financial review presents the financial position, performance and cash flow analysis on a Group share basis.
The chart below sets out a summary of the main movements in the EPRA net asset value per share over the year.

Non-controlling interest represents TfLs 37 per cent share of ECPL.
IFRS includes amounts receivable from joint ventures which eliminate on a Group share basis.
Adjusted, diluted number of shares in issue at 31 December 2018 was 852.6 million 2017: 850.6 million.
com 35 Financial review continued Investment, development and trading property The revaluation loss on the Groups property portfolio was 84.7 million for the year, representing a 2.4 per cent decrease in value on a like-for-like basis compared with the MSCI Capital Return for the equivalent period of a 2.1 per cent gain.
The Group revaluation loss consists of a 37.3 million gain at Covent Garden and a 122.0 million loss at Earls Court.
Total property return for the year was -0.4 per cent.
The MSCI Total Return Index recorded a 7.5 per cent return for the corresponding period.
The revaluation loss of 84.7 million occurred on investment property.
On an IFRS basis, which includes ECPL at 100 per cent and does not include Lillie Square on a line by line basis, loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property was 146.1 million.
Trading property is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value, therefore valuation surpluses on trading property are not recorded.
Any unrecognised surplus is however reflected within the EPRA net asset value measure.
During the year 4.4 million of the unrealised trading property surplus has been realised.
At 31 December 2018, the unrecognised surplus on trading property was 25.7 million 31 December 2017: 31.8 million which arises solely on the Groups share of trading property at Lillie Square.
Debt and gearing During the year the Group agreed terms for two 12 month extensions to the Lillie Square LP facility at the borrowers option.
As a result, assuming that the second extension is exercised, the Groups earliest repayment date on its facilities would be May 2021.
The Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2018 were 854.4 million 31 December 2017: 690.8 million.
A reconciliation between Group share and IFRS is shown below: 2018 2017 Group Joint Group Joint 1 2 1 2 Share ventures NCI IFRS Share ventures NCI IFRS m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 49.9 20.4 3.0 32.5 52.3 25.7 2.0 28.6 Undrawn committed facilities 804.5 35.0 32.0 801.5 638.5 33.1 32.5 637.9 Cash and undrawn committed facilities 854.4 55.4 35.0 834.0 690.8 58.8 34.5 666.5 1.
Net debt decreased by 161 million to 573 million, principally as a result of the disposal of the Empress State Building, partly offset by further investment into our assets and the acquisitions at Covent Garden.
As set out in the summary adjusted balance sheet, net debt on an IFRS basis was 585 million.
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan to value LTV, which is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by the carrying value of the Groups property portfolio.
The Group focuses most on an LTV measure that includes the notional share of joint venture interests but excludes the share of the non-controlling interest.
The LTV of 17.9 per cent remains comfortably within the Groups limit of no more than 40 per cent.
2018 2017 Loan to value 17.9% 21.3% Interest cover 149% 170% Weighted average debt maturity 6.0 years 6.9 years Weighted average cost of debt 2.9% 2.8% Gross debt with interest rate protection 88% 91% The Groups policy is to eliminate substantially the medium and long-term risk arising from interest rate volatility.
The Groups banking facilities are arranged on a floating rate basis but are generally swapped to fixed rate or capped using derivative contracts.
At 31 December 2018 the proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection was 88 per cent 31 December 2017: 91 per cent.
The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants, details of which are set out on page 135, and has significant levels of headroom against its covenants across all of its debt facilities.
At 31 December 2018 the Group had capital commitments of 53.4 million 61.3 million at 31 December 2017.
Capital commitments consist of 3.8 million for Covent Garden and 49.6 million for Earls Court Properties including the 15.0 million of CLSA instalments and 32.4 million in relation to Lillie Square.

Conditional Land Sale Agreement CLSA In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, which it entered into with LBHF, for the purchase of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates The Estates.
The overall consideration payable is expected to be 105 million cash plus the planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA investment property remains unrecognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as its main underlying asset the land relating to The Estates does not currently meet the recognition criteria under IFRS required for investment and development property.
Annual payments of 15 million commenced in December 2015 and the final payment is due to be paid in December 2019.
Where amounts are paid prior to the transfer of property, they will be carried on the Groups balance sheet as prepayments against future land draw down.
Of the 90 million paid to date, 15 million relates to the acquisition of two properties, held as investment and development property, and 75 million relates to options over The Estates which is held as a prepayment within other receivables.
The remaining future payment totalling 15 million is disclosed as a capital commitment as referred to above.
The prepayment balance will be transferred to investment and development property once the recognition criteria for investment and development property have been met.
Once this occurs, in line with the Groups accounting policy, the land will become subject to bi-annual valuation with any changes reflected in the Groups reported net asset measure.
CASH FLOW A summary of the Groups cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2018 is presented below: Summary cash flow 2018 2017 Group Joint Group Joint 1 2 1 2 Share ventures NCI IFRS Share ventures NCI IFRS m m m m m m m m Operating cash flows after interest and tax from continuing activities 17.5 2.5 0.6 14.4 24.0 10.2 0.6 13.2 Purchase and development of property, plant and equipment 108.7 33.4 9.5 84.8 225.6 27.0 12.6 211.2 Transactions with joint venture partners and non-controlling interests 1.1 1.1 8.3 6.1 7.8 5.6 0.1 13.3 Net sales proceeds from discontinued operation 0.3 0.3 226.0 226.0 Net sales proceeds from subsidiaries 250.7 250.7 4.5 4.5 Net sales proceeds from property 51.1 30.8 0.6 20.9 109.1 92.0 17.1 Net cash flow before financing from continuing activities 174.2 4.0 178.2 88.8 49.2 12.1 27.5 Issue of shares 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 Financing 166.4 3.2 1.0 162.2 75.7 46.3 10.6 18.8 Dividends paid 8.2 8.2 6.7 6.7 Transfers with discontinued operation 5.4 5.4 Other 4.0 4.0 3.8 3.8 3 Net cash flow from continuing activities 4.3 7.2 1.0 3.9 8.3 2.9 1.5 3.9 Net cash flow from discontinued operation 0.2 0.2 Net cash flow 4.3 7.2 1.0 3.9 8.1 2.9 1.5 3.7 1.
Net cash flow is based on unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and therefore does not include the movement in Lillie Square deposits on a Group share basis of 1.9 million 2017: 14.6 million.
com 37 Financial review continued Operating cash outflows of 17.5 million are as a result of changes in net working capital requirements.
During the year, 57.4 million was invested at Covent Garden for the purchase of three properties and subsequent expenditure for the development of property predominantly at Floral Court.
At Earls Court, total expenditure of 51.3 million primarily relates to enablement works on ECPL land including the acquisition of the final residential unit at Empress Place and the construction of Lillie Square Phase 2.
The disposal of the Empress State Building, effected through the sale of subsidiaries, resulted in a net inflow of 248.9 million after transaction-related costs.
The proceeds were used to reduce the Groups net debt position and will be deployed in Capcos core central London estates.
Net proceeds from subsidiaries also includes 1.8 million relating to deferred consideration on the disposal of the Brewery by EC&O Limited on 9 February 2012.
Net sales proceeds from property of 51.1 million Group share relates to the disposal of seven units at Floral Court and 41 units at Lillie Square.
IFRS net borrowings repaid during the year were 162.2 million.
Adjusted for net borrowings repaid in joint ventures and the Groups non-controlling interest the reduction was 166.4 million.
Dividends paid of 8.2 million reflect the final dividend payment made in respect of the 2017 financial year and the interim dividend paid in September 2018.
This was higher than the previous year due to a lower take up of the scrip dividend alternative, 35 per cent versus 47 per cent for the final dividend in 2017.
IFRS cash and cash equivalents has increased by 3.9 million to 32.5 million.
Lillie Square Phase 1 completions has reduced the cash held for deposits and as a result the Groups share of cash and cash equivalents has decreased by 2.4 million to 49.9 million.

Further details regarding the EPRA and Company specific adjustments are disclosed within note 14 Earnings Per Share and Net Assets Per Share within the consolidated financial statements.
Income Covent Garden net rental income has increased by 8.6 million due to 4.4 million of like-for-like growth and 4.2 million through current and prior year acquisitions and developments.
The Group continues to convert reversionary potential into contracted rents resulting in a like-for-like net rental income growth at Covent Garden of 9.6 per cent.
ERV at Covent Garden increased by 3.0 per cent, like-for-like, from 104.8 million to 107.7 million.
Earls Court net rental income has decreased by 11.5 million, primarily as a result of the Empress State Building sale.
On an overall basis, increased net rental income at Covent Garden has been offset by the loss of income from the Empress State Building resulting in a decrease in Group net rental income of 2.7 million IFRS: 2.5 million.
Loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property The loss on revaluation of the Groups investment and development property was 80.9 million.
Covent Garden recorded a gain on revaluation of 37.3 million as a result of rental growth.
The loss on revaluation at Earls Court of 118.2 million was driven by changes in valuers assumptions.
The IFRS loss on revaluation, which includes the non-controlling interest share of ECPL losses, was 148.2 million.
The sale of seven apartments at Floral Court resulted in a 2.1 million gain above the previous recognised valuation gain.
com 39 Financial review continued Administration expenses Underlying administration expenses have been reduced by 2.0 million due to efficiency initiatives.
4.9 million of costs were incurred during the year in relation to the possible demerger and related activity.
Net finance costs Net finance costs have decreased to 19.2 million due to the lower level of average borrowings during the year.
Taxation The total tax charge for the year, made up of both underlying tax and non-underlying tax, is 4.3 million.
Tax on underlying profits of the Group was 1.4 million which reflects a rate in line with the current rate of UK corporation tax.
The main rate of corporation tax reduced from 20 per cent to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017.
The corporation tax rate will reduce further to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020.
Contingent tax, being the amount of tax that would become payable on a theoretical disposal of all investment property held by the Group, as at 31 December 2018 was nil 31 December 2017: nil.
A disposal of the Groups trading properties at their market value, before utilisation of carried forward losses, would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 4.9 million 19 per cent of 25.7 million.
IAS 12 provides for the recognition of a deferred tax asset where it is probable that there will be future taxable profit against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
As a result of the application of this provision, the Group has not recognised the deferred tax asset on decreases to the carrying value of investment property and certain losses carried forward.
The Groups tax policy, which has been approved by the Board and is available on the Group website, is aligned with the business strategy.
The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by structuring operations in a tax efficient manner, with external advice as appropriate, which complies with all relevant tax law and regulations and does not impact adversely our reputation as a responsible taxpayer.
As a Group, we are committed to acting in an open and transparent manner.
Consistent with the Groups policy of complying with relevant tax legislation and having regard to key stakeholders, the Group maintains a constructive and open working relationship with HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment may be uncertain.
Dividends The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be paid on 16 May 2019 to shareholders on the register at 12 April 2019.
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
Going concern At 31 December 2018 the Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities were 854.4 million and its capital commitments were 53.4 million.
With a weighted average debt maturity of six years, loan to value of 17.9 per cent and sufficient headroom against all financial covenants, there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to meet both ongoing and future commitments for at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 2018 Annual Report & Accounts.
