Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Performance review Key performance indicators KPIs The Group tracks its performance using two operating KPIs, four financial KPIs and one funding target that the Board believes are key indicators of progress against the Groups strategic and financial targets.
In addition the Group has a number of guidance measures at a Group, divisional and business level, details of which are set out in the financial performance section on pages 28 to 31.
These include non-GAAP measures, the derivation of which is shown in the notes to the financial statements referenced in the heading to each measure.
Where the Groups KPI is based on a non-GAAP measure, rather than its GAAP equivalent, this is because in the Directors view the non-GAAP measure provides a better indicator of the performance of the underlying business.

The Group maintained its stance to recover input cost inflation across the trade-focused businesses in 2018, with overall price inflation across the Group of 2.7%.
The highest inflation was experienced in the Contracts division where commodity price inflation had the most concentrated impact, but this tempered over the course of the year.
Pricing in the UK DIY market was extremely competitive through the year, with Wickes making targeted investments in price in certain categories to drive volume.
This was successful, particularly in core categories in the fourth quarter of the year, but had a detrimental impact on gross margins.
The competitive pressures began to ease towards the end of 2018 and market pricing became more rational.
