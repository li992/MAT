They are not recognised profit measures under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND TREASURY The Group reports its results in GBP, but trades internationally and is therefore exposed to currency fluctuations on currency cash flows in various ways.
These include purchasing inventory from overseas suppliers, making sales in currencies other than GBP and holding overseas assets in other currencies.
The Board mitigate the cash flow risks associated with these fluctuations with the careful use of currency hedging using forwards and options.
The Group uses forward contracts that qualify for hedge accounting in two main ways to hedge highly probable Euro sales income and US dollar stock purchases.
This introduces a level of certainty into the Groups planning and forecasting process.
During the period the Group entered into vanilla foreign exchange US dollar forwards totalling $1,440m.
Management have reviewed detailed forecasts and the growth assumptions within them, and are satisfied that the forecasts meet the criteria as being highly probable forecast transactions.
As at 29 April 2018, the Group had the following forward contracts that qualified for Hedge Accounting under IAS39 Financial Instruments, meaning that fluctuations in the value of the contracts before maturity are recognised in the Hedging Reserve through Other Comprehensive Income.
After maturity, the sales and purchases are then valued at the Hedge rate.

Regular reviews are performed by the SD Treasury team alongside senior management to ensure the continued appropriateness of the currency hedging in place, and where suitable either implementing additional strategies and or restructuring existing approaches in conjunction with our financial institution partners.
Given the potential impact of commodity prices on raw material costs, the Group may hedge certain input costs, including cotton, crude oil and electricity.
TAXATION The effective tax rate on Profit before tax in FY18 was 64.4% FY17: 17.7%.
This is due to the impact of current year investment losses that are not tax deductible and prior year adjustments.
The prior year rate reflects the impact of items that qualify for substantial shareholder relief.
The underlying effective tax rate remains at approx.
31%, this reflects the impact of the increase in freehold property and related disallowable depreciation.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS Strategic investments are an integral part of the Groups overall strategy.
Against a backdrop of a challenged retail market, we believe innovative strategic partnerships will help to differentiate our offer and enhance the consumer experience.
We look for ways to extend our reach into new retail channels and geographies, as well as selectively grow our market share.
We maintain an active dialogue with the management teams of each of our investments, continually looking to explore new ways of working together.
Given the breadth of our business, the strategic benefits can be varied and extensive.
During FY18 we made good progress on several opportunities, highlighting the strength of our strategic investments approach.
In February 2018, we announced an exciting collaboration agreement with GAME Digital plc comprising a 20 million working capital facility and a 35 million capital expenditure facility, which GAME may utilise to fund the venues envisaged under the collaboration agreement, including the costs for new venues and ongoing development of the BELONG website and its related tournament management system.
The Group owns a 25.4% stake in GAME Digital.
The agreement covers the rollout of BELONG and GAME Retail stores, including plans to enter into concession agreements with Sports Direct.
BELONG is GAME Digital's competitive gaming and eSports experience centred around physical 'arenas', bringing both casual and competitive gaming to communities nationwide, in city and town centres and in major shopping centres.

We are also considering access to other Sports Direct owned brands in future seasons.

This role does not enable Liam Rowley to make or influence strategic decisions and he is excluded from certain sensitive and confidential matters as well as those that may cause a conflict of interest.
During the period, the Group increased its total direct and indirect holding in Debenhams plc to 29.7% of issued share capital.

Subsequent to the year end, JD Sports Fashion plc completed their takeover of The Finish Line Inc. and Sports Direct International plc disposed of its remaining economic interest.
The Group continues to hold various other interests, none of which represent more than 5.0% of the voting power of the investee.

ACQUISITIONS During the year, the Group completed the acquisition of the US retail chains operating under Bobs Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports.
We also acquired the remaining shareholdings of Lovells Sports Holdings Ltd and Brasher Leisure Ltd trading as Sweatshop, both of which were previously Associates of the Group.
RELATED PARTIES MM Prop Consultancy Ltd, a company owned and controlled by Michael Murray domestic partner of Anna Ashley, daughter of Mike Ashley, continues to provide property consultancy services to the Group.
MM Prop Consultancy Ltd is primarily tasked with finding and negotiating the acquisition of new sites in the UK, Europe and rest of the world for both our larger format stores and our combined retail and gym units but it also provides advice to the Companys inhouse property team in relation to existing sites in the UK, Europe and rest of the world.
MM Prop Consultancy Ltd fees are linked directly to value creation which is determined by the Company's nonexecutive directors who independently review performance bi-annually with a view to determining, at their absolute and sole discretion, the quantum of the percentage payable.
Under the terms of the agreement with MM Prop Consultancy Ltd no fees are payable until the earliest of 30 September 2018 so that the Companys independent nonexecutive directors have a sufficient amount of time to assess performance.
During the period, independent valuations were collated as an initial stage in confirming the value created through disposals and properties still held by MM Prop Consultancy Limited.
The Groups non-executive directors agreed 25% of the final agreed value created would be paid to MM Prop Consultancy Ltd based on these independent valuations of selected sites subject to the agreement.
The value created had not been determined and approved by the nonexecutive directors as at period end or at the date of signing this Annual Report and accounts.
74 The freehold acquisition program is a cornerstone of the elevation strategy and has proven to be extraordinarily successful.
With a strong ongoing pipeline and with original expectations exceeded, Michael Murray has waived a portion of his fee and settled on 20% of the final agreed value created.
Based on IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets we have provided for the most reliable estimate of the amount expected to be paid to MM Prop Consultancy Ltd being 5.0m to the end of FY18.
Michael Murray is now considered to be a related party in the context of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures.
This is due to the increased scope of his role within the Group in the second half of the financial period, as he became Head of Elevation in 2018, defining him as key management personnel.
COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS The Group has commercial arrangements in place with IBSL Consultancy Limited.
Management has considered whether a related party relationship exists and concluded that Justin Barnes, a director of IBSL Consultancy Limited, and or IBSL Consultancy Limited are acting in an advisory capacity only and are not performing key management functions that would indicate a related party relationship.
Management decisions are made solely by the management of the Group.
Justin Barnes is a director of a number of companies in the Mash Group of which Mike Ashley is the sole shareholder of the ultimate parent of the group, Mash Holdings Limited.
No payments made to Justin Barnes or IBSL Consultancy Limited in relation to services provided to subsidiaries of Mash Holdings Limited relate to services provided by IBSL Consultancy Limited or Justin Barnes to the Group.
