48 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic Report Financial review Loss for the year The Groups IFRS loss for the year, attributable to equity shareholders, was 268.1 million, 656.5 million lower than the profit made in 2017.
This was principally due to net revaluation losses on the Groups property portfolio totalling 448.6 million, net losses on property disposals of 64.9 million and lower revaluation gains on the premium outlets portfolio, from gains of 225.2 million in 2017 to 56.2 million in 2018.
Management principally reviews the Groups performance on an adjusted basis to monitor the Groups underlying earnings as it excludes capital and non-recurring items such as valuation movements, gains or losses on the disposal of properties and other one-off exceptional items.
This approach is consistent with other property companies and we follow EPRA guidance to calculate adjusted figures.
A reconciliation of loss profit to adjusted profit for the year is shown in Table 27.

In 2018, net rental income NRI decreased by 22.9 million to 347.5 million.
The like-for-like portfolio saw a decline in income of 4.1 million compared with 2017.
This was driven by the impact of tenant failures, which totalled 7.1 million across the Group and a reduction in surrender premiums received compared with 2017.
2.2 million of the total like-for-like decline related to the UK retail parks portfolio with a further 1.9 million from the Groups flagship destinations.
Acquisitions generated 4.1 million of additional income predominantly arising from Pavilions, Swords which was the final Irish loan to convert to property ownership in September 2017.
In 2018 the Groups change in like-for-like NRI of 1.3%, as shown in KPIs on page 16, includes the performance of all our Irish flagship assets where the underlying net rental income received in 2017 prior to the conversion to property ownership ofthe final secured loan was treated as finance income.
Like-for-like NRI performance by sector is further explained in the Operating review on pages 18 to 33.
Disposals reduced income in 2018 by 31.8 million.
2017 disposals at Westwood Gateway Retail Parks in Thanet, Place des Halles in Strasbourg and Saint Sbastien, Nancy contributed to a reduction of 22.0 million.
In 2018, disposals of Battery Retail Park in Birmingham, Wrekin Retail Park Telford, Imperial Retail Park in Bristol, Fife Central Retail Park, Kirkcaldy, Jeu fide Paume, Beauvais and the 50% disposal of Highcross resulted in a further income reduction of 9.8 million compared with 2017.
Developments and other factors increased net rental income by 7.8 million.
Key contributors to this uplift included the completion of the second phase of the Elliotts Field development in Rugby in November 2017, development at the Orchard Centre, Didcot which completed in spring 2018, and additional income from UK other properties in Leeds and Croydon.
Administration expenses Table 30 Administration expenses analysis Year ended Year ended 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Proportionally consolidated, excluding premium outlets m m Employee costs excluding variable costs 47.8 44.7 Variable employee costs 4.3 11.7 Property fee income 14.8 13.7 Other corporate costs 17.7 18.3 Employee and corporate costs 55.0 61.0 Management fees receivable 10.3 12.1 Net administration expenses 44.7 48.9 In 2018, 0.2 million 2017: 0.5 million of the Groups proportionally consolidated administration expenses related to the Groups Share of Property interests.
At 44.7 million, net administration expenses reduced by 4.2 million, or 4.3 million at constant exchange rates.
This decrease was largely due to variable employee costs which were 7.4 million lower.
This was associated with reduced 2018 bonus payments and the reversal of the accrual for the total property return element of the 2017 annual bonus where the payout threshold was not achieved when the outcome was finalised in April 2018.
The reduction in administration expenses was partially offset by lower management fees receivable in 2018, as 2017 included a one-off development management fee paid on the full opening of Westquay South.
Our accounting policy is to capitalise the cost of staff working directly on on-site development projects.
In 2018, 1.3 million of staff costs were capitalised on this basis, compared with 0.1 million in 2017.
50 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic Report Financial review Cost ratio The EPRA cost ratio for the year ended 31 December 2018 was 21.9%, 30 basis points higher than 2017.
The net administration expenses element ofthe ratio has reduced by 40 basis points to 11.5% consistent with the reduction in expenses explained above.
The property costs element has increased from 9.7% to 10.4% due to costs associated with tenant failure.
The sale of four retail parks also increased this ratio, as they have a lower level of property outgoings relative to the Groups other sectors.
The calculation of the cost ratio is included as Table 93 of the Additional disclosures on page 179.
Loss on sale of properties During 2018, we sold 11 properties raising proceeds of 570 million, or 553 million after deducting selling costs.
Over 40% of these proceeds related to the sale of 50% of Highcross.
These disposals resulted in a loss of 65 million Reported Group: 80 million against December 2017 valuations.
The losses principally related to Highcross, Leicester and Jeu fide Paume, Beauvais.
Acquisition-related costs The Group recognised 6.4 million of acquisition-related costs during 2018, in addition to 6.5 million recognised in the second half of 2017.
These costs were predominantly in relation to professional advisor and finance facility fees incurred due to the proposed acquisition of intu which was announced in December 2017 and the offers from Klpierre S. A. in March and April 2018.
Both transactions were withdrawn in April 2018 and the costs have been excluded from the Groups adjusted earnings.
Share of results of joint ventures and associates, including investments in premium outlets The Group has interests in 16 joint ventures 2017: 15 and the share of the results of joint ventures under IFRS for the year ended 31 December 2018 was a loss of 106.4 million 2017: 180.5 million profit.
Further details are provided in note 13 to the financial statements.
As explained at the beginning of the Financial review on page 48, for management reporting purposes we review the Groups property portfolio on aproportionally consolidated basis, to reflect the Groups different ownership shares.
We do not proportionally consolidate the Groups premium outlet investments in Value Retail VR and VIA Outlets VIA.
These are externally managed by experienced outlet operators, independently financed and have operating metrics which differ from the Groups other properties.
Due to the differing nature of the Groups control, VIA is accounted for as a joint venture and VR is accounted for as an associate.
Table 31 below shows the contribution to the Groups adjusted profit from joint ventures and associates, split between the proportionally consolidated properties and the investments in premium outlets.

In 2017, the loan, and hence interest income was in a joint venture, but since the property was acquired it has been accounted for as a joint operation, with the Groups share of results proportionally consolidated in the Reported Group.
Adjusted earnings from premium outlets of 41.1 million were 3.3 million higher than in 2017.
The Groups share of VIA earnings increased by 1.9million due principally to acquisitions including Zweibrcken Fashion Outlet and Vila do Conde Porto Fashion Outlet in the first half of 2017.
VRs earnings increased by 1.4 million as the effect of the acquisition of additional investor stakes in 2018 was partially offset by higher finance and administration costs.
Interest costs increased in 2018 as the premium outlets portfolio has taken advantage of low interest rates through a number of refinancings to increase the maturity profile of its borrowings.
This has enabled reinvestment through development and other capital expenditure in addition to increased distributions.
Further details of the Groups joint ventures and associates are shown in notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements respectively.
The operating performance of our premium outlets is described in the Operating review on pages 26 to 29 and the combined profit contribution is in Table 98 of the Additional disclosures on page 182. www.
com 51 Financial review continued Finance costs Net finance costs, calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis totalled 132.9 million in 2018, compared with 170.4 million in 2017.
124.5million related to the Reported Group and 8.4 million to the Share of Property interests as shown in note 2 to the financial statements.
Adjusted finance costs, which excludes the change in fair value of derivatives, debt cancellation costs and other non-recurring items, totalled 101.7million in 2018, a decrease of 5.9 million, or 6.6 million at constant exchange rates.
The decrease is principally due to the redemption of the 250million 2020 6.875% bonds in October 2017 and the redemption of the 500 million 2019 2.75% bonds in August 2018.
This was offset by lower finance income, largely due to the final Irish loan conversion in September 2017 and the impact of increases in UK base rates in November 2017 and August 2018 on the cost of floating rate debt.
Interest capitalised on development schemes at Orchard Centre, Didcot, Italie Deux and Les 3 Fontaines totalled 1.9 million in 2018, compared with 0.8 million in 2017.
The supporting calculation for adjusted finance costs is shown in Table 101 of the Additional disclosures on page 184.
Tax The Group has tax exempt status in the UK, France and Ireland and is exempt from corporation tax on rental income and gains arising on property sales.
The current tax charge, on a proportionally consolidated basis, was 1.9 million, 0.1 million higher than the previous year.
The tax charge for the Reported Group was unchanged at 1.8 million for both years.
We publish guidance explaining the Groups tax strategy and have updated this for 2019.
Hammersons Approach to Tax for the year ending 31 December 2019 is available on the Groups website www.
Dividends and share buyback The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 14.8 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 11.1 pence, the total for 2018 is 25.9 pence, compared with 25.5 pence in 2017.
The final dividend is flat year-on-year in order to maintain a high income yield for shareholders and indicate confidence in significant 2019 disposals, which would reduce future EPS but offer enough cover for the current dividend level.
The final dividend is payable on 2 May 2019 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 22 March 2019.
7.4 pence will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the balance of 7.4 pence paid as a normal dividend.
In July 2018, the Company announced the commencement of a 300 million share buyback programme, returning proceeds realised from disposals to shareholders over a twelve month period.
At 31 December 2018, major we had purchased 28 million shares at a total cost of 129 million inclusive of fees.
The accretive effect of the buyback on EPS and NAV per share is shown in tables 28 and 32 respectively.
In January 2019, the suspension of the share buyback programme was announced.
The Board has now decided to put the programme on hold until the Group achieves its enhanced disposal goal and sees greater market certainly.
Net assets During 2018, equity shareholders funds decreased by 591 million, or 9.8%, to 5,433 million at 31 December 2018.
Net assets, calculated on an EPRA basis, were 5,650 million and on a per share basis reduced by 38 pence to 7.38.

Adjustments in accordance with EPRA best practice shown in note 11D to the financial statements on page 145.
52 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic Report Financial review The reduction in EPRA net assets was primarily the result of net property revaluation losses totalling 392 million, mainly in the UK flagships and retail parks portfolios as explained in the Property portfolio review on page 46.
This was partially offset by adjusted profit which increased net assets by 240 million.
Dividends and the share buyback reduced net assets by 203 million and 129 million respectively.
Investment and development properties The valuation of investment and development properties in the Reported Group at 31 December 2018 was 3,830 million, 856 million lower than the prior year.

Net revaluation deficits totalling 272 million were partially offset by the sale of Highcross into a joint venture and the associated refinancing net increase of 154million, distributions to the Reported Group of 99 million and adjusted earnings of 142 million.
The Groups total adjusted investment in premium outlets increased by 179 million in 2018 to 1,754 million.
The increase was primarily due to our additional investment of 114 million through the acquisition of direct investor stakes in Bicester, La Valle, La Roca and Las Rozas Villages.
Property revaluation gains contributed a further 56 million to the uplift.
An analysis of the Groups combined investment in premium outlets is shown in Table 99 in the Additional disclosures on page 182. Financing and cash flow Our financing strategy is to generally borrow on an unsecured basis on the strength of the Groups covenant to maintain operational flexibility, although secured borrowings are occasionally used, mainly in conjunction with joint venture partners.
Borrowings are arranged to maintain short term liquidity and to ensure an appropriate maturity profile.
Acquisitions may initially be financed using short term funds before being refinanced with longer term funding when market conditions are appropriate.
Short term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships.
Long term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds and private placements and is secured against certain properties held by joint ventures.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The Board regularly reviews the Groups financing strategy and approves financing guidelines against which it monitors the Groups financial structure.
These guidelines, together with the relevant metrics, are summarised in Table 34 which illustrates the Groups robust financial position.

Net debt On a proportionally consolidated basis, net debt at 31 December 2018 was 3,406 million, a reduction of 95 million during the year.
This comprises loans of 3,423 million, the fair value of currency swaps of 85 million, less cash and deposits of 102 million.
Cash and deposits were 164 million lower than at 31 December 2017 due to the receipt of sale proceeds from Place des Halles, Strasbourg at the end of 2017 which were used to repay floating rate debt facilities in January 2018.
The movement in proportionally consolidated net debt is analysed in Table 35.

2018 has been another active year from a financing perspective: In the first half of the year, we exercised extension options within our existing revolving credit facilities and received approval to extend the maturities for commitments totalling 770 million by one year from April 2022 to April 2023 In August, we redeemed the Groups 500 million 2.75% bonds due September 2019.
We incurred a one-off redemption premium of 15.3million which has been treated as an exceptional financing cost.
The redemption was funded using liquidity from disposals and contributed to the reduced weighted average cost of debt In November, as part of the 50% sale of Highcross for 236 million, the new joint venture signed a 165.2 million loan agreement 82.6 million Hammerson share.
The new loan was secured on the property on a non-recourse basis and is repayable in full at maturity in February 2024.
The interest cost was fixed at less than 3% 54 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2018 Strategic Report Financial review The Groups liquidity at 31 December 2018, comprising cash and undrawn committed facilities, was 729 million, 229 million lower than at the beginning of the year.
The Groups weighted average maturity of debt reduced marginally to 5.4 years 2017: 5.6years.
We manage exposure to foreign exchange translation differences on euro-denominated assets through a combination of euro borrowings and derivatives.
At 31 December 2018, the value of euro-denominated liabilities as a proportion of the value of euro-denominated assets was 79%, compared with 78% at the beginning of the year.
Interest on euro debt also acts as a hedge against exchange differences arising on net income from our overseas operations.
The sterling: euro exchange rate has remained broadly stable during the year, accordingly foreign exchange movements have not had a significant impact on the Groups financial results in 2018.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities and the private placement senior notes contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing should not exceed 150% and that interest cover should be not less than 1.25 times.
Two of our unsecured bonds contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 150%, whilst the covenant on the remaining bonds is that gearing should not exceed 175%.
The bonds have no covenant for interest cover.
The Groups financial ratios are comfortably within these covenants.
The valuation of the Groups property portfolio at 31 December 2018 would have to fall by 29%, or over 55% for the UK portfolio only, to breach the highest of the Groups covenants.
Planned future disposals will act to increase this headroom.
Fitch and Moodys rate Hammersons unsecured credit as A and Baa1 respectively.
"Following the termination of the Groups offer to acquire intu, in May 2018 Fitch removed their ""rating watch negative"" and affirmed Hammersons long-term credit ratings of Issuer Default Rating BBB and senior unsecured rating at A-."
These ratings from Fitch have remained unchanged since June 2011.
Moodys long-term rating for Hammerson of Baa1 stable outlook has not changed since February 2015 when it was upgraded from Baa2.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups loan to value was 38% and gearing was 63%, compared with 36% and 58% respectively at the beginning of the year.
Supporting calculations are in Table 103 in the Additional disclosures on page 184.
At 31 December 2018, the Groups share of net debt in VR and VIA totalled 900 million 2017: 686 million.
On a proforma basis, proportionally consolidating this net debt with the Groups share of net debt and property values held by VR and VIA, the Groups gearing would be 79% 2017: 69% and loan to value would be 43% 2017: 40%.
