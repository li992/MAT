KEP is derived from the concept of Economic Value Added representing earnings after a charge for the annual cost of capital employed in the business.
Earnings are defined as adjusted post-tax profit, excluding interest, property lease costs and exceptional items.
A charge is then deducted by applying the weighted average cost of capital WACC to capital employed.
For the purposes of consistency both WACC and capital employed are lease adjusted.
Leases are capitalised based on an estimate of their long-term property yields.
In order to focus on controllable factors both WACC and long-term property yields are based on those in place when KEP was introduced.
