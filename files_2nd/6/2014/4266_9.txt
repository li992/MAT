Non-IFRS measures Although we prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS, we also report and discuss additional measures that we call underlying.
These underlying measures are not IFRS measures.
Management believes that these underlying measures provide investors with useful information regarding our ongoing performance by excluding certain amounts that are included in the comparable IFRS numbers.
You can nd a description of these underlying measures and their limitations, an explanation of why management believes they are useful to investors and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure on pages 144 to 147.

For a more detailed explanation, please see the analysis on pages 20 to 27.
This was mainly due to a 70% reduction in revenue from our Legacy segment, in line with our expectations as these discontinued products progressed to the end of their product life cycle: a reduction in volumes from our aftermarket business within our Auto segment: lower sales in cameras following our decision, announced in December 2013, to cease development of next generation camera-on-a chip 'COACH' products and a decline in Gaming chip volumes.
These decreases were partially offset by an 11% increase in revenue from the Voice & Music segment, reecting growth in high-end stereo speakers and headsets.
In 2014, our IFRS gross margins increased to 58.1% 2013: 51.6% primarily due to a shift in product mix from our lower margin Legacy segment to the higher margin Voice & Music business.
These factors also accounted for the increase in 2014 of underlying gross margin to 58.5% 2013: 52.4%.
The increases in gross margin percentages were not enough to offset the effect of declining revenues and, so in absolute terms gross profit decreased to $449.9 million in 2014 2013: $495.3 million whilst underlying gross profit decreased to $453.2 million in 2014 2013: $503.4 million for the same reasons.
Total operational costs, which comprise Research & Development R&D expenses and Sales, General and Administration SG&A expenses, decreased 16% to $391.1 million in 2014 2013: $466.8 million.
This decrease was primarily driven by reduced variable employee expenses, lower restructuring costs and litigation activity and a reduction in external development costs.
Underlying operational costs decreased by 14% to $343.3 million in 2014 2013: $399.1 million.
This was mainly due to the combined effect of a reduction in variable employee benefit costs and external development costs as well as lower costs due to reduced litigation activity.
18 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Operating profit for 2014 was $97.0 million 2013: Operating loss $48.4 million.
Underlying operating profit increased to $109.9 million in 2014 2013: $104.3 million as the lower revenue was more than offset by the strong underlying gross margin and lower operational costs.
Qualcomm Transaction On 15 October 2014, the boards of CSR and Qualcomm Incorporated Qualcomm announced that agreement had been reached regarding the terms of a recommended cash offer for the Company, whereby Qualcomm Global Trading Pte.
Ltd. QGT, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, will acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of CSR the Qualcomm Transaction.
More details of this transaction can be found on page 148.
In connection with the Qualcomm Transaction, we incurred $12.0 million of costs during 2014 as described on page 23.
Sale of Imaging Intellectual Property IP Assets & Impairment Reversal In December 2013, we announced our decision to discontinue further investment in the development of next generation COACH platform products.
This decision lead to an impairment of assets associated with the COACH business and the redundancy of 152 employees as explained in the Cameras section on page 20.
In early June 2014, due to the progress of negotiations to sell certain Imaging IP associated with the COACH business, we determined that the IP previously impaired had a market value and we therefore re-assessed the carrying value of these assets.
This lead to a reversal of some of the impairment charges made against these assets in 2013, resulting in a credit to operating profit of $23.3 million in 2014.
On 8 June 2014, we completed the sale of this Imaging IP associated with the COACH business, together with the transfer of 28 employees allocated to the COACH business, for a total consideration of $44.0 million.
The gain on disposal of Imaging IP was $14.9 million.
No assets or employees remain allocated to the COACH business.
Returns to Shareholders During 2014, we bought back 6.4 million of our own ordinary shares in the open market for an aggregate of $61.9 million, the details of which are disclosed on pages 78 and 79.
In addition, during 2014 the CSR Employee benefit Trust EBT purchased 0.8 million of CSR ordinary shares in the open market for an aggregate of $7.6 million.
On 5 September 2014, the Company paid an interim dividend of $0.052 per ordinary share.
In view of the proposed Qualcomm Transaction, the Board does not intend to recommend a final dividend in respect of the 2014 financial year.
Highlights of 2013 IFRS Underlying 2013 2012 2013 2012 Revenue $960.7m $1,025.4m $960.7m $1,025.4m Gross margin51.6% 49.6% 52.4% 50.8% Goodwill and non-current asset impairment $76.9m profit on disposal of development operations $127.2m Operating loss profit $48.4m $107.9m $104.3m $74.0m Loss profit for the period $46.4m $51.2m $81.1m $55.4m Diluted loss earnings per share $0.28 $0.25 $0.46 $0.27 Net cash from operating activities $82.3m $73.9m $82.3m $73.9m Treasury deposits, cash and cash equivalents $306.2m $333.3m $306.2m $333.3m Trading Summary We summarise below our performance in 2013 in comparison to 2012.
For a more detailed explanation, please see analysis on pages 26 to 30.
This was mainly due to an expected fall in sales of Legacy products, particularly the revenue from handset connectivity and handset location products after these transferred to Samsung in Q4 2012.
We also saw a significant decline in digital still camera products within our Consumer segment reecting the shift in the market towards smartphones and tablets.
These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes of higher priced products in the Voice & Music and Auto segments.
Our IFRS gross margins increased to 51.6% in 2013 2012: 49.6% primarily due to a shift in product mix away from lower margin handset products, combined with the strong growth in the higher margin Voice & Music business.
Underlying gross margin increased to 52.4% for the same reasons 2012: 50.8%.
Total operational costs decreased by 12% to $466.8 million in 2013 2012: $528.4 million.
This reduction in costs was primarily driven by a reduction in underlying operational costs, a $10.9 million reduction in litigation costs and the release of a $9.8 million litigation provision.
This was offset by a $10.4 million increase in share based payment costs driven by the increase in share price and the higher volume of shares issued to employees.
Underlying operational costs fell by 11% to $399.1 million in 2013 2012: $446.4 million.
This was mainly due to the full year benefit of lower headcount following restructuring programmes which completed in 2012 and included the transfer of 311 employees as part of the transaction with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd for the disposal of our handset connectivity and handset location development operations the Samsung Transaction that completed in 2012. www.
com 19 Financial report continued The operating loss for 2013 was $48.4 million after the impact of the non-cash $76.9 million impairment charge in connection with the discontinuation of development of COACH products, and other non-underlying items.
Underlying operating profit grew to $104.3 million in 2013 2012: $74.0 million due to the strong underlying gross margin and lower operational costs, as mentioned above.
Cameras On 10 December 2013, we announced our decision to discontinue development of next generation COACH platform products, in order to focus investment on higher growth markets.
This decision resulted in a non-cash impairment to goodwill, intangible assets and tangible assets allocated to the Cameras cash generating unit CGU of $76.9 million.
This charge comprised $50.5 million impairment on goodwill, $26.2 million on intangible assets and $0.2 million on tangible assets.
In connection with this action, we incurred restructuring costs of $6.5 million which were mainly due to the redundancies of 152 employees in the Camera business who were not redeployed within the Group, and which completed during 2014.
Returns to Shareholders During 2013, we bought back 8.45 million of our own ordinary shares in the open market for an aggregate of $67.8 million.
In addition during 2013, the Employee benefit Trust purchased 0.5 million CSR ordinary shares in the open market for an aggregate of $4.8 million.
We paid a dividend of $0.136 per ordinary share, of which $0.091 was paid as a final dividend in May 2014, and $0.045 was paid as an interim dividend in September 2013.
Litigation During 2013 we paid $12.0 million to settle outstanding lawsuits of which $7.5 million had been accrued in 2012.
In March 2013, the US Supreme Court dismissed the case brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against two former ofcers of Microtune, Inc. in respect of which CSR assumed certain indemnification obligations as a result of the acquisition of Zoran Corporation in 2011.
As a consequence of the courts decision, we released a litigation provision of $9.8 million.
Review of 2014 2014 Segmental Performance We divide our operations into four reporting segments, Voice & Music, Auto, and Consumer which form our Core business, and Legacy.
These segments are described on pages 2 and 3.
Results for the four segments are regularly reviewed by senior management including the CEO who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to understand how each area has impacted the results of our Group and inform decisions on resource allocation.
Therefore, we report the results of these business areas as operational and reporting segments as dened by IFRS 8.
There were no changes to these segments during 2014.
The table below shows our segmental performance in 2014 and 2013.
During 2014, we saw increased sales volumes from the higher margin factory-t market due to the increasing adoption of Bluetooth, location products and Wi-Fi technologies in cars.
This is part of the general trend by Tier One manufacturers to incorporate connectivity and location features in their vehicles and we expect this to continue as car manufacturers seek to provide drivers and passengers with enhanced in-car information and entertainment.
As the adoption of such features increases, we are seeing a decline in sales volume of our lower margin aftermarket products that provide technology for installing into older car models.
20 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report The underlying operating loss in 2014 for the Auto segment was $20.2 million compared to an underlying operating loss of $7.4 million in 2013 which reected, in addition to the decreased revenue, higher R&D costs.
During 2014, we increased R&D investment in this segment as part of our strategy to develop the next generation of automotive infotainment connectivity and location devices.
Looking forward, we expect to sustain investment in this area in order to support our strategy to grow our capabilities in this segment.
Consumer In 2014, revenue from our Consumer segment decreased 14% to $155.4 million from $181.5 million in 2013.
Volumes decreased by 4%, primarily driven by Cameras customers switching to alternative suppliers offering next generation solutions following our 2013 decision to cease further development of our COACH platform, as well as reduced demand for gaming products due to changes in customer market share and the impact of consumers switching to a next generation console which does not contain our Bluetooth solution.
Revenues from our Document Imaging business lines remained stable compared to 2013 and we have seen growth in our Bluetooth Smart products, although this represents a small proportion of our total revenues in 2014.
The underlying operating loss for Consumer in 2014 was $18.1 million 2013: $70.4 million.
This loss mainly decreased due to ceasing our investment in COACH products see page 20 for further details.
We continued to incur R&D cost through the development of the Bluetooth Smart and Indoor Location technologies, and expect this to continue in the future.
Voice & Music In 2014, revenue from our Voice & Music segment increased 11% to $346.6 million, from $312.0 million in 2013.
The continued strong growth in Voice & Music during 2014 was driven by increasing consumer demand to play digital content wirelessly using products such as remote speakers, speaker docks and wireless stereo headphones.
The full extent of the year on year growth was moderated by the one-off revenue in the first half of 2013, arising from the enforcement of handsfree driving legislation in China which did not recur in 2014.
Underlying operating profit for Voice & Music in 2014 grew to $124.5 million 2013: $123.1 million due to increased volumes of higher margin stereo products offset by costs to develop the next generation audio products.
Legacy Legacy consists of home entertainment, handset connectivity and handset location business lines for which we are no longer developing new products or adopting new technologies.
During 2014, revenue derived from this segment decreased in line with our previously stated expectations to $71.8 million from $238.4 million in 2013 as customers switch to new generations of these products from other suppliers.
The Legacy segment remains profitable to the Group as no R&D expense is incurred on these product lines.
Our Income Statement 2014 compared to 2013 2014 2013 Increase Amount Amount decrease $ million % of Revenue $ million % of Revenue $ million % change Revenue 774.8 100.0 960.7 100.0 185.9 19 Cost of sales 324.9 41.9 465.4 48.4 140.530 Underlying cost of sales 321.6 41.5 457.3 47.6 135.730 Gross profit 449.9 58.1 495.351.6 45.4 9 Underlying gross profit 453.2 58.5 503.452.4 50.2 10 R&D expenses 240.9 31.1 273.1 28.4 32.212 Underlying R&D expenses 223.6 28.9 248.4 25.9 24.810 SG&A expenses 150.2 19.4 193.7 20.2 43.522 Underlying SG&A expenses 119.7 15.4 150.7 15.7 31.021 Non-current asset impairment reversal charge 23.3 3.0 76.9 8.0 100.2 n a Gain on disposal of Imaging IP 14.9 1.9 14.9 n a Operating profit loss 97.0 12.5 48.4 5.0 145.4 n a Underlying operating profit 109.9 14.2 104.310.95.65 Revenue Our revenue is generated principally from the sale of products to producers of consumer electronic equipment, original design manufacturers and distributors.
In 2014, our revenue decreased $185.9 million to $774.8 million from $960.7 million in 2013.
This decrease was primarily due to the expected decline in our Legacy segment, reduced volumes of Auto aftermarket and Gaming products and our withdrawal from the Cameras market following our decision to discontinue development of future COACH products.
This decrease was partially offset by growth in the Voice & Music and Auto factory-t businesses.
These factors are explained in more detail in the segmental review above.
Volume weighted average selling prices increased by approximately 23% during 2014.
This increase was primarily due to a change in mix as lower priced Legacy products became a smaller proportion of our total business and revenue.
There is an established industry trend for individual products to see declining average selling prices as they mature and we seek to mitigate this by investing in the development of new technologies and products that can command higher prices for innovative features that may be attractive to our customers.
com 21 Financial report continued Analysis of Revenue We operate in three principal geographic areas: Asia, the Americas and Europe.
We consistently derive the significant majority of our revenue from business with customers whose manufacturing locations are based in Asia.
In 2014, our top ten customers provided 37% of total revenue 2013: 39%, 2012: 40%.
Further information about our geographic reach and our major customers can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Gross margin and gross profit In 2014, our gross margin increased to 58.1% 2013: 51.6% primarily due to a change in product mix with more of our revenue being generated from our higher margin Voice & Music and Auto segments because our lower margin Legacy and Cameras products saw expected reductions in volume.
The increase in gross margin was not enough to offset the overall decline in revenue and therefore, gross profit decreased to $449.9 million in 2014 from $495.3 million in 2013.
Gross profit includes $3.3 million of amortisation of intangible assets arising from historical acquisitions 2013: $8.1 million.
Excluding these charges, the underlying gross profit for 2014 was $453.2 million, which resulted in an underlying gross margin of 58.5%.
Research and Development R&D expenses We analyse R&D expenses between underlying and other R&D expenses.
The table below sets forth the main components of the total R&D expense, and highlights the differences between these two measures.
2014 2013 2014 vs 2013 Amount % of Amount % of Decrease $ million Revenue $ million Revenue $ million % change Research and Development Underlying R&D expenses 223.629.0 248.425.9 24.8 10 Share-based payment charges 16.42.022.92.4 6.5 28 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 0.90.11.80.2 0.9 50 Total 240.9 31.1 273.1 28.4 32.2 12 Underlying R&D expenses decreased 10% to $223.6 million in 2014 which was mainly due to a decrease in variable employee expenses and the result of ceasing further investment into COACH product development.
Share-based payment charges decreased by $6.5 million between 2014 and 2013.
The reduced cost was due to a decrease in the number of share options and awards granted in 2014, and there was a one-off charge in 2013 relating to the vesting of one year retention awards issued in 2012.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles decreased in 2014 as assets acquired in historic acquisitions reached the end of their useful economic life.
Sales, General and Administration SG&A expenses We analyse total SG&A expenses between underlying SG&A and other costs.
The table below sets forth the main components of the total SG&A expense, and highlights the differences between the underlying and total SG&A measures: 2014 2013 2014 vs 2013 Decrease Amount % of Amount % of increase $ million Revenue $ million Revenue $ million % change Sales, general and administrative Underlying SG&A expenses 119.715.5 150.715.7 31.0 21 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 4.40.66.80.7 2.4 35 Share-based payment charges 13.41.715.41.6 2.0 13 Integration and restructuring costs 2.00.324.72.6 22.7 92 Transaction costs 12.01.5 12.0 n a Patent & litigation settlement 4.70.5 4.7 n a Release of litigation provision 9.8 1.0 9.8 n a Fair value of contractual milestones 5.00.5 5.0 n a Other operating income 1.3 0.2 3.8 0.4 2.5 66 Total 150.2 19.4 193.7 20.2 43.5 22 22 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Overall SG&A costs decreased 22% to $150.2 million in 2014 from $193.7 million in 2013, which was due to: Lower underlying SG&A expenses driven by lower variable employee expenses, reduced litigation activity and a reduction in average SG&A headcount from 659 in 2013, to 611 in 2014: Reduced amortisation of acquired intangibles as assets recognised in historic acquisitions become fully amortised: A decrease in share based payment charges due to the lower volume of share options and awards granted during the year, as well as a relatively high charge in 2013 arising from the release of retention awards with a one year vesting period: Reduced litigation settlement costs compared to 2013 when we settled outstanding litigation for $4.7 million see page 20 for further information : Signicantly reduced integration and restructuring costs due to less activity in these areas during 2014.
An explanation of these costs can be found in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements: and The one-off cost of $5.0 million booked in 2013 for a provision against possible adjustments in consideration from the Samsung Transaction based on the timing of certain deliverables that CSR and Samsung agreed to deliver together.
This liability was fully settled in 2014.
This decrease in SG&A expenses was partially offset by: The one-off release of a $9.8 million litigation provision in 2013 relating to historical litigation as explained on page 115: A decline in the operating income we earned as part of the agreed terms of the Samsung Transaction due to a reduction in the level of support provided.
This activity ceased in October 2014 and we do not expect any further recurring income or costs arising from the transaction: and Transaction costs of $12.0 million arising from the proposed Qualcomm Transaction, including $5.6 million on assignment of contracts and $5.0 million on legal fees.
Other items In 2014, we recognised an impairment reversal of $23.3 million, and gain on disposal of Imaging IP associated with the COACH business of $14.9 million both of which are explained on page 19.
In 2013, following the announcement that we were no longer investing in further development of certain camera products, we impaired goodwill and xed assets allocated to the Cameras cash generating unit CGU by $76.9 million.
For further details see page 20.
Operating result Our IFRS operating profit for 2014 was $97.0 million.
This primarily reected a combination of underlying operating profit of $109.9 million, an impairment reversal and gain on disposal of Imaging IP associated with the Cameras business, and $29.8 million of share option charges.
All of these items are fully explained in the paragraphs above.
The IFRS operating margin was 12.5% for 2014, compared to a loss of 5.0% in 2013.
Underlying operating margin was 14.2% in 2014 compared to 10.9% in 2013, the increase was mainly driven by lower in R&D and SG&A expenses and higher gross margin on lower revenues.
These factors are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs above.
In 2014 underlying operating profit was $109.9 million, compared to $104.3 million in 2013.
Investment income and finance costs Investment income primarily represents the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
During 2014 these averaged $262.8 million 2013 $302.4 million.
The 2014 average was lower due to the timing of cash outows arising from the return of capital to shareholders in 2013 and 2014, offset by the net cash injection of $30.4 million following the sale of Imaging IP assets as explained on page 19.
A breakdown of finance costs can be found in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Taxation The tax credit for 2014 was $3.0 million, compared to a credit of $6.1 million in 2013.
This results in an effective tax rate of -3.2% for the year 2013: 11.6%.
The rate is lower than the average UK statutory rate of 21.5% mainly due to the offset of tax losses for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised, together with the recognition of a deferred tax asset with respect to temporary differences relating to our Israeli subsidiary, following stabilisation of its business model subsequent to sale of our Imaging IP.
The lower tax rate for 2013 was due primarily to the non-deductibility for tax purposes of the Cameras impairment, although this was offset in part by the release of historical provisions relating to the former Zoran operations.
The underlying effective tax rate for 2013 was 16.6%, which differed from the rate of 21.5% due mainly to reductions from the UK Patent Box and the offset of tax losses for which no deferred tax asset had been recognised.
The underlying effective tax rate excludes the tax impacts of items not included within our underlying profit before tax measure.
It also excludes the impact of tax rate changes on our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes to deferred tax assets due to additional loss or other temporary difference recognition or fide-recognition.
profit loss for the period We recorded a profit for the period of $96.8 million, compared to a loss of $46.4 million in 2013, which was mainly due to the increase in operating result in the year and taxation movements, as explained in earlier paragraphs.
We recorded an underlying profit for the period of $90.0 million, compared to $81.1 million in 2013, reecting the improvement in underlying operating profit and reduction in taxation costs as explained above.
com 23 Financial report continued Earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share were $0.59 and $0.55 respectively in 2014, compared to basic and diluted loss per ordinary share of $0.28 and $0.28 in 2013.
Underlying diluted earnings per ordinary share was $0.51 in 2014 and $0.46 in 2013.
The main factors leading to these movements were the change in profitability for the period, as described on page 23.
The weighted average diluted number of shares for 2014 of 175.6 million was broadly consistent with 2013 175.4 million, as the ordinary shares bought back and cancelled during the period were offset by the exercise of share options and awards and improvements in the share price, increasing the dilutive effect of outstanding options.

Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements explains how we test goodwill for impairment and the assumptions we use in this test.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment PPE During 2014, we invested $29.2 million in our PPE and intangible assets, the majority being in new leasehold ofces and IT infrastructure following ofce moves in India, the UK and the US.
Intangible assets of $3.1 million were acquired during the year as part of our acquisition of the trade and assets of Reciva Ltd which is explained in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.
An impairment of $26.2 million booked in 2013 related to the Imaging IP associated with the COACH business, of which $23.3 million was reversed during 2014 after we became aware of a fair value on disposal for this IP.
These assets were later sold generating a profit of $14.9 million.
For further details see note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax The increase in the deferred tax asset to $129.3 million at 26 December 2014 from $109.2 million at 27 December 2013 is mainly due to the increase in future tax deductions with respect to share options resulting from the increase in CSR plcs share price during 2014, together with the recognition of an asset with respect to Israeli tax losses as mentioned on page 23.
The deferred tax liability of $3.9 million relates to tax payable in future periods with respect to the Samsung Transaction and withholding tax on accrued but unpaid interest on intercompany balances.
Long-term asset Amounts previously presented as long term assets that arose in connection with the Samsung Transaction in 2012, became due in less than one year during 2014 and are therefore disclosed in Trade and other receivables.

We aim to maintain sufficient inventory to enable us to meet our customer lead times, which are often short to meet the end customer patterns of demand.
We seek to balance this with our awareness and assessment of the pace of change in consumer end markets and the need to minimise working capital to earn returns for shareholders.
Inventory was $56.4 million compared to $73.9 million in 2013.
This 24% decrease reected the reduction in the number of different products offered by CSR as our Legacy and COACH products reach the end of their life cycle.
Trade & other receivables Trade receivables represent 38 debtors days compared to 37 days in 2013.
Other receivables include $31.0 million due within 12 months but which was previously disclosed as a long-term asset.
This represents cash held in escrow to meet specic types of warranty claims arising from the IP transferred in the Samsung Transaction of 2012.
Liabilities We had total liabilities of $208.2 million as at 26 December 2014, compared to $253.6 million as at 27 December 2013.
Accruals decreased by $54.6 million during 2014 primarily due to lower variable employee benets and the payments made in respect of historic litigation settlements with deferred payment terms.
Provisions for restructuring of $7.7 million were utilised during 2014.
Contractual obligations As shown in the table below, as at 26 December 2014, our principal contractual obligations consisted of amounts payable under operating leases, trade and other payables and outstanding purchase obligations.
The Group did not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases shown in the table below.
The Group has a dened benefit severance plan in its Israeli subsidiary.

com 25 Financial report continued Cash, cash equivalents and treasury deposits decreased to $283.2 million as at 26 December 2014, compared to $306.2 million at 27 December 2013.
We hold cash funds with differing rates of liquidity.
Funds that are immediately available or held on short term deposit are called cash and cash equivalents, whilst funds placed on deposit for more than 90 days are called treasury deposits and these are disclosed separately on the face of our balance sheet.
We use treasury deposits in order to access higher nancing returns as we deem that this cash is not needed for immediate business operations.
During 2014 we kept 27% of cash as treasury deposits 2013: 26%.
We primarily generate cash from day to day operating activities and therefore we do not rely on any third party nancing.
We invest in tangible and intangible assets required to continue to develop new products and to ensure our staff work in an effective environment.
In 2014 we spent $35.8 million on capital additions including items capitalised in prior years.
We do not have significant cashows relating to tax or investing.
In 2014, we paid cash dividends of $23.6 million 2013: $20.4 million, and spent $70.3 million 2013: $71.6 million on share buybacks as described on pages 78 and 79.
During 2014, we paid $5.1 million for the trade and assets of Reciva Ltd and received $36.5 million from the sale of Imaging IP assets, whilst incurring $6.1 million of directly attributable costs.
See notes 33 and 34 to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation.
We use cash remaining after capital expenditure, taxation and investing to support our strategic objectives to increase profitability and grow shareholder returns.
During 2014 we made distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and through buybacks of ordinary shares.
Cash purchases of our own shares in 2014 include $62.7 million from buyback programmes and $7.6 million through the EBT see page 80 for further information.
These values include trades that were made in 2013 but were cash settled in 2014.
Proceeds from issues of shares of $15.1 million were recieved during 2014, a decrease from $24.2 million in 2013, due to a lower number of share options and awards being exercised by employees and a lower weighted average exercise price.
A full breakdown of cashows can be found in the consolidated financial statements on pages 90 and 118, whilst details of our capital management and liquidity policies can be found on page 31.

During 2013, we saw higher volumes from the continued growth in adoption rates of Bluetooth, location products and Wi-Fi technologies in cars in line with the general trend by Tier One manufacturers to adopt connectivity and location features in their vehicles.
The underlying operating loss in 2013 for the Auto segment was $7.4 million compared to a profit of $3.2 million in 2012 reecting our increase in R&D investment in this segment during 2013.
26 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Consumer In 2013, revenue from our Consumer segment decreased 30% to $181.5 million from $258.7 million in 2012.
This decrease was primarily driven by a 58% fall in revenue from our Cameras business line, reecting the decline in the digital-still camera market as consumers continued to switch to photo technology embedded in smartphones.
The underlying operating loss for Consumer in 2013 was $70.4 million 2012: $15.6 million.
While gross margin percentages in Consumer business lines remained strong, the operating loss increased compared to 2012, as a result of the lower sales volumes in Cameras.
In addition, profitability declined further as we continued to invest in R&D for the nascent Bluetooth Smart and Indoor Location technologies.
Voice & Music In 2013, revenue from our Voice & Music segment increased 64% to $312.0 million, from $190.2 million in 2012.
During 2013, we continued to see strong growth in Voice & Music driven by the increased consumer demand for playing digital content wirelessly on remote speakers, speaker docks and wireless stereo headphones.
In the first half of 2013, we saw significant additional revenue for our mono audio headset products due to demand driven by enforcement of hands-free driving legislation in China, which, as expected, did not continue into the second half of the year.
Underlying operating profit for Voice & Music in 2013 grew to $123.1 million 2012: $75.1 million, due to volume growth in higher margin stereo products, as well as the impact of the above mentioned increased volume of mono headset sales in China.
Legacy In 2013, revenue derived from our Legacy segment decreased 35% to $238.4 million from $364.3 million in 2012.
Performance was better than we expected primarily because of unanticipated continued demand for Legacy handset products.

This decrease was partially offset by growth in the Auto and the Voice & Music segments.
Volume weighted average selling prices decreased by approximately 5% during 2013.
This decline was caused by usual product life cycle trends offset by a change in product mix, as lower priced handset chips became a smaller proportion of our business.
Geographic analysis of revenue Information on our geographical splits of revenue can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Major customers In 2013, our top ten customers provided 39% of total revenue 2012: 40%: 2011: 46%.
Further information about our major customers can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
com 27 Financial report continued Gross profit In 2013, our gross profit margin increased to 51.6% 2012: 49.6% primarily due to a change in product mix where falling sales volumes of Legacy handset products were partially replaced by higher margin products from our Voice & Music and Auto segments.
The increase in gross margin was not enough to offset the effect of declining revenues and therefore gross profit decreased to $495.3 million in 2013, from $509.1 million in 2012.
Gross profit includes $8.1 million of amortisation of intangible assets arising from historical acquisitions 2012: $11.3 million.
Excluding these charges, the underlying gross profit for 2013 was $503.4 million, producing an underlying gross margin of 52.4%.
R&D expenses We analyse R&D expenses between underlying and other R&D expenses.
2013 2012 2013 vs 2012 Increase Amount % of Amount % of decrease $ million Revenue $ million Revenue $ million % change Research and development Underlying R&D expenses 248.425.8 272.326.5 23.9 9 Share-based payment charges 22.92.415.01.57.953 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 1.80.23.10.3 1.3 42 Total 273.1 28.4 290.4 28.3 17.3 6 Underlying R&D costs decreased 9% to $248.4 million in 2013, mainly due to the inclusion of $6.2 million of UK R&D tax credits, and a reduction in R&D headcount following the transfer of 288 engineers to Samsung as part of the Samsung Transaction in 2012.
Primarily because of this transaction, we saw the average R&D headcount fall from 1,654 in 2012, to 1,458 in 2013.
Share-based payment charges increased by $7.9 million from 2012 to 2013 due to the increase in the our share price, which increased both the fair value of share options and awards issued in 2013 and the accrued cost of cash settled shares and associated taxes.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles fell in 2013 because assets recognised as part of our 2009 acquisition of the SiRF group became fully amortised in the year.
SG&A expenses SG&A expenses decreased 19% to $193.7 million in 2013 2012: $238.0 million.
We analyse total SG&A expenses between underlying SG&A and other costs.
The table below sets forth the main components of the total SG&A expenses, and highlights the differences between the underlying and total SG&A measures: 2013 2012 2013 vs 2011 Increase Amount % of Amount % of decrease $ million Revenue $ million Revenue $ million % change Sales, general and administrative Underlying SG&A expenses 150.715.7 174.117.0 23.4 13 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 6.80.78.30.8 1.5 18 Share-based payment charges 15.41.612.81.22.620 Integration and restructuring costs 24.72.627.52.7 2.8 10 Patent & litigation settlement 4.70.515.51.5 10.8 70 Release of litigation provision 9.8 1.0 9.8 n a Fair value of contractual milestones 5.00.5 5.0 n a Other operating income 3.8 0.4 0.2 3.6 n a Total 193.7 20.2 238.0 23.2 44.3 19 28 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report SG&A expenses decreased 19% to $193.7 million in 2013 from $238.0 million in 2012, which was due to: Lower underlying SG&A costs driven by a reduction in average headcount from 820 to 659 due to the full year impact of restructuring activities in 2012, including the transfer of 23 SG&A employees as part of the Samsung Transaction: A decrease in amortisation of acquired intangibles in 2013 as assets recognised as part of our 2009 acquisition of the SiRF group became fully amortised during the year: A decrease in integration and restructuring costs as restructuring activity arising from the Zoran and Samsung transactions ceased but was offset by $6.5 million of costs due to our decision to withdraw from future COACH product investment.
Integration and restructuring costs during 2012 were signicantly higher than 2013 and consisted of the final restructuring and integration programme costs following the 2011 Zoran acquisition, and costs arising following the Samsung Transaction.
A breakdown of integration and restructuring costs can be found in note 28 to the consolidated financial accounts: The release of a provision of $9.8 million relating to historical litigation.
See page 115 for further information: and Operating income arising from the R&D support we provided to Samsung as part of the Samsung Transaction increased as it covered a full year of activity.
Costs associated with this support are reported within restructuring and integration costs.
The decrease in SG&A expenses was partially offset by: An increase in share based payment charges due to the increase in our share price, which increased both the fair value of share options and awards issued in the year and the accrued cost of cash settled shares and associated taxes: A provision made for possible adjustment of up to $5.0 million in consideration which was dependent on the timing of certain deliverables under the terms of the Samsung Transaction.
As at 27 December 2013, we estimated the fair value at $5.0 million.
This was fully settled during 2014: and The settlement of outstanding litigation for $4.7 million.
Other items In 2013, following the announcement that we were no longer investing in further development of future COACH products, we impaired $76.9 million in respect of goodwill and xed assets allocated to the Camera CGU.
In 2012, we recognised a $127.2 million gain on the disposal of development operations in the Samsung Transaction.
Operating result Our IFRS operating loss for 2013 was $48.4 million, compared to an operating profit of $107.9 million 2012.
This decrease was mainly due to a non-cash impairment charge of $76.9 million relating to the Cameras CGU, a one-off profit of $127.2 million in 2012 arising from the Samsung Transaction, and lower legacy revenue following the same transaction which reduced gross profit by $13.8 million.
These factors were offset by a $61.6 million reduction in operating costs primarily due to lower headcount as well as savings on litigation and restructuring costs.
All of these items are more fully explained in the paragraphs above.
The IFRS operating margin for 2013 was a loss of 5.0% compared to a profit of 10.5% in 2012.
Underlying operating profit was $104.3 million, compared to $74.0 million in 2012.
This increase was mostly driven by the reduction in underlying R&D and SG&A costs discussed in the preceding paragraphs.
Underlying operating margin was 10.9% in 2013 compared to 7.2% in 2012.
Taxation The tax credit for 2013 was $6.1 million, compared to a charge of $50.7 million in 2012.
This resulted in an effective tax rate of 11.6% for the year 2012: 49.8%.
The rate is lower than the average UK statutory rate of 23.25% due primarily to the non-deductibility for tax purposes of the Cameras impairment, although this was offset in part by the release of historical provisions relating to the former Zoran operations.
The higher tax rate for 2012 was driven by a high tax rate on the disposal of our handset connectivity and handset location business to Samsung due primarily to the non-deductibility of the goodwill written off on disposal.
The underlying effective tax rate for 2013 was 20.3%, which differed from the rate of 23.25% mainly due to reductions from US R&D tax credits and the UK Patent Box, combined with the release of provisions following the successful conclusion of audits by various tax authorities, counterbalanced by the impact of non-recognition of trading tax losses in Israel.
Result for the period In 2013, we recorded a loss for the period of $46.4 million, compared to a profit of $51.2 million in 2012.
This reduction in profitability is mainly due to the reduction in operating profit in the year, and taxation movements, as explained above.
We recorded an underlying profit in 2013 of $81.1 million, compared to $55.4 million in 2012, reecting the improvement in underlying operating profit and reduction in taxation costs.
Earnings per Share Basic and diluted losses per ordinary share were $0.28 and $0.28 respectively in 2013, compared to basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share of $0.26 and $0.25 in 2012.
Underlying diluted earnings per ordinary share was $0.46 in 2013 and $0.27 in 2012.
The main factors leading to these movements were the change in profitability for the period and the reduction in the number of outstanding ordinary shares following the share buybacks undertaken in 2013 which are explained on pages 78 and 79. www.

A breakdown of this movement is shown in the table above.
In 2013 we generated $82.3 million cash from day-to-day operating activities 2012: $73.9 million and continued to pay minimal cash tax due to utilisation of tax losses.
We also generated cash of $24.2 million from the proceeds of share issues, compared to $53.1 million in 2012 which included a $34.4 million new share issue as part of the 2012 Samsung Transaction.
During 2013, we spent $41.0 million on capital expenditure which included $14.0 million on intangible assets which were capitalised in 2012.
We use the cash remaining within the Group after capital expenditure to support our strategic objectives to increase profitability and grow shareholder returns.
During 2013, we spent $92.0 million returning cash to shareholders through purchases of our shares and payment of dividends.
In 2012, we returned $315.1 million to shareholders of which $284.3 million was returned by way of a Tender Offer with the remainder through share buybacks and dividends.
The disposal of development operations in the Samsung Transaction gave a cash inow to CSR of $271.3 million.
During 2013, we increased longer term cash holdings and held 26% of our total cash balance as treasury deposits 2012: 6%.
30 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 CSR in review Governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Our Finance Policies Our finance policies are reviewed annually, and changed where necessary to reect current industry and macro-economic factors.
There were no significant changes in our policies during 2014.
Hedging We operate using a functional currency of USD, which is the currency underlying substantially all of the revenue and cost of sales during the year.
Operational expenditure arises in a number of local currencies, with approximately 37% denominated in GBP during 2014.
In order to reduce the volatility of our earnings due to foreign exchange rate uctuations, we enter into forward contracts to x an exchange rate for our future GBP denominated expenditure.
These contracts are accounted for as cash ow hedges and do not affect the profit and loss until the period in which the related transaction is recorded.
Occasionally, after discussions with our Treasury committee we may choose to hedge against specic transactions in other currencies, if we believe these may cause volatility to the Group results.
See note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for the accounting policies on foreign currencies, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.
Note 19 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Note 31 includes a foreign currency sensitivity analysis.
Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity is the cash inow from our operations.
At present we do not rely on third-party nancing and therefore we do not consider liquidity risk to be significant.
We manage this risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cashows, and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
Neither CSR nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
There are no material restrictions on the use of any of our cash, cash equivalents or treasury deposits.
We hold all our liquid investments in accordance with the counterparty and settlement risk limits in the treasury policy approved by the Board of Directors namely that: at any one time cash is placed with at least three banking counterparties: authorised banking counterparties require a credit rating of A3 or above: no more than 30% of money market deposits will have over 90 days maturity and no deposit will have over 12 months duration: and no counterparty can hold more than $75 million of funds, or 25% of aggregate gross cash balances, whichever is higher.
Capital management Our policy is to maintain a strong capital base and substantial cash balances so as to maintain customer, creditor, investor and market confidence, as well as to sustain future development of the business.
We regularly consider returning funds to shareholders whether through dividends or as part of share buy backs, and we monitor our distributable reserves to ensure we have capacity to do this.
As explained on page 19 during 2014, we bought back 6,360,728 ordinary shares for an aggregate of $61.9 million.
Our issued share capital at 26 December 2014 was 185,955,224 ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each, including 19,855,906 ordinary shares held in Treasury.
Dividend policy In view of the proposed Qualcomm Transaction, the Board does not intend to pay or recommend for payment any further dividends at this time.
CSR Employee benefit Trust EBT From time to time, the EBT purchases CSR ordinary shares in the open market.
These shares are intended to be used for satisfying obligations to deliver shares under our employee share incentive plans.
The timing of any such transactions is subject to compliance with UK listing regulations, agreement between CSR and the trustees of the EBT, and prevailing market prices.
In 2014, the EBT purchased 776,228 ordinary shares for an aggregate of $7.6 million.
Tax policy The key principles that constitute CSRs Tax Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, are as follows: We are compliant with tax laws and regulations in all territories in which we operate and pay tax in accordance with these laws and regulations: We develop and sustain good and transparent working relationships with tax authorities, government bodies and other relevant third parties: and We actively manage our tax affairs, as in all aspects of our business, in such a way as to maximise shareholder value, taking into account not just the immediate scal effects, but also longer term considerations including corporate reputation.
Financial control We regularly review the internal control environment, and assess our performance against this with a rolling programme of internal audits, the results of which are shared with the audit committee.
More details about our control environment can be found in the audit committee report on pages 59 and 60. www.
