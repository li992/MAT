Revenue In Sterling, revenue increased by 5% from 537m in 2013 to 564.9m in 2014.
However, with over 70% of our revenue in US$ and given that, on average, the US$ was weaker year-on-year, the underlying performance of the business was in fact much stronger.
US$ is a better measure of the businesss performance and in US$ the revenue increase was 11%.
In US$, Performance Materials revenues were 13% higher and Wireless Systems revenues were up 8%.
The table below shows revenue for each segment in US$ together with the incremental revenue contribution from acquisitions made part way through 2014.

For Wireless Systems, operating margin was up year-on-year to 12.3% 2013,11.7%.
The table below provides further analysis in US$ of the underlying operating profit.
The gross profit percentage of 40.3% is 0.5% lower than in 2013, largely due to changes in product mix in Performance Materials.

Much of the increase in R&D is in Wireless Systems which typically has design cycles beyond one year and longer product lives than Performance Materials.
A proportion of this investment has been capitalised and typically will be amortised over a three to four year period and matched against the revenue benefit.
Model Solution was acquired in 2014.
$0.2m of the R&D increase and $3.6m of the indirect overhead increase is due to the inclusion of a part year of this acquisition.
Underlying operating profit increased by 12% in 2014.

Laird is exposed to interest rate risk as it holds borrowings on both a fixed and floating basis.
Our policy for this risk is to optimise the mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage Lairds finance costs.
Credit and counterparty risk Our policy on counterparty risk management is to place cash deposits and other financial instruments with its relationship banks, all of which also provide credit facilities to Laird.
The level of exposure to each bank is continually monitored.
As at 31 December 2014, all cash and short-term deposits had a maturity of less than three months.
Foreign exchange management We aim to minimise our exposures to US$ transactional currency exposures by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
Laird aims to forward cover at least 75% of the unmatched cash flows on a quarterly basis.
Foreign currency borrowings are used partially to hedge the currencies of the Groups principal assets and cash flows.
Where foreign currency borrowings are in the same currency as investment in overseas assets they are treated as a hedge of the net investment.

This imbalance can lead to 2 March 2015 an adverse impact, in so far as the strengthening of the RMB may not be fully recovered in US$ selling prices.
In addition, there is a translation impact in converting profits into the Groups reporting currency Sterling : each US$0.01 appreciation against Sterling approximates to an annual increase in operating profit of 0.45m.
In 2014, on average through the year the US$ was weaker against Sterling than in 2013 and this reduced profits on translation by 4m.
The majority of the Groups assets are held overseas and these are hedged in part by foreign currency loans.
