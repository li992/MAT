St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 18 The Financial Model As described earlier, the Groups strategy is to attract and retain retail funds under management on which we receive an annual management fee for as long as we retain the funds.
This is the principal source of income for the Group out of which we meet the overheads of the business, invest in growing the Partnership, and invest in acquiring new funds under management.
The level of income is dependent on the level of client funds and changes with market movements.
Since a proportion of our business does not generate net cash in the first six years, the level of income will increase as a result of new business from six years ago becoming cash generative.
This deferral of cash generation means the business always has six years worth of funds in the gestation period see page 24.
Financial Group expenditure is carefully managed with clear targets set for growth in establishment expenses in the year.
Many other Review expenses increase with business levels and are met from margins in the products see page 31.
However, the Group also invests in new client services, computer systems and other corporate initiatives, all of which are reported as development expenditure.
A small proportion of Group expenditure is required to support management of existing funds, but the majority of expenditure is investment in growing the Partnership and acquiring new funds.
The resulting new business is expected to generate income for an average of 14 years, and is expected to provide a good return on the investment see page 24.
As the business matures, the proportion of the cash emergence from the existing business required to support the acquisition of new business is reducing.
This has resulted in strong growth in underlying cash emergence in recent years which has ultimately fed through to growth in the dividend.
Presentation of Financial Results Given the long-term nature of the business and the high level of investment in new business generation each year, management believes the IFRS result does not provide an easy guide to the cash likely to emerge in future years, nor does it reflect the total economic value of the business.
We therefore complement our statutory IFRS reporting with additional analysis.
Firstly, we provide additional analysis in relation to the tax reported under IFRS.
The IFRS methodology requires that the tax recognised in the financial statements should include the tax incurred on behalf of policyholders in our UK life assurance company.
Since the policyholder tax charge is unrelated to the performance of the business, management believes it is useful to separately identify the profit before shareholder tax.
This measure reflects the profit before tax adjusted for tax paid on behalf of policyholders.

Our products are typically well matched in relation to change with movements in stock markets.
Since the impact of initial charges to meet initial costs, and this treatment results in these changes is unrelated to the performance of the business, the establishment of largely offsetting DAC and DIR balances.

St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 22 Financial Review continued Section 2: Cash Result and Capital In addition to presenting the financial performance on the IFRS basis, we also provide an analysis of the sources of cash emergence in the year, which we refer to as the cash result and is shown post tax.
This cash result is based on the underlying profit after tax but is adjusted for deferred tax including the corporation tax rate change in 2013 and to reflect the level of regulatory solvency constraint on profits emerging from regulated companies, such as our insurance businesses, in line with that required by Regulators.
It is also adjusted for the share option cost in the year.
Since the cash result can be impacted by timing variances and capitalised impacts in solvency requirements, management believes it is also useful to present an underlying cash result excluding these effects, which the Board reviews, in conjunction with Group solvency, when determining the proposed dividend to shareholders.

Capital Position In addition to presenting an IFRS balance sheet on page 104 and an EEV balance sheet on page 165, we believe it is beneficial to provide a balance sheet using the approach underlying our cash result.
This is because the cash result is adjusted for non-cash items such as DAC, DIR and deferred tax.
The Board therefore considers this cash result balance sheet provides the best indication of the net asset position of the Group.
The following table analyses the differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the cash result balance sheet.
These adjustments include netting out assets and liabilities of the policyholder interest in unit-linked funds, and removal of a number of significant non-cash adjustments in particular DAC, DIR and deferred tax.

The table above provides an analysis of the differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the cash result balance sheet.
As in previous years, we also provide an analysis of the Solvency position.
The key difference between the cash result net assets above and the Solvency net assets is an amount of additional reserves arising from the Irish solvency regulations.
These reserves include additional prudential reserves over that required by the UK regulator.
As a result, the Solvency position is 572.0 million, which is 31.1 million lower than the cash result net assets of 603.1 million.
The table below provides an analysis of the Solvency position between regulated and non-regulated entities, together with an assessment of the solvency position against both the required minimum regulatory capital and the internal capital requirement set by the Board referred to as the management solvency requirement.

A further measure of solvency for an insurance group is the Insurance Groups Directive IGD resources.
This is calculated by considering the level of net assets in the Group outside of the insurance companies that could be available to support the solvency of the insurance company and other regulated companies.
It therefore represents additional solvency cover over the 327.1 million Life company solvency assets identified in the table above.
At 31 December 2014 the IGD resources amount was estimated as 240 million 2013: 260.0 million.
The balance of other assets after intra-group dividends received and the payment of the final 2014 dividend is 273.2 million which includes 112.5 million of non-cash items.
The balance represents free group resources, including an amount of 90 million held as a buffer to maintain future dividends in the event of stock market volatility impacting the cash result in a particular year.
The Group continues to be capitalised well in excess of regulatory solvency requirements, with over 60% of cash result balance sheet assets and solvency assets invested prudently in cash, AAA rated money market funds and UK government securities.
Other assets principally other receivables are less liquid.
An analysis of the liquid asset holdings is provided below.

Distribution Business and Other The results from distribution and other operations have already been commented on in the IFRS section.
Investment Return Variance The investment return variance reflects the capitalised impact on the future annual management fees resulting from the difference between the actual and assumed investment returns.
Given the size of our funds under management, a small difference between the actual and assumed investment return can result in a large positive or negative variance.
St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 30 Financial Review continued New Business Margin The largest single element of the EEV operating profit is the new business contribution see analysis in the previous section.
The level of new business contribution generally moves in line with new business performance.
To demonstrate this link and aid understanding of the results, we provide additional analysis of the new business margin margin.
This is calculated as the new business contribution divided by a relevant new business measure, and is expressed as a percentage.
The table below presents margin results based on each of the two main measures of new business performance used by the insurance sector.
Annual Premium Equivalent APE calculated as the sum of regular premiums plus 1 10th single premiums.
Present Value of New Business Premium PVNBP calculated as single premiums plus the present value of expected premiums from regular premium business, allowing for lapses and other EEV assumptions.

This reflects a high level of investment expenditure in the year.
The greater reduction in the margin for the Unit Trust business reflects a reallocation of corporate expenses between Life and Unit Trust business as the respective proportions of the business change.

Management Expenses The table below provides the usual breakdown of the management expenditure before tax for the combined financial services activities.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December Notes 2014 2013 Million Million Paid from policy margins and advice charges Partner remuneration 1 455.4 407.1 Investment expenses 1 124.6 101.8 Third party administration 1 44.3 41.8 624.3 550.7 Direct expenses Other performance related costs 2 86.8 72.5 Establishment costs 3 125.1 108.0 Academy costs 4 4.1 2.7 Other development costs 5 15.6 11.9 Back office infrastructure costs 6 11.9 5.0 Regulatory fees 7 6.1 6.1 FSCS levy 7 5.9 5.5 Regulatory change costs 8 3.1 Contribution from third party product sales 9 22.4 20.4 233.1 194.4 Total 857.4 745.1 We have changed the presentation of this analysis of Group expenses to provide further information on performance related costs and business as usual other developments.
The 2013 comparative has been re-presented to be in a consistent format.
These costs are met from corresponding policy margins and any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not directly impact the profitability of the Group.
Other performance related costs, for both Partners and employees, vary with the level of new business and operating profit performance of the business.
Establishment costs are the running costs of the Groups infrastructure and are relatively fixed in nature in the short term, although they are subject to inflationary increases.
These costs will increase as the infrastructure expands to manage the higher number of existing clients, the growing number of advisers and increasing business volumes.
The growth in establishment expenses during the year was higher than our original expectations as a consequence of an increase in expenditure associated with the high level of adviser recruitment in the year together with the costs relating to the higher business volumes.
We expect establishment expenses in 2015 to increase by around 10%.
The Academy is an important strategic investment for the future and the increase in the costs during 2014 reflects the increased number of students within the programme and the launch of our first regional Academy in Manchester.
2015 will see further growth in this investment as the Academy continues to expand with further intakes planned in London and Manchester together with our first Academy intake in Solihull.
Other development costs represent the expenditure associated with the on-going development in our investment proposition, corporate initiatives, technology improvements and other system developments.
These costs will vary year by year depending upon the extent of change and or investment planned.
The development expenses were 15.6 million during 2014 2013: 11.9 million and we expect a similar level of spend in 2015.
The costs of the back office investment programme were 11.9 million for the year compared to a second half year cost of 5.0 million in 2013.
The change programme progressed well during 2014 and we soft launched ISA and unit trust business at the end of the year with full migration of this business expected in 2015.
As we continue to develop the system and migrate the existing business we will incur further investment expenditure and anticipate the costs for 2015 to be some 15.0 million.
The regulatory costs represent the fees payable to the regulatory bodies of 6.1 million 2013: 6.1 million, together with our required contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of 5.9 million 2013: 5.5 million.
These were the one-off costs of changing our systems and process for the implementation of the adviser charging rules.
As these changes have now been implemented, we do not expect further expenditure in 2015.
Contribution from third party product new business reflects the net income received from wealth management business of 9.0 million 2013: 8.2 million, from group pension business of 0.8 million 2013: 0.5 million and from Protection business of 12.6 million 2013: 11.7 million.

This net inflow represents 11.5% 2013: 12.2% of opening funds under management and can be viewed as the organic growth of the business.
Noted below is an explanation of regular withdrawals, maturities and surrenders: The regular withdrawals represent those amounts selected by clients which are paid out by way of periodic income.
The withdrawals have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Maturities are those sums paid out where the plan has reached the selected maturity date e. g. retirement date.
The expected maturities have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
03183415 S St tr ra at te eg gi ic c R Re ep po or rt t St. James's Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 33 Surrenders and part surrenders are those amounts where clients have chosen to withdraw money from their plan.
Surrenders are assumed to occur in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit based on actual experience, updated on an annual basis, by plan duration and the age of the client.
The implied surrender rate shown in the table above is very much a simple average and reflects only recent experience.
Whilst it could be compared with the long-term assumptions underlying the calculation of the embedded value, it should not be assumed that small movements in this rate will result in a change to the long term embedded value assumptions.
Analysis of funds under management The following table provides an analysis of the funds under management at 31 December 2014 split by geography and asset type: 2014 2013 Billion Billion UK Equities 14.9 13.3 North American Equities 10.4 8.4 Fixed Interest 7.1 6.1 European Equities 6.0 5.0 Asia & Pacific Equities 4.8 3.9 Property 1.5 1.1 Alternative Investments 0.9 1.3 Cash 4.4 3.6 Other 2.0 1.6 Total 52.0 44.3 The Henley Group As shareholders are aware during 2014 we acquired The Henley Group THG, a business providing financial advice to largely British expatriate clients based in Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong.
We consider THG to be a strong cultural fit with our business and see the acquisition as an important extension of our existing face to face advice model to clients through our own dedicated advisers albeit focusing on the expatriate market place.
There are currently some 90,000 British expatriates in these three locations served by an estimated 310 British expatriate focused advisers.
Our expectations are that the number of expatriates in these markets will continue to grow by some 7-10% per annum providing for 110-130,000 expatriates across Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong by 2020, with an estimated 21 billion of investible assets.
THG currently has 4,400 clients with 453 million funds under management serviced by 51 advisers.
Our intention, mirroring our UK proposition, is to expand the number of advisers and increase their productivity year by year so that by 2020 we have an adviser population of 200 and funds under management of over 2 billion.
Since the acquisition we have been integrating the business into our Group, commencing conversations with a number of potential adviser recruits and applying for regulatory approval to market our products and services in these markets.
The financial details of the acquisition are include in Note 9 on page 123.
Since the date of acquisition during 2014, the integration and running costs of 1.7 million which is reported in Distribution together with other costs and our investment spend of 2.3 million which is reported in Other have reduced profit by a total of 4.0 million.
We expect the ongoing investment into THG to continue for a number of years.
However, as the investment generates new funds under management we will see an increasing contribution to the Embedded Value of the Group.
We have recently rebranded THG as St. Jamess Place Asia and continue to explore opportunities in other expatriate markets.
