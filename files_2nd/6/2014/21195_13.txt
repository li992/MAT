Its called Teapot Island and Keith and Sue Blazye, its owners, are one of our customers.
As Sue Blazye explains: We woke up on Christmas morning and came downstairs to find our exhibition under three feet of water because a local river had flooded.
Mr and Mrs Blazye wanted to get the exhibition up and running in time for the start of the tourist season and they didnt want to disappoint their customers.
Mr and Mrs Blazye and our case manager, Helen Anderson, worked closely with the loss adjuster to work out what the Blazyes wanted and how it could be delivered.
Opening in time wouldnt have been possible using standard drying and repair techniques.
So our drying consultants found a way to get the repairs done in time.
We use these new approaches more often now.
Thanks to Mr and Mrs Blazyes commitment, the partnership between our claims manager and the loss adjuster, and the innovative approach to getting the drying and repairs done, Teapot Island opened its doors to visitors in time for the start of the tourist season.
Helen Anderson said: Ive worked for Aviva for 13 years and this was one of the most unusual and complex claims Ive worked on but also one of the most gratifying.
Delivering for our customers in this way is the best bit of my job.
Watch the Blazyes story at www.

We were so impressed with the help and support that Aviva offered.
