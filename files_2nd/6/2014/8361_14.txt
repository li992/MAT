OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW 45 The agreed investment objectives of the Scheme are: to secure, with a high degree of certainty, liabilities in respect of all defined benefit members: and to adopt a long-term strategy which aims to capture outperformance from equities and move gradually into bonds to reflect the increasing maturity of the defined benefit membership with a view to reducing the volatility of investment returns.
The majority of equities held by the Scheme are in international blue-chip entities.
The aim is to hold a globally diversified portfolio of equities, with an ultimate target of 50 per cent of equities being held in UK and 50 per cent in US, European and Asia-Pacific equities.

The Treasury function is not a profit centre and it does not enter into speculative transactions.
It aims to reduce financial risk by the use of hedging instruments, operating within a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the Board.
Liquidity risk We seek to maintain sufficient facilities to ensure access to funding for our current and anticipated future requirements, determined from budgets and medium-term plans.
Following the acquisition of Initial Facilities, and the resulting step change in Group debt, we have put in place a $350 million US private placement.
These loan instruments have a weighted average maturity of mid-2024 and are fully hedged into a fixed interest rate sterling amount.
Additionally we have access to committed revolving bank facilities totalling 250 million, which were extended during the year until February 2019.
Our aggregate finance facilities therefore stand at c450 million with 250 million of this available until February 2019 and the remainder available on average until mid-2024.
Market price risk The objectives of our interest rate policy are to match funding costs with operational revenue performance and to ensure that adequate interest cover is maintained, in line with Board-approved targets and banking covenants.
Our borrowings under the US private placement are denominated in US dollars and subject to fixed interest rates.
These are fully hedged back into a sterling fixed rate with FX swaps lasting for the duration of the loan period.
Our other borrowings are principally denominated in sterling and mostly subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
We have in place interest rate caps and swaps which limit interest rate risk.
The weighted average duration to maturity of these instruments is approximately seven months.
Foreign currency risk Transactional currency translation The revenues and costs of our trading entities are typically denominated in their functional currency.
Where a material trade is transacted in a non-functional currency, the entity is required to take out instruments through the centralised Treasury function to offset the currency exposure.
The instruments used will normally be forward currency contracts.
The impact of retranslating any entitys non-functional currency balances into its functional currency was not material.
Consolidation currency translation We do not hedge the impact of translating overseas entities' trading results or net assets into the consolidation currency.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, profits and losses from overseas activities are translated at the average exchange rates applying during the year.
The average rates used in this process are disclosed on page 42.
The balance sheets of our overseas entities are translated at the year-end exchange rates.
The impact of changes in the year-end exchange rates, compared to the rates used in preparing the 2013 consolidated financial statements, has led to an increase in consolidated net assets of 12.8 million 2013: 13.0 million decrease.
OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW 47 GOING CONCERN The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report and Governance sections.
Our financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and details of financial risk management are described in the Financial Review.
The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts, which provides a strong future workload and good forward revenue visibility.
We have access to committed debt facilities totalling c450 million until a range of dates that extend beyond at least February 2019.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

During the first year of the contract the 235-strong team has provided customer service training to all staff and installed a new 24 7 service centre answering 2,000 calls a month.
The partnership has also committed to investing 5 million to improve the campus, recruited undergraduates and apprentices and is supporting the University to meet its target of reducing carbon usage by 44 per cent.
SEF has also used technology to share maps of the campus and surrounding areas through the use of Quick Response QR codes.
The team was recently awarded centre of excellence status by the British Institute of Cleaning Science in recognition of the quality of training it provides staff.
