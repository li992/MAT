million Currencies Volatility in foreign exchange rates had a significant impact on the performance of the different business units, although the net impact on the Group was limited.
The sharp devaluation of the rouble in the second half negatively impacted the domestically focused Russian operations of the Uncoated Fine Paper business unit, while benefiting the export orientated Russian Packaging Paper activities.
Rand weakness supported the export business from South Africa.
The stronger US dollar versus the euro had a net positive impact on US dollar denominated export sales, although the greater impact is expected to be in the support it provides going forward to European pricing levels given the reduced import threat.
Costs The Group benefited from a general reduction in variable costs compared with the prior year.
European wood costs were lower as a result of lower demand and currency effects.
Paper for recycling costs were 3% lower than the previous year.
Chemical input costs, particularly starch, also declined during the year.
The packaging converting operations benefited from lower average paper input costs.
Benchmark polyethylene prices were broadly in line with the previous year but declined sharply towards the end of the year as a consequence of lower oil prices.
Lower average oil and gas prices also contributed to the lower energy costs, in addition to supporting a reduction in transport and logistic costs.
Fixed costs were lower than the previous year, driven by foreign exchange benefits and our continued strategic focus on operating performance and efficiencies.
Segment reorganisation and restatement In the second half of the year, we refined our organisational structure, resulting in several changes to the Groups segmental reporting.
The most significant of these changes were the: transfer of the Release Liner business from Fibre Packaging to Consumer Packaging to take advantage of identified synergies in customer relations, innovation and the global footprint of these businesses: and transfer of the 66,000 tonne per annum kraft paper machine at the Ruomberok mill from Uncoated Fine Paper to Packaging Paper.
All comparative segmental information has been restated and the reorganisation had no impact on the overall Group result.
