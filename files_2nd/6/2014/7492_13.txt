Invested capital as at 1 March 2014 was 2,421.6m, an increase of 44.8m versus the balance sheet as at 2 March 2013.
This increase in invested capital was principally driven as a result of an increase in the combined value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, which re ects the increased level of capital expenditure in the year, principally as a result of the strategic investment initiatives in both Argos and Homebase.
In addition, as previously discussed, there was also an increase in the Financial Services loan book.
The increase in invested capital was partially offset by both a reduction in inventories and an increase in provisions.
The increase in invested capital of 44.8m was more than offset by the reduction in forward foreign exchange contracts and the reduction in net cash, the result of which was an overall decrease in net assets of 59.0m.
