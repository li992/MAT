Wholesale power sales Our generation business sells power both to Haven Power, our retail business, and into the wholesale markets.
The price achieved for power sold into the wholesale market is based on market prices at the time we secure the sale of power.
The timing of our sales is driven by our hedging strategy, but can be influenced by liquidity in the market and requirements for collateral.
Market prices fell in 2014 see page 30 : however our hedging strategy provided some protection from recent market weakness.
As a result, the average achieved price for generation power sales increased slightly compared to 2013.
Whilst the market spreads available, in comparison to our short run marginal cost of producing, determine whether it is optimal to generate, the operational performance of the power station determines whether we are able to generate and benefit from good market spreads.

China seabourne coal demand has fallen year-on-year, with growth focus now on India.
With prices falling, producers focused on reducing production costs and increasing output to improve efficiencies.

8 Carbon prices spiked early in 2014 due to the introduction of the much-debated back loading postponing the sales of 900mt of emissions allowances to 2019 20 in order 7 to restrict current supplies in an attempt to alleviate the oversupply in the market.
However, the oversupply of allowances resulting from the European recession and 6 emission reductions persists and as a result prices fell back to pre-back loading levels almost immediately.
5 Political intervention remains the key driver for carbon prices and further possible measures, such as discussions around the market stability reserve proposed for 4 phase four of the EU ETS in 2021, drove a steady rise in carbon prices over the second half of 2014.
Biomass The majority of biomass used for large-scale power generation is imported from Currency spot rates NorthAmerica and Europe and accordingly is priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or USD:GBP euros.

The increase in carbon price support CPS, 1.5 1.10 a levy on coal deliveries, from April 2014, continued to reduce margins for coalfired generators.
The fall in power prices also impacted bark spreads, which fell steadily during the year.

Additional carbon costs in 2014 asaresult of CPS mechanism.
The generation gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 433 million, compared to 430 million in 2013.
Dark green spreads, which currently account for the majority of our gross profit, were weaker in 2014, but good operational performance and the increasing influence of biomass in our fuel mix means profitability was slightly higher than in 2013.
The introduction of the UK CPS mechanism from April 2013 has added a levy to our coal purchases and, as expected in its first full year of operation, which saw a rate increase applicable from April 2014, continued to erode the profitability of our coal generating plant.
However, with biomass now accounting for 29% of fuel burnt by energy content, this was mitigated somewhat by the reduced cost of CO emissions allowances 2 purchased under the EU ETS.
This reinforces the economic case for the strategy we have developed to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled power generator.
Revenue Total generation revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 2,450 million, compared to 1,780 million in 2013.
Our generation business recognises revenue when it sells power into the wholesale ROC and LEC assets market, or to Haven Power see Retail, on page 36.
Intra-group sales totalled on the balance sheet 735 million in 2014 2013: 468 million.
We can meet our power delivery obligations 2014 2013 m m either by generating the power ourselves or by buying power from the market.
We purchase power from the market either when it is more economical to do so, or to As at 1 January 139.5 18.7 meet delivery obligations that cannot be covered by generation.
ROCs and LECs generated 354.7 143.9 ROCs and LECs purchased 5.7 37.6 Power purchases of 710 million 2013: 334 million are included within cost of sales and the associated revenue within power sales.
Increasing retail sales have increased ROCs and LECs sold utilised 315.4 60.7 our power delivery obligations which, along with falling market power prices during As at 31 December 184.5 139.5 2014 illustrated by the charts on the previous page has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of power we have purchased from the market.
As prices fall, the overnight power price drops below our marginal cost of production more frequently at the point of delivery.
Increasing levels of intermittent generation principally wind and solar on the electricity system in the UK, which can contribute to falling power prices and increased grid charges, are also providing opportunities to capitalise on the flexibility ofthe Drax plant through balancing and system support activities.
33 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Excluding the cost of power purchased in the market, our power sales revenue of 1,369 million was higher than the equivalent comparative for 2013 1,335 million.
This increase reflects both a 0.5TWh increase in net power sold electrical output and a small increase in the average achieved electricity price from 51.0 per MWh to 51.3 per MWh, despite a fall in market prices during the year.
The timing of our power sales hedges has provided protection from recent power market weakness.
Generation revenue also includes sales of ROCs and LECs of 315 million 2013: 63 million.
With two units now fully converted and biomass now accounting for 29% of our fuel mix 2013: 12% we are entitled to considerably more ROCs and LECs from our renewable generation.
The timing of ROC sales is driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation deadlines and commercial considerations.
Increasingly, we are able to utilise available agreements described in more detail in Financing and cash flow management to monetise ROC sales, accelerating the recognition of sales as well as the associated cash flows.
Fuel burn composition heat % This trend, in addition to the greater entitlement to ROCs and LECs described above, is demonstrated in the table at the foot of the opposite page.
Advantaged fuels: 1% It is the value of ROC and LEC support earned in any given period, rather than the Biomass: income received for those sold, that drives the bark spreads achieved.
This support 29% is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in the month the associated biomass is burned matching the benefit against the cost of the biomass.
Cost of sales As explained on pages 28 to 29, our fuel costs are driven by a combination of market prices at the time of securing the fuel and the mix of different fuels burnt during the period.

Coal 7.2 8.5 The average gross cost of fuel, before the impact of carbon allowances, CPS and ROC Biomass 4.1 1.6 support, was 40.3 per MWh in 2014 compared with 32.1 per MWh in 2013, reflecting Advantaged fuels 0.3 0.8 the increasing proportion of biomass in our fuel mix.
Following the conversion of our first unit to run on biomass in April 2013, we modified a second unit to run as an enhanced co-fired unit in May 2014, burning up to 85% biomass, which was subsequently fully converted in October.
Within cost of sales, net biomass costs are made up of the cost of the fuel delivered to site less the value of renewable support received.
The cost of the fuel includes raw material and delivery costs.
The renewable support reflects the value assigned to ROCs and LECs earned through generating electricity from burning biomass, that value being derived from prevailing market prices for ROCs and LECs at the point of generation.
The value of the renewable support therefore reduces the net cost of biomass.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview 34 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Operational and financial performance continued When renewable support is taken into account, the average cost of fuel for the yearis26.8 per MWh, compared to 26.6 per MWh in 2013.
Coal remains the largest component of our fuel mix and as a result the cost of the UK carbon tax introduced in April 2013, which was subject to a 93% rate increase from April2014, has continued to add to our fuel costs.
The total cost in respect of CPS in2014 was 118 million, compared to 62 million in 2013.
However, as our proportion of generation from biomass increases our requirement to purchase emissions allowances under the EU ETS reduces.
In 2014 our emissionsreduced to 16.6 million tonnes with allowances purchased at an averageprice of 4.6 per tonne from 20.3 million tonnes last year with allowances 16.6m purchased at an average price of 6.1 per tonne, a saving of 47 million year-on-year.
When we sell ROCs and LECs, to a third party or Haven Power, the value 16.6 million tonnes of previously recognised as a reduction in fuel costs and held in our balance sheet is CO2emissions allowances purchased in 2014 recognised as a cost of sale.
The cost of ROCs and LECs sold in 2014 is 314 million 2013: 20.3 million tonnes.
2013: 62 million, with the increase compared to last year reflecting both increased generation and our ability to accelerate sales using ROC agreements as described above.
When it is more economical to do so, we can meet our power delivery obligations created through forward sales of power in prior periods by buying power from the market.
Power purchases in 2014 totalled 710 million 2013: 334 million.
Generation cost of sales also includes grid charges of 82 million 2013: 70 million which continue to increase as the level of intermittent generation on the UK electricity system impacts system balancing costs.
Generation operating performance Health and safety 2014 saw another year of significant project activity at Drax Power Station, with the 0.33 modification of a second unit to run as an enhanced co-firing unit from May and its subsequent conversion in October alongside a single major scheduled planned outage.
Against this backdrop our safety performance in the UK remains industryTotal recordable injury rate leading, with no worse than first aid injuries during annual major planned outages in 2014 2013: 0.29. atDrax Power Station for two years.
In the US, substantial progress has been made on the construction of two pellet plants and a port facility.
We have worked hard this year, with our contractors, to improve safety standards at these sites and bring them into line with performance levels at our UK operations.
Regrettably, as noted in the Chief Executives statement, the tragic death of a subcontractor at one of our US construction sites in the year stands as a reminder to the critical importance of strong safety standards and culture.
The safety of all of our employees and contractors across the Group is of paramount importance and has always been at the centre of our management ethos.
The Groups lost time injury rate and total recordable injury rate TRIR in 2014 were 0.06 and 0.33 respectively, compared to 0.09 and 0.29 in 2013.
Despite the increase in TRIR, which was related to our US construction programme, our performance continues to be in the upper quartile amongst global coal power plants.
35 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Plant operational performance Biomass When initially converted in April 2013, our first biomass unit was materially constrained by the use of temporary fuel storage, handling and distribution systems.
The commissioning of our bespoke systems late last year has largely overcome these start-up issues.
With two converted units at the end of the year, both running fully on our bespoke receipt, storage and handling infrastructure, biomass now represents 29% of our electrical output, having increased from 2.9TWh in 2013 to 7.9TWh in 2014.
Both units are performing well and to plan, delivering 630MW of capacity on a consistent basis.
We have made good progress with biomass unit optimisation.
In addition, we completed a successful grid flexibility test during 2014.
As a result, we expect to undertake greater system balancing activities from biomass units, enhancing potential value streams.
Outage activity in the year included a one-month outage to modify the second unit for enhanced co-firing from May and a further outage ahead of full conversion from October, in addition to scheduled routine maintenance and fuel trials.
The first biomass unit, which has now been running for over 18 months, ran very reliably throughout 2014.
Our maintenance regime includes a major planned outage for each of our six units once every four years.
Consequently, there is an irregular pattern to planned outages and associated expenditure, since in two of the four years two units will each undergo a major planned outage.
In 2015, our first converted biomass unit will undergo a major planned outage.
Coal We have continued to realise good operating performance from our remaining coal units.
Generation from coal-fired capacity was 18.8TWh 2013: 23.3TWh in 2014, the reduction from the prior period caused by biomass conversion activity described above.
A single major planned outage took place on coal units in 2014, compared to two in the previous year.
There are no major outages planned for coal-generating units in 2015.
9TWh Electrical output generated from biomass fuel in 2014 was 7.9TWh 2013: 2.9TWh.

2013: 8.1TWh ROCs earned by the generation business from burning biomass can be utilised by the retail business through its sales of power.
In 2014, Haven Power utilised 36% of ROCs generated by Drax.
In addition, where Haven Power supplies Renewable or Levy Exempt Power this utilises the LECs earned by burning biomass.
Such sales account for over half of Haven Powers volumes.
With our growth targets for the business, Haven Power should utilise all the ROCs generated from one of our converted units and a substantial proportion of the LECs from the three planned unit conversions.
In selling power into the retail market, rather than wholesale, the Group swaps collateral risk for credit risk, which is more controllable.
Haven Power actively manages credit risk by assessing the financial strength of its customers and applying rigorous credit management processes, reflected in very low bad debt experience to date.
Further information on credit risk is provided in note 22 to the financial statements.
We continue to have a strong focus on cash collection and working capital.
This focus, combined with the growth at Haven Power, has again resulted in the retail business being a net contributor of cash to the Group.
Revenue Movements in key financial metrics for Haven Power are underpinned by continued good volume growth.
Haven Power delivered net sales volume growth of 46% this year to 11.8TWh from 8.1TWh in 2013.
Haven Power has built its business on a good service reputation, which has supported the achieved growth and has resulted in an excellent renewals performance in the I&C sector.
As a result of this growth, revenue increased to 1,090 million at an average price of92.4 per MWh 2013: 751 million at an average price of 92.7 per MWh.
Much of Havens sales growth continues to be from the larger but more competitive I&C market.
Many larger I&C customers are signed up to flexible contracts where the customer decides when to fix the price of their power, or leave it to day or month ahead prices.
As a result, the declining wholesale power price in 2014 has contributed to the reduced average price for retail sales.
With over 13TWh of sales already contracted for the next 12 months we expect Haven to continue to grow in the future, with our proven infrastructure providing the foundation from which future growth can be achieved.
37 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Cost of sales Net generation split by customer % Total power purchases increased to 629 million in 2014 2013: 455 million, primarily Retail: as a result of the increase in sales volumes described above.
Haven purchases most 49% of its power requirement from Drax Power Station, with all non-long-term intra-group purchases made at market equivalent prices.
Accordingly, the average price paid of 53.3 per MWh has fallen slightly from 56.2 per MWh in 2013 reflecting changes in the wholesale market over the period.
In addition to the cost of purchasing power, cost of sales comprise third party costs including grid charges, the cost of meeting our obligations under the Renewables Obligation, small-scale Feed-in-Tariff schemes and the cost of LECs required to deliver Renewable or Levy Exempt Power to our customers.
Grid charges include costs of distribution, transmission and system balancing.
Wholesale: 51% The rates charged by the network and system operators have increased compared to 2013.
Distribution costs increased by 9% on average in April 2014 and transmission costs increased by 15% on average for the same period.
As described under 2014 2013 Change Generation, the increase in intermittent generation on the UK electricity system has Wholesale 51% 66% 15% driven an increase in system balancing costs.
As a result, total grid charges for 2014 Retail 49% 34% 15% were 253 million, equivalent to 21.4 per MWh sold 2013: 168 million, equivalent to Retail sales based on volume at Notional Balancing Point.
In April 2014 the costs of the Renewables Obligation increased from 8.66 per MWh to 10.57 per MWh sold, an increase of over 22%.
Small-scale Feed-in-Tariff costs also increased by 30% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Approximately half of the power sold by Haven is levy exempt.
Accordingly the associated total cost of LECs sold has increased year-on-year as sales volumes grow.
Total third party costs, at 445 million, represented 41% of the overall costs of supply 2013: 280 million, 38% of the overall costs of supply.
Gross margin The markets in which Haven Power operates have been very competitive in both the current and prior period.
It is these challenging trading conditions that drive the gross margin performance of the retail business.
As noted above, revenues from flexible sales contracts have reduced due to the falling wholesale power price in the year.
Conversely, rising third party costs put further pressure on the margins achievable on fixed price sales.
The majority of the growth achieved at Haven Power over recent years has come from the more competitive I&C market, which typically has a lower gross margin than the SME market.
Taking all of these factors into account, retail gross margin for 2014 was 17 million compared to 16 million in 2013.
17m Retail gross profit in 2014 2013: 16 million.

220 In addition, we invested 3 million into the White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage WRCCS project during the year.
The project is at the mid-point of a two-year 215 Front-End Engineering and Design process.
We have committed to provide a further 1 million of funding to enable the project to conclude this process, with a final 210 investment decision expected in 2016.
Further details of our investment in WRCCS are set out in note 12 to the financial statements.
205 Further costs associated with Retail Market Reform added 1 million to the cost base of Haven Power in 2014, compared to the previous year.
Despite these incremental costs, the result for the year demonstrates our continued commitment to strong operational cost control.
The chart to the left of this page illustrates good year-on-year performance in managing the underlying cost base of the Group, with low inflation in underlying costs after allowing for a single major outage 2013: double major outage in 2014.
Group EBITDA Group EBITDA earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation which excludes the impact of unrealised gains and losses and the one-off settlement of CESP in 2014 see below, is our primary financial performance indicator.
Changes in EBITDA are primarily driven by factors influencing the gross margin.
Despite challenging market conditions and absorbing additional carbon costs through CPS, our gross margin improved modestly this year as a result of the increasing influence of our biomass transformation, good operational performance at Drax Power Station and continued strong growth at Haven Power.
However, investment in our cost base to support our US operations as they approach commercial operations and the increasing costs of meeting regulatory requirements in both generation and retail mean our EBITDA is in line with last year at 229 million.

229m Community Energy Saving Programme CESP Group EBITDA In November 2014 we reached a settlement agreement with Ofgem regarding non- 2013: 230 million.
compliance with our obligations under the Community Energy Saving Programme CESP.
The settlement requires us to contribute a total of 28 million, which will see up to 20 million benefit vulnerable energy consumers through a programme of work to be developed with the charity National Energy Action.
A further 5 million fine will be payable and 3 million delivered as further consumer redress measures.
The objective of CESP was to deliver energy saving measures to domestic energy users in specified low-income areas of Great Britain.
We voiced our concerns at the outset regarding the inclusion of independent generators in the scheme given their lack of experience in delivering the energy efficiency schemes requested and lack of any direct relationships with domestic electricity consumers.
For these reasons, we outsourced our obligation to a third party provider operating within the sector.
Unfortunately, the chosen provider failed to deliver the obligation in full and, despite procuring additional measures, we did not comply with our obligations under the scheme by the end of the obligation period.
We have agreed a settlement with the third party for breach of contract in this regard, which will result in Drax receiving settlement of 5 million in cash and the third party delivering the consumer redress measures described above.
The net impact of these settlements to Drax is therefore a cash cost of 20 million which, as a material one-off item which is non-operational in nature, has been excluded from our underlying performance measures, including EBITDA, in line with previous policy.
Depreciation Depreciation was 81 million for the year ended 31 December 2014, compared to 65 million in 2014.
The commissioning of our biomass storage, handling and distribution systems at Drax Power Station late in 2013 drives the majority of this increase.
As we progress our biomass transformation and the US supply chain investments come online in 2015, depreciation charges will continue to increase.
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts A key component of the Groups risk management strategy, set out in more detail on pages 46 to 49, is the use of forward contracts to secure and fide-risk the future cash flows of the business.
The Group uses forward contracts in two ways forward purchases and sales of physical commodities to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future sales and the use of financial contracts either currency exchange contracts or contracts underpinned by commodity prices which are settled financially, rather than by delivery of physical goods to fix sterling cash flows.
As we progress our biomass transformation, we have entered into an extensive hedging programme to support our biomass procurement activities and secure the sterling cost of biomass.
This has included forward contracts for the purchase of physical biomass, the use of financial products to fix variable elements of indexation notably oil-linked within these contracts, and foreign exchange contracts to secure the sterling cash flows.
This programme covers all contracted and a substantial proportion of uncontracted but forecast purchases.
This programme, in conjunction with the established hedging strategy for our coal operations, provides a significant degree of protection from adverse market price movements.
Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview 40 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Operational and financial performance continued The accounting for these contracts is described in further detail in note 20 to the financial statements, but briefly, the unrealised gains and losses recognised in the income statement reflect changes in the fair value of forward commodity and financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption or as hedges from an accounting perspective, even though the contracts represent an economic hedge under International Financial Reporting Standards.
The fair value of a forward contract is primarily derived with reference to prevailing market prices at the start and end of the period.
The location of the unrealised gains and losses arising on our portfolio of these contracts within the 2014 financial statements is summarised in the table below: Accounting treatment for Gains losses gains losses in the consolidated Accounting for derivative contracts on contracts in 2014 financial statements Commodity contracts Power 52.7 million Hedge reserve Coal from international sources 13.9 million Income statement Coal from domestic sources n a Own-use exemption Biomass n a Own-use exemption CO2 emissions allowances 11.0 million Hedge reserve Gas 11.2 million Income statement Financial contracts Foreign currency exchange contracts 106.6 million Income statement 44.2 million Hedge reserve Financial coal 24.5 million Income statement 7.5 million Hedge reserve Financial oil and other financial products 62.6 million Income statement Total net gains in hedge reserve note 28 100.4 million Total net gains in income statement note 20 65.8 million Accounting treatment is determined by the availability of the own-use exemption or the hedge relationship being designated as and meeting the definition of an effective hedge under IFRS.
Where neither of these items apply, unrealised gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
Unrealised gains recognised in the income statement of 66 million this year 2013:unrealised losses of 110 million principally reflect the strengthening US dollar, relative to sterling during the period, which improved the value of our contracted position relative to prevailing market rates.
These gains were offset to an extent by unrealised losses on financial oil contracts, utilised in securing the element of biomass costs linked to oil price indices, as global oil prices fell significantly in the final quarter of the year.
In considering these movements it is important to recognise that profitability is driven by our strategy to deliver market level dark green and bark spreads, not by the absolute price of any single commodity at a given date.
The unrealised gains and losses on forward contracts represent a subset of our total forward contracted position, driven by accounting regulations, and are not indicative of future financial performance.
Accordingly we exclude these gains and losses from our key underlying performance measures.
Interest Net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 were 29 million compared to 23 million in 2013.
The 6 million increase in net finance costs reflects the additional costs associated with financing our biomass transformation.
This includes interest on our borrowings which are described in further detail in the Liquidity and capital resources section on page 42.
41 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Profit before tax The profit before tax for 2014 is 166 million, compared to 32 million in the previous year.
The settlement of CESP, additional depreciation and interest charges have resulted in an incremental pre-tax charge of 41 million in 2014: however the increase in pre-tax profits has been driven by unrealised gains on derivative contracts of 66 million, compared to unrealised losses of 110 million last year.
Underlying profit before tax, which excludes the impact of unrealised gains and losses and the one-off effect of the CESP settlement in 2014, amounted to 120 million compared to 142 million in 2013.
The 22 million reduction is primarily attributable to additional depreciation and interest charges.

The increase principally reflects the increase in profit before tax in 2014 versus 2013, which was driven primarily by the unrealised gains recognised in respect of derivative contracts 2013: unrealised losses.
The 2013 tax credit included non-recurring tax credits of 22 million relating to reductions in UK corporation tax rates, and 7 million in respect of research and development claims agreed with HMRC.
The underlying effective rate of tax excluding the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivatives contracts and settlement of CESP, as described above is 20% in 2014, in line with the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK as expected.
The comparable underlying rate in 2013 was 0%, driven by the nonrecurring tax credits described above.
Cash taxes paid during the year were 16 million 2013: 18 million, principally reflecting lower underlying profit before tax.
These payments were offset by tax refunds in settlement of prior years, bringing net taxes paid in 2014 to 14 million 2013: 11 million.
Profit after tax and earnings per share Profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 129 million, compared to 51 million in 2013, driving basic earnings per share of 32 pence in 2014, compared to 13 pence in 2013.
96m Underlying profit after tax, which strips out the impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and the settlement of CESP in 2014, was 96 million Underlying profit after tax 2013: 142 million resulting in underlying earnings per share of 24 pence per share 2013: 142 million.
The reduction in underlying earnings per share in 2014 reflects the impact of increased depreciation, interest and tax charges described above.
This is the basis for dividend distributions.

This complements our existing term loan facilities 350 secured in 2012 and 2013 and enhances the existing financing structure by providing additional liquidity to the Group and ensuring a smooth profile of debt maturities.
300 Furthermore, the all-in cost of the new facility is very competitive.
250 The financing structure also incorporates the 75 million amortising term loan 200 facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, agreed last year, a 50 million amortising term 150 loan from the Green Investment Bank, a 100 million amortising term loan facility with 100 the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and a 400 million working capital and letter of credit facility.
The term loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 50 2025.
As envisaged under the terms of the original agreement, the working capital and letter of credit facility has been extended for one year and is now due to mature inApril 2017.
In addition, a commodity trading facility allows us to transact prescribed volumes ofcommodity trades at attractive prices without the requirement to post collateral.
This facility continues to operate well, offering trading counterparties uncapped access to the security package available to our senior lenders.
Overall, the financing structure is a key component of the steps we have taken over the past few years to restructure our business, financing and trading arrangements to enable Drax to both invest to strengthen and secure the potential of the business, whilst being able to operate comfortably at a sub-investment grade level.
ROCs and LECs earned from renewable generation can drive significant working capital absorption, with the associated cash income typically received up to 12 months after burning the associated biomass.
At the end of 2013 we executed an 80 million ROC monetisation agreement with Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Ltd, expanding our capability to enhance cash flows by selling ROC receivables.
The agreement has been utilised during the year to accelerate over 50 million of cash from ROC sales to third parties.
We have recently concluded further similar agreements with HSBC and Lloyds, taking the total of ROC monetisation agreements in place to 200 million.
We continue to explore ways to further enhance our ROC cash flows.
Capital expenditure Fixed asset additions were 201 million in the year ended 31 December 2014, compared to 286 million in 2013.
This includes 125 million on our biomass transformation 201m project 2013: 228 million, which is now mostly focused on our US developments following the commissioning of the on-site facilities at Drax Power Station in late 2013.
Capital expenditure Total capital expenditure to date on the biomass transformation project, with two 2013: 286 million.
units complete, necessary supporting infrastructure in place and significant progress with the two US pellet plants and port facility, amounts to approximately 550 million.
We expect to spend a further 130 million over the period to 2017 concluding these projects and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive IED, bringing total development expenditure to 650-700 million, in line with our original guidance.
Our lead case investment for IED compliance remains unchanged, incorporating the implementation of low nitrogen oxide burners and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction technology across all units.
At Drax Power Station, the on-site infrastructure and systems that underpin our transformation strategy are now in place and provide us with the ability to unload rail wagons efficiently, store up to 300 thousand tonnes of biomass on-site and deliver it directly to the combustion systems of converted units.
In the US, our port facility is now pellet-ready and both pellet plants have entered a commissioning phase.
We continue to expect commercial operations at our first pellet plant in the first quarter of 2015, with commercial operations at the second pellet plant following in the second quarter.
Both plants are expected to reach full capacity six months later.

Read more: Capital risk management 129 Seasonality of borrowing Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices and despatch in the Winter period and lower despatch in the Summer months, when prices are lower and plant availability is affected by planned outages.
Accordingly, cash flow during the Summer months is materially reduced due to the combined effect of lower prices and output, while maintenance expenditures are increased during this period due to major planned outages.
The Groups 400 million working capital and letter of credit facility assists in managing the cash low points in the cycle where required see Financing and cash flow management.
Future developments The market outlook for 2015 remains challenging.
We will continue to see the erosion of dark green spreads as the cost of carbon increases following the CPS trajectory set by government.
Our dark green spreads will also be impacted by changes to gas and power prices, which remain uncertain.
Lower power prices will also impact bark spreads, where the fuel price is less variable and will not fall in line with revenues received.
The timing of our hedges provides protection for a limited period, following which any persisting market weakness will impact our future financial results.
We remain committed to our strategy to convert three units to biomass with the funding platform already in place to deliver this.
Our capital expenditure projects to support this ambition remain on schedule and on budget and are set to deliver a stronger, more robust business.
In 2016 we will have converted three units to biomass, providing cost-effective, low carbon renewable energy.
As noted in the Chief Executives statement, two of our coal generating units were successful in the first capacity market auction in December 2014, with capacity payments expected to commence in 2018.
The White Rose CCS project is now half way through its feasibility study, which is onschedule to complete towards the end of 2015.
