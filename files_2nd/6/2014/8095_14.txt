GARETH WRIGHT GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED During 2014 we have completed a number of bolt-on acquisitions and we strengthened our Global Exhibitions Division with the acquisitions of Virgo Group and .
Acquisitions are assessed on case-by-case basis against abroad set of financial and strategic criteria.
For bolt-on acquisitions, these have to meet strict acquisition criteria which include delivering returns in excess of the Groups weighted average cost of capital in the first full year, being earnings enhancing in the first full year of ownership, and achieving acash payback within seven years.
However, for selective acquisitions, the Group will take a longer-term view toallow time for full integration of the acquired business, coupled with additional investment to maximise the long-term returns itgenerates.
