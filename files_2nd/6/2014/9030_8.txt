The Groups IAS 19 pension liability is 26.5 million 2013: 9.8 million.
Net debt m The year-on-year increase arises as a result of movements in assumptions, in particular a lower discount rate used to calculate the schemes liabilities.

Group revenue 370.7 million and EBITDA before exceptional items 75.3 million were broadly flat 2013: 372.9 million and restated 74.9 million.
The KC segment reported revenue of 105.0 million 2013: 104.6 million representing a strong consumer performance particularly inthe take-up of fibre-based services, offset by slightly lower business revenue.
Ongoing efficient cost management resulted in EBITDA before exceptional items increasing by 3.1 per cent to 56.2 million 2013: 54.5 million.
Within our Kcom segment, revenue was 270.9 million 2013: 273.4 million reflecting our focus on exploiting emerging market trends.
EBITDA before exceptional items was 28.7 million 2013: 29.4 million.
We anticipate some incremental decline in revenue in the year ending 31 March 2015, as the decline in some historic carrier based activities continue to decline.
KCOM Group PLC 22 Annual report and accounts 2013 14 Strategic report The Groups PLC segment includes central and share scheme expenses, andadministration costs associated with the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
These costs before exceptional items were 9.6 million 2013: restated 9.0 million.
The income statement effect of financing theGroups pension schemes was previously reported within EBITDA but, following the revision to IAS 19, is now included within finance costs.
The Groups net exceptional credit was 0.6 million.
This included a2.6million profit on contract termination offset by costs of restructuring 1.1 million, costs associated with the Groups second asset-backed pension funding arrangement 0.7 million and onerous lease costs 0.2 million.
Capital investment The Groups depreciation and amortisation charge for the year was 20.3 million 2013: 19.6 million, reflecting continued investment inexisting commitments.
We expect this charge to increase in future years.
Cash capital expenditure during the year was 27.9 million 2013:28.0 million.
Specific projects include: I the continued deployment of fibre: I IT investment to allow the Group to move towards common systems and processes: and I targeted customer specific investment.
The Group anticipates that capital investment levels will be approximately 35 million in the year ending 31 March 2015.
Thisincrease reflects the timing of cash outflows rather than amaterialchange in capital investment levels.
Tax The Groups tax charge of 11.8 million 2013: restated 11.9 million reflects the corporation tax charge for the year and the ongoing unwind of deferred tax balances.
Deferred tax balances have been re-measured to reflect the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 23 per cent to 20 per cent forthe year ending 31 March 2015.
The effective rate of 23.3 per cent is broadly in line with the prevailing rate ofcorporation tax as the effect of re-measuring deferred tax is offset by prior year tax items.
The Groups corporation tax liability would have been higher had it not been for the benefit arising from theGroups second asset-backed pension funding arrangement.
Our cash tax payment in the year ended 31 March 2015 relating to the current year is c2 million.
We expect cash tax payments in the years ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016 to be c4 million and c5million respectively, in line with prevailing corporation tax rates.
