deficits calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
The new pensions accounting standard came into force for Kier for the June 2014 financial year and the 2013 figures, as Haydn Mursell comparatives, have been restated.
The expected return on scheme assets and the interest cost on scheme liabilities, Chief Executive previously reported in the income statement, have been replaced with a net interest cost which is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit obligation.
The amendment has a corresponding impact on actuarial gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with no overall change to the net retirement benefit liability in the Balance Sheet.
At 30 June 2014, on an IAS 19 basis, the net deficit of the Kier Group Pension Scheme was 50m 2013: 37m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 837m 2013: 784m and the net present value of the liabilities was 900m 2013: 832m.
The increase in the net deficit was a result of changes in the key assumptions, particularly the lower than predicted discount rate.
Clearly these assumptions change as market rates fluctuate.
The triennial valuation of the scheme as at 1 April 2013 has now been concluded, resulting in an increase in additional deficit contributions of about 1m pa.
The Group is currently consulting with members over the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual.
