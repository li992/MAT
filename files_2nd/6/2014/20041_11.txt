The 26 February 2015 duration of these swaps matched the duration of the principal instrument.
These interest rate derivative instruments were accounted for as fair value hedges of the relevant liability.
Foreign exchange risk management Foreign currency transaction exposures arising on internal and external trade ows are not generally hedged.
Our objective is to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency income with local currency costs where possible.
Our internal trading transactions are matched centrally and we manage inter-company payment terms to reduce foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency cash ows can be hedged selectively under the management of Corporate Treasury and the TMG.
These include hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from acquisitions and disposals of assets.
Where possible, we manage the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency.
In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, we seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal assets and cash ows.
These are primarily denominated in US dollars, Euros and Sterling.
Certain borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets.
Forward contracts in major currencies are also used to reduce exposure to our investment in overseas Group assets.
The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings to assets for major currencies monthly.
