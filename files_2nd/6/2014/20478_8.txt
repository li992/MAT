This change has been made in order to increase yield without materially increasing risk.
This change has not resulted in a material change in credit quality and only a moderate increase in average duration, due to the features of the underlying investments.
Money market funds, fixed income and debt securities comprise the majority of the total: 79% at31 December 2014, up from 77% at 31 December 2013.
Investment and interest income in 2014 was 15.4 million, up 8% on 2013 14.3 million.
Theincrease was due to higher average balances along with the increased allocation of funds tofixed income and other short dated securities that took place across 2014.
The increase would have been greater but was partially offset by an adjustment of approximately 8million relating to notional investment income on quota share reinsurance funds withheld arrangements.
