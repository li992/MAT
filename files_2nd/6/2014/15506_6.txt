CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED We will achieve this by maintaining our focus on delivering best-in-class customer service, investing in our systems and staff, simplifying and, where possible, improving the competitiveness of our services even further, encouraging existing Members to talk about the unique benefits we offer to their friends and acquaintances, and making it easier for our Partners to promote our services more effectively.
We continue to explore the possibility of expanding our current range of core services into areas where we can leverage our existing strong relationship with our Members to offer them improved service and better value on services they currently obtain from other suppliers, whilst also delivering a satisfactory return for our shareholders.
Potential additional services include water, television and or a range of insurance products eg: home and motor policies.
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND NON-FINANCIAL KPIs Our overall performance for the year has been extremely encouraging in a number of key respects: continuing strong organic growth with service numbers up by 305,100 2013: 221,037 lower churn lower delinquency growing proportion of Members taking all five of our core services significant increase in the number of new Partners positive reviews and recognition from Which?
for both energy and telephony services consistently high Net Promoter Scores Against the background of a broadly flat economy, and with household incomes remaining under pressure, our value-based consumer proposition and the part-time income opportunity we offer are extremely attractive to both Members and Partners respectively.
Our continuing strong organic growth is underpinned by high levels of confidence amongst our Partners in our brand and financial strength, the good value provided by our services, and our commitment to delivering best-in-class customer service.
Customers CUSTOMER GROUP 2014 2013 Residential Club 495,234 425,118 Business Club 29,098 28,313 TOTAL CLUB 524,332453,431 TML 6,3077,601 TOTAL GROUP 530,639461,032 12 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Our customer base can be split into three groups as set out in the above table, each of which has different characteristics: i Residential customers who are Members of the Utility Warehouse Discount Club 93.3% of our customers taking on average 3.64 services from us: ii Small businesses who are Members of the Utility Warehouse Discount Club for Business 5.5% of our customers taking on average 2.74 services from us: and iii Other small businesses signed up through our wholly owned Telecommunications Management Limited TML subsidiary 1.2% of our customers taking on average 3.56 services from us.
These customers are no longer considered a core part of the business, and their contribution is becoming progressively less material in the context of the Group.
Within the residential Club, there is a further difference in quality and therefore in the revenues and profits they will generate over the time they remain a Club Member between Members, depending on whether they are a homeowner, and on the number of services we provide to them.
We are therefore pleased that against the backdrop of an increasing national trend towards renting, the proportion of homeowners amongst new Members has remained broadly steady at around 75%, and the proportion of new Members taking all five of our core services has increased significantly compared with the previous year: PERCENTAGE OF NEW RESIDENTIAL CLUB MEMBERS TAKING FIVE CORE SERVICES 13.3% Q1 FY14 13.2% Q2 FY14 16.3% Q3 FY14 24.4% Q4 FY14 Although on average a new Member taking all five of our core services requires a greater initial investment, these Members benefit from our most competitive prices, generate higher commission for our Partners, and provide the greatest lifetime value to the Company.
Overall churn within our customer base has continued to fall.
This is best illustrated by analysing individual energy supply point churn, which declined to an average of just 0.8% per month during the final quarter, and demonstrates one of the key benefits from progressively improving the quality of our customer base: Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 13 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED ENERGY SUPPLY POINT CHURN 16.3% FY11 13.3% FY12 11.2% FY13 10.4% FY14 Average revenue per customer would have shown a further increase during the year due to the improvement in the quality of our customer base and slightly higher retail prices, but these positive factors were more than offset by lower energy consumption during an exceptionally mild winter this year, and the comparison with an exceptionally cold winter which inflated energy spend the previous year: AVERAGE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER These revenue figures relate to the Customer Management operating segment and exclude our TML subsidiary 14 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 190 286 316 329 459 482 505 634 801 824 1,057 1,152 1,162 1,190 1,363 1,302 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements We enjoy high levels of overall customer satisfaction, as evidenced by the positive reviews we receive from Which?
magazine on a regular basis, and the feedback we receive from the surveys we send out each month to Members who have contacted our call centre.
This feedback is consistently generating a positive Net Promoter Score of around 40: to put this into context, any score above zero in the utility sector would be considered highly acceptable E. ON has reported a score of -21 in its residential supply business, and the average in a 2013 Satmetrix industry report on internet service providers was 9.
Our innovative CashBack card continues to generate significant monthly savings for our Discount Club Members, with the total value of CashBack credited to Members since launching this programme now in excess of 18m.
In addition, we have seen increasing numbers of Members using our online shopping portal and price comparison service to help them find the cheapest online supplier for a wide range of everyday household goods, and to earn additional CashBack.
Services Our full range of services include Fixed Telephony calls and line rental, Broadband, Mobile, Gas, Electricity, and CashBack card.
At the year end, we supplied a total of 1,907,160 services 2013: 1,602,060, representing a record net increase of 305,100 during the year.
SERVICES 2014 2013 Electricity 474,123 403,922 Gas 392,744 334,565 Fixed Telephony calls and NGN 296,820 260,502 Fixed Telephony line rental 264,341 221,692 Broadband 221,938 175,337 Mobile 117,425 89,017 CashBack card 139,769 117,025 TOTAL 1,907,160 1,602,060 Residential Club 1,804,830 1,504,802 Business Club 79,864 72,676 TOTAL CLUB 1,884,694 1,577,478 TML 22,466 24,582 TOTAL GROUP 1,907,160 1,602,060 We saw consistent quarterly growth throughout the year in all the core services we provide Gas, Electricity, Mobile, Home Phone and Broadband, with a particularly pleasing 31.9% rise in the number of mobile services provided.
This increase means penetration of Mobile within our residential Club has risen from 12.5% to 23.7% over the last three years as a result of our continuing investment in making this service more attractive to Members.
With around 35% of new Members taking this service, there remains significant scope for further improvement in this level of penetration over the next few years.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 15 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED CashBack card Our exclusive CashBack card has proven itself as an important Member acquisition and retention tool.
It gives our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as a credit on their next monthly bill from us.
We have seen a 19% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 139,769 2013: 117,025, with a little under one third of new residential Club Members applying for a card.
We believe this steady level of demand is a reflection of the continuing challenging economic climate, where many new Members find it difficult to fund the switch from paying in arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in advance with a prepayment card.
We paid over 4.6m 2013: 4.4m in CashBack to our Members during the year funded entirely by the retailers in the programme, with many Members achieving a reduction of between 20% and 30% on the amount they pay for the utilities we are supplying to them each month, simply by using their CashBack card instead of an alternative payment card for most of their regular household shopping.
Customer Service We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single call centre based in the UK.
We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues they may have with their multi-utility account.
We have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members: we readily invest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects of our Members interactions with us in order to ensure the overall quality of their experience.
We have been delighted at the consistently high customer service ratings we receive in Which?
magazine, and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys.
Partners Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business.
In contrast to the routes to market adopted by other suppliers of essential household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenuesharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold equity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy higher-spending customers who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be least likely to churn: by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income.
This ensures that cases of misselling are generally both inadvertent and extremely rare.
We provide a variety of training and personal development courses both online and classroom based, designed to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners effectively and successfully: all of these courses are free to attend.
In addition, we have recently introduced an interest-free hire purchase scheme to allow our Partners access to a Tablet to help them present the benefits of our unique Discount Club.
16 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with a subsidised Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini, remains extremely popular and around 575 vehicles are now in circulation 2013: 500.
Owners inform us that they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from both potential new Members and Partners.
Premises and Systems We are making good progress with the refurbishment of our new headquarters office building which we purchased in February 2012.
Once this project is completed towards the end of this year, it will provide sufficient space to support our growing business needs for the foreseeable future.
From a systems perspective, we have the capacity to manage a substantial increase in our current customer and service numbers, without the need for any material further investment.
