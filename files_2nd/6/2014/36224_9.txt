The unaudited and unreviewed pro forma financial information for 2013 has been prepared in a manner consistent with the accounting policies applicable for periods ending on or after 1 January 2013 as outlined in note 1 of the financial statements with the exception of the accounting treatment applied to certain associates and joint ventures for which Glencores attributable share of revenues and expenses are presented see note 2 and reflects the final fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of Xstrata on 2 May 2013 as if the acquisition and full consolidation of such had taken place as of 1 January 2013.
These adjustments primarily relate to depreciation, amortisation and the release of onerous and unfavourable contract provisions.
The pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, because of its nature, addresses a hypothetical situation and therefore does not reflect the Groups actual financial position or results.
A reconciliation of the pro forma results to the reported results for the year ended 31 December 2013 is included in the glossary.
The reported and pro forma financial information is presented in the Financial review section before significant items unless otherwise stated to provide an enhanced understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
Significant items refer to page 36 are items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact andnature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results.
Financial results Compared to the 2013 pro forma results, 2014 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 2% to $12,764 million and Adjusted EBIT was down 10% to $6,706 million, as the impact of generally lower commodity prices on our industrial assets, offset the benefits of anet production increase, currency related cost benefits and an 18% increase in marketing Adjusted EBIT to $2,790 million.
These results continue to reinforce the strength and resilience of Glencores business model and the diversification benefits associated with combining and integrating, across a broad spectrum of commodities, a portfolio of industrial assets with large scale physical sourcing, marketing and logistics capabilities.

Metals and minerals Adjusted marketing EBIT, while still delivering a solid overall contribution, was down 7% over 2013, with iron ore having faced particularly challenging marketing conditions during the year.
Energy products Adjusted marketing EBIT was down 17% compared to 2013, reflecting the oversupplied coal and flat oil markets that prevailed during the first half of 2014, however market conditions, notably in oil, were more supportive towards the end of the year, on account of increased volatility and curve structure.
The Agricultural products Adjusted marketing EBIT was up $658 million compared to 2013, on the back of strong results from Viterra and also improved results from the traditional marketing business and industrial activities, albeit from a low 2013 base.
Industrial Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 7% to $9,763 million, owing to weaker average year over year commodity prices including coal, gold, silver, oil and copper down 8-20%, 10%, 21%, 9% and 6% respectively.
Average nickel and zinc prices were the main exceptions, increasing by 13% each during the year.
The net lower prices were partially mitigated by weaker producer currencies notably the Tenge, Rand, and Canadian and Australian dollars, down relative to the US dollar, by 18%, 12%, 7% and 7% respectively, increased production, notably Mutanda, as it delivered on its 200,000 tonnes per annum target and a stronger Agricultural industrial performance.
