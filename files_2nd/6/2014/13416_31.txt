Amortisation of certain 1 1 acquired intangible Operating derivatives fair value changes assets Fair value changes on operating derivatives relate to changes in the value of commodity hedges for the forward purchase of aluminium Fair value changes 5 5 and the fair value movements on non hedge accounted forward on certain operating exchange contracts.

During 2014 some of the aluminium hedges failed the effectiveness test.
Once a hedge has failed an effectiveness test, accounting standards do not allow for it to be retrospectively redesignated and therefore fair value movements will continue to be recorded in the income statement.
The change in aluminium prices on these failed aluminium hedges has given rise to a gain of 3m 2013: charge of 23m.
There was also a gain of 2m 2013: charge of 1m relating to fair value changes on certain non hedged accounted commodity and foreign exchange contracts.
