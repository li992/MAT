Mortgage availability and consumer confidence have also improved in the last 12 months.
The planning environment is currently positive, although a shortage of planning officers in local authorities is leading to some delays getting started on site.
The UK has under-invested in affordable housing for the last 30 years, creating considerable pent-up demand.
All political parties see the sector as a lever for economic growth and employment, and there is high reliance on the private sector for supply.
The Governments ten-year rent policy has strengthened the financial capacity of Registered Providers RPs.

Our gross margin improved from 19.8% to 21.4%, with the operating margin up from 13.3% to 15.1% and return on capital increased to 22.4%.
The margin of 15.1% was ahead of our expectations.
The operating margin benefited from using more land bought at current prices: operational efficiency driven by The Linden Way, which standardises our processes by pulling together best practice fromacross our business: leveraging our fixed overheads: and increased revenues from our affordable housing developments.
Whilst we have seen cost increases in our supply chain, as a result of the shortages discussed in the chief executives review on page 8, this was offset by sales price increase in the year.
Help to Buy has been an important catalyst in improving housing market conditions this year, although its impact on our sales has been less than for many of our peers.
Since its launch, customers have used Help to Buy for 32% of our plots but only 26% of sales by value.
Fewer of our customers are using Help to Buy in the South and South East, where we are strongest, with a greater Homes in prime locations proportion in the Midlands and East of England, where affordability is often more of an issue.

The Government has implemented a ten-year rent policy, which will sustain the capacity of housing associations to commission affordable homes over the next decade.
Major registered providers also want to leverage their balance sheets, by including speculative sales to cross-subsidise their activities.
This plays to Linden Homes strengths in development and sales.

At the year end, we had secured plots for 100% of our planned developments in 2015 and 87% for 2016.
Combined with the record sales carried forward at the year end, this puts us in a strong position to hit our objectives.
We will drive efficiency and do more with our existing resources, as we aim to further increase our margin.
We will continue to benefit from our sector expertise in delivering affordable housing.
Our challenge will be to deliver homes within our expected timescales and costs.
Whilstsupply chain conditions have steadied in recent months, we believe they will remain difficult during the next financial year.
This requires us to plan ahead and to work with our supply chain partners, so they understand our development schedules and can provide materials when we needthem.
