Richard Rose Finance Director Economic background FINANCIAL REVIEW After three and a half years in which the price of oil averaged above US$100 bbl, crude oil experienced a sharp fall in the second half of 2014.
The average for 2014 was US$98.9 bbl against US$108.7 bbl for the prior year.
In the first half of 2014 the Brent oil price ranged between US$104 bbl and US$115 bbl, before falling to US$55 bbl by the end of the year.
Premiers portfolio of crudes traded at a weighted average of US$2.0 bbl premium to Brent 2013: US$2.6 bbl, as we continued to realise favourable prices, particularly for our Chim So crude.
Premiers average realisations for the year were US$98.2 bbl 2013: US$109.0 bbl after taking into account timings of actual liftings and export duties paid in Vietnam.
Post hedging, realised prices increased to US$101.0 bbl 2013: US$109.1 bbl.
Average gas prices for the group were US$8.4 mscf 2013: US$8.3 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, linked to HSFO pricing and in turn, therefore, linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$16.8 mscf 2013: US$17.1 mscf.
The average price for Pakistan gas where only a portion of the contract formulae is linked to energy prices was US$4.6 mscf 2013: US$4.4 mscf.
Premier Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements 49 Effect of steep decline of the oil price The fall in both spot and forward oil prices has inevitably had an impact on our reported financial results in respect of the carrying value of certain of our oil and gas assets.
An impairment charge has been booked in the income statement relating to several of our fields in the UK North Sea, Indonesia, Vietnam and Mauritania.
The total amount for the impairment pre-tax is US$784.4 million US$327.8 million, post-tax.
Impairment charges for the year, relating to UK fields, amounted to US$732.3 million pre-tax 2013: US$178.7 million, and were recognised for the Solan, RECORD Balmoral area and Huntington fields, while the remaining impairment charge of US$52.1 million was recognised in respect of the Chim So field in Vietnam, the Chinguetti field in Mauritania and SALES the Kakap field in Indonesia.
The principal cause of the impairment charge is a reduction in the short to medium-term oil price assumption used in estimating the future discounted cash flows for each field.
In addition to the impact of the reduced oil price REVENUE assumptions, a review of the expected decommissioning costs for the Balmoral area in the first half of 2014 has also driven part of the impairment charge, whilst the Solan impairment has in part been caused by an increase in the costs incurred to date and expected AND costs to completion.
Income statement Production in 2014 averaged 63.6 kboepd 2013: 58.2 kboepd up OPERATING 9.3 per cent on a working interest basis.
On an entitlement basis, which under the terms of our Production Sharing Contracts PSCs allows for additional government take at higher oil prices, CASH FLOW production was 57.8 kboepd 2013: 52.4 kboepd.
Working interest gas production averaged 177 mmscfd 2013: 174 mmscfd or approximately 49 per cent of total production.
The increase in the groups production can be partially attributed to an increase in operating efficiency across a number of assets in the portfolio.
The groups operating efficiency was 84 per cent in 2014 2013: 75 per cent.
Total sales revenue from all operations reached a new record level of US$1.6 billion 2013: US$1.5 billion, due to higher production PRODUCTION partially offset by lower average oil prices.
Cost of sales, excluding impairment charges, were US$986.6 million 2013: US$856.1 million.
Operating costs were stable at US$436.1 million 2013: US$418.9 million.
Unit operating costs were US$18.8 per barrel of oil equivalent boe 2013: US$19.7 boe, lower than the prior year due to higher production, improved operating efficiency across 64 several of the companys assets and one-off insurance claims kboepd received in the year.
Underlying unit amortisation rose to US$19.2 boe 2013: US$17.7 boe mainly reflecting higher production from fields in the UK and Vietnam, which carry a higher amortisation charge per boe compared to the group average.
Exploration expense and pre-licence expenditure costs amounted to US$58.5 million 2013: US$106.2 million and US$25.3 million 2013: US$30.1 million respectively.
This includes the write-offs relating to Block L10B in Kenya and the Ratu Gajah well in Indonesia, exiting our exploration licences in Mauritania and the relinquishment of various exploration licences in the UK as part of Premiers portfolio management programme.
Net administrative costs were US$25.4 million 2013: US$20.2 million.
50 Premier Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements Operating loss was US$248.1 million 2013: operating profit of US$352.0 million, mainly attributable to the impairment charges described above.
Finance costs and other charges, net of interest revenue and other gains, were US$137.8 million 2013: US$65.4 million.
The interest revenue from the loan to our partner on the Solan field development has increased to US$36.8 million 2013: US$6.3 million, however, we have recognised a provision of US$61.2 million against this long-term receivable, reflecting a reduction in the total returns expected on the Solan field in a lower oil price environment.
The charge for the unwinding of the discounted decommissioning provision increased to US$46.9 million 2013: US$36.4 million reflecting increased provisions for future decommissioning as industry cost estimates rise.
Pre-tax losses were US$384.0 million 2013: pre-tax profits US$285.4 million.
The group tax credit for 2014 was US$173.7 million 2013: tax charge of US$51.4 million, an effective tax rate of 45.2 per cent of the pre-tax loss.
The groups theoretical tax rate is close to 50 per cent, which includes a higher taxation rate in the UK being offset by lower rates in Vietnam and Pakistan.
The 2014 group tax credit arises as a result of a deferred tax credit in the UK, mainly arising from the tax effect of the impairment charges recognised in the year and recognition of the UK Small Fields allowance for the Catcher field.
The group has an estimated US$2.7 billion of carried forward UK corporation tax allowances and losses, the majority of which are forecast to be utilised against UK ring fence profits over time, and are therefore reflected in the deferred tax asset position at the year-end.
The group did not pay any corporation tax or supplementary charge in the UK in 2014 due to these brought forward losses.
Loss after tax was US$210.3 million 2013: profit after tax US$234.0 million resulting in a basic earnings per share loss of 40.3 cents 2013: profit 44.2 cents.
Dividend and buyback During 2014, Premier purchased 18.4 million shares at a volume weighted average price of 302 pence and paid a dividend of 5 pence per share.
In December, a decision was taken by the Board to postpone the buyback programme pending a recovery in the oil price.
The Board has also decided to suspend the dividend and therefore no dividend is proposed.
Cash flow OPERATING CASH FLOW Cash flow from operating activities was US$924.3 million 2013: US$802.5 million after US$ accounting for tax payments of US$208.5 million 2013: US$228.3 million.
Cash movements in working capital have improved to US$74.7 million 2013: US$1.3 million.
Capital expenditure in 2014 totalled US$1,195.5 million 2013: US$878.0 million.
Capital expenditure US$ million 2014 2013 924 Fields development projects 887.5 603.7 million Exploration and evaluation 294.1 260.5 Other 13.9 13.8 Total 1,195.5 878.0 The principal development projects were the Solan and Catcher fields in the UK, and CAPITAL INVESTMENT the Dua field in Vietnam.
In addition, US$318.4 million 2013: US$185.9 million funding US$ support was provided to our partner in the Solan project.
Exploration and evaluation spend includes costs principally related to the exploration drilling and pre-development activities in Norway, Indonesia, the Falkland Islands and Kenya.
Disposals and assets held for sale 1,196 During the first half of 2014, Premier announced the proposed sale of the non-operated million Scott area assets in the UK North Sea for US$130 million, the sale of Block A Aceh onshore Indonesia for US$40 million, and the sale of PL359, which contains the Luno II discovery offshore Norway, for US$17.5 million prior to working capital adjustments.
The Scott area assets and Luno II transactions were completed during the second half of 2014, whilst a US$76.9 million loss has been recognised as the anticipated loss on the sale of Block A Aceh, which was completed in January 2015.
These disposals, combined with the write-off of deferred consideration of US$7.0 million held for the Block 07 03 disposal in 2013, resulted in a gain on disposal of non-current assets of US$2.7 million 2013: US$3.6 million.

These will be redeemed at an average of US$1.39: due to cross currency swap arrangements.
It also includes 250.0 million of UK retail bonds and long-term bank financing which are valued at year-end US$1.56: spot rate.
These will be redeemed at an average of US$1.64: due to cross currency swap arrangements.
CASH AND 2 The carrying amounts of the convertible bonds and the other long-term debt on the balance sheet are UNDRAWN FACILITIES stated net of the unamortised portion of the issue costs of US$0.4 million 2013: US$0.4 million and debt arrangement fees of US$27.4 million 2013: US$12.2 million respectively.
US$ Long-term borrowings consist of convertible bonds, UK retail bonds, senior loan notes and bank debt.
Premier took advantage of the strength of the banking markets in the first half of 2014 to refinance its principal US$1.2 billion facility with a new, increased facility of US$2.5 billion on improved terms with extended maturity to July 2019.
The group repaid a US$300 million term loan in January 2015 which was due to mature in April 2015.
1.9 Premier does not have any significant debt maturities until late 2017 and all debt is billion unsecured.
As at 31 December, cash and undrawn facilities stood at US$1.9 billion.
Financial risk management Commodity prices The Boards commodity pricing and hedging policy continues to be to lock in oil and RESERVES gas prices for a proportion of expected future production at a level which ensures that investment programmes for sanctioned projects are adequately funded.
Where investment requirements are well covered by cash flows without hedging, it is recognised that there may be an advantage, in periods of strong commodity prices, in locking in a portion of forward production at favourable prices on a rolling forward 12-18 month basis.
243 At year-end, 5.4 mmbbls of Dated Brent oil were hedged through forward sales for 2015 at an average price of US$98.3 bbl.
This volume represents approximately 50 per cent of mmboe the groups expected liquids entitlement production in 2015.
84,000 mt of HSFO, which drives our gas contract pricing in Singapore, has been sold forward for 2015 at an average price of US$614.4 mt.
These hedges cover approximately 13 per cent of our expected Indonesian gas entitlement production for 2015.
RESOURCES The year-end fair value on the commodity hedges was US$250.1 million 2013: loss US$24.2 million, which is expected to be released to the income statement during 2015, as the related barrels are lifted.
During 2014, forward oil sales of 5.6 mmbbls, and forward fuel oil sales of 222,000 mt expired resulting in a net credit of US$46.0 million 2013: US$0.8 million which has been 551 included within sales revenue for the year.
mmboe Foreign exchange Premiers functional and reporting currency is US dollars.
Exchange rate exposures relate only to local currency receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Local currency needs are acquired on a short-term basis.
At the year-end, the group recorded a mark-to-market loss of US$6.0 million on its outstanding foreign exchange contracts 2013: gain of US$13.1 million.
The group currently has 150.0 million retail bonds, 120.0 million long-term senior loan notes and 100.0 million term loan in issuance which have been hedged under cross currency swaps in US dollars at average fixed rates of US$1.64: and US$1.34:.
Interest rates The group has various financing instruments including senior loan notes, convertible bonds, UK retail bonds, term loans and revolving credit facilities.
As at year-end, 56 per cent of total borrowings is fixed using the interest rate swap markets.
On average, the cost of drawn funds for the year was 4.4 per cent.
Mark-to-market credits on interest rate swaps amounted to US$6.8 million 2013: credit of US$6.4 million, which are recorded as movements in other comprehensive income.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view to spreading counterparty risks.
52 Premier Oil plc 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements Insurance The group undertakes a significant insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of physical risks associated with its exploration, development and production activities.
Business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields for a maximum period of 18 months.
During 2014, claims amounting to US$20.5 million were agreed in relation to property damage and business interruption on the Chim So gas export pipeline damage in 2013.
Going concern The group monitors its funding position and its liquidity risk throughout the year to ensure it has access to sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements.
Cash forecasts are regularly produced based on, inter alia, the groups latest life of field production and expenditure forecasts, managements best estimate of future commodity prices based on recent forward curves, adjusted for the groups hedging programme and the groups borrowing facilities.
Sensitivities are run to reflect different scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in oil and gas production rates, possible reductions in commodity prices and delays or cost overruns on major development projects.
This is done to identify risks to liquidity and covenant compliance and enable management to formulate appropriate and timely mitigation strategies.
Due to the current weakness in oil and gas prices, the directors have reduced planned development and exploration expenditure for 2015, are implementing a series of cost saving initiatives to reduce both operating costs and general and administration spend and have identified a range of portfolio management opportunities to monetise certain of the groups current development and exploration assets and to source additional sources of financing.
At year-end, the group had significant headroom on its borrowing facilities and related financial covenants.
The groups forecasts and projections, which take into account the actions described in the preceding paragraph, also indicate that the company will be able to operate within the requirements of its existing borrowing facilities for 12 months from the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
However, if there were further sustained falls in the oil price or if certain of the identified portfolio management opportunities are delayed or cancelled, whilst forecasts indicate that the groups liquidity will remain strong, it is possible that management will need to request a temporary amendment to the terms of one of its financial covenants.
If the groups on-going forecasts were to suggest that this would be required, management would take appropriate action with the support of its long-term banking relationships well in advance of such requirement, and management have no reason to believe that such support would not be forthcoming.
The directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Business risks Premiers business may be impacted by various risks leading to failure to achieve strategic targets for growth, loss of financial standing, cash flow and earnings, and reputation.
Not all of these risks are wholly within the companys control and the company may be affected by risks which are not yet manifest or reasonably foreseeable.
Premiers risk management process and identified principal risks for the next 12 months are described on pages 22-25.
