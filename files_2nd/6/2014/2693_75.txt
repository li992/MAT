84 Cable & Wireless Communications Financial review of the year Our financial results in the 2013 14 year have shown early signs of our operational turn-around as we become more geographically focused.
At the beginning of 2013 14 we announced a cost reduction programme targeted to reduce our run-rate operating costs by US$100 million by the end of 2014 15.
During the year we have made good progress with operating costs down US$43 million against the prior year, and an exit run-rate of US$77 million of cost savings achieved.
Group revenue declined by 4% to US$1,873 million as growth in mobile and broadband and TV revenue across each of our businesses was more than off set by declining xed voice and enterprise, data and other revenue.
On a like-for-like basis adjusting for a change in accounting following outsourcing of our LIME directory business and the sale of A nis in Africa, revenue was 1% lower than the prior year.
The US$52 million growth in mobile data revenue up 23% in the year indicates our customers increasing demand for data and their desire to access the internet anywhere, anytime, and on any device.
However, at the same time, both mobile and xed voice revenue is declining across our industry: growth in broadband and TV is therefore vital for our future.
Of the fall in enterprise, data and other revenue US$38 million of the reported US$56 million revenue decline was due to the change in directories accounting in LIME and a further US$4 million resulted from the disposal of A nis.
The improvement in Group operating costs was driven by an 8% reduction US$48 million in the Caribbean as we increased effi ciency in our operations through headcount rationalisation, exiting non-core property assets and procurement savings.
Overall Group EBITDA, at US$608 million, was 5% ahead of the prior year which was restated to US$581 million following a change to the IAS 19 pensions accounting standard see note 3.9.
Reported pre-exceptional net pro t aft er tax for the year increased by 45% to US$148 million 2012 13 US$102 million and adjusted earnings per share were US2.6 cents 2012 13 US1.5 cents.
Capital expenditure Capital expenditure, excluding the costs of extending our mobile licence agreements and acquiring additional spectrum in Panama and Jamaica was US$306 million, 16% higher than last year and representing 16% of revenue.
Our principal mobile investments continue to be in 4G mobile data networks supporting smartphone sales in Panama, The Bahamas and Antigua as well as upgrades to the faster LTE networks in The Bahamas and Cayman.
We have made selective bre network investments in Barbados and Cayman to off er high speed broadband services.
We also invested in advancing our billing and customer relationship management systems.
We anticipate continuing our mobile investments across the Caribbean and making strategic investments in MPLS transmission capacity and cable systems to support both retail and carrier sales.
On 30 October, we announced that our Panama business secured a new 20 year mobile licence agreement to run from 24 October 2017 to 24 October 2037.
Under the agreement our Panama business will have access to 65MHz of spectrum including 30MHz of new spectrum for US$100 million circa US40 cents per MHz per head of population.
We will be granted access to the additional block of 1900 MHz spectrum immediately and we will also gain access to the 700 MHz spectrum, a lower level frequency ideal for the transmission of mobile data over long distances, from August 2014.
This will enable our network to support the rapid growth of mobile data services.
Payment was made in the second half of 2013 14.
In Jamaica we secured a new 15 year mobile licence agreement from 2015 to 2030 at a cost of US$30 million giving us access to 20MHz of 1900MHz spectrum to expand HSPA capacity and 24 MHz of AWS spectrum for eventual LTE network deployment.
We also acquired additional microwave spectrum for expanding backhaul capacity to accommodate the additional subscribers and increased data traffi c being experienced.

Fixed charges We paid US$53 million relating to income tax in 2013 14, US$21 million lower than the prior year primarily due to changes in tax legislation in Panama.

We paid dividends to non-controlling interests of US$106 million in the period, which was in line with the prior year.
Underlying equity free cash ow of US$88 million was US$58 million higher compared to the prior year.
Non-recurring items and exceptionals The net cash out ow included US$130 million for exceptional items related to restructuring programmes primarily in the Caribbean, where our cost initiative has progressed ahead of our expectations.
We also incurred a call premium of US$19 million due to the early redemption of our US dollar bond repayable in 2017, and US$114 million of cost to extend our mobile concessions and acquire additional spectrum in Panama and Jamaica.
