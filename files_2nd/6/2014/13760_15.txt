We aspire to be the investment of choice in the global beer industry.
We measure our performance against this goal by assessing total shareholder return TSR, growth in adjusted EPS and free cash flow.
We achieved adjusted EPS growth in the year of 2%, as a result of higher operating profit, lower finance costs and a lower tax charge, and after reflecting the adverse impact of foreign exchange rate movements.
Free cash flow at US$2,563 million also continued to be robust but was US$667 million lower than the prior year, as a result of the phasing of payments to the Australian tax office and additional investment in our Chinese associate to fund, in part, the acquisition of the Kingway brewery business.
In the five years to 31 March 2014 we achieved a TSR of 203%, compared with the median of the comparator group of 105% as measured in accordance with the terms of our performance share awards.
The differential of 98% between the two is our TSR key performance indicator as shown on page 17.
