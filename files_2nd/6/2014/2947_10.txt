The increase in operating margin to 5.8 per cent 2013: 5.1 per cent reflects the benefit of maintaining a selective approach to the contracts for which we bid and cost savings, notably those we achieved from restructuring in 2013.
Work winning in support services was particularly strong in 2014 with new orders and probable orders worth 2.9 billion 2013: 1.9 billion.
This included a number of major successes for public sector customers in the UK, notably winning all five of the Next Generation Estates Contracts for which we bid, to provide hard facilities management services for the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, that are worth up to 2.5 billion over ten years.
We also won a 200 million, five-year contract extendable to seven years to provide a total facilities management service to some 50 per cent of the public sector prisons operated by the Ministry of Justice in the UK, and a 200 million, five-year contract to provide facilities management services to the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.
In addition, we won contracts to provide a range of support services for private sector customers, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Arqiva, Heathrow Airport Limited and Canadian Natural Resources Limited that together are worth over 400 million over five years.

Carillion has led the market in recycling equity investments in PPP projects, namely selling investments in mature projects those that have passed from construction into the operational phase and reinvesting the proceeds in new projects.
In 2014, we sold equity investments in four projects for cash proceeds of approximately 37 million, which represented an average discount rate of some seven per cent and generated a pre-tax profit of 13.9 million.
In 2014, our portfolio of investments in PPP projects continued to perform in line with expectations and our objective of achieving an overall post-tax internal rate of return of 15 per cent.
Revenue in 2014 reduced due to the effects of selling seven equity investments in 2013, as previously reported, and of selling further investments in 2014, as noted above.
Operating profit reduced in line with expectations, primarily because we sold less equity in mature projects in 2014 than in 2013.
At 31 December 2014, we had 17 PPP projects in which we had invested 42 million of equity and into which we are committed to make further planned investments of 112 million.

The improvement in operating profit reflected the increase in revenue and an increase in operating margin to 5.0 per cent 2013: 4.0 per cent, as we have continued to see improvements in trading conditions in some Middle East markets.
Trading conditions in the UAE, where our main Joint Venture business operates, have remained very competitive, although we have begun to see some signs that our markets are improving, notably in Dubai, where we are seeing a significant number of new contract opportunities coming to market.
In 2014, we continued to win substantial new contracts.
For example, in Dubai, Al Futtaim Carillion AFC won contracts for two luxury hotels the W Hotel and Phase IV of the Madinat Jumeirah Resort project that involves the construction of a luxury 435-room hotel which together are worth some 300 million and a 75 million contract for Phase 1 of the Dubai World Trade Centre development.

AFC also converted preferred bidder positions into signed contracts for the 150 million Phase 2 Avenue In 2014, Al Futtaim Carillion completed the 570 million New York City Walk development in Dubai and the 110 million Hard Rock Hotel University in Abu Dhabi, which provides state-of-the-art facilities for in Abu Dhabi.

Our pipeline of contract opportunities increased to 15.4 billion at the year end 2013: 13.1 billion, as significant new contracts are expected to come to market, notably in Oman, Dubai and Qatar.
There have been no immediate signs of a reduction in contract opportunities as a result of the worldwide drop in oil prices, therefore given the strength of our order book and pipeline, we believe we have the opportunity to grow revenue again in 2015 and to deliver growth over the medium term, with margins moving up towards our medium-term target of six per cent.
