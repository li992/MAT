Financial Review 2014 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW 2014 CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT Turnover at 48.4 billion decreased 2.7%, including a negative impact from both foreign exchange, of 4.6%, and acquisitions net of disposals of 0.9%.
Underlying sales growth was 2.9% 2013: 4.3%, balanced between volume growth of 1.0% 2013: 2.5% and pricing of 1.9% 2013: 1.8%.
Emerging markets, consistent at 57% of total turnover, were down 2.2% at reported exchange rates, with underlying sales growth of 5.7% versus 8.7% in the prior year.
Developed markets underlying sales declined by 0.8%.
Globally, our markets grew by around 2.5% with flat volumes.
Core operating margin was up 0.4 percentage points to 14.5%.
Gross margin declined by 0.2 percentage points to 41.4%.
This was driven by increased costs in emerging markets, largely currency related, partly offset by pricing, savings and margin-accretive innovation.
Commodity costs increased around 4%, at constant exchange rates, as devaluing currencies have imported inflation into local raw material production partially offset by cost savings.
Significant efficiencies in the cost of producing advertising allowed us to increase our share of spend while maintaining brand and marketing investment at 14.8%.
Overheads were reduced by 0.6 percentage points largely due to saving initiatives such as Project Half for Growth and some favourable one-off items such as property sales in India.
Operating profit was 8.0 billion, compared with 7.5 billion in 2013, up 6%.
The increase was driven by non-core items which were a net credit of 960 million 2013: 501 million.
Included within non-core items was the gain on disposal of the Ragu and Bertolli pasta sauces business and the.
We sold the Slim Fast business and recognised an impairment charge of 305 million on the related assets within non-core items.
