For all significant known issues and claims provided for we inspected third party We have audited the financial statements of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc for the year ended 30 April 2014 set out on pages 89 to 119. correspondence where available and compared it to the provision held.
We also discussed claims with legal counsel.
In our opinion: We inspected the calculation of the provision held.
For known issues we challenged the cost forecast for work to be undertaken and, where t he financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 30 April 2014 and of possible, compared these to quotes to undertake the remediation.
For claims that history indicated may arise, we evaluated settled issues the Groups profit for the year then ended: and considered any differences in the development portfolio then and now, such as increasing complexity of construction, as evidence for the calculation of the provision.
t he Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union: We assessed each provision against the requirements of the relevant accounting standards and the Groups policy and assessed whether the Groups disclosures adequately disclose the potential liabilities of the Group.
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards: and Revenue recognition 1,620.6m t he financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group Refer to page 54 Audit Committee statement, page 94 and 96 accounting policy and page 89 financial disclosures financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The risk: It is the Groups policy to recognise 100% of revenue on property units when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete, being the point at which the Group is satisfied it has discharged its obligations to the buyer.
Contract exchange, including 2 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT the payment of a deposit, may have occurred sometime in the past.
However, the legal completion of the sale remains dependent on the In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit receipt of final payment.
The recognition of revenue is generally before legal completion, being the point at which the balance of the sale is were as follows: paid for and title transfers, and as such is potentially more subjective than recognising at the latter point.
Carrying value of inventories and profit recognition inventories: 2,481.2m, gross profit: 508.9m The risk is that the unit is not physically complete or that the buyer does not complete the purchase, as should either of these be the case the Refer to page 54 Audit Committee statement, page 96 accounting policy and page 106 financial disclosures revenue should not be recognised.
The risk: The Group recognises profit on each sale by reference to the overall site margin, which is the forecast profit percentage for a site Our response: Our audit procedures on these areas included, among others: that may comprise multiple phases and can last a number of years.
The recognition of profit is therefore dependent on the Groups estimate Detailed testing of controls over sales approval and sample testing of sales in the year with a particular focus on significant sales recorded of future selling prices and build costs, which form the basis of the site forecast.

It is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, the latter also being based on the forecast for the site.
As such errors in these forecasts can impact the assessment over the carrying value of inventories and gross profit.
We inspected the internal sign-off sheets to check that sales recorded in the year had gone through the Groups approval process for sale of properties and the paperwork provided by third parties who approve the sale of newly constructed buildings, including the Council of Future selling prices are dependent on market conditions, which can be difficult to predict.

There is a risk that the actual revenue and costs are different to those forecast resulting in material misstatement of inventory and gross profit.
For a sample of sales made in the year that were not legally complete at the year-end, we visited the sites around the year-end date to assess by physical inspection the extent to which building work was complete and the property was physically ready to be handed over to a buyer.
There is also a risk that costs are inappropriately recognised within inventories or the allocation of costs that relate to the whole site, such as After the year end, and up to the date of signing the audit report, we assessed whether final payments from buyers had been made and land and infrastructure, is inappropriate across development phases, resulting in a material misstatement of inventory or gross profit.

We attended a selection of managements cost review meetings, to check that they are effectively We have also considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in respect of the judgements taken in recognising revenue for property units challenging the costs incurred and forecast.
We inspected the site forecasts, on a sample basis, and challenged the assumptions for future costs and sales.
This included comparing sales forecasts to sales made to date and to prices achieved on comparable local sales.
We compared actual margins achieved to forecasts, to 3 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT check the accuracy of the Groups forecasting process.

We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in excess of 0.9m, in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
For all significant new land acquisitions and a sample of other land acquisitions we inspected purchase contracts to understand the terms and any deferred or contingent payments.
We re-performed the calculation of such amounts to check the amounts recorded.
We considered any Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at key reporting components covering 93% of Group revenue: 95% of Group profit previous acquisitions to establish any changes in amounts recorded for related deferred or contingent payments and assessed the accuracy before taxation and 93% of Group total assets.
