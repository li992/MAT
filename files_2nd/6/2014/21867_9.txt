A hardening market indicates 2.0 increasing profitability.
This reduction was strongly influenced by reinsurance business which experienced rate reductions of 7.4%, driven by a 10.6% rate reduction in property treaty.
Rates for direct business fell by 1.6% in the period, with the principal movements being decreases in energy, the property open market book and casualty.
These were partly offset by increases in specialist liability, marine and the property binder book.
Retention rates Strategic priority Measure Commentary Track record Profitable Retention rate The retention rate shows the proportion of our Retention rate % underwriting business that renews, on a risk adjusted basis, compared to the previous year.
The retention rates we achieved in 2013 and 2014 reflect the successful renewal of a profitable book of business, following the re-underwriting of the book that occurred between 2008 and 2012, through which we rebalanced our book and non-renewed around half of our underwriting portfolio.
STRATEGIC REPORT Brit PLC Annual Report 2014 53 Outwards reinsurance Our reinsurance expenditure in 2014 was 277.2m or 21.3% of GWP 2013: 229.4m 19.3%, an increase of 47.8m 20.8%.
At constant exchange rates the overall increase was 26.3% 2013: 7.0%.
Included within our 2014 reinsurance expenditure was 42.9m in respect of a specific one-off reinsurance contract, entered into to provide adverse development cover for a discontinued professional lines account with exposure to Italian medical malpractice.
This contract has provided the Group with significantly greater certainty over a poorly performing legacy account.
Under the terms of this contract, 40.3m of reserves transferred to the reinsurer, resulting in a net cost to the Group of 2.6m.
An effect of this contract was to reduce our attritional ratio by 1.9 percentage points and increase our underwriting expense ratio by 1.7 percentage points.
It did not materially impact our combined ratio.
During 2014, we also took advantage of reinsurance market conditions to strengthen significantly our catastrophe cover.
These additional protections include a Group-wide property aggregate catastrophe cover and some additional variable quota share protections.
As a result, the expected recoveries against a number of our realistic disaster scenarios RDS have increased, thereby reducing our net exposure to such events.
Our largest net exposure under the Lloyds-defined RDSs has fallen to 113m 2013: 149m.
Net earned premium Net earned premium in 2014, excluding the effects of foreign exchange on non-monetary items, increased by 2.4% to 970.4m 2013: 947.7m 0.5%.
This growth was impacted by the 42.9m reinsurance premium paid in respect of the specific one-off reinsurance contract referred to in the outwards reinsurance section.
At constant exchange rates the overall increase was 7.4% 2013: decrease of 1.2%.

Our 51.0% attritional ratio has benefited by 1.9 percentage points from the one-off reinsurance contract as described above.
This has offset deterioration arising from rating pressures and a change in business mix resulting from a reduction in short-tail reinsurance and an increase in lines such as specialist liability, the property binders book and marine.
2014 saw limited natural catastrophe activity, the only event being Hurricane Odile which resulted in incurred net losses of 8.8m.
We had immaterial exposure to the losses of Malaysian Airlines MH370 and MH17, the Korean ferry SEWOL and Air Asia, but we did incur net losses of 12.9m from the Tripoli airport attack.
As part of our quarterly reserving process, we released 32.1m of claims reserves established for prior year claims, the equivalent of a combined ratio reduction of 3.3% 2013: 57.3m 6.0%.
Of this reserve release, 87.9% was derived from the 2011 and prior underwriting years 2013: 88.5% from the 2010 and prior underwriting years.
The main drivers of this release were casualty treaty, property treaty and marine.
Our statement of financial position remains strong and we continue to operate a robust reserving process.

Commission costs were 269.9m and the commission expense ratio was 27.5% 2013: 235.8m 24.9%.
In addition to the effects of the one-off reinsurance, the ratio was affected by changes in business mix, including increased binder business.
We wrote more business through cover-holders as, in the current softening conditions, the rating of this business tends to be better than open market business.
Our operating expenses are analysed later in this report.

The performance and market position of Brit business units, together with relevant market developments, are discussed in the Underwriting Review section of this Strategic Report, commencing on page 26.
As explained above, an effect of a specific one-off reinsurance contract was to reduce our Group attritional ratio by 1.9 percentage points and increase the Group underwriting expense ratio by 1.7 percentage points.
The effect of this contract on Brit Global Specialty Direct was to reduce its attritional ratio by 2.4 percentage points and increase its underwriting expense ratio by 2.3 percentage points.
This contract had no effect on Brit Global Specialty Reinsurance.

Our total return in 2014 of 75.7m 2013: 54.7m was influenced by falling bond yields and a contraction in credit spreads across the US and European markets which led to gains on our fixed income and credit portfolios.
Our growth assets showed gains as equity markets and alternatives rose.
Within our unrealised gains for the year there are 15.1m of gains made within fund investments 2013: 8.3m.
Of these gains, 9.1m was distributed on scheduled distribution dates in January 2015 January 2014: nil, thereby converting unrealised gains into income.
Further discussion of our investment performance and portfolio is included in the Investment Management Review section of this Strategic Report, commencing on page 40.
Expenses Our operating expense ratio was unchanged at 12.0% 2013: 12.0% and includes 0.6 percentage points resulting from the one-off reinsurance contract mentioned above.
Operating expenses for the period were as follows: 2014 2013 Expense analysis m m Underlying operating expenses including bonus provisions 138.0 129.5 Project costs, timing differences and other expense adjustments 1.5 0.7 Expenses before IPO related costs 139.5 128.8 IPO related costs 13.7 2.0 Total operating expenses 153.2 130.8 Underlying operating expenses during 2014 increased by 6.6% to 138.0m 2013: 129.5m.
This increase related to an increase in bonus costs, targeted expansion and investment in growth areas such as our US specialty business BGSU and aviation, together with increased costs reflecting the Companys listed status.

We experienced a total foreign exchange gain of 21.6m in 2014 2013: loss of 58.2m.
This total foreign exchange related gain comprised: An unrealised revaluation loss of 0.4m 2013: loss of 65.4m, primarily relating to the mark to market of the capital we hold in non-Sterling currencies to match our risk exposures.
The loss comprises a gain of 20.6m resulting from the weakening of Sterling against the US dollar, offset by losses of 21.0m resulting from the strengthening of Sterling against a number of other currencies, primarily the Euro, Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar: Gains of 1.7m 2013: gain of 13.2m on derivative contracts which were entered into to help manage our FX exposures: and An accounting gain of 20.3m 2013: loss of 6.0m, as a result of the IFRS requirement to recognise non-monetary assets and liabilities at historic exchange rates.

Tax The Group is liable to taxes on its corporate income in a number of jurisdictions, in particular the UK, Gibraltar and the US, where its companies carry on business.
Our effective tax rate for the period was 6.8% 2013: 6.1%, which is a composite tax rate reflecting the mix of the tax rates charged in those jurisdictions.
