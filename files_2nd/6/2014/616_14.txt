FINANCIAL REVIEW A year of good progress with continued outperformance of key markets.
DAVID EGAN OVERVIEW Group Finance Director I am pleased to be reporting on a year of good financial progress for Alent.
On a constant currency basis, Alent has delivered growth in NSV, adjusted operating profit, NSV margin and adjusted EPS together with strong cash generation.
Foreign exchange translation has been a major headwind on our reported results in 2014.
Using 2014 average exchange rates would have decreased 2013 NSV and adjusted operating profit by 6%.
Our principal markets, electronics, automotive and industrial, have all shown modest improvements as we progressed through the year.
Global economies, on the whole, have shown growth although Europe and Brazil, in particular, have been subdued, whilst global consumer confidence has improved slightly year over year.
Alent has continued to consistently outperform its principal end-markets.
We have either held, or grown, market share in the majority of our end-markets, maintained price discipline and continued to exert tight cost control.
As a result of our competitive advantages and financial discipline, Group NSV increased 4.6% on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit increased 7.6% on a constant currency basis and adjusted earnings per share increased 11.1% on a constant currency basis.
In addition, robust financial balance sheet discipline was maintained.
Cash generation was strong during the year resulting in a significant strengthening of the balance sheet leading to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0x following the payment of the 42m special dividend in October 2014.
Cash generation was strong during the year resulting in a significant strengthening of thebalance sheet.
