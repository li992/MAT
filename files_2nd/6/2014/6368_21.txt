Financial statements Chief Financial Officers review Introduction We made good progress during the year in executing our strategic plans: this is reflected in the progress in our financial performance.
The groups revenue from continuing operations increased by 1 2 3.9% to 6,750m.
PBITA was 424m, a 7.9% increase on 393m in 2013, and earnings grew by 11.7% to 210m.
Revenue in our emerging markets grew by 8.9% to 2,398m and now represents 36% 2013: 34% of the groups total revenue and 40% 2013: 40% of the groups PBITA.
In our developed markets, revenue increased by 1.4% to 4,352m with growth of 6.9% in North America and modest declines in the UK and Europe of 1.3% and 0.6%.
PBITA in both emerging and developed markets grew faster than revenue reflecting good operating leverage across our markets.
Other specific items in the current year were a net 66m charge Himanshu Raja and resulted from increases in provisions for contract losses of Chief Financial Officer 45m relating to UK government contracts, the re-measurement of certain balance sheet assets and liabilities and other items of 32m and a net 10m charge relating to losses from smaller portfolio entities being sold or ceased and interest and tax from joint ventures.
These charges were offset by a pension settlement gain of Disciplined financial 21m relating to the transfer of the Netherlands secure solutions defined benefit pension scheme into an industry-wide scheme.
Our restructuring programmes in 2013 and 2014 continued to and risk management deliver good returns: making the group more efficient and effective in its operating and overhead base.
During 2014, we invested a further 29m in restructuring programmes, principally in the UK & Ireland to bring the Ireland business under UK management and We have made good progress in embedding a to introduce a shared services centre in the region: and in new and robust financial and risk framework Europe we accelerated some of the best practice plans to reduce our overheads.

operations principally from the sale of the cash solutions business in Canada, the businesses in Sweden and Norway and the disposal of US Government Solutions for combined gross proceeds of 177m.
We now operate in over 110 countries.
Portfolio management remains an important discipline in ensuring we maintain strategic focus, capital discipline and disciplined financial management across the group.
PBIT for the year was 270m compared with the loss of 67m in 2013.
Total profit for the year was 169m compared with a loss of 351m in 2013.
The group has previously highlighted its focus on cash and free cash flow, and it is pleasing to report that cash flow from continuing operations improved by 11% to 553m 2013: 496m.
There remains more to do to improve our operational processes around billing and cash collections and this remains a key target for 2015.
The groups net debt at 31 December 2014 was 1,578m 2013: 1,552m resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.8.
In January 2015 the group renewed its 1.1bn revolving credit facility.
We saw good demand for the new facility of 1bn which matures in January 2020, with the option of two one year extensions which if exercised give the group facilities through to January 2021 and January 2022 respectively.
Underlying EPS was 13.6p, up 5.4% on 12.9p in 2013 and total earnings per share was 9.8p, compared with loss per share of 24.7p in 2013.
The group has declared a final dividend of 5.82p 2013: 5.54p, making the total dividend for the year 9.24p 2013: 8.96p.

Treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt EBITDA ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, where possible.
The group no longer uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans.
The group believes cash flow should not be put at risk by these instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets.
At 31 December 2014, the groups US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 78% and 74% respectively, hedged by foreign currency loans.
As at 31 December 2014, net debt held in US dollar and Euro and in those currencies officially pegged to these two currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.3 times EBITDA generated from these currencies.
Corporate governance The groups policies regarding risk management and corporate governance are set out in the Corporate governance report on pages 56 to 69.
Going concern The directors are confident that, after making enquiries and on the basis of current financial projections and available facilities, they have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements as set out in the Directors responsibility statement on page 88.
