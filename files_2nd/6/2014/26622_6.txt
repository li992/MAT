STRATEGIC REPORT 14 CFOs financial review Total costs were down 17%, and within this total fixed costs were down 20% due to the continued implementation of the Groups cost savings programme.
As a result of these revenue and cost drivers, our adjusted profit before tax was $481 million, up 62% from the prior year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were 24.4 cents 2013:14.1cents.
Our statutory profit before tax was $384 million 2013: $56 million, reflecting adjusting items of $97 million, which primarily relate to amortisation of purchased intangible assets and acquisition related costs.
Strategically, we are focused on operating our business as efficiently as possible and managing our balance sheet effectively, whilst maintaining its strength and liquidity.
We have made significant progress in respect ofthese two objectives during 2014.
We have completed the execution of our cost savings programme ahead of schedule, delivering our 2015 target fixed cost base during the second Jonathan Sorrell, Chief Financial Officer half of 2014.
Total fixed costs in H2 2014, excluding Numeric and Pine Grove, were $143 million, or $286 million on an annualised basis, versus a target for 2015 of $305 million.
We believe we are operating our business as efficiently as is appropriate for the set of business opportunities we In 2014 we have seen the benefits of the are pursuing and no additional reductions are expected unless there are progress on the delivery of our strategy changes in operating performance or the business environment.

As expected, management fee margins for our quant alternative products declined during the year given a mix shift toward lower margin institutional assets and, coupled with the continuing mix shift away from the high margin guaranteed products, this resulted in theaverage net management fee margin decreasing by 36 basis points from the prioryear.

Previously the US business as a whole was loss making and therefore Man did not recognise any of its accumulated $191 million US tax assets.
Man has recognised a deferred tax asset of $8 million in 2014, a credit to the tax expense, as a result of acquiring Numeric which means that it is likely that the US business will earn taxable profits in the future.
The proportion recognised relates only to the next three years, consistent with the Groups business planning horizon.
As Man does not expect to pay federal tax for the foreseeable future, any movements through the income statement relating to accounting for this deferred tax are treated as adjusting items.

MAN GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014 STRATEGIC REPORT 21 Going concern The directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that Man has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and have accordingly prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Regulatory capital Man is compliant with the FCAs capital standards and has maintained significant surplus regulatory capital throughout the year.
At 31 December 2014, surplus regulatory capital over the regulatory capital requirements was $419 million.
The decrease in the Group financial resources of $335 million during 2014 primarily relates to: 1 The acquisitions of Numeric and Pine Grove, which has increased the intangibles deduction from Tier 1 capital by $345 million: 2 The final 2013 dividend payment of $95 million: 3 The share repurchase programme undertaken in the first half of the year of $116 million including costs : partly offset by 4 H1 2014 posttax net performance fee income of $55 million H2 2014 performance fees will be added once audited in February 2015 : and 5 The issuance of Tier 2 debt of $150 million, less capitalised costs of$1million.
The increase in the Group financial resources requirement of $6 million primarily relates to a net increase of $34 million driven by seeding investments in fund products, partly offset by the impact of a lower capital requirement on various receivables balances.
