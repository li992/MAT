There are two significant performance differences between the two years.
Firstly, the combined ratio, whilst still very good at 89%, is 5% higher than the exceptional result achieved in 2013.
As explained in the reserve releases section on page 42, all the difference in combined ratio was driven by the above average prior year reserve releases in 2013.
This change in the combined ratio, coupled with a slightly higher FX impact, reduced profits by about $80m, although this was partially compensated by achieving about $30m more investment and other income than in 2013. www.

Rates on renewal business on average decreased by 2% across the portfolio.
We have continued to adjust our underwriting appetite in areas where competition is most intense.
Our portfolio by business division has remained broadly unchanged from 2013.
We continue to operate a diversified portfolio by type of business and geographical location, and have grown our business across three of the six divisions during 2014.
The charts above highlight how we achieve diversification by product mix, geography and type of business.
Reinsurance purchased Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: to enable the group to put down large, lead lines on the risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
The amount the group spent on reinsurance in 2014 was $289.1m 2013: $293.7m.
Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims and expenses to total net earned premium.
A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio has increased in 2014 to 89% 2013: 84%, maintaining our five year historic average of 90%.
It is worth pointing out that the calculation of the combined ratio for Beazley includes all claims and other costs to the group but excludes foreign exchange gains or losses.
We believe this represents the most transparent and useful measure of operating performance as it ensures that all of the costs of being in business are captured, whether directly linked to underwriting activity or not.

There has been minimal exposure to natural catastrophes throughout the year, with a small exposure to Hurricane Odile seen on the property and reinsurance books.
Reserve releases Beazley has a consistent reserving philosophy, with initial reserves being set to include risk margins that may be released over time as and when any uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range 5-10% above the actuarial estimates, which themselves include some margin for uncertainty.
The margin held above the actuarial estimate was 7.1% at the end of 2014 2013: 8.2%.
This margin has remained stable over time and is a lead indicator for the sustainability of reserve releases.
It is, however, important to recognise that claims reserve uncertainty is the most significant risk within Beazley and a positive lead indicator will not always equate to future releases.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
There was an overall reduction in reserve releases in 2014 compared to 2013.
This was driven by the political risks & contingency, reinsurance and specialty lines divisions.
The 2013 reserve releases in reinsurance benefited from an incredibly benign year, superstorm Sandy aside, whilst the equivalent release during 2014 was affected by the mid sized catastrophes of 2013, a number of individual risk losses and adverse development on the New Zealand earthquake loss.
Reserve releases decreased in specialty lines in 2014, which was in line with our expectations.
The 2014 releases came mainly from the 2003 through 2006 underwriting years as these years continued their exceptional development.
Additionally, releases were seen on the 2012 underwriting year, with favourable development being recognised on the short tail cyber classes.
The political risks & contingency reserve releases of 2013 benefitted from favourable development on our financial crisis-exposed 2006-2008 underwriting years and in addition the release of catastrophe margin during 2014 were lower than the recent past due to the terrorist attack in Nairobi in September 2013 Please refer to the financial statements for information on reserve releases and loss development tables.
com 42 Beazley Annual report 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Beazley Annual report 2014 43 Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased during 2014 to $658.9m from $619.3m in 2013.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2014 2013 $m $m Brokerage costs 349.7 337.2 Other acquisition costs 91.5 94.3 Total acquisition costs 441.2 431.5 Administrative expenses 217.7 187.8 Total acquisition costs and administrative expenses 658.9 619.3 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premium they remain consistent at 21% year on year.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with accounting standards.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity e. g. underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
Administrative expenses comprise primarily personnel costs including variable incentives for all staff, IT costs, facilities costs, Lloyds central costs and other support costs.
These have increased more than our gross premiums written over a five year period and, as a consequence, the companys expense ratio has edged upwards by 1% per annum from 36% to 40%.
The main causes of this are an increase in both long term and short term incentive payments triggered by the companys outstanding success during this period, investment in Solvency II and investment in our infrastructure aimed at securing future growth.
We manage underlying costs tightly and target growing expenses less than the top line over the medium term.
Foreign exchange The majority of Beazleys business is transacted in US dollar which is the currency we have reported in since 2010 and the currency in which we hold the companys net assets.
Changes in the US dollar exchange rate with sterling, the Canadian dollar and the euro do have an impact as we receive premiums in those currencies and the majority of our staff still receive their salary in sterling.
Part of this impact, generated by IFRSs treatment of the unearned premium reserve as a non-monetary item, is purely timing with FX profits and losses which unwind in the subsequent period.
Beazleys FX loss taken through the profit and loss in 2014 was $12.3m 2013: $3.0m.
Investment performance Investment income for the year ended 31 December 2014 was $83.0m, or an annualised return of 1.9%, compared with $43.3m or 1.0% over the same period in 2013.
In 2014 the portfolio benefited from falling yields in all regions where we have significant fixed rate exposure, i. e. the US, UK and especially in Europe where yields fell to record low levels across the curve.
Our credit investments also contributed positive performance, benefiting from the fall in yields, even though investment grade and high yield credit spreads widened during the course of the year.
Our hedge funds with uncorrelated strategies were also a significant contributor to returns.
During the year our management of core fixed income assets transferred from Falcon Money Management to an in house team.
This portfolio, comprising AAA AA Government and Agency bonds, returned 1.3% in 2014, generating strong returns in Europe and positive results in the US and the UK as yields fell and curves flattened.
The other element of the core portfolio, credit, is outsourced to four managers and generated a 1.4% return.
The credit assets are predominantly investment grade, including a small allocation to investment grade emerging market corporates, but also include small exposures to high yield and senior secured loans.
Cash assets, totalling 8.2% of the portfolio, generated a 0.2% return.

We continue to work with Falcon Money Management on this section of the portfolio where we have set a target allocation of being equally distributed between the three sub-strategies.
The weighted average duration of our fixed income portfolio including cash, government bonds and credit investments at the end of 2014 was 1.8 years 2013: 1.8 years.
We are cautious about the outlook for investment returns in 2015 which will be limited by extremely low yields across the curve, and, in some cases even negative yields at shorter durations.

Our effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate between the Irish and UK tax rates.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 16.9% 2013: 15.7%.
In 2013, it was announced that the UK corporation tax rate will be reduced to 20% by 2015.
This rate reduction in the UK tax rate has been applied to our UK deferred tax balance brought forward.
