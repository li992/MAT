Revenue performance Investment income in the year of 41.7m was marginally higher than last years 41.4m.
The Income & Growth pool contributed 2.0m more than in 2013, reflecting the increased cash allocation to this pool, and the Unquoted pool benefited from substantial dividends from the Latshaw Group, The Sloane Club and Sterling Industries.
These increases were substantially offset by a reduction in income from Close Brothers and other Quoted pool investments, as we reduced overweight holdings.
The investment income represented a net yield on the monthly average portfolio of 3.2%, compared with 3.3% last year.
Capital performance Net gains on investments totalled 151.4m 2013 178.1m, including derivatives.
The principal gains were 35.3m from Oval, 21.2m from Close Brothers, 18.0m from Quintain Estates and 15.5m from the Capital Today China fund.
These gains more than offset investment losses, the most significant of which was 7.9m from Satellite Information Services.
Listed investments contributed 72.1m to the valuation gains, and unlisted investments contributed 79.3m.
Unlisted investments increased in value at a greater rate than listed investments over the year.
This was evidenced principally by transactions in the year or soon after.
In general, we would normally expect to see the valuation changes of unlisted companies lagging those of our listed portfolio, reflecting our prudent valuation principles.
