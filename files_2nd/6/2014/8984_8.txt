com 25 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW CONTINUED Overall, copper in ore output from the continuing operations was OperatingOverview 4% above the prior year with the inclusion of ore extraction from The production profile of the Groups mining operations changed the commissioning phase of Bozymchak.
However, the volume significantly during 2014 with the disposal of the copper mines, of copper in ore processed was similar to the prior year with concentratorsand smelters that were based in the Zhezkazgan an increase in stockpiles at Bozymchak and at the Nikolayevsky and Central Regions on 31 October 2014. concentrator, where capacity was restricted due to modernisation The completion of the Restructuring has enabled the Group works that occurred primarily during the first half of 2014. to focus on the smaller but cash generative mining operations Copper in concentrate output from the East Region and in the East Region and at the Bozymchak mine ahead of the Bozymchak in 2014 was 3.1 kt above the prior year at 89.9 kt.
commissioning of Bozshakol and Aktogay oxide during the The increase in output was mainly due to the improvement in fourth quarter of 2015. recovery rates at the Nikolayevsky concentrator as a result of Ore extraction from the East Region and Bozymchak in 2014 modernisation work and a 0.7 kt contribution from Bozymchak.
was 6% above the prior year with the additional ore from the In 2014, copper cathode production totalled 83.5 kt, which commissioning of Bozymchak during 2014 offsetting the lower was at the upper range of the guidance provided for the year output from the mature  mine.
Production was above the prior year due output from the East Regions key mines, Artemyevsky and to the increase in copper in concentrate output and the Orlovsky, was consistent with the levels achieved in 2013. build up of work in progress at the Balkhash smelter in 2013.
Copper grades at the continuing operations declined from 2.41% By-product metals are an important component of the continuing in the prior year to 2.35% in 2014, mainly due to the additional ore operations business model with ore from the East Region from Bozymchak which had a copper grade of 1.00%.
The mining containing significant volumes of zinc, gold and silver and Bozymchak of higher grade zones at Orlovsky and Artemyevsky raised the also producing gold and silver.
The production of by-products grade of ore extracted in the East Region above the prior year.
Bozymchak, our copper and gold open-pit mine in Kyrgyzstan, commenced commissioning in 2014 and will ramp up in 2015 to commercial levels of production.

Output from Bozshakol will be the Disposal Assets extracted 27,119 kt of ore at a copper grade of sold as copper concentrate to smelters in China.
The Aktogay 0.83% producing 171.3 kt of copper cathode equivalent.
The Disposal oxide operations will produce copper cathode.
Assets also produced 53.5 koz of gold bar and 3,608 koz of silver granule during the period to 31 October 2014.
The captive power stations generated net power of 4,129 GWh in the 10 month period prior to the Restructuring which was 12% below the comparative 10 month period in 2013 due to lower demand and works to improve the long-term performance of the power stations.
Bozymchak is expected to have an average annual output of 6kt of copper cathode and 28koz of gold bar over the life of the mine.
