OUTLOOK Achieving record profits is testament to our skill in generating strong returns through our market-leading expertise and foresight in regeneration and development.
During the year, we have taken advantage of an improving marketplace and have focused on growing our income across the UK through active asset management initiatives and disposals of those properties to which we can no longer add value.
We will continue to do so in 2015 whilst growing our pipeline of development opportunities as enquiries continue to increase and the market gathers pace.
We also look forward to making further progress on New Covent Garden Market which is not yet accounted for within our financial results.
All of these factors and our ability to harness the growth in the marketplace whilst also maintaining a prudent financial structure provide us with an excellent base from which to grow the business further.
