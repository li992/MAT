STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Review Despite a year of significant regulatory change, we have maintained our track record of growth and have again achieved record financial results for the Group.
The Group achieved net revenues of 291.9m, an 8% increase, driven primarily by increased levels of AUA and share dealing commission.
Continued robust control of costs and scalable operations has contributed to maintain a high net operating profit margin on net revenue which fell slightly to 71.3% FY 2013: 71.5%.
The effective tax rate for the Group this year was 22.4% FY 2013: 23.7%.
The 8% increase in operating profit, together with a lower rate of corporation tax, combined to increase the diluted earnings per share from 31.4 pence to 34.2 pence per share.
