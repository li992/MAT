Financial review Our financial results Chris Kennedy Chief Financial Officer Highlights 4,527m 8.12 Revenue Profit before tax per seat 2013: 4,258m 2013: 7.03 114.5 pence per share Basic earnings per share 2013: 101.3 pence per share A good cost performance meant that easyJet grew In the 2014 financial year, easyJet flew 64.8 million profit before tax by 21.5% to 581 million, resulting in profit passengers 2013: 60.8 million and grew revenue before tax per seat of 8.12 2013: 7.03.
Profit after by 6.3% from 4,258 million to 4,527 million, tax was 450 million, an increase of 13.1% over last year.
compared with 5.1% growth in seats flown.
Total revenue per seat grew by 1.2% to 63.31.
At constant currency, revenue per seat grew by 1.9%.
Excluding fuel, cost per seat reduced by 1.2% to 37.70, but increased by 0.6% at constant currency, with inflationary increases largely offset by a one-off reduction in engine heavy maintenance costs, continued delivery of easyJet lean initiatives including improved contractual terms with a number of ground handlers, and lower fide-icing costs as a consequence of an unusually mild winter.
Fuel costs increased by 69 million, from 17.38 to 17.49 per seat, with the average effective fuel price stable at $977 per tonne.
20 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Strategic report Overall, profit before tax per seat increased by 15.6% to 8.12 per seat.
The tax charge for the year was 131 million.
The effective tax rate for the year was 22.5% 2013: 16.7%, slightly higher than the standard UK rate due to the higher rate applicable to profits taxed in Switzerland.
The effective tax rate of 16.7% in the prior year was due to a 28 million reduction in deferred tax resulting from legislation that reduced the UK corporate tax rate to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. easyJet made corporation tax payments totalling 96 million during the 2014 financial year.
Earnings per share and dividends per share 2014 2013 pence per pence per share share Change Basic earnings per share 114.5 101.3 13.0% Proposed ordinary dividend 45.4 33.5 35.5% Special dividend 44.1 n a Basic earnings per share increased by 13.0% to 114.5 pence, driven by the increase in profit after tax from 398 million to 450 million.
The Board is recommending an ordinary dividend of 180 million or 45.4 pence per share which is subject to shareholder approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 12 February 2015.
This will be paid on 20 March 2015 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 27 February 2015.
Return on capital employed ROCE and capital structure 2014 2013 Change ROCE 20.5% 17.4% 3.1ppt Gearing 17% 7% 10ppt ROCE for the year was 20.5%, an improvement of 3.1 percentage points from prior year driven by the increase in profit for the year, partly offset by a 2% increase in average adjusted capital employed.
This latter increase was mainly driven by pre-delivery payments on the 35 aircraft ordered during the 2014 financial year and the full year impact of the 24 aircraft leases entered into during the 2013 financial year.
The combined impact of the special dividend and the increase in adjusted capital employed resulted in gearing of 17% 2013: 7%, in line with the target range of 15% to 30% over the next three financial years.
Cash and money market deposits as at 30 September 2014 were 985 million, a reduction of 252 million from the end of the prior financial year, driven by the special dividend and aircraft pre-delivery payments.
com 21 Financial review continued EXCHANGE RATES The proportion of revenue and costs denominated in currencies other than sterling was little changed year-on-year.
Revenue Costs 2014 2013 2014 2013 Sterling 47% 48% 26% 25% Euro 42% 41% 33% 35% US dollar 1% 1% 35% 34% Other principally Swiss franc 10% 10% 6% 6% Average exchange rates 2014 2013 Euro revenue 1.21 1.19 Euro costs 1.22 1.19 US dollar $1.59 $1.59 Swiss franc CHF 1.49 CHF 1.45 Over the year as a whole, movements in average effective exchange rates were relatively small.
The net favourable impact on profit of changes in exchange rates was mainly driven by a weaker average euro rate as follows: Favourable adverse Euro Swiss franc US dollar Other Total million million million million million Revenue 23 4 3 3 33 Fuel 2 1 1 Costs excluding fuel 40 5 5 50 Total 19 1 1 3 18 Although easyJet has a surplus of euro revenue over euro costs, on average, revenue cash inflows occur several months before cost cash outflows, resulting in a short-term benefit to the income statement that will not continue into the next financial year.
22 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2014 Strategic report FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Revenue 2014 2013 pence per pence per million per seat ASK million per seat ASK Seat revenue 4,462 62.40 5.61 4,194 61.64 5.65 Non-seat revenue 65 0.91 0.08 64 0.94 0.09 Total revenue 4,527 63.31 5.69 4,258 62.58 5.74 Revenue per seat improved by 1.2% to 63.31 in comparison to the prior year, and by 1.9% at constant currency.
Load factor increased by 1.3 percentage points to 90.6%, contributing to revenue per ASK being flat at constant currency despite the 1.9% increase in average sector length.
Revenue per passenger was 69.90, down by 0.3% compared with the 2013 financial year, but up by 0.5% at constant currency.
com 23 Financial review continued Airports and ground handling cost per seat decreased by 2.3% and were broadly flat at constant currency.
Charges at regulated airports increased as anticipated, primarily as Contratto charges in Italy annualised.
However, easyJet lean delivered compensating savings on new ground handling and airport contracts.
fide-icing cost per seat was also 0.16 lower as an unusually mild winter followed last years unusually cold conditions.
Crew cost per seat increased by 0.3% to 6.70, and by 1.8% at constant currency, driven by an average 2.0% increase in payroll costs and the 1.9% increase in average sector length, partly offset by improved crew scheduling.
Navigation costs decreased slightly to 4.30 per seat but were up by 2.4% at constant currency principally due to increased average sector length.
Maintenance costs per seat decreased by 4.6% to 2.97, and by 2.9% at constant currency.
As expected, the increasing average age of the fleet has led to higher maintenance costs.
However, these increases were more than offset by the benefit of the revised engine contract, which has delivered a reduction in the cost of heavy maintenance.
A significant proportion of this reduction is one-off in nature and will not recur next year.
Other costs per seat increased by 3.1% to 3.41 per seat, driven by the cost of wet leasing two aircraft over the summer, employee performance-related pay and digital development costs.
Aircraft dry leasing cost per seat increased by 16.1% to 1.73 and by 12.5% at constant currency.
The increase in cost per seat is driven by the annualising of last years leasing activity, when the leased fleet increased by a net 17 aircraft to 72.
There have been no new leases or lease returns during the 2014 financial year.
Net interest receivable decreased by 0.06 to 0.10 per seat as easyJet continued to repay mortgage and finance lease debt.
The impact of movements in currency exchange rates is a gain of 7 million compared with a loss of 8 million in the prior year, in each case driven mainly by changes in the euro exchange rate.
A fluctuation of this size is within the range of expectations, given the size of the related foreign currency cash flows.
Fuel 2014 2013 pence per pence per million per seat ASK million per seat ASK Fuel 1,251 17.49 1.57 1,182 17.38 1.59 Fuel cost per seat increased by 0.6% and by a similar amount at constant currency.
The average effective fuel price was broadly similar at $977 per tonne equivalent to 614 per tonne.
Longer average sector length and the higher load factor drove an increase in cost per seat, which was partly offset by easyJet lean initiatives.
Further per seat benefits were driven by short-term factors, including more favourable weather conditions.

The net book value of property, plant and equipment increased by 262 million driven principally by the acquisition of nine A320 family aircraft, and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases and life-limited parts.

As a result, gearing has increased to 17% at 30 September 2014.
