Redefine International P. L. C. 28 Annual Report 2014 Strategic report Strategic report Adjusted NAV per share increased 4.9% to 40.54p.
Financial review Overview The Group produced a profit attributable to equity holders for the year of 95.2m.
Adjusted for the effects of the management internalisation and the extinguishment of the residual Gamma debt, this represents a 13.8m increase on the prior year.
Basic and diluted EPS, excluding the effect of the management internalisation and Gamma debt writeoff, were 6.30p compared to the 6.66p basic and 6.23p diluted EPS in the prior year.
Earnings available for distribution were 39.1m, an increase of 9.0m from the comparable period.
Adjusted NAV per share increased to 40.54p compared to 38.66p at 31 August 2014, an increase of 4.9%.
The costs of the management internalisation, which were writtenoff in the period, had an impact of 1.92p per share.
Adjusted NAV per share, excluding the effect of the management internalisation, would therefore have been 42.46p.
The property valuation uplift of 49.8m was offset by a net fair value decline on Cromwell securities of 5.5m.
3.1m of gains on disposals of Cromwell securities were, however, Andrew Rowell achieved during the year.
CFO Earnings available for distribution and dividend Earnings available for distribution increased 29.9% to 39.1m.
Distributable rental income was up 19.1m largely due to the acquisition of the CMC portfolio, Weston Favell and the restructuring of the Aviva shopping centre portfolio, which resulted in Grand Arcade, Wigan and West Orchards, Coventry becoming 100% owned.
The higher rental income Earnings available for was partly offset by the associated higher interest costs.

an increase of 9.0m from The Companys policy is to distribute the majority of its earnings available for distribution in the form of dividends the comparable period.
Earnings available for distribution exclude capital items, earnings from the Gamma portfolio and only include the Groups share of the net income from the Deltaportfolio.

Redefine International P. L. C. 30 Annual Report 2014 Strategic report The 3.20p per share distribution for the year reflects a yield of 7.9% on the Adjusted NAV per share at 31 August 2014.
The Board declared a second interim dividend of 1.70p per share on 28 October 2014, for the six month period ended 31 August 2014.
The 3.20p per share distribution for the year reflects a yield of 7.9% on the Adjusted NAV per share at 31August 2014.
The Company offered shareholders the option of receiving ordinary shares in lieu of the cash dividend under a Scrip Dividend Scheme.
The scrip dividend average take up for the year was 64.3%.
The record date for the second interim dividend on the JSE and the LSE was 21November 2014 and the dividend payment date was 5December 2014.
Net assets EPRA NAV per share has increased by 25.5% to 37.66p 31 August 2013: 30.00p largely as a result of the Gamma residual debt extinguishment and a movement of the deferred tax on the Cromwell investment.
EPRA NAV is used as a reporting measure to better reflect underlying net asset value attributable to shareholders by removing the cumulative fair value movements of interest rate derivatives and deferred tax.
The property valuation uplift of 49.8m 3.84p per share was offset by a net Cromwell fair value decline of 5.5m 0.42p per share as well as a 4.5m 0.35p per share foreign exchange translation movement.
Share placements during the period added 2.71p per share, owing to placements at a premium to net asset value.
The EPRA NAV as at 31 August 2014 includes items which, in the opinion of the Board, should be adjusted for in order to better reflect the underlying value of the Group.
An Adjusted NAV per share has therefore been calculated as follows: 31 August 31 August 2014 2013 pence pence Note per share per share Fully diluted IFRS NAV per share 37.11 29.05 Adjusted for derivatives and deferred tax 0.55 0.95 EPRA NAV per share 1 37.66 30.00 Gamma residual debt 4.21 Delta negative equity 2 1.64 2.36 Other negative equity provision 3 1.24 1.66 Performance fee 0.43 Adjusted NAV per share 40.54 38.66 The 44.9m positive impact of the Gamma residual debt was achieved following the final determination notice being issued to the Gamma bondholders and the receipt of a legal extinguishment of the debt from the Security Trustee.
The consideration of 22.8m related to the cancellation of the investment advisory agreement as well as the 2.1m of goodwill on the acquisition of RIMH, were written off in the period.
This had the effect of reducing EPRA NAV per share and Adjusted NAV per share by 1.92p.
There is no adjustment for this as it has a permanent impact despite the expectation that the management internalisation will have a longterm positive effect on earnings and the performance of the Group.
Without the impact of the management internalisation, Adjusted NAV per share would have been 42.46p per share.
The EPRA publishes best practice recommendations for Europes Stock Exchange listed real estate sector.
In order to enhance comparability and transparency the Company has adopted the EPRA net asset value measure within its reporting.
The EPRA NAV presented removes the cumulative fair value movements of interest rate derivatives and deferred tax.
Following the successful completion of the Delta restructuring announced on 15 October 2012, the negative net asset value position of 1.64p per share is expected to reverse at the end of the loan term.
A liability of 5.6m 0.43p per share is currently held relating to the facility provided to the Grand Arcade, Wigan.
As part of the Aviva restructure completed in December 2013, Aviva retained the right to participate in 50% of the income and capital growth generated by Grand Arcade.
This right was recognised at fair value, although it is not deemed to have an immediate impact on NAV and has therefore been adjusted for.
In addition, as a result of the nonrecourse nature of the debt relating to the Justice Centre in the Hague, Netherlands and the Ciref Berlin German portfolio, the negative net asset value positions of 0.69p per share and 0.12p share respectively have been written back.
