Underlying growth, excluding revenues of 19.2 million relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital since its acquisition in May 2014, was 9.5%.
Of the underlying revenue growth of 9.5%: additional in-patient and daycase volumes accounted for 5.6%: the rate increase in in-patient and daycase average revenue per case accounted for 1.2%: and growth in out-patient revenues accounted for a further 2.1% increase, including an increase in minor procedures undertaken in out-patient rooms of 7.8 million.

Underlying growth, excluding revenues relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital, was 1.4%.
Of the underlying growth of 1.4% in PMI revenues: the decrease in the volumes of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.0% decline in revenues: the rate increase in in-patient and daycase average revenue per case accounted for a 1.3% increase in revenues and offset the decline in volume: and growth in out-patient revenues accounted for a further 1.1% increase, including an increase in minor procedures undertaken in out-patient treatment rooms which would previously have been undertaken in theatre.
The growth in rate was adversely impacted by an increase in the proportion of surgical cases treated as daycases.
These procedures carry a lower revenue per case than in-patient admissions.
Revenue per case of in-patient admissions increased by 6.4% relative to the prior year, supported by an increase in the complexity of surgical procedures undertaken.
The average revenue per daycase admission increased by 2.2% in the year.

Underlying growth, excluding revenues relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital, was 27.3%.
Of the underlying growth of 27.3% in NHS revenues: a significant increase in surgical admissions accounted for a 19.9% increase in revenues: the rate increase in in-patient and daycase average revenue per case accounted for a 2.6% increase in revenues, notwithstanding a 2.25% decline in attributable NHS tariff in the year: and growth in out-patient revenues accounted for a further 4.8% increase in revenues in the year.
In 2013, the in-patient and daycase rate was adversely impacted by a temporary reduction in case mix complexity arising from the transition in April 2013 of local NHS Commissioning to Clinical Commissioning Groups, as a result of the Health and Social Care Act.
The year ended 31 December 2014 benefited from both the absence of similar effects and an increase in local contract NHS work, typically more complex procedures attracting a higher average revenue per case.

Underlying growth, excluding revenues from Spire St Anthonys Hospital was 7.4%.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 31 Strategic Report Financial review continued Of the underlying growth of 7.4% in self-pay revenues: an increase in surgical admissions accounted for a 6.8% increase in revenues: in-patient and daycase average revenue per case accounted for a 0.8% decline in revenues: and growth in out-patient revenues accounted for a 1.4% increase in revenues in the year.
Revenue per case for in-patient admissions increased by 1.6% and by 1.5% per daycase admission: however, daycase admissions accounted for 59% of total admissions, up from 57% in the previous year.
From the beginning of 2012 until early 2013, the Group benefited from a significant number of hip revision procedures associated with a patient recall undertaken by DePuy.
These revision procedures were highly complex and priced at a substantial premium to average self-pay procedures.
The absence of similar work in 2014 had an adverse impact on rates achieved overall and masked a positive rate improvement in underlying recurring case mix.
OTHER REVENUE Other revenue, which includes fees paid to the Group by consultants e. g for the use of Group facilities and services and third-party revenues e. g pathology services to third parties, increased by 5.1 million, or 19.2%, in the year, from 26.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 31.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT Cost of sales increased in the year by 54.5 million, or 14.3%, from 382.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 436.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Underlying cost of sales, excluding 10.5 million relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital, increased in the period by 44.0 million, or 11.5%, from 382.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 426.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Underlying gross margin for the year of 2014 was 49.1%, compared to 50.0% in 2013.
Gross margin has been adversely impacted by a reduction of 3% in NHS tariff applicable to the 20132014 fiscal year and a further 2.25% NHS tariff reduction applicable from 1 April 2014 for the 20142015 fiscal year and by a higher proportion of revenues from the NHS in 2014 than in 2013.
Some of this impact has been mitigated by improved operating efficiency in the period.
Underlying clinical staff costs, as a percentage of revenues, reduced by 0.1% to 17.4% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014, as compared to 31 December 2013.
Underlying direct costs of prostheses, drugs and consumables, as a percentage of revenues, increased from 21.3% for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 22.1% in 2014.
This was due to a significant increase in NHS orthopaedic and ophthalmology surgical activity in the period and a general increase in in-patient case complexity across specialties, relative to 2013.
Underlying medical fees payable to consultant surgeons and anaesthetists for services performed in connection with NHS patients grew as a consequence of the increase in NHS activity in the year.
Medical fees for NHS work increased from 5.2% of total revenues in 2013 to 5.8% of total revenues in 2014: however, as a consequence of the continued focus on cost management, these fees reduced as a percentage of NHS revenues, from 20.7% in 2013 to 20.0% in 2014.
Other fees payable to consultants for out-patient and diagnostic activities reduced as a percentage of revenues, from 6.0% in 2013 to 5.7% in 2014.
OTHER OPERATING COSTS Other operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 increased by 76.5 million, or 27.1%, from 282.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 359.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Underlying other operating costs, excluding 8.6 million relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital, increased in the period by 67.9 million, or 24.0%, from 282.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 350.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Included within these costs are exceptional costs of 11.5 million for 2013 and 54.0 million for 2014 relating to the business reorganisation, corporate restructuring and regulatory and governance costs.
Before exceptional items, underlying operating costs increased by 25.4 million, or 9.4%, from 271.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 296.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 on revenue growth of 9.5% in the year.
DEPRECIATION Excluding 0.7 million relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital, the charge for depreciation for the year ended 31 December 2014 has increased by 1.4 million, or 3.3%, relative to 2013, to 44.4 million.
Overall, depreciation arising from capital expenditure in 2014 and the acquisition of St Anthonys, have offset the full year impact on depreciation of reductions in the fixed asset base from the sale in January 2013 of 12 hospital properties, subject to long leases 2013 Freehold Sale, and of the sale and leaseback of the Spire Washington Hospital premises in March 2014.
32 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information RENT Rent of land and buildings for the year, excluding 0.1 million relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital, increased by 5.7 million, or 10.4%, to 60.6 million.
The increase is largely the consequence of the annualised impact of the 2013 Freehold Sale 2.2 million in the year, the first annual indexation of rental costs associated with the 2013 Freehold Sale 1.3 million in the year and the commencement of rent following the sale, subject to lease, of the Spire Washington Hospital, which was concluded on 11 March 2014 with a starting rent of 2.3 million per year 1.9 million in the year.
The impact on comparatives will not normalise until the end of the first quarter of 2015.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS Since Admission, 2.7 million share options comprising of 1.7 million Directors Share Bonus Award and 1.0 million Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP have been awarded to executive directors and members of the senior management team.
These are conditional on certain market and other performance conditions being fulfilled.
Further details are contained in note 28 on page 120 of the financial statements.
The charge to the income statement in the year was 2.8 million 3.7 million inclusive of NI, of which 2.5 million 3.4 million inclusive of NI related to the Directors Share Bonus Award and was charged to exceptional items, as it related to performance during the period prior to the IPO.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2014 increased by 5.1 million, or 3.3%, from 154.1 million to 159.2 million.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6.1%, from 150.0 million to 159.2 million 2013 EBITDA adjusted to include 4.1 million rental costs, to include these costs on the same basis as for 2014, following the 2013 Freehold Sale and the sale, subject to lease, of the Spire Washington Hospital in March 2014.
OPERATING PROFITS BEFORE AND AFTER EXCEPTIONAL COSTS Operating profit after exceptional costs decreased by 39.7% in the year to 60.1 million.
Before exceptional costs, operating profits increased by 2.7%, from 111.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 114.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2014.
PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The profit on disposal of 18.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 relates principally to the sale of the freehold land and buildings of Spire Washington Hospital.
The profit in the prior year of 44.2 million relates principally to the profit on the 2013 Freehold Sale.
FINANCE COSTS Finance costs in the year include those incurred in respect of borrowings drawn under the capital structure of the Group prior to Admission.
On Admission, borrowings reduced significantly and, therefore, finance costs also reduced.
Finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2014, before exceptional finance costs, totalled 85.9 million, a reduction of 68.0 million or 44.2% over the prior year.
This reduction mainly comprises 35.9 million of interest on shareholder debt and 32.1 million on bank loans, net of the mark-to-market movement on interest rate swap instruments settled on Admission.
Had the finance structure as effected on Admission been in place throughout the 2014 financial year, finance costs before exceptional items would have further reduced by 65.2 million to 20.7 million.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, exceptional finance costs of 42.2 million arose from the 2013 Freehold Sale and relate to interest rate swaps being recycled to the income statement as they no longer met the criteria for hedge accounting, net of the early settlement discounts arising on the repayment of bank borrowings.
TAXATION The taxation credit for the year ended 31 December 2014 consisted of a 13.7 million credit for deferred tax and a charge of 0.7 million for corporation tax.
The UK corporation tax charge on 2014 profits was nil 2013: nil, reflecting the significant allowable costs arising from the Listing, including the settlement of out-of-the-money interest rate swaps.
The UK corporation tax charge in the income statement is an adjustment to prior years.
The credit for deferred taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 13.7 million, comprising deferred tax assets previously unrecognised, in relation to losses carried forward following the reorganisation of the Spire Group into a single tax group.
The credit for the year ended 31 December 2013 relates predominantly to the release of deferred tax liabilities associated with fixed assets disposed of as part of the 2013 Freehold Sale.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2014 33 Strategic Report Financial review continued PROFIT AFTER TAXATION The profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 6.0 million, compared with a profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 102.2 million.
The profit on assets sold as part of the 2013 Freehold Sale and the consequent release of associated deferred tax liabilities substantially contributed to the result for 2013.

Spire Harpenden Hospital INVESTING IN NEW CAPACITY TO MEET DEMAND Building within the current hospital, together with extended parking, means easy access for our patients to all wards, theatres and patient areas.
Were well positioned now to treat even more of our local population.

Demand, particularly from local NHS trusts, commissioners and through NHS Choose and Book, continues to grow.
By 2013, theatre utilisation was up to 76% and the hospital was beginning to face pinch points in theatre and consultant capacity.
An additional theatre, incorporating laminar flow and laparoscopic capability, an enhanced recovery area and a further seven-bedded ward were opened in September, and a fully refurbished main reception area was opened in February 2015.
Harpenden now has 79 beds, five main theatres, an endoscopy theatre and extensive digital X-ray, mammography, ultrasound, CT and MRI facilities.
Following the new investment, theatre utilisation is 60% and the hospital now has capacity for future growth.
6 theatres Spire Harpenden Hospital has five complex theatres and one endoscopy theatre Planned to a 5cm tolerance, Spire Harpenden Hospitals new theatre block was craned into position within the existing hospital complex.
The use of off-site modular construction enabled this nine month, 5 million development to be completed with the loss of only one days operation.
