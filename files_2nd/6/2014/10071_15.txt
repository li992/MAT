1 Before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation.
Tax 2 Restated to include the results of Bridon within The headline Income Statement tax rate was 27.0% 2013: 26.4%.
The headline tax rate for the Group is lower than the weighted blend of the statutory tax rates around the world because of the recognition of deferred tax assets that were not previously thought to be recoverable.
There is also a small benefit from the release of provisions previously held against potential overseas tax audits which have been successfully resolved.
The tax rate after exceptional items and intangible asset amortisation is 32.4% 2013: 28.9%.
The main reason for this being higher than the headline rate is the 3.9 million 2013: 8.1 million exceptional tax charge on Group reorganisations.
The cash tax rate on headline continuing operations of 16.5% 2013: 22.5% is below the headline Income Statement rate due to the utilisation of pre-existing Melrose Group tax losses and other deferred tax assets.
The deferred tax liability in respect of intangible assets, of 259.8 million 2013: 287.4 million, is not expected to represent a future cash tax payment and will unwind as the customer relationship, brand name and intellectual property intangible assets are amortised.
