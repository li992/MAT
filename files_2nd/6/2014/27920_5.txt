A3 Chief Executives review During the year ended 30 September 2014 the Group successfully pursued its strategy to deliver shareholder value through developing new lending, purchasing portfolios, entering into new servicing agreements, diversifying its funding base and continuing the careful management of the extant portfolios.
The funding and income diversification strategy has been materially advanced by the authorisation of Paragon Bank PLC, the Groups retail deposit funded banking subsidiary, which was granted in February 2014.

indd 17 16 12 2014 10:43 A Strategic report A3.1 Financial review continued Total operating income increased by 11.4% to 197.9 million 2013 restated : 177.6 million.
Within this, net interest income increased to 179.4 million from 161.0 million restated for the year ended 30 September 2013.
The increase reflects both improving margins and growth in the size of the average loan book, which rose by 3.2% to 9,028.7 million 2013: 8,748.0 million appendix C. Net interest margins increased in 2014 to 1.99% compared to 1.84% last year appendix C, driven by new originations and portfolio purchases having higher margins than those assets redeeming in the period and general improvements in the financing costs of the Groups warehouse and new securitisation structures.
Other operating income was 18.5 million for the year, compared with 16.6 million in 2013.
The increase reflects a higher level of third party fee income resulting from the number of third party assets brought under the Groups administration in this and the preceding period, together with strong performance-related fees earned on historic servicing contracts.
Operating expenses increased by 7.6% to 63.4 million from 58.9 million for 2013 restated, principally as a result of increased staff numbers to service the loan portfolios administered by Idem Capital, with average headcount increasing by 14.6% in the year.
The operational costs of Paragon Bank, where costs will exceed associated revenues whilst the business becomes established, also had an impact on Group costs in the year.
Strong income growth, however, resulted in the cost:income ratio reducing to 32.0% from 33.2% restated last year appendix A, remaining significantly below the industry average.
The Board remains focused on controlling operating costs through the application of rigorous budgeting and monitoring procedures and targets a medium term cost:income ratio below 30.0%.
The charge of 12.3 million for loan impairment has reduced from that for 2013 2013: 15.2 million.
As a percentage of average loans to customers appendix C the impairment charge has reduced to 0.14% compared to 0.17% in 2013.
The Group has seen positive trends in arrears performance over the period, with the incidence of new cases reducing and customers correcting past arrears, whilst increasing property values have served to reduce overall exposure to losses on enforcement of security.
The loan books continue to be carefully managed and the credit performance of the buy-to-let book remains exemplary.
Yield curve movements during the period resulted in hedging instrument fair value net gains of 0.6 million 2013: 1.3 million net gains, which do not affect cash flow.
The fair value movements of hedged assets or liabilities are expected to trend to zero over time, as such this item represents a timing difference.
The Group remains economically and appropriately hedged.
Cash flows from the Groups securitisation vehicle companies and the acquired portfolios remain strong, financing, alongside debt raisings, investments in further loan portfolios, the capital requirements of Paragon Bank and credit enhancement for mortgage originations.
Free cash balances were 177.3 million at 30 September 2014 2013: 170.8 million note 39.
Corporation tax has been charged at the rate of 20.8%, compared with 19.2% for the last year: the lower UK Corporation Tax rate in 2014 partially offset the effect of the downward revaluation of deferred tax liabilities made during the previous period.
Profits after taxation of 97.2 million 2013 restated : 84.7 million have been transferred to shareholders funds, which totalled 947.1 million at the year end 2013: 873.3 million.
Following the authorisation of Paragon Bank in the year, the Board conducted a review of its internal reporting requirements and a new segmental reporting format has been adopted.
Paragon Mortgages includes revenue, in the form of interest and ancillary income, from the Groups first mortgage operations, other than the buy-to-let lending of Paragon Bank, and from assets remaining in other legacy, portfolios.
Idem Capital includes revenue generated from assets purchased by the Groups debt investment business, Idem Capital Holdings Limited and third party loan administration activity.
Paragon Bank includes revenue generated from the Groups regulated banking business, Paragon Bank PLC.
An analysis of the Groups financial assets by type is shown in note 29.
