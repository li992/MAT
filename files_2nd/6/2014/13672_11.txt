The business continues to exercise tight cost control, which particularly benefited other operating costs.
Operating costs also benefited from a one-off VAT credit of 35 million and lower year-on-year depreciation and amortisation of 7 million, due to a different mix in depreciable assets.
The VAT credit arose as a result of a change in regulation, which increased the scope of products attracting VAT from April 2012, leading to an increased recovery rate.
The one-off benefits were offset by a 45million higher pension charge mainly due to the IAS 19 service charge rate increasing from 18.2 per cent to 20.3 per cent of pensionablepay.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 23 Financial review continued People costs increased by four per cent, driven by an increase in UKPIL people costs.
Tight cost control in non-people costs in UKPIL, which reduced by three per cent, mitigated the impact of increased volumes in GLS and higher sub-contractor rates in GLS Germany in distribution and conveyance costs.
Infrastructure costs were flat, with lower property and depreciation and amortisation costs being offset by higher IT costs.
Other operating costs decreased by 11 per cent due to tight cost control, predominantly in UKPIL.
Operating profit before transformation costs All the business segments generated increased operating profit before transformation costs, resulting in a Group operating profit before transformation costs of 671 million 2013 598 million, with the margin increasing by 20 basis points.
See KPIs pages 18 to 19 Operating profit after transformation costs Transformation costs were 241 million 2013 195 million and are described in the UK Parcels, International & Letters UKPIL section of this report.

The accounting impact of the Pensions Reform was to increase the accounting pension surplus significantly, resulting in a one-time non-cash credit of 1,350 million.
Specific items also arose in relation to transaction-related costs of 28 million 2013 10 million and the charge associated with the Employee Free Shares Offer of 94 million.
The Employee Free Shares Offer charge represents the charge to the income statement relating to the issuing of Free Shares, which is calculated from the start of the period when employees become eligible for the shares and is based on the mid-market closing price on the day of admission to the London Stock Exchange.
In 2014-15 the charge is expected to be around 170 million.
Business-related costs of 15 million 2013 67 million largely comprise 15 million historical employment costs, a 7 million release 201328million charge of the industrial diseases claims provision and 5 million of POL separation costs 2013 20 million relating to facilitiesmanagement.
The prior year also included 20 million of asset impairments mainly property.

Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 24 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Non-operating specific items comprise property disposal gains of 19 million 2013 4 million and 2 million from the sale of the Groups associate investment in G3 Worldwide Mail N. V. Spring and net pension interest.
Net pension interest is non-cash and is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the year for the schemes liabilities to the net pension surplus.
Due to the substantial change in the RMPP surplus resulting from the Pensions Reform, the net pension interest was recalculated to 69 million 2013 30 million for the full year.
The net pension interest for 2014-15 based on the discount rate for the schemes liabilities and net pension surplus is expected to be around 75 million.
Net finance costs excluding specific items The net finance costs of 67 million 2013 99 million comprise finance costs of 71 million 2013 104 million, offset by finance income of 4million 2013 5 million.
2014-15 will see the full year benefit of refinancing our HM Government funding in 2013-14.
On 12September 2013, the Group entered into new Syndicated bank loan facilities.
On 15October 2013, the date of the Companys admission to the London Stock Exchange, drawdowns of 600 million were made against these new facilities and used, along with 418 million of surplus cash, to repay all existing HM Government debt and accrued interest and related costs of obtaining loan finance.
The net finance costs include 47 million 2013 82 million of interest relating to average loans and borrowings on HM Government facilities of 973million, up to the date of the repayment of these facilities 2013 972 million, at an average interest rate of 8.8 per cent 2013 8.4percent.
A further 3 million 2013 nil was payable on the new Syndicated bank loan facilities on an average borrowing volume of 536million since the Companys listing, at an average interest rate of 1.4 per cent.
The total blended interest rate on the new Syndicated bank loan facilities is estimated to be 3.5 per cent after including the effects of interest rate hedging, commitment and arrangement fees and allowing for market expectation of rate rises over the life of the facilities.
The other main elements of net finance costs comprise 10 million 2013 13million finance lease interest and commitment and arrangement fees of 8 million 2013 8 million.

The UK current tax charge is minimal, primarily as a result of the statutory treatment of the HMRC-approved Employee Free Shares Offer as well as utilisation of some brought forward tax reliefs, including losses and capital allowances.
GLS current tax rate was 34 per cent reflecting higher European corporation tax rates on profits and losses, primarily in France, for which no deferred taxation credit has been recognised.
The deferred tax charge is principally due to the effect of the Pensions Reform.
The deferred tax credit in the prior year arose as a result of the recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of carried forward tax reliefs in the UK, including losses and capital allowances.
Excluding specific items, the Group tax charge was 97 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27 per cent.
Notional earnings per share EPS Notional EPS, excluding specific items, was 26.3 pence Reported 127.7 pence.
The notional EPS is calculated using the profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the parent, both Reported and Excluding specific items, and assumes that the one billion ordinary shares in issue at the date of the Companys flotation had been in existence throughout the current reporting year.
Going forward, EPS will be calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue over the relevant period.
Dividends The Board is recommending a final dividend of 13.3 pence per share, payable on 31July 2014 to shareholders whose names appear on the register of members on 4July 2014, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 24July 2014.

Trading working capital movements generated an outflow of 57 million 2013 60 million outflow due to a number of factors including the level of VAT payments.
Both years benefited from one-off working capital items.
In 2013-14, there was a one-off benefit of 150 million in respect of the March 2012 pension prepayment and 20 million relating to the buy forward of stamps partially offset by a 30 million unwinding of the prior year buy forward.
In 2012-13, working capital benefited from the buy forward of stamps of 87 million, an increase in the VAT creditor of 75million, due to an increase in the number of products that have become subject to the standard rate of VAT since April 2012, and the unwinding of the pension prepayment of 40 million.
In 2014-15, there will be a one-off benefit to working capital of approximately 45 million due to the timing of payroll payments in respect of monthly paid staff.
Payments in respect of transformation operating expenditure of 201 million 2013 230 million comprised 111 million 2013 100 million project and property costs, 71 million 2013 75 million voluntary redundancy payments and 19 million 2013 55 million business transformation payments.
Transformation capital expenditure was 83 million 2013 177 million.
Non-transformation capital expenditure was 333 million 2013 258 million primarily in respect of GLS, Parcelforce Worldwide expansion and Mailmark.
The level of investment in the year is the amount of cash EBITDA that needs to be re-invested back into the business to sustain its operations and enable future growth.
It comprises both operating expenditure including voluntary redundancy payments and capital expenditure, which is currently running well ahead of depreciation.
This investment is needed to transform the operations of the UK business to meet the changing mix of traffic and to drive efficiencies in people costs.
Net investment totalled 581 million in 2013-14, reflecting total investment of 617 million offset by the re-investment of operating property and business disposals of 36 million.
Taxation and interest cash costs of 71 million 2013 81 million comprise 33 million 2013 44 million relating to net interest paid and 38million 2013 37 million relating to current taxation payments.
Cash inflows associated with operating property and business disposals were 36 million 2013 52 million.
Net debt Net debt decreased by 351 million to 555 million for the year ended 30March 2014, mainly due to cash flow generated, offset by 45 million of 2013-14 finance costs settled on early repayment of HM Government loans and the costs associated with obtaining new loan facilities.
At the date of listing, all principal and interest on HM Government loans were repaid and 600 million of Syndicated bank loans were drawndown.
Property The Groups property portfolio can be divided into two classes: surplus or soon-to-be-surplus sites with the potential for development development properties : and operational properties, used for the Groups day-to-day operations.
The vast majority of the Groups properties are operational properties.
4 As set out in the Prospectus, the Group has identified three potential development sites in London: Nine Elms: Mount Pleasant: and Paddington the London Development Portfolio.
Depending on future changes to the configuration of the operational network, some other sites may have the potential to become development properties, but none would be of similar scale to the London Development Portfolio.
Additionally, each year there will be lower value disposals arising from localised changes to the network.
The proceeds from these disposals will be re-invested to fund partially the modernisation of the Royal Mail Delivery Office network.
With new external facilities now in place, we can seek to 3 Cash flows are the same on both a Reported and Adjusted basis.
This non-GAAP presentation excludes the 820 million cash flows relating to POL on its transfer to Royal Mail Holdings plc on 1April 2012.

Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 26 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information optimise the realisable value of any development properties as they become surplus, but we will adopt a flexible approach as to the manner in which this is achieved.
Pensions Reform On 26September 2013, the Company agreed with the Royal Mail Pension Plan Trustee to implement the Pensions Reform with effect from 1April2014.
Under this agreement, members pensionable pay will increase by RPI up to a maximum of five per cent, regardless of whether actual basic pay increases by more or less than this amount.
This change is considered to be a plan amendment which meets the IAS 19 definition of a past service cost and accordingly a non-cash 1,350 million credit specific item has been recognised in the Group income statement.
Pension balance sheet amounts The IAS 19 pension position at 30March 2014 was a surplus of 1,723 million compared with a surplus of 825 million at 31March 2013.
Theincreased surplus reflects the impact of the Pensions Reform of 1,350 million, partially offset by the impact on liabilities of a lower discount rate.
This discount rate is driven by the estimated real rate of return available on AA corporate bonds of similar duration to the schemes liabilities 28years.
Financial risks and related hedging The Group is exposed to currency and commodity price risk.
The Group operates hedging policies which are described in the notes to the financial statements.
The exposures are set out below, together with the impact on 2014-15 operating profit as a result of the changes in fuel costs exchange rates up to 30March 2014, after the impact of the respective hedging programmes.
5% increase in price No further change in weakening of price exchange rate Sterling before versus 2013-14 hedging after hedging Impact on 2014-15 operating profit m loss m gain Diesel and jet fuel 4 1 US$ 3 2 Euro 10 - The currency exposure arises mainly from the Groups trading with overseas postal operators, GLS profits and inter-company loans with GLS.
There is a significant degree of offset between these exposures and hedge programmes in place which will reduce the impact on 2014-15 operating profit.
The residual, unhedged, exposure for 2014-15 is estimated to be 5 million in respect of Euro and 30 million US Dollars.
It is anticipated that there will be a 1 million favourable impact on profits arising from the change in effective after hedging impact diesel costs from 50.2 pence per litre in 2013-14 to an anticipated 49.7 pence per litre in 2014-15.
Without hedging, this variance would be 7 million favourable based upon closing fuel prices at 30March 2014.
The Groups exposure to fuel prices is shown below, together with the coverage provided by the hedges in place.
The exposure represents the cost of the underlying commodity and excludes fuel duty approximately 100 million per annum.
Diesel and jet fuel costs including duty for 2014-15 are expected to be 185 million 2013 196 million.

At 30March 2014, 492 million 89 per cent of net debt of 555 million was at a long term i. e. more than one year fixed rate to maturity.
An increase of 100 basis points in interest rates during the year would have resulted in an increase to profit of 1 million.
Counterparty risk is managed by limiting aggregate exposure to any individual counterparty based on their financial strength.
Letters of Credit In 2000, Royal Mail entered into a lease arrangement whereby certain automation equipment was leased and the lease rentals concurrently prepaid by Royal Mail into an investment fund.
Following the general fall in credit ratings in the market, a Letter of Credit has been required to provide, on behalf of Royal Mail, additional support to the lessor in the event of default by the investment fund holder.
The current value of the Letter of Credit is 37 million and it is currently not collateralised.
Royal Mail plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 27 Financial review continued As a result of changes to insurance arrangements during the year, the Group is now required to provide Letters of Credit against the economically self-insured elements of its insurance programme.
As at 30March 2014, 75 million of Letters of Credit were required and had been put in place and are not currently collateralised.
The probability of any of the Letters of Credit being called upon is considered to be remote, and therefore no disclosures have been made in relation to these Letters of Credit in the Group financial statements.
Outlook for 2014-15 We continue to expect to see overall volume growth in the UK parcel market in 2014-15, with the B2C C2X segment growing at around 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent and the B2B segment growing at slightly above GDP.
However, we expect that the increased competitive activity in the market will put pressure on pricing.
5 We continue to expect UK addressed letter market volumes to decline by four to six per cent per annum.
For 2014-15, we expect to be at the better end of this range.
The impact of upcoming European and local elections in May 2014 and forecast improvement in GDP will more than offset the expected impact from the increased rollout of direct delivery competition in 2014-15.
GLS experienced good revenue growth in 2013-14, in part helped by competitor disruption in Italy that is not expected to be repeated in 2014-15.
Therefore, the rate of GLS revenue growth in 2014-15 is expected to be slightly lower than in 2013-14.
The profit improvement resulting from the continued turnaround in France is expected to be offset by increased IT investment across the network.
We continue to focus on cost control.
The management reorganisation programme announced in March 2014 is expected to deliver annualised cost savings of 50 million, of which approximately 25 million will be realised in 2014-15.
However, there is expected to be an increase in the pension charge of 70-80 million, mainly driven by the increase in the IAS 19 pension service charge rate from 20.3 per cent to 23.6 per cent as a result of market conditions.
The expected increase is based on the current pensionable payroll and the final charge will be dependent on the level and mix of pensionable pay in 2014-15.
In addition, 2014-15 will not benefit from the one-off VAT credit of 35 million in 2013-14.
Depreciation and amortisation is expected to increase by around 20 million, reflecting continuing investment.
These items will have an impact on the year-on-year movements in operating costs, particularly in the first half of the year.
Excluding the one-off VAT credit and expected increase in the pension charge, we are targeting around a 50 basis point expansion in Group operating profit margin before transformation costs for the full year.
Transformation costs are expected to be in the range of 120-140 million, largely depending on the level of voluntary redundancies.
We expect the cumulative net cash investment over 2013-14 and 2014-15 to remain at around 1.2 billion, as the reduced costs of implementing certain projects in 2013-14 will help offset the cash costs of the management reorganisation programme in 2014-15.
