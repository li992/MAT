Trading profit growth was 4.1 per cent and would have been 8.6 per cent at constant currency.
Foreign exchange rates impact The Group reports its results in sterling though the most important trading currency is the US dollar which represents 55 per cent of the Groups revenue.

The policies to manage these risks have been applied consistently throughout the year.

Other financial risks The nature of the Groups business exposes it to risks which are partly financial in nature.
Counterparty risk is the risk that banks and other financial institutions which are contractually committed to make payments to the Group may fail to do so.
Commodity risk is the risk that the Group may have purchased commodities which subsequently fall in value.
The Group manages counterparty risk by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, which are approved by the Treasury Committee and monitored regularly.
The Group manages convertibility risk by limiting its exposure to assets which, in the judgement of the Board, may become illiquid for any length of time.
The management of credit and commodity risk is considered to be the responsibility of operational management and, in respect of these risks, the Group does not prescribe a uniform approach across the Group.
The Groups principal risks including strategic, operational, legal and other risks are shown overleaf.
