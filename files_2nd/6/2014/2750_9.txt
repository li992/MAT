These additional costs contribute to the rise in net administration costs from US$42m in 2013 to US$67m for the current year.

Impairment and disposal of available-for-sale financial assets Prior to the restriction on sale of the Groups investment in CIL in January 2014, the Group sold 0.6% of its holding: recognising a gain on sale of US$4m.
The cumulative deficit in valuation of the investment of US$194m has been recycled from reserves and is disclosed as impairment.
