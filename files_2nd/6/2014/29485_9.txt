St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 14 We have commented earlier in this report on the record 7.8 billion of new investments which, together with the continuing excellent retention of client funds and strong investment markets, have led to a 17% growth in funds under management to a record 52.0 billion.
We have also provided an update on the Partnership and adviser numbers.
Whilst the investment in new advisers translates into expense today, it is a lead indicator for future new business.
Therefore, the strong growth in advisers over the last few years and, in particular the 10% growth in 2014, has resulted in higher establishment expenses but it bodes well for new business in 2015 and future years.
In this statement I will comment on the other financial results and, as usual, a more detail review is provided in the Financial Chief Financial Review on pages 18 to 33 which accompanies this report.
Officers Report Financial Results As shareholders will be aware, we report our results on both IFRS and EEV bases, as well as providing further detail on the cash Andrew Croft result emerging from the business.
The EEV result reflects the full economic value of the business and is primarily driven by current year events, particularly new business and investment performance.
The IFRS and cash results Following the very strong are the cumulative effect of all previous years and so the increase in these measures over recent years is due as much to our strong performance of the business in underlying retention as our success in attracting new business.
Of course, retention and new business are related, as it is the positive recent years I am pleased to experience of clients which means they remain with the Group, which leads to additional investment and also advocacy.
report the continuation of this The continuing strong performance of the underlying business trend in 2014. and excellent retention of clients are once again key features of the results on all measures.
However, shareholders will be aware of the changes to regulatory rules on adviser charging which were introduced in 2013.
Whilst the fundamentals of our business were unaffected by the rule changes, we commented at the time on a number of changes to the accounting treatment of certain cash flows which particularly impacted our IFRS reporting.
These effects are long-term and will develop in our accounts over the coming years.
Therefore to further aid investors understanding we have added a new measure called underlying profit, which is based on the IFRS result but adjusted to exclude the impact of the DAC, DIR and PVIF intangibles.
Hopefully investors will find this additional disclosure helpful.
Detail on the definition of all the measures is provided on pages 18 and 19.
The key drivers to the result both this year and 2013 are the growth in new business, the continued strong retention and the investment we have made in future new business with the growth in the number of advisers.
In addition, in each year, we have been able to recognise the value of a capital loss arising in certain legacy companies we originally inherited as part of the St. Jamess Place Group.

However, given the strong results and in particular the strong underlying cash result, the Board has proposed a 50% increase in the final dividend.
This will provide for a pay-out ratio of 70% for the current year and we expect the pay-out ratio to increase to 75% in the near term.
