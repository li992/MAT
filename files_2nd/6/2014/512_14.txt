We helped customise a scalable temporary gas power solution addressing different growth phases and shifting drill locations using a combination of mobile gas generators running on well gas and latterly a micro-grid also running onwell gas.
This micro-grid was connected to the individual well locations byoverhead power lines and operated as the primary utility for the area.
This solution delivered fuel savings of60% versus a diesel solution.
