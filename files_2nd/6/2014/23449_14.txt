Financial Review The Companys diluted NAV per share increased by 15% during the year to 3,174p as a result of a strong performance from the total portfolio which delivered gains of 246 million.
Analysis of Movement in Net Asset Value per share The Consolidated Income Statement on page 61 shows the total return for the period which, together with the impact of Bond conversions, provides an analysis of the movement in NAV.
Performance from the investment portfolio contributed 6.15 per share, just over 22% of the opening NAV.
Foreign currency movements on the loan used for hedging contributed a further 15p.
From this, finance, operating costs and tax were 75p.
The priority profit share paid to Electra Partners for managing the portfolio was 62p per share and the charge for incentive schemes was 90p.
Lastly, a bond conversion increased NAV by 7p.
The above net costs together with the investment performance result in an increase to net assets of 4.10 per share, a total return of 15%.

This is achieved by linking the incentive arrangements to cash realisations and taking into account the time value of money.
The provision for incentives made during the year is a reflection of the strong investment returns which Electra Partners has generated over the past five years.
It will remain a provision, subject to future performance, until such time as cash realisations are sufficient for Electra to have received back the cost of its investment and related management fees together with a priority return.
36 million, equivalent to 90p per share, was provided in the year to 30 September 2014, being 15% of the gains on the investment portfolio.
This figure is less than 18% because Zensar, which contributed 40 million 16% of the total gains on investments, is contained within an incentive scheme set up in 1995 which accrues carried interest at 8% on a deal by deal basis, rather than the 18% on a pooled basis in the post 2006 incentive arrangements.
The provision for incentives in the year to 30 September 2013, of 63 million, amounted to 28% of the investment returns in that period.
This amount exceeded 18% because the realisation of Allflex triggered a first time provision in the 2006 pool.
Previously, realisations together with the fair value of remaining investments were insufficient for the profits on the pool to exceed the compound 8% hurdle that Electra Partners needs to achieve in each pool, some 160 million at 30 September 2013.
The sale of Allflex, which produced a return of 113 million in 2013, pushed the total pool profits well above the hurdle triggering a provision of 45 million in relation to that pool.
The carried interest is described in more detail in Note 22 on pages 87 to 89.
Net Liquid Resources The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 66 analyses the movement in the Groups cash for the year.
Whilst cash at bank was largely unchanged in the period, the cash held in liquidity funds was substantially reduced falling by 50% over the period to 120 million.
As a result net liquidity stood at 166 million compared to 294 million last year.
Record levels of realisations over the last three periods with total proceeds exceeding 1.1 billion led to unusually high liquidity, particularly last year.
However, investment activity, with 900 million invested over this same period, has reduced cash to a level necessary to cover ongoing investment activity and operating costs.

The Convertible Bond pays a coupon of 5% amounting to 5 million in the period.
Additionally a further amount was accrued to represent the cost of the embedded derivative of the conversion option.
In total the accrual rate adopted is 9.9% adding an additional 4 million to this charge.
The Zero Dividend Preference share is accounted for by accruing at the compound yield of 6.5% which is the yield to maturity based on its redemption value.
The amount charged in this period was 4 million which was charged to the capital column in the Consolidated Income Statement reflecting the way in which this instrument will be eventually repaid.
The weighted average cost of debt for the year was 6.7%.
Operating Costs Expenses were 6 million during the year to 30 September 2014 compared to 2 million in 2013.
3 million of this increase relates to the exceptional costs of advisory and legal fees in relation to Circulars to Shareholders and the General Meeting held in October 2014.
Additionally, there were some one off costs in relation to advisory work undertaken in relation to certain regulatory changes, in particular AIFMD and FATCA.
Borrowings Electra has a 195 million multi-currency revolving credit facility which is repayable in December 2017.
Electras policy is to use its credit facility to partially hedge against US Dollars and Euro movements for investments held in these currencies.
Electra raised 46 million of ZDPs in 2009 and 100 million of Subordinated Convertible Bonds in 2010.
The ZDPs are repayable in 2016, while the Subordinated Convertible Bonds are repayable in 2017 if they have not been converted into ordinary shares.
