SUMMARY The increase in revenue during the year has been driven by continuing strong organic growth in the number of services we provide combined with modest price increases, partially offset by the swing from an extremely cold winter in 2013 to an unseasonably mild winter in 2014.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits of 25.3% reflects the underlying increase in the average number of customers during the year, improving economies of scale, and an initial contribution from our new energy supply arrangements since December.
The increase in both the quantity and quality of new customers added over the course of the year has led to an increased loss from our Customer Acquisition operating segment of 12.1m 2013: 10.1m, although the average acquisition cost per customer fell during the second half following the introduction of our new Gold Bundle structure.
Distribution expenses remained broadly flat as a proportion of revenue, reflecting the progressive implementation of the new distributor compensation plan we announced almost 18 months ago.
In absolute terms they increased by 1.0m as a result of higher payments to Partners arising from our continuing strong organic growth and the higher revenue we achieved for the year.
Administrative expenses increased during the year by 7.0m to 41.6m 2013: 34.6m as a result of higher staff costs, an increase in bank charges relating to our new debt facilities with Barclays, greater telephony costs following our decision to introduce a freephone 0800 number for customer services, and the one-off costs associated with the energy Retail Market Review.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 26.8% to 50.6p 2013: 39.9p.
In accordance with previous guidance and our strong cash position, the Company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 19p 2013: 18p per share, making a total dividend of 35p 2013: 31p per share for the year.
MARGINS Our overall gross margin for the year was slightly above previous guidance at 15.2% 2013: 13.9% as a direct consequence of our new energy supply arrangements with Npower which were completed in 18 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements December 2013.
We are therefore updating our guidance on gross profit margins, and now expect them to be within a range of 15% to 17% previously 13% to 15% for the foreseeable future.
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS Our customer management business delivered record growth of over 300,000 services during the year, making eleven consecutive quarters in which we have delivered net growth of over 50,000 services: NET GROWTH IN SERVICES The consistency of these numbers reflects our continuing focus on making it easier for our Partners to gather new members by simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our services more competitive, and improving our customer service.
As a result, all our core services are now seeing strong monthly growth.
The particularly high growth in service numbers during Q2 and Q3 last year was due to exceptionally favourable market conditions and strong promotional activity, and should not be interpreted as a precedent for similar seasonal outperformance in these periods in future years.
The progressive improvement in the quality of our customer base, with lower levels of delinquency and a steady increase in the average number of services being taken by each customer, has resulted in a progressive reduction in both churn and bad debts over the last four years.

REVENUE BY SERVICE M 2014 2013 Electricity 270.3 235.2 Gas 257.6 256.5 Fixed Communications Telephony Broadband 82.2 71.8 Mobile 16.7 13.7 Other 15.7 15.0 TOTAL 642.5 592.2 CUSTOMER ACQUISITION Our net investment in acquiring new customers increased during the year to 12.1m 2013: 10.1m, reflecting the strong organic growth we achieved in the number of services being provided.
Although the initial cost of acquiring a customer who takes one of our Gold Bundles can be considerably higher than for a household taking fewer services, our experience shows that the lifetime value of such customers more than compensates for the higher upfront costs we incur.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution expenses, which primarily represent the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Partners, increased by 1.0m to 18.6m 2013: 17.6m : this reflects an increase in the amount of residual income we paid, combined with higher bonus and incentive payments resulting from the significant increase in our organic growth compared with the previous year.
Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year remained constant at 1.5% of revenues 2013: 1.5%, but increased slightly in absolute terms to 9.9m 2013: 9.0m, partly due to an increase in the number of fraudulent applications for premium mobile phones during the first half of the year which triggered an immediate tightening of our credit checking procedures.
Whilst remaining sympathetic to the financial difficulties some households are experiencing in paying for their energy, we continue to manage our bad debt risk by installing prepayment meters at properties where the occupiers are unwilling to pay for the energy they are using by any other means.
We installed 8,958 of them during the year 2013: 6,584, many of them at the customers own request, which helped grow our base of prepayment meters to 50,095 2013: 33,563 representing approximately 5.8% of the energy services we supply.
This remains significantly below the average level of prepayment meters within the industry of around 15%.
20 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Looking to the future, the further reduction we have seen in the proportion of delinquent customers across the year is, we believe, a useful forward indicator to the level of bad debts we can expect over the medium term.
DELINQUENT CUSTOMERS The average number of employees increased from 604 to 696, most of which took place in the second half of the year: this increase in headcount of 15% is below the increase we saw during the year in the number of services we are providing, as we continue to enhance our systems to manage our growing customer base more effectively.
Personnel expenses excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive schemes increased by 20.8% during the year to 23.8m 2013: 19.7m, as we continue to strengthen our management team.
Other year-on-year adverse movements in administrative expenses included an increase in bank charges relating to our new debt facilities with Barclays, greater telephony costs following our decision to introduce a freephone 0800 number for customer services, and the one-off costs associated with the energy Retail Market Review.
Overall, administrative expenses represented 6.3% of revenue for the year 2013: 5.8%, mainly due to substantially lower spend by Members on their energy during an exceptionally mild winter.
We continue to look for efficiency savings throughout the business to maximise economies of scale as we continue to grow.
This excellent result reflects a continuing strong trading performance, and the further steady progress they have made in supplying gas alongside electricity into the small business and corporate sector, for which they are now buying renewable energy from over 500 small UK generators.
Opus revenues increased by 17.6% to just over 434m 2013: 369m and profit before tax increased from 22.4m to 30.2m.
We remain encouraged by the resilience of the business model and the strength and experience of the Opus management team, and expect to receive a dividend of approximately 4.1m in July 2014.
Our shareholding in Opus is valued on our balance sheet at 8.8m in line with standard accounting policy, notwithstanding the likelihood that its market value is substantially in excess of this figure: we are extremely pleased to have such significant exposure to this rapidly growing, profitable and highly cash generative business.
NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS In December 2013 we improved the commercial terms of our energy supply arrangements with Npower by acquiring Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited for a total consideration of 218m of which 21.5m is deferred for three years.
To fund this transaction and other working capital requirements associated with our recent rapid organic growth, we raised 130m of equity from shareholders and 100m of debt from Barclays Bank.
The debt is due to be repaid over three years, as set out in note 12 to the financial statements on page 100.
This transaction has given rise to the creation of a significant intangible asset in the balance sheet of the Group.
In accordance with the relevant accounting standards, we will be amortising it on a straight-line basis over the 20 year life of the new energy supply arrangements.
As this amortisation is a non-cash item, and unrelated to the underlying trading performance of the business, the financial results on which we will be focussing each year will exclude any impact from this amortisation.
CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL Our cash balances at the year-end increased to 45.4m 2013: 3.4m.
This reflects continuing strong underlying operational cash generation, combined with advance funding from Npower to cover various industry related costs which they were paying directly prior to the new energy supply agreement coming into effect.
Cash outflows are expected to be significantly higher this year, as we complete the 20m refurbishment of our new headquarters office building, support our distribution channel with branded BMW Minis and Tablets, and fund growing demand from customers for free Smartphones.
Facilities have been arranged with Barclays Bank to enable us to fund these costs without affecting our progressive dividend policy.
We anticipate a modest rise in our working capital requirements over the next two years due to a number of factors: i the costs associated with funding the growth in our mobile business where increasing numbers of customers are choosing to be provided with a premium mobile handset, which they can obtain from us with no upfront cost on a 24 month contract: ii an increase in the number of BMW Minis supplied to Partners on hire purchase agreements: and iii the cost of providing them with Tablets on 30 months interest-free credit to help them build their businesses more effectively.
Under the terms of the new energy supply arrangements Npower remains responsible for funding the working capital requirements associated with our energy budget plan customers.
22 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements BORROWINGS Our balance sheet at the year end shows a net debt position of 53.6m 2013: net cash 0.8m which principally reflects the impact of the 100m we borrowed from Barclays to help fund the recent transaction with Npower.
DIVIDEND The final dividend of 19p per share 2013: 18p will be paid on 1 August 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 July 2014 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting which will be held on 15 July 2014.
This makes a total dividend payable for the year of 35p 2013: 31p.
We remain firmly committed to a progressive dividend policy, but the level of distributions to shareholders for the current year will need to reflect the impact of starting to repay the borrowings we arranged in December to part-fund our recent transaction with Npower.
Our current expectation is that the total dividend for the current year will therefore increase by around 15%, and thereafter that further growth in earnings from the level we achieve this year should be reflected in a corresponding rise in the level of distributions to shareholders.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of 4.2m 2013: 0.9m.
These expenses relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2.
As a result of the increasing relative importance of share incentive scheme charges as a proportion of our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits and earnings.
The increase in this charge mainly reflects the strong rise in the Companys share price during the financial year, and therefore separate disclosure is considered appropriate so that the underlying performance of the business can be clearly identified.
In accordance with IFRS 2, awards made under the Companys JSOP share incentive scheme are deemed to be cash-settled.
However, whilst approximately 3.4m 2013: 0.4m of the share incentive scheme charges during the year relate to JSOP awards, and could therefore be settled in cash, in practice it is expected that any settlement of awards under the JSOP will be made in equity.
Our current earnings per share have therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
The tax charge for the year is 7.7m 2013: 7.6m.
The effective tax rate for the year was 20.9% 2013: 21.8%.
