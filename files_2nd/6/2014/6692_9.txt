The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 48 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information On-train metering The majority of electric train operating companies are charged by Network Rail for their estimated use of energy on the basis of modelled consumption rates.
At the end of the year when the estimated and actual numbers are reconciled train operating companies either pay additional energy costs or, in some instances, receive a refund.
However, in the past year, Southern has moved to metered electricity billing, by installing on-train meters tracking energy consumption.
This means its charges are no longer based on modelled consumption rates, but on actual metered usage.
Southern can now be more certain about the cost of its 322 strong fleets energy consumption, with the obvious benefits of more accurate budgeting and cost control.
Southern has always led the way in reducing energy consumption and was the first operator, together with Network Rail, to introduce regenerative braking on the direct current network.
Another benefit of the on-train meters is the ability Southern has to realise the benefit of monitoring efficient driving.
Train drivers are trained to coast on identified particular parts of the network.
This entails permitting the train to use its own momentum, where appropriate, to save energy and reduce electricity consumption.
This energy efficient driving is part of Go-Aheads continual work towards reducing its carbon emissions and reducing cost.
