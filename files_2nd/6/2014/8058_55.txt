2 The award is subject to time vesting only, i. e. there are no further performance conditions.
Vesting of the performance shares and share options is dependent on the achievement of targets relating to compound average annual growth CAAG in RBs EPS over a three-year period.
The Remuneration Committee of Indivior will determine the vesting of awards at the 2016 AGM, where applicable, taking into account RBs actual EPS and Indiviors achievements during the performance period.
The Committee maintains the discretion to make adjustments if this is considered to be appropriate.
Any adjustments will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration for FY2015.
Legacy award 2014 Value Creation Plan The CEO did not receive an award under the RB LTIP in 2013.
Instead he was made an award under the RBP Value Creation Plan VCP.
This was a cash-based plan, put in place by RB to incentivize managing the decline of the US Suboxone Film Market Share over the three-year period 20142016.
Following the demerger, Indivior has agreed for the VCP to continue on the same terms as the original VCP put in place by RB.
Under the terms of the plan the CEO may receive a target cash payment of $1,326,000 in 2017 based on the Companys average market share of the sublingual opioid dependence medications over the performance period.
For achieving the threshold target, 25% of the target award will be received and for achieving the maximum target 2x of the target awards will be received.
The performance targets are not being disclosed at present as we consider these to be commercially sensitive, but we will disclose these targets in full in 2017 once the awards have vested.
Awards to CFO on appointment The Company appointed a new CFO, Cary J. Claiborne, in November 2014, prior to the demerger from RB.
As part of the terms of his appointment, it was agreed that he would be awarded the following awards to compensate him for the value of remuneration foregone as a result of him leaving his previous employer: An award of $292,000 being the fair value equivalent of shares options forfeited as a result of leaving previous employment.
It is expected that the CFO will use this payment to buy shares to go towards reaching the share ownership requirement of 5x of base salary.
Following the payments Cary has purchased 85,780 shares in the Company.
A cash payment of $158,000 to partially compensate for the loss of bonus and unvested 401 K company match as a result of leaving his previous employment.
This will be repayable to the Company if he resigns within two years of the payment date, pro-rated for the time not employed during the two-year period.
An enhanced LTIP award in 2015 with an additional award of 1x of base salary which will be subject to the same stretching performance conditions as for all other 2015 LTIP awards.
