Simon Shaw Financial policies and risk management Group Chief Financial Officer The Group has financial risk management policies which cover financial risks considered material to the Groups operations and results.
These policies are subject to continuous review in light of developing regulation, accounting standards and practice.
Compliance with these policies is mandatory for all Group companies and is reviewed regularly by the Board.
Treasury policies and objectives The Group Treasury policy is designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group, which primarily relate to funding and liquidity, interest rate exposure and currency rate exposures.
The Group does not engage in trades of a speculative nature and only uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various other items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
Surplus cash balances are generally held with A rated banks.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings, at both fixed and floating interest rates.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group cash flow to interest rate risk, which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain at least 70% of its borrowings in fixed rate instruments.
