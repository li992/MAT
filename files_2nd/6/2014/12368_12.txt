Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the Groups financial results and performance.
Both the average and year end RUB by the Group.
US$ exchange rates fluctuated significantly during 2014, in particular in the second half, resulting in significant depreciation of the Russian Rouble against the US Dollar by the year-end.
From 1 January to 31 December 2014 the Russian Rouble depreciated against the US Dollar by 72.2% from All intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes to the Groups ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions.
Foreign exchange losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement predominantly arise on the re-translation of US Dollar-denominated The carrying amount of the Groups interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their relative interests in the external loans in Rouble functional currency entities and represent a non-cash loss.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
The Groups net assets have also reduced with a US$618 million non-cash loss arising in reserves relating to the translation of the Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge denominated Balance Sheets into the US Dollar presentational currency.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between 1 the aggregated fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 2 the previous carrying amount of the assets including goodwill, and The devaluation of the Rouble had a limited effect on operating costs and Adjusted EBITDA in the first three quarters of the year, however this liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests.
benefit became more significant in Q4 2014 when a significant devaluation took place.
Should the RUB US$ exchange rate continue at the current levels throughout 2015, there will be further significant operating cost and Adjusted EBITDA benefits relative to 2014.

The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration The requirements of IAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Groups that does not qualify for as a measurement period adjustment is based on how the contingent consideration is classified.
Where an indicator of impairment exists or the carrying value of the asset contains goodwill with an indefinite useful life, the entire that is classified as equity is not subsequently remeasured.
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at carrying amount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single cash subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IAS 39 Financial Instruments generating unit through the comparison of its recoverable amount the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell with its carrying Recognition and Measurement with the corresponding amount being recognised in profit or loss.

Goodwill is all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant transactions that are measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair translated at rates on the date of such transactions: value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets resulting exchange differences are included in equity and presented as movements relating to the effect of translation to the Groups presentation acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of On the disposal of a foreign operation i. e. a disposal of the Groups entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.

An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in the consolidated income On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
For all other partial disposals i. e. reductions in the Groups ownership interest in associates or jointly controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control, the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to the Acquisition of mining licences consolidated income statement.
The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity.
As these entities do not represent a business, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination and, accordingly, the transaction is accounted for as the Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets and liabilities acquired arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as acquisition of an asset.
The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost.

The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
No financial instruments have been classified as available for sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for financial instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Loans Cash and cash equivalents and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.

For equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include: present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty net basis.
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations see below, that management has made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in consolidated financial statements.
Current and deferred tax Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items that are recognised in the Production start date consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in The Group assesses the stage of each mine or plant construction project to determine when an asset moves into the commercial production consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

Revenue recognition The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use and moves into the Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullions and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured at the fair value production stage.
Criteria considered include, but are not limited to the following: of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts.

The valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and criteria that, in some cases, include managements estimates of discounted future cash flows.
The calculation of the units-of-production rate of depreciation could be impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecast production based on proved and probable ore reserves.
This would generally arise when there are significant changes in any of the If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates of the fair values of factors or assumptions used in estimating ore reserves.

Such a remeasurement could have an impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated income statement in current and future periods.
Impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment The Group considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications that goodwill, mining assets Key sources of estimation uncertainty or other property, plant and equipment owned by the Group are impaired.
External sources of information the Group considers include: changes in Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the market and economic and legal environment in which the Group operates, that are not within its control and that affect the recoverable amount the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, of goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.

In determining the recoverable amounts of the Groups mining assets and other property, plant and equipment, the Groups management determines the fair value less costs to sell by estimating the discounted future The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that after-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Groups mining properties, costs to sell the mining properties and the appropriate post-tax have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period.
Reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of recoverable reserves and resources and or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to: amounts of the Groups goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash flows could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment: valuation of stockpiles and work in-process: Stockpiles and work in-process In determining mine operating costs recognised in the consolidated income statement, the Groups management uses survey and assay share-based compensation: techniques to estimate quantities of ore stacked on leach pads and in process and the recoverable gold and silver in this material to determine the environmental obligations: average costs of finished goods sold during the period.
Changes in these estimates can result in a change in mine operating costs of future periods contingencies: and and carrying amounts of inventories.
At 31 December 2014 the carrying value of the ore stockpiles was US$207 million and work in-process was US$51 million.
