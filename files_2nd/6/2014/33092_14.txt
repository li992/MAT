FINANCE REVIEW After an outstanding year of net asset growth and the conversion of 175m of bonds into new shares in January 2015, we believe the Group is in a very good financial position to deliver its substantial pipeline of regeneration projects.
Derwent London had its strongest year of net asset growth todate in 2014.
The increase in net asset value NAV was 705.2m for the year, up by 29.7% from the end of 2013, withatotal return for the year of 30.1%.
This growth was largelydrivenby a combination of favourable letting conditions, demandbeing well in excess of available good-quality office space thereby causing market rental values to rise, and particularly strong investment demand.
The extent of yield movement during 2014, influenced as it is by many external factors, exceeded our expectations.
This fall looks likely to continue into 2015 but our view is that equivalent yields must now be approaching cyclical lows.
Our predictions for London office ERVs in 2014 proved to be more accurate and wecontinue to anticipate further growth to come.
In 2014, the Groups ERV grew by 9.4%, which has further increased our rental reversion.
With lettings from our recent developments, wetherefore saw rental income grow in 2014while keeping firm control of our operating costs, with acorresponding positive impact upon recurring profit, EPS andinterest cover.
As a result, we increased the final dividend by 8.7% giving a total of 39.65p DAMIAN WISNIEWSKI per share for the year.
This represents the seventh successive FINANCE DIRECTOR year of dividend growth since 2007, the year of the merger of Derwent Valley and London Merchant Securities, the average annual growth ratesince then being 8.4%.
Levels of apparent liquidity chasing the London property sectorhave seemed the highest for many years with available cash now seeking debt as well as equity returns.
We have taken advantage of these market conditions by completing 100m of 15 and 20 year US private placement funding in January 2014 and extending our 550m revolving unsecured bank facility in December 2014 to a January 2020 maturity.
The latter included a worthwhile reduction in the margin payable.
As explained later, our 2016 convertible bonds also completed their conversion to new ordinary shares in January 2015 which further strengthens the balance sheet and improves interest cover.

The revaluation surplus and profits from property sales together accounted for 687p 3,600 32 compared to 378p in 2013.
The overall improvement in EPRA NAV per share can be summarised as follows: 2,700 24 2014 2013 p p Revaluation surplus 654 326 1,800 16 Profit on disposals 33 52 EPRA profit after tax 57 54 Dividends paid net of scrip 35 30 900 8 Equity portion relating to issue of convertible bonds 2019 12 Interest rate swap termination costs 2 13 0 0 Dilutive effect of convertible bonds 2016 46 10 Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Non-controlling interest 10 7 Other 7 6 Property portfolio at fair value LTV ratio 644 378 Net assets attributable to equity shareholders A detailed reconciliation of the EPRA NAV to the IFRS NAV is shown in note 38 to the financial statements.
The rapid growth in NAV per share above the 2,222p conversion price for the convertible bonds originally due to mature in 2016 gave rise to a further 46p per share of NAV dilution in 2014 after10p per share in 2013.
As the EPRA NAV per share is a fully diluted measure, there will be no additional impact as EPRA net asset value per share p a direct result of the conversion of the bonds in 2015, though the unamortised issue costs of 1.4m will effectively be written 3,500 offatthe point of conversion.
As they were redeemed in January2015, the bonds were reclassified as current liabilities at the 2014 year end.
With financial markets across much of the global system chasing 33 57 yield and the fear of deflation or continued sluggish growth in 3,050 654 2,908 46 many European markets, there has been a quite extraordinary 35 10 9 movement in the UK 10-year gilt rate over the last year or so.
Atthe end of 2013, the 10-year gilt rate was around 3.0% and expected to rise further but, by the end of 2014, ithad fallen to about 1.8%.
As noted above, this trend has been very positive 2,600 for our property valuations but the fair value adjustments to our debt instruments have naturally moved in the opposite direction.
2,264 Accordingly, we saw a 9.3m or 9p per share increase in the mark-to-market cost of unwinding interest rate swaps taking the balance sheet exposure to 25.2m or 24p per share at the end 2,150 of 2014 compared to 15p per share ayear earlier.
As the swap curve has fallen across its entire time range, the impact upon thefair value of our long-term fixedrate debt liabilities was more marked and increased from 15.2m in 2013 to 78.8m or 76pper share in December 2014.
These adjustments took the Groups EPRA triple NAV per share to 2,800p at 31 December 2014, which represents an increase of 26.0% over the year.
