revenue Group Essar Energy revenue increased by US$2,981.8 million over 2010, reflecting a 42% growth year on year, primarily driven by increased refined product prices and record refinery throughput and production.
Additionally, a full year of operations at the Algoma power plant, commissioned in June 2009, has helped increase power revenues.
revenue power Power revenues improved by US$56.7 million from US$265.1 million in 2009 to US$321.8 million in 2010.
This 21% increase was primarily as a result of a full year of operation of our Algoma power plant, Canada.
Additional revenues were also generated from sales under an ABT, a frequency based pricing mechanism, as well as increased recovery of fixed charges in Bhander under the related power purchase agreement.
The ABT mechanism is an energy policy adopted in India ABT Order dated January 2000 issued by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission based on pricing bulk power across various stakeholders which is designed to bring about more responsibility and accountability in power generation and consumption through a scheme of incentives to regulate generation and usage of power across the grid.
Production and availability from the Companys main operating power plants compared to prior year was as follows: Generation Availability Plant Load Factor MWh % % asset 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Hazira I 515 MW 2,692 2,810 97 97 60 62 Bhander 500 MW 2,515 2,228 99 99 57 51 1 Vadinar 454 440 96 96 75 80 2 Algoma 85 MW 538 235 94 80 82 65 3 total 6,199 5,713 97 97 65 65 1 Vadinar results include Phase 1 of the expansion project from 11 November 2010.
2 Algoma plant commenced operations from 13 June 2009.
3 Percentages shown for availability and plant load factor represent the weighted average of those for all power plants.
Despite strong power plant availability, our generation, whilst overall improved from 2009, was lower than planned due to heavy rains during the monsoon season in India which affected both domestic and agricultural demand.
However, the structure of our power purchase agreements means that the impact of this lower generation on earnings is largely mitigated as payments are primarily based on availability, except those in respect of the Hazira power purchase agreement with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited which are derived on an off-take basis.
company overview business review Governance financial statements Essar Energy plc Annual report accounts 2010 39 revenue exploration and production Production of 9,616 bbls from the CB-ON 3 Mehsana field, Gujarat, contributed US$0.6 million of revenue in the year to 31 December 2010.
A further US$2.6 million was earned by providing Exploration and Production related manpower service to other Essar affiliated companies.
revenue refining and marketing Refining and Marketing revenues increased by US$2,921.9 million, representing a 43% growth, from US$6,758.7 million in 2009 to US$9,680.6 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the following: increased refinery product sale prices of US$2,057.9 million with average price of US$647 mt during 2010 against US$498 mt in 2009: improved sales quantity of refinery products contributing further revenues of US$733.5 million with 13.8 mmt of petroleum product sold in 2010 representing a 12% increase against 12.3 mmt sold in 2009: rise of average selling price of traded products from US$798 mt in 2009 to US$1,039 mt in 2010 resulting in US$79.9 million increase in revenues: crude oil trading revenue of US$120.5 million over 2010 which were not undertaken in 2009: US$72.3 million increase in sales tax benefit mainly due to increase in selling prices and higher quantity of products sold as compared to the prior year: and US$138.1 million reduction in revenues due to a 34% reduction in the quantity of traded products sold.
During 2010, the Vadinar refinery processed 14.7 mmt of crude oil against 13.2 mmt in 2009.
2010 recorded the highest yearly throughput, with the crude distillation unit operating at 140% of its nameplate capacity.
All other refinery units operated well beyond their name plate capacity.
Furthermore, fuel and loss, which is a measure of effectiveness of energy utilisation and loss control by refineries worldwide, improved in 2010 at 5.8% against 6.2% in 2009.
In general, fuel and loss indicates how much fuel we have used for each ton of crude processed.
It is measured as a percentage of crude processed and natural gas consumed.
Lower fuel and loss indicates higher energy efficiency and better control of losses which in turn positively impacts refinery margins.
The Company believes its fuel and loss is one of the lowest amongst Indian refineries.

In Marketing, we have 1,385 operational retail fuel outlets and 250 under construction.
In 2010 we commissioned our first auto-LPG outlet.
Agreements have been signed with Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited, Gas Authority of India Limited and Sabarmati Gas Limited for setting up compressed natural gas facilities in Essar Oil retail fuel outlets across India.
Together with higher production, we had sales of 13.8 mmt in 2010 against 12.3 mmt in 2009.
In 2010, we further consolidated our position in bitumen, having sold 537.8 kt 2009: 111.8 kt of the product, our highest ever.
ebitDa EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and any non-operational items.
Non-operational items include the foreign exchange gain on conversion of the IPO proceeds into US dollars, the profit on available for sale investments and the gain on settlement of liabilities.
The business drivers behind EBITDA are set out in the following section.
ebitDa power Powers EBITDA for 2010 increased by US$57.3 million to US$213.5 million from US$156.2 million in 2009, an increase of 37%.
This was primarily due to a full years operation of the Algoma power plant, sales under ABT and increased fixed charges in Bhander Power under the terms of the power purchase agreement.
Essar Energy plc Annual report accounts 2010 40 financial review continued ebitDa exploration and production Exploration and Production achieved an EBITDA of US$1.1 million in 2010 compared to US$8.0 million loss in 2009 mainly as a result of a reduction in foreign exchange losses as well as revenues derived from the provision of manpower services to other Essar affiliated companies.
ebitDa refining and marketing Refining and Marketing EBITDA for 2010 decreased by US$0.8 million to US$514.7 million from US$515.5 million in 2009.
This was primarily due to improvements in the GRM year on year by US$161.0 million, offset by an increase of US$17.5 million in operating costs, a decrease in traded margin of US$30.0 million, lower foreign exchange gains in 2010 of US$96.0 million and increase in product handling charges of US$14.7 million due to an increase in quantities sold.
refining and marketing cp ebitDa and cp Grm For further understanding of our Refining and Marketing operations we also present its EBITDA on an adjusted internal measure using the CP GRM, as defined below.
CP GRM is not calculated under IFRS, but management believes that this information should be provided as it enables investors to better understand the underlying performance of the Vadinar refinery.
The differences between CP EBITDA and EBITDA for the Refining and Marketing operations are set out in the table below: year ended 31 December US$ million 2010 2009 cp ebitDa excluding sales tax benefit 218.1 145.9 Add sales tax benefit 281.3 212.9 cp ebitDa including sales tax benefit 499.4 358.8 Impact of: Timing differences in pricing domestic products 99.1 112.4 Time lag in crude prices 71.4 173.7 Impact of duty 0.5 Impact of inventory movement 45.5 103.7 Hedging gain 2.0 8.3 ebitDa refining and marketing including sales tax benefit 514.7 515.5 The GRM is calculated as actual sales net of crude costs derived from the accounts.
Inventory gains and losses, hedging gains and losses and sales tax benefit for the period also form part of the GRM.
Based on this method of calculation, Essar Energys GRMs are not directly comparable to the performance of other refiners, other refining benchmarks and industry as further discussed on in Appendix 1 on page 116.
The Refining and Marketing operations results including the impact of sales tax benefit are as follows: year ended 31 December 2010 2009 CP GRM US$ million 708.2 405.6 CP GRM US$ per barrel 6.6 4.2 CP EBITDA US$ million 499.4 358.8 EBITDA US$ million 514.7 515.5 CP GRM has increased from US$4.2 per barrel to US$6.6 per barrel, whilst CP EBITDA including sales tax increased by US$140.6 million from US$358.8 million in 2009 to US$499.4 million in 2010, as a result of additional sales tax benefit due to higher sales in Gujarat and higher underlying product prices.
net finance costs year ended 31 December US$ million 2010 2009 total finance costs 471.7 363.4 Less: borrowing costs capitalised 154.6 62.0 Unwinding of discount 19.5 8.4 finance cost charged to the income statement 336.6 309.8 total finance income 64.2 28.8 Less: interest income capitalised 15.0 2.8 finance income recognised in the income statement 49.2 26.0 net finance costs 287.4 283.8 company overview business review Governance financial statements Essar Energy plc Annual report accounts 2010 41 Net finance costs comprise of US$336.6 million 2009: US$309.8 million of finance costs charged to the income statement and finance income of US$49.2 million 2009: US$26.0 million.
Net finance costs have remained relatively flat year on year with an increase of US$3.6 million as the rise in total finance costs of US$108.3 million mostly negated by an increase in net interest income of US$23.2 million, as a result of interest received on IPO net proceeds, as well as the increase in interest capitalised of US$92.6 million in respect of costs directly attributed to assets under construction.
taxation The income tax charge of US$117.2 million in 2010 comprises current tax of US$30.6 million 2009: US$2.8 million and deferred tax of US$86.6 million 2009: US$76.1 million.
The current tax charge has increased by US$27.8 million primarily due to an increase in profits which are subject to corporate income tax or Minimum Alternative Tax MAT, as appropriate.
The majority of profits derived from companies in India are subject to MAT.
MAT is charged on book profits in India at a rate of 19.93%, but is available as a credit against corporate income tax in the following 10 years.
The deferred tax charge of US$86.6 million 2009: US$76.1 million in 2010 is mainly on account of property, plant and equipment and the impact of unabsorbed depreciation.
The Groups 2010 effective tax rate was 32% compared with the 2009 rate of 28%.
non-operational items Non-operational gains have increased by US$41.2 million to US$61.0 million in the current period compared to US$19.8 million in 2009.
Further non-operational gains in 2010 are largely driven by a foreign exchange gain of US$41.3 million 2009: nil from the conversion of the IPO proceeds into US dollars, profit on sale of available for sale investments of US$11.2 million 2009: nil as part of the reorganisation of the Group prior to IPO, the gain on settlement of liabilities with third party banks of US$10.1 million 2009: nil and a US$19.1 million reduction as a result of one off gains in the prior year relating to surplus on acquisition of a joint controlled entity, Kenya Petroleum Refinery Limited.
profit after tax Profit after tax has increased by US$41.5 million, representing a 20% growth, from US$206.8 million in 2009 to US$248.3 million in 2010 as a result of improvements in the operations as discussed above.
Earnings per share of 17.1 cents in 2010 is broadly in line with the calculated value for 2009 of 17.0 cents per share despite the increase in earnings as the number of shares have increased post IPO.

Essar Energy plc Annual report accounts 2010 42 financial review continued property, plant and equipment power Property, plant and equipment include US$2,856.2 million capitalised in respect of power expansion projects, an increase of US$2,017.8 million against 2009.
Power plants under construction also comprise of the acquisition of the Aries coal mine US$118.0 million in Indonesia, US$155.1 million in respect of the Navabharat Power project including US$50.2 million acquisition consideration and US$29.9 million acquisition of the Mozambique mine.
property, plant and equipment exploration and production A further US$52.8 million of capital expenditure has been recognised in respect of the Raniganj block, the Ratna fields, and various other blocks.
Further, foreign exchange translation differences of US$6.0 million have also increased property, plant and equipment.
There were no impairments of Exploration and Production assets in the period, in line with the prior year.
property, plant and equipment refining and marketing The Vadinar refinery Phase 1 project resulted in additions of US$725.5 million in 2010, with cumulative assets under construction of US$1,338.7 million at 31 December 2010 2009: US$613.2 million.
Additionally, foreign exchange translation differences of US$178.0 million 2009: US$140.0 million have further increased property, plant and equipment as compared to 31 December 2009. other non-current assets Other non-current assets have increased by US$272.4 million year on year primarily as a result of further sales tax assignment liability paid and increased arrangement fees for currently unutilised debt facilities for use on our expansion projects.
Other non-current assets include US$275.1 million 2009: US$121.6 million which reflects sales tax assignment liability paid to a related party.
The related party has committed to discharge the sales tax liability as it falls due in accordance with the sales tax incentive scheme as detailed in Note 28 of the financial statements.
current assets Currents assets have increased by US$1,228.1 million to US$3,363.6 million year on year primarily as result of the following: increase of US$492.3 million and US$221.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets following receipt of IPO funds after partial utilisation to fund expansion projects in 2010: increase of US$330.1 million and US$230.1 million in inventories and trade and other receivables due to an increase in crude oil prices and value of refinery products as well as record throughput in 2010: and US$41.3 million reduction in available for sale investment following the disposal of Essar Steel Limited shares and other investments during 2010 at fair value.
current liabilities Current liabilities reduced by 20% to US$2,772.0 million year on year partly driven by a reclassification of acceptances from short term to long term trade and other payables of US$560.7 million, discussed further below, as well as US$168.9 million reduction in short term borrowings in line with the strategy to secure long term borrowings.
non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities have increased by US$2,536.8 million, representing a 100% increase year on year primarily due to the following: US$560.7 million of acceptances were transferred from current to non-current trade and other payables reflecting a change in maturity where these will be converted to long term rupee facilities on expiry: US$101.9 million increase on the discounted sales tax liability following further sales made in the period: US$1,557.5 million increase in long term borrowings in line with funding requirements in respect of expansion projects, further discussed in the capital and liquidity section below: US$119.6 million rise in deferred tax liabilities driven primarily by the impact of property, plant and equipment as well as unabsorbed depreciation and business combination acquisitions: and US$197.1 million increase in other non-current liabilities including US$136.0 million due to related parties principally in respect of construction works and supply of equipments.

The increase is primarily driven by an increase in profit before tax and increase in operational activity, which has benefited from improved profits from the Power business, record refinery throughput and improved year on year GRM.
Net cash used in investing activities has increased by US$1,972.0 million from US$640.0 million in 2009.
This reflects the Companys investment in its Refining and Power expansion projects and expenditures for Exploration and Production activities.
Additionally interest paid has increased by 35% year on year reflecting the Companys utilisation of available debt facilities to fund expansion projects.
Equity infusion of US$2,442.5 million represents the promoter investments of US$630.2 million in the Power, Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing businesses prior to the Groups formation, and IPO net proceeds of US$1.8 billion.
capital and liquidity During the year, the Group raised equity of US$1.9 billion through its IPO.
Capital of US$717.2 million, US$55.0 million and US$440.0 million was invested in the Power, Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing business segments during the year, respectively.
The surplus cash was invested in high rated liquid funds and bank deposits in line with the Groups financial and risk policy as well as the provision of US$225.0 million of trade advances to the Refining and Marketing businesses for working capital requirements.
The gearing ratio has reduced by 23% year on year largely as a result of an increase in equity and cash and cash equivalents following the IPO.
It is anticipated that the Groups gearing will increase in future periods once further financing is drawn to fund capital expenditure on expansion projects.
During the year, the Group raised project financing of US$4,316.3 million, US$127.9 million and US$252.8 million for the expansion projects of the Power, Exploration and Production and Refining and Marketing business segments, respectively.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had US$750.0 million 2009: US$918.9 million of short term borrowings outstanding.
The majority of the borrowings are for the Power business and are project financing facilities with limited recourse to the Company.
Additionally, the majority of the arranged facilities are in Indian rupees to match the revenue streams for the Power business thereby reducing exchange rate risk.
The Group continues to be able to borrow at competitive rates for working capital and expansion projects.
Post year end, the Group also raised US$550 million through a convertible bond issue which has further strengthened the liquidity position of the Group.
This demonstrates the Groups ability to manage its capital and liquidity position and to capitalise on market opportunities as they arise.
Going concern The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk.
In assessing the Groups going concern status, the Directors have taken account of financial position of the Group, anticipated future trading performance, its bank and other facilities, its capital investment plans, forecast gross refining margins and the likelihood of any material adverse legal judgements.
The IPO in 2010 and our recent convertible bond issue of US$550 million in February 2011 have further strengthened the Groups financial position and ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current available funding.
As set out in Note 27 to the financial statements, the Group believes it has a high likelihood of success in the sales tax litigation but if it were unsuccessful, the Directors are confident that the Group can manage its financial affairs, including securing additional funding and reaching agreement with lenders, so as to ensure that sufficient funding remains available for the next 12 months.
On this basis, after making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2010 accounts.
