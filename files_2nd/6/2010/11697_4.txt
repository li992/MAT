Chief Financial Officers Review In 2010 the Pace business experienced strong revenue and earnings growth alongside three strategically important acquisitions.
The acquisitions enhanced the Groups earnings and market position while also broadening our customer base and technology capabilities.
Our 2010 acquisitions, Bewan Systems SA, 2Wire Inc and Latens Systems Ltd, were all cash transactions funded through cash and debt.
We made significant progress in the operational and cultural integration of the new businesses into the Group, benefiting from our now well-established operating model.
The model, through its scalable systems, and best practice financial and key performance indicators, enables early issue identification and rapid decision making and allows us to manage growth effectively.
To integrate our acquisitions and take full advantage of the new opportunities they have created, we have evolved our Group structure.
The cost of delivering these changes along with the acquisition costs gave rise to a one-off exceptional charge of 19m.
The charge included 5.9m of acquisition transaction costs, 10.3m of post-acquisition restructuring and integration costs and 2.8m for the planned closure of our free-to-air European retail operations.
The investment in restructuring and integration costs will deliver costefficiencies across the Group, including $30m in annual synergies expected from the 2Wire acquisition.
