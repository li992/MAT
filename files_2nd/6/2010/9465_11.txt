Full-year revenue was up 1% on a pro forma basis with Outsourcing Services revenue up 10% on a pro forma basis to 1,601 million.
It now represents 43% of Group revenue 2009: 37%.
The trend in Consulting and Professional Services improved through 2010, with the full-year decline halving from last year to 5% and a fourth quarter decline of only 3%.
Utilisation in Consulting and Professional Services was stable at around 80% through the second half.
Within Consulting and Professional Services, we have established Business Consulting as a separate service line.
At the end of the year, we had around 3,500 employees within Business Consulting, with France, Sweden and Finland our largest consulting businesses.
Utilisation trends have remained stable during the last six months of the year as we added employees to the organisation through the second half.
The balance of our business across sectors continued to be an asset.
A more general trend of growth in the commercial sectors o set slower spending in the Public Sector.
This was particularly marked in the second half of the year in our Northern European geographies with the growth rate across the commercial sectors overall doubling.
This contributed to second half revenue up 2% on last year on a pro forma basis.
Strong performance in Financial Services and TTI against weaker 2009 comparatives o set slowing in other sectors.
The return to growth in Financial Services was particularly strong, up 11% compared to a 20% decline in 2009.
TTI was up 3% in the year compared to a 9% decline the previous year.
New projects signed at the beginning of 2011 in the UK and the slowdown as a result of the extended delay in forming a new government in the Netherlands contributed to the Public Sector underperforming our expectations.
Energy and Utilities and Telecoms both showed declines against strong 2009 comparatives.
France was our most consistent performer through 2010, with revenue up 7% for the year.
Growth in Northern and Central Europe and Sweden accelerated through the second half to end up 7% and 4% for the full year respectively.
All of these segments grew above 7% in the second half.
The Benelux experienced the most signi cant decline but showed a marked improvement in the second half.
UK revenue was slightly weaker than anticipated due to some projects not being signed until the first quarter of 2011.

30 Business review Financial review Adjusted operating pro t before exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles initially recognised on acquisition was 272 million.
Adjusted operating margin was 7.4%, in line with last year.
As expected, the impact of volume and pricing reductions agreed during the first half of 2009 had an impact on the first half margins, which was o set by cost reductions from actions taken in 2009.
The second half saw margins stable or improving with the exception of the Benelux.
The improvement in the French operating margin, due mainly to a change in French tax legislation, was a positive contributor, adding around 20 bps to Group margin.

The reduction is related to the completion of amortisation of some brand names.
While we did not incur any exceptional charges for restructuring in 2010, we recorded an exceptional charge of 2 million in relation to our disposal of the payroll business in the Benelux.
This compares to exceptional charges of 117 million in 2009, mainly related to restructuring incurred as part of the Programme for Growth.

Business Process Outsourcing BPO also grew signi cantly, up 6%.
Infrastructure Management IM was broadly stable, accounting for 40% of outsourcing revenue.
AM also accounted for the majority of our new orders in the first half of the year, with orders in this part of Outsourcing Services up 2%.
We continually work to maintain our market leading share of the European applications management market and have identi ed a number of areas which we expect to drive further demand in this market, such as security management of applications placed on the cloud, mobile application management and globally blended shared services combining skills from both onshore and o shore regions.
Our Outsourcing order backlog was 2.3 billion at the end of 2010, with orders of 1.8 billion added in the year, on the back of strong demand across most geographies.
Signi cant contracts with Shell, the UKs Serious Organised Crime Agency and an important client in the Netherlands with a total value of over 475 million have also been added since the end of 2010.

Revenue was up 7% on a pro forma basis to 810 million.
Our French business has been the most consistent performer across Logica in 2010 growing above the market on the back of strong client relationships.
Despite a stronger comparative in the fourth quarter of 2009, revenue growth remained strong through the second half.
Our largest sectors, Financial Services and TTI, drove growth.
Among our smaller sectors, the fastest growing was the Public Sector, which was up 19% driven by the rollout of tax and payroll programmes for the Ministry of Finance.
Energy and Utilities slowed on the back of a strong comparative and ahead of regulatory changes which should drive revenue growth in 2011.
Outsourcing revenue grew to 43% of total revenue as we undertook new contracts in a number of sectors including in the Public Sector.
Adjusted operating pro t was 68 million.
Margin at 8.4% bene ted from the change in tax legislation from the beginning of 2010 which added around 110 bps to our reported margin, as well as strong utilisation and previous cost base reductions.
The business is actively recruiting to lower the level of subcontractors taken on to respond to rapid growth in this business in 2010.
We had a good second half order intake and have a good pipeline for 2011, driven by the increase in outsourcing activity.

Revenue was up 7% on a pro forma basis to 788 million with a good performance across most geographies.
We saw an acceleration through the second half with revenue up 10%.
Finland was the best performing country, with revenue up 11% driven by an increase from Outsourcing contracts signed in 2010.
Revenue growth in our second largest country, Germany, was also strong, as it bene ted from earlier investments and general strengthening across the economy.
Denmark grew quickly from a smaller base as a result of the Posten Norden contract signed in early 2010.
Despite di ering patterns across clients and geographies, we saw solid revenue performance in our two largest sectors, TTI and the Public Sector.
As in our other geographies, Financial Services recovered strongly in 2010 and particularly so in Germany, where we were named a preferred supplier to a major Financial Services client.
Second half growth was driven by the Telecoms sector under new contracts with major clients in Finland.
Adjusted operating pro t was 61 million, which resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 7.8%.
Cost reductions and good utilisation o set the impact of pricing pressure in the first half.
Book to bill for the period was 114% 2009: 110%.
Order growth of 11% was driven by new contracts across the region and improving market positioning in Germany where we signed new Outsourcing contracts.
This included a five-year contract with ArcelorMittal Bremen, signed at the end of 2010.
This new deal will see Logica provide application management and infrastructure services for business applications ensuring our clients business bene ts from service continuity and increased cost exibility.

Revenue in the UK business was down 5% on a pro forma basis to 709 million.
This was 2% below our previous guidance and a result of the delay of contracts which slipped into 2011, combined with weaker billing than we had expected across public and commercial sectors at the end of 2010.
Public Sector revenue was down 6% as a result of expected weakness following the election.
Although there was good growth in Energy and Utilities and Financial Services, overall revenue in the commercial sectors declined.
This was mainly due to weakness in Telecoms against a strong 2009 comparative, when the sector was up 57%.
Adjusted operating pro t was 60 million 2009: 64 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 8.5%.
We are recruiting to refresh our skills base in a stronger employment market and working to improve utilisation.
With the 157 million Serious Organised Crime Agency SOCA contract not being signed until early 2011, the book to bill was 78%.
We expect the UK business to be growing as we exit 2011.
The recovery will be second half weighted with the rollout of major contracts with SOCA and Shell and will be dependent on the pace of public sector spending decisions.
Underpinning our confidence is an increase in demand in the commercial sectors, notably in Energy and Utilities and in Financial Services.

Revenue was 566 million, up 4% for the year on a pro forma basis.
Revenue momentum was second half weighted, with second half revenue up 7% on the back of a weak comparative in 2009.
With the exception of the Public Sector, revenue improved in all sectors as a result of new Outsourcing contract wins.
Our contract with Posten Norden drove TTI revenue in the second half.
We began to deliver to Skandia in the Financial Services sector, while contracts with large clients like TeliaSonera drove growth in Telecoms.
Activity in the Public Sector remained slow as a result of reduced spending and the completion of the final stage of a contract in the education sector.
Outsourcing will continue to drive growth in 2011 and we have been recruiting to help resource these Outsourcing deals.
Outsourcing now represents 60% of revenue with strong growth in 2010 due to a number of new contracts including Posten Norden.
Adjusted operating pro t was 38 million.
The decline in adjusted operating margin to 6.7% was due to a weaker first half margin on the back of pricing reductions agreed in 2009 and the phasing of pro t as we rolled out new contracts in the second half.
Improved utilisation rates and realignment of our cost base as we have come through 2010 have started to o set this.
As market sentiment has improved, we have been successful in winning new business in a competitive market.
We have good order backlog for 2011, helped by new contract wins at Lantmnnen, Scan and Posten Norden in 2010.

Revenue was down 10% on a pro forma basis to 488 million.
As anticipated, the rate of revenue decline continued to slow during the second half.
Revenue was down 4% in the second half, compared to a 15% drop in the first half.
Stable pricing levels and a continuing positive trend in Financial Services, where revenue was up 7% versus a decline of 31% in 2009, drove the second half improvement.
Performance of Public Sector in the second half has been slower than we anticipated due to the delay in forming a government.
Outside Financial Services, clients remain cautious, focused on cost cutting with investment decisions being carefully considered.
Adjusted operating pro t was 14 million 2009: 23 million.
Adjusted operating margin was 2.9% 2009: 4.3% and included a 5 million charge related to projects in the second half.
Utilisation was around 75%, compared to the low 70s at the end of 2009.
Following a change in management, we have put in place plans for driving further e ciencies through the organisation.
The most signi cant indication of the improving market in the Benelux was a book to bill of 107% 2009: 93%.

Returns to shareholders 4.2p 9.0% FY dividend 2009 Return on capital 2009: 3.3p 2009: 9.0% The Boards policy is to ensure that the progress we have made in improving the performance of the business over the last three years delivers a real return to shareholders which ows through our dividend policy, while continuing to provide su cient funds to invest in future growth.
As a result, the Board has recommended a steady increase in the dividend payout ratio from 2009 levels of 28% to at least 40% by 2012.
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 2.3p 2009: 2.3p to be paid on 5 May 2011 to eligible shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 April 2011.
This would take the full year dividend to 4.2p 2009: 3.3p, which represents a payout of around a third of adjusted EPS of 12.3p and a 27% increase in the full year dividend over last year.
Our return on capital ROCE was 9%, in line with last year and our cost of capital.
