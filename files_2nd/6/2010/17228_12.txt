Key judgements & assumptions Judgements and assumptions made in the financial statements are continually reviewed.
Whilst some outcomes have been affected by the volatility in the financial markets, all judgements and assumptions in the accounting policies remain consistent with previous years.
Consideration of impairment to the carrying values of assets has been made and we concluded that the individual carrying values of stores and other operating assets are supportable either by value in use or market values.
The impact of the current economic conditions on the assessment of going concern has been considered in the general information section of the Directors report.
Provisions Property provisions decreased by 12m from 112m last year note 22 of the Group financial statements.
The decrease is primarily a release in the onerous lease provision.
The release was for a store we have re-opened as it fits well with our new smaller stores format and for a number of tenants lease breakpoints being passed resulting in a continuing commitment from the tenant to continue the leases.
A small charge has been made in the year as a result of the difficult conditions in the property market.
