financial review The Group enters 2011 with US$41.4 million net cash having repaid US$88.8 million of Stratic debt in November 2010: as well as strong ongoing operating cash flows from its existing portfolio of assets and a US$280.0 million bank facility, of which US$206.0 million is undrawn and available for development activities and acquisition opportunities.
Income Statement Production and revenue Production levels, on a working interest basis, for the pro-forma 12 months to 31 December 2010 averaged 21,074 Boepd, up 55% compared with 2009.
The increase primarily reflects improved production from Don Southwest and West Don fields, which commenced first production in June 2009 and April 2009 respectively, and incremental production from West Don field as a result of the Stratic acquisition.
Thistle field production also increased due to well A46 being brought back onstream and sustained high levels of power system uptime.
Saleable production was approximately 4% lower than the export meter production volumes quoted above primarily as a result of Jonathan Swinney the partial decommissioning of the Chief Financial Officer LPG processing plant during 2010, resulting in additional volume adjustments being applied by the Economic environment Sullom Voe Terminal operator.

prices and the acquisition of Stratic in November 2010.
The increase of US$4.1 per Boe in the Groups average pro-forma depletion expense is also mainly due to the impact of the increase in Don Southwest production compared with the previous year as the Don fields carry a significantly higher depletion rate per barrel compared with the Heather, Thistle and Broom fields.
