The strength of our business model and our ability to work in partnership with our customers to deliver shared efficiencies has proved beneficial.
For the Group as a whole whilst revenue remained at a similar level to last year at 1.9 billion 2009: 1.9 billion the continuing strength of our Marine division and growth from a full years contribution from the RSME contract in the Defence division have mitigated the adverse impact of weaker market conditions for the Engineering and Plant division in South Africa and the re-focusing of the Rail division.
Our increasing involvement in long-term contracts and through-life solutions for customers is enabling us to deliver and share in efficiency gains.
In addition, our focus on delivering increasingly complex engineering support across the Group has supported the strong profit growth with operating profit increasing by 11%.
Focused on maintaining a secure financial position.
