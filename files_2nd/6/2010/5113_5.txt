This investment in the network has resulted in increased revenue yields and profitability despite the backdrop of a recessionary economic environment across Europe.
Total revenue grew 11.5% to 2,973.1 million and reported profit beforetax was 154.0 million or 2.75 per seat 2009: 54.7 million or 1.04 per seat.
