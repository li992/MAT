This has been driven largely by the strong cyclical recovery in the television advertising market and ITVs outperformance of that market.
Despite this cyclical recovery, ITV has maintained its focus on cost control and cash management.
Costs have been reduced and increased revenues have been effectively converted into increased profits.
The continued focus on cash management, alongside improved profits, has led to a significant reduction in net debt.
ITV is now in a substantially stronger financial position than two years ago, but this does not External revenue versus 2009 m disguise the ongoing challenges that the business faces.
2,200 The following review is focused on adjusted results as, in managements view, these show 22 42 more meaningfully the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and 205 2,100 2,064 reflect how the business is managed and measured on a daily basis.
We have also restructured the notes to the accounts, to present a clearer view of our financial performance and financial position as at 31 December 2010.
2,000 External revenue and EBITA before exceptional items Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2010 was 10% higher at 2,064 million 1,879 1,900 2009: 1,879 million.
The improvement in Net Advertising Revenue NAR, driven by the strong television advertising market, has been partially offset by a 13% reduction in external revenue in ITV Studios, mainly from international productions.
1,800 2009 NAR Other revenue ITV Studios 2010 29 Overview Strategy & operations Performance & financials Responsibility Governance Financial statements The increase in NAR is the principal reason that EBITA before exceptional items more than EBITA before exceptional items versus 2009 m doubled to 408 million 2009: 202 million.
Cost savings of 60 million have been made 60 19 500 17 23 40 million of efficiency savings and 20 million from the reduction in the licence fee 408 205 which further boosted profitability, but these have been offset by increased schedule costs, 400 increased transmission costs to support the launch of the HD channels and YouView, and reduced ITV Studios profits.
300 The improved EBITA before exceptional items has driven the increase in adjusted EPS 202 to 6.4p 2009: 1.8p.
200 Net debt 100 Cash management has remained a key focus in 2010, with net debt reducing from 612 million at 31 December 2009 to 188 million at 31 December 2010.
0 Adjusted cash flow of 517 million 2009: 345 million has increased this year not only as a result of improved profits but also from another year of strong profit to cash conversion.
The continued focus on cash resulted in a profit to cash ratio in 2010 of 127% 2009: 171% as we continued to reduce our stock levels and manage working capital tightly.
Aside from adjusted cash flow, 69 million was raised from the sale of Friends Reunited and Screenvision US.
The cash costs of operating exceptional items in 2010 mainly relate to items provided for in previous years, such as the cash costs which underpin the efficiency savings Net debt versus 2009 m delivered over the past two years.
The return to corporation tax payments in 2010 is a 800 consequence of improved profitability.

The television advertising market was up 15% in the year and ITV has outperformed the market once again with ITV Family revenue up 16%.
ITVs share of broadcast, at 45.1%, was up 0.4 share points on last year.
Of the 205 million increase in total ITV NAR, the improvement in the television advertising market accounted for 191 million and the increase in ITVs share is worth 14 million.
ITV has outperformed the television advertising market for the past three years, as we continue to deliver the big audiences and brands that are most demanded by our advertisers.
This market outperformance was achieved despite a 5% decline in ITV1 SOCI in 2009 compared to 2008: under the Contract Rights Renewal remedy, advertisers are entitled to reduce their advertising share commitment to ITV1 in proportion to the decline in ITV1s SOCI in the previous year.

Television advertising, however, continues to offer value for money given its reach and rebalancing the business 2010 has seen television take share from other media.
Over the year, the total radio advertising market grew by 4%, internet by 11%, and press declined by 1%: these all away from its reliance compare to television, which grew by 15%.
on television advertising Broadcast sponsorship income was broadly flat at 60 million 2009: 59 million.
Although revenues closely related to advertising, sponsorship tends to be committed under longer term contracts which can mitigate the impact of short-term movements in the advertising market.
Minority revenues comprise ITV Network programme sales to Channel 3 licences not owned by ITV STV, UTV & Channel.
These revenues increased by 7 million to 54 million 2009: 47 million due to the higher network programme budget, and fewer programmes being subject to an opt out claim than in 2009.
SDN, which operates one of the six digital terrestrial multiplex licences in the UK that make up Freeview, grew external revenues by 3 million to 43 million 2009: 40 million.
In 2010 SDN agreed three new contracts, including the multi videostream deal with Channel 5.
As a result of these new contracts we expect to continue to grow revenues from the SDN business in 2011.
com revenues, excluding Friends Reunited, were up 17% compared to last year, albeit off a low base.
Unique users were up 17% and video views up 9%, with long form viewing, which is more valuable to advertisers, making up an increased proportion of total video views.
This, combined with the strong online advertising market, resulted in the increase in itv.
Media sales, PRS and other income has grown and includes premium rate telephony services, airtime sales on behalf of third parties, interactive transactions associated with ITV and our first steps into pay television.
Total ITV schedule costs increased by 17 million in 2010 to 1,023 million 2009: 1,006 million.
The increase is principally due to the inclusion of the football World Cup.
Other Broadcasting & Online costs of 421 million 2009: 426 million include industry and regulatory costs, as well as staff and overhead costs.
The year-on-year decline is mainly from the delivery of cost savings and lower licence fees.
There has been an increase in transmission costs, mainly due to the launch of the HD channels and costs associated with YouView.
A review of Channel 3 licence fees resulted in a 20 million saving as Ofcom recognised the cost of delivering public service obligations such as news and current affairs and adjusted the regional broadcasting licence fees accordingly.

ITV Studios creative content pipeline has depleted over time which, coupled with an environment where broadcasters are taking less risk with new content and budgets are still relatively tight, has impacted ITVs ability to sell programmes both in the UK and internationally.
This highlights the need for creative renewal.
UK production and resources external revenue for other UK broadcasters has decreased by 10% to 64 million 2009: 71 million, and the number of external hours produced have also reduced by 10%.
Programmes such as The Street and Animal Cops did not return, but these were partially offset by the growth of programmes such as Coach Trip and Four Weddings.
International production revenues reduced by 23% to 106 million 2009: 138 million.
This was largely driven by Im A Celebrity where there has not been any production in 2010 in the USA, Germany or Sweden: nothing of scale replaced these.
This is reflected in the total number of hours produced internationally which reduced by 11% in 2010 compared to 2009.
Distribution and exploitation sales were down by 2% to 123 million 2009: 126 million.
Television sales revenues held up well on the back of strong drama sales, but were offset by lower co-production revenues.
Home Entertainment revenues, primarily DVD, remain under pressure, particularly in the UK.
Original supply to ITV channels is not included in reported ITV plc consolidated revenue as it represents an internal programming cost of sale.
This internal supply is broadly flat at 261 million 2009: 262 million as programmes delivered in 2009 such as Heartbeat and The Royal did not recur, but there were new programmes such as Popstar to Opera Star and The Chase in 2010.
ITV Studios cost base has reduced by 33 million to 473 million 2009: 506 million.
Most of the costs in the production business are variable and linked to revenue.
The fixed costs have been reduced as part of the ongoing challenge to the cost base and those savings have helped maintain overall margins of 15%.

These include 17 million of reorganisation and restructuring costs in relation to cost savings that have been delivered.
There was a 7 million credit to onerous property provisions following the successful subletting of some excess space and consolidation of London offices.
The pension exceptional credit relates to pension scheme initiatives undertaken in the year to reduce the pension liability.
Further details are included in section 3.6 of the financial statements.

Cash-related net financing income remains low, despite the increasing cash balances, as most of the cash reserves are held on short-term deposit with low interest rates.
Amortisation of bonds is non-cash in the short term but will result in a cash payment on settlement.
This principally relates to the 2014 Eurobond, 2015 Bond tap and 2016 Convertible Bond.
Adjusted financing costs are used to reflect the controllable interest costs of ITVs net debt.
The principal differences between the reported net financing costs and adjusted financing costs relate to mark-to-market movements on swaps and foreign exchange on bonds, which are volatile and unrealised within the year, and the imputed pension interest.
The 5 million gain 2009: 7 million charge relating to mark-to-market on swaps and foreign exchange on bonds is as a result of decreases in the implied interest rates at 31 December 2010 compared to 31 December 2009.
Other net financing income includes the unwind of the amortised cost adjustment as described in note 4.1 and the net losses from bond buy-backs.
33 Overview Strategy & operations Performance & financials Responsibility Governance Financial statements Tax The adjusted tax rate of The total reported tax charge of 16 million 2009: credit of 69 million results in an 23% is expected to remain effective tax rate significantly lower than the statutory rate of tax.
This is primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset of 68 million in respect of tax losses not previously at, or close to, this level for recognised.
The deferred tax asset is being recognised as the Group is making sufficient at least the next two years taxable profits to be able to utilise these brought forward tax losses.
Corporation tax paid during the year of 23 million arises as a result of the return to profitability of the Group during the year, partially offset by utilisation of tax losses and pension contributions.
The significant initiatives made towards addressing the pension deficit have resulted in tax relief for the Group.
Taking the brought forward losses and pension relief into account the Group should pay a relatively low level of cash tax compared to the statutory charge over the next two to three years.
The timing of these deductions does not effect the statutory tax charge due to the deferred tax impact, which is recognised in full in the year.
The adjusted tax rate for adjusted profits is lower than the standard tax rate as the utilisation of losses is in excess of normal disallowable costs: 2010 2009 m m Profit before tax as reported 286 25 Operating exceptional items net 19 53 Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets 48 51 Non-operating exceptional items 73 Adjustments to net financing costs 6 12 Adjusted profit before tax 321 108 2010 2009 m m Tax charge credit as reported 16 69 Net charge for exceptional and other items 5 21 Credit in respect of amortisation and impairment of intangible assets 13 14 Credit in respect of adjustments to net financing costs 2 3 Credit in respect of prior period items 82 Other tax adjustments 47 26 Adjusted tax charge 73 35 Adjusted rate of tax 23% 32% Amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations.
The purpose of presenting an adjusted tax charge is to more closely reflect the expected cash tax in respect of the current years profit before tax.
The Group adjusts its reported tax charge for exceptional items and material or non-recurring items, including amortisation of intangibles, adjustments to net financing costs and certain tax adjustments.
In 2010 the other adjustments of 47 million primarily represents the deferred tax benefit of tax losses available for use in future years.
These losses are expected to be utilised over the next two to three years and as a result the adjusted tax rate in that period is expected to be lower than the statutory rate.

35 Overview Strategy & operations Performance & financials Responsibility Governance Financial statements Cash flow, working capital management and net debt Cash flow and working capital management With profits and cash flows overly dependent on the volatile television advertising market, it is important that ITV manages its cash and working capital tightly.
2010 was another good year in this regard, with 127% profit to cash conversion being delivered, well ahead of our benchmark of 90% over a rolling three-year period.
It will be difficult to repeat this level of profit to cash conversion in 2011, primarily because our capital expenditure is rising and programme rights and other inventory are now reduced to more normalised levels.

2009 has been restated to include cash spend on the acquisition of intangible assets, since this is core to supporting the operations of the business.
Liquidity risk Maturity profile at 31 December 2010 m The Group has a high degree of operational gearing and is exposed to the economic cycle.
400 Between 2005 and 2009 ITVs profitability declined as the economy weakened and volatile television advertising revenues fell.
This resulted in a lowering of ITVs credit ratings by Standard & Poors, Fitch and Moodys respectively from investment grade BBBBBBBaa3 300 to sub investment grade B BBB1.
However, with the upturn in television advertising revenues in 2010 combined with good cash and cost control, these pressures have been 200 partially eased.
Although still sub investment grade, in May 2010 Standard & Poors revised ITVs credit ratings outlook from Negative to Stable B and then put it on credit watch positive in January 2011.
In August 2010 Fitch and Moodys both increased ITVs credit 100 ratings by one notch to BB and Ba3 respectively.
Funding 0 ITV is aware of the perceived inefficiency of holding 860 million of cash and cash equivalents and over 1 billion of gross debt, but it is important to note the speed at which the net Convertible bond debt has reduced over the past two years.
The extent of decline of the television advertising market in 2008 and 2009, and then the subsequent recovery in 2010, was unexpected.
This recovery, combined with tight cash control, has allowed net debt to reduce significantly over two years from 730 million at 31 December 2008 to 188 million at 31 December 2010.
In addition to net debt of 188 million at 31 December 2010, the Group also has an IAS 19 Pension Deficit of 313 million.
In 2010 ITV bought back 63 million 54 million nominal of the 2011 bonds, 42 million nominal of 2015 bonds and repaid the 50 million May 2013 loan.
As at 31 December 2010, ITVs net sterling position after the impact of cross currency swaps against the remaining 54 million 2011 Eurobond is a receivable of 16 million.
This receivable has arisen due to large positive swap values arising from favourable currency movements: when ITV exchanged or bought back these series of bonds it was more efficient to enter into new swaps to protect this position rather than terminate existing swaps.
In October 2010 ITV increased the size of its undrawn, covenant free bilateral bank facility secured on advertising receivables from 75 million to 125 million and the maturity of this facility was extended from March 2013 to September 2015.

At 31 December 2010 ITV had 860 million of cash and cash equivalents.
This figure includes 89 million of cash equivalents whose use is restricted to finance lease commitments and unfunded pension commitments.
Cash and cash equivalents also include 47 million held principally in overseas and part owned subsidiaries.
As explained above, steps have been taken to repurchase some of the more expensive debt.
The remaining debt now held is not expensive given our credit rating at an average gross cost of debt of 7%, is an appropriate mix of medium to long-term debt and has no financial covenants.
As ITV drives forward the Transformation Plan it is also important that some flexibility is maintained to invest in the business.
Pensions Reducing pension risk and uncertainty As part of the long-term strategy to manage the risks and uncertainties associated with the pension schemes, the Group has continued to implement a programme of measures to manage the cost and risks of providing the defined benefit arrangements and to provide greater security for the benefits that members have built up.
During 2010, ITV implemented two initiatives to reduce these risks, resulting in a 28 million income statement gain.
With effect from 1 April 2010, ITV is offering all new pensioners the opportunity to uplift part of their pension in return for giving up rights to annual increases on that part of their pension.
Additionally, the offer was extended to existing pensioners who retired after the initial offer was made in 2009.
The level of member acceptance resulted in a past service credit of 27 million over 2010, reflecting the reduction in the liabilities due to the option being accepted by these pensioners and the expected take-up of this option in the future.
In addition, the Group carried out an enhanced transfer value ETV programme aimed at reducing the liabilities in respect of the deferred pensioner population.
This resulted in a net settlement gain of 1 million, reflecting the difference between the liabilities removed and the ETV paid.
IAS 19 Detailed analysis of the Groups pension schemes, including timing of actuarial valuations, IAS 19 pension deficit versus 2009 m are included in note 3.6 of the financial statements.
600 80 147 The Groups defined contribution schemes gave rise to an operating charge in 2010 of 500 436 6 million 2009: 4 million.
28 400 28 The aggregate IAS 19 deficit on defined benefit schemes at 31 December 2010 was 313 million 313 2009: 436 million.
This decrease was driven by an increase in the value of the scheme 300 assets, the benefits from the actions taken in the year as set out above and the reduction in liabilities due to the Governments decision to link statutory pension increases to the 200 Consumer Price Index rather than the Retail Price Index.
This was offset in part by a decrease in the discount rate applied to liabilities.

The Partnership owns SDN Limited and the Group has contributed an interest of measures to manage in the Partnership worth 124 million to the main section of the Scheme.
The Group retains control, and continues to consolidate the revenue and cashflow, of the Partnership and SDN.
the cost and risks of Under the Partnership arrangements, the Group has committed to making a payment providing the defined to the main section of the Scheme of up to 150 million in 2022, if and to the extent that it benefit arrangements remains in deficit.
In addition, the Partnership will make an annual distribution of 8 million to the Scheme for 12 years from 2011.
The Partnerships interest in SDN will provide collateral for these payments.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership reduces the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement does not impact the deficit on an IAS 19 basis, as it is not an asset controlled by the Scheme.
The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit has been adjusted to reflect this transaction see note 2.3 in the financial statements.
Deficit funding The Group has agreed with the Trustee the level of contributions to the main section of the ITV Pension Scheme through to 2014.
From 2011 the Group will make deficit funding contributions of 35 million per annum.
From 2012 the Groups annual contribution will be increased by 5 million, unless during the previous year the Group implemented initiatives which reduce the Schemes deficit by at least 10 million, compared with the level absent such initiatives.
In addition from 2012, if the Groups reported EBITA before exceptional items exceeds 300 million in the previous year, the Group will increase this contribution by an amount representing 10% of EBITA before exceptional items over this threshold level.
These arrangements supersede the Groups previous commitment to make annual contributions of 30 million per annum through to 2013.
Further deficit contributions of 8 million will commence from 2011 as a result of the SDN partnership, as described above.
Assuming no unforeseen circumstances, no further change is currently expected in ITVs committed contributions to the main section of the Scheme before 2015.
The triennial valuation, as at 1 January 2010, of the two smaller sections of the defined benefit pension scheme, sections B and C, is in progress.
Trustees investment strategy The Trustees continue to review the investment strategy for the main defined benefit pension scheme.
The asset allocation of the main section of the Scheme as at 31 December 2010 was broadly that 47% of the assets were invested in equity, property and other return seeking assets, and 53% were invested in bonds and other liability-matching investments.
The Trustees also use derivative instruments to hedge partial exposures to movements in interest rates, inflation and foreign exchange rates.
