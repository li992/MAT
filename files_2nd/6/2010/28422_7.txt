In particular it excludes the value of the shareholders interest in the estate.
All amounts have been translated at year end exchange rates.

Other items represents the impact of the time value of options and guarantees on new business, foreign exchange effects and other nonmodelled items.
Foreign exchange effects arise as EEV new business profit amounts are translated at average exchange rates and expected free surplus generation uses year end closing rates.
In recent years, our strategic focus on capital conservation and value optimisation has enabled us to transform the free surplus generation prole of the Group.
The undiscounted in-force free surplus generation ability of the Group is now significant, with all businesses contributing material amounts.
Our disciplined approach to writing low strain, high return, short payback new business, produces an expected free surplus generation prole with sizeable free surplus releases in the early years, thereby ensuring that the initial investment is paid back quickly and incremental profits are earned thereafter.
The combination of the long-term business in-force releases depicted in the previous tables, coupled with asset management profits, returns on excess assets together with the impact of future new business, reinforces our confidence that we remain on track to deliver a cumulative net free surplus after new business investment of 6.5 billion in the 2010 to 2013 period.
