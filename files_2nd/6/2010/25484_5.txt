16.0 pence In terms of the contracts constituting the DLC structure, Investec plc and Investec Limited effectively form a single economic enterprise in which the economic and voting rights of ordinary shareholders of the companies are maintained in equilibrium relative to each other.
The directors of the two companies consider that for financial reporting purposes, the fairest presentation is achieved by combining the results and financial position of both companies.
Customer deposits Accordingly, the year end results for Investec plc and Investec Limited present the results up 50.5% to and financial position of the combined DLC group under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, denominated in Pounds Sterling.
21.9 billion All references in this document to Investec or the group relate to the combined DLC group comprising Investec plc and Investec Limited.
Exchange rates Third party assets under Our reporting currency is Pounds Sterling.
Certain of our operations are conducted by management entities outside the UK.
The results of operations and the financial condition of our individual companies are reported in the local currencies of the countries in which they are domiciled, up 51.9% to including Rands, Australian Dollars, Euros and US Dollars.
These results are then translated into Pounds Sterling at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our 74.2 billion combined consolidated financial results.
In the case of the income statement, the weighted average rate for the relevant period is applied and, in the case of the balance sheet, the relevant closing rate is used.

signs of recovery, After six consecutive falls in output, accounting for a drop of 6% of GDP, the economy expanded by 0.4% in Q4 2009 and 0.3% in Q1 2010.
The economy contracted by 3.7% however, operating in the 2009 2010 financial year.
While Q1 2010 looks adversely affected by heavy snowfall, fundamentals remain independent surveys point to a faster pace of expansion than officially recorded, suggesting that economic recovery may have started earlier in the UK.
The course of this year has mixed with activity seen some encouraging developments: unemployment started to fall sooner than we had hoped and deterioration in public finances was less than government had forecast: both levels below historic developments point to stronger economic activity.
trends Yet the public deficit still hit a hefty 11.1% of GDP and it became a central election issue.
The MPC extended its process of quantitative easing across the financial year creating money in exchange for mainly government bonds from a proposed 75 billion in March 2009 to 200 billion, purchases that it completed in January 2010.
Since then the committee has become increasingly fretful of a more persistent rate of CPI inflation, which stood at 3.4% at the end of 2009 2010.
Eurozone The Eurozone economy emerged from recession in Q3 2009, expanding by 0.4% in Q3, but posting softer growth in subsequent quarters.
The larger economies of Germany and France led this expansion, posting growth of 0.4% and 0.3% respectively in Q2, both benefiting from international car scrappage schemes and Germany particularly lifted by a revival in world trade and exports to the Far East and China specifically.
Growth softened to 0.1% in Q4 and 0.2% in Q1 2010, although survey evidence has suggested a quickening of growth thereafter.
Yet the Eurozone has become embroiled in a government debt crisis that began in October when the new Greek government revealed significant discrepancies in its national accounts, making it the Eurozones most indebted nation.
Greek financing costs rose gradually from here, but the increase accelerated in 2010.
A bungled bail-out proposal, impeded by a German government facing a key election, added to market uncertainty and while Greek debt costs soared towards the financial year end there were some signs of worries spilling into other Eurozone economies including Portugal, Ireland and Spain.
The European Central Bank, which had been slower to react to economic slowdown than other international central banks, started this financial year still cutting its key refinancing rate to 1.00%.
It then announced a series of technical measures in April 2009 that drove overnight interest rates to hover around 0.35% from July 2009 to the end of March 2010.
Australia The Australian economy rebounded from just one quarters contraction in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse, but has expanded consistently since then, posting an average quarterly growth rate of 0.7% across 2009 2010 to see annual GDP 1.8% higher.
Yet this still sub-trend pace of expansion coincided with a rise in unemployment, which reached a peak of 5.8% in Q3 2009, before easing back to 5.4% by the years close.
The economy benefited from the recovery in Asian markets and exports provided a lift to the economy in the first half of 2009.
However, this year has seen momentum spread into domestic demand, with Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 30 household spending posting solid increases.
The Reserve Bank of Australia RBA was still easing monetary policy at the start of the financial year and cut its key cash rate to 3.0% in April 2009.
Yet the spread of recovery into the domestic economy led the RBA to withdraw some of this stimulus and rates began to rise in August 2009, taking rates to 4.0% by year end.
11 United States The US economy started expanding again this year.
Q2 2009 posted the fourth consecutive quarterly contraction, reducing GDP by 3.8% from its peak.
Q3 saw the economy begin to grow again, expanding by 2.2% annualised.
This was followed by increases of 5.6% and 3.0% in the subsequent quarters, although these figures were boosted by the inventory cycle and growth averaged just 1.3% per quarter excluding this effect.
The arbiter of the US economic cycle, the National Bureau of Economic Research, is yet to declare an end to the recession, but the quarterly pattern of growth suggests that this has indeed happened.
The economic downturn also led to a disproportionately aggressive labour market response, with dramatically reduced headcount.
This boosted labour productivity, which should bode well for employment trends ahead.
Indeed payrolls started to rise again towards the end of the period under review.
But pay growth remains subdued and is contributing to a still softening rate of core inflation.
The Federal Reserve remains cautious over the economic outlook, and closed all but one of its special operations to support financial markets as conditions improved during 2009 2010.
It also completed its credit easing purchases.
The Federal Reserve maintained its commitment to leave rates exceptionally low for an extended period although, since the start of 2010, one member has moved to drop this commitment.
Overall the Fed now oversees an economy with a modest growth outlook, not one facing another depression.
South Africa South Africas general elections took place in April 2009, with the ANC retaining majority but resulting in a switch in leaders from acting President Kgalema Motlhanthe to South Africas current leader, President Jacob Zuma.
Despite unfounded fears that the leader of the ANC would alter economic policies once he gained the presidency, President Zuma proved not only to steer a steady course, but has soothed many opposing sectors while simultaneously providing both policy continuity and improved workings of monetary and fiscal operations.
Draft work on current policies, from industrial to education, is aimed at setting South Africa on a higher growth and employment path, one which is achievable given the relatively robust way the country has weathered the international credit crisis.
While South Africa did slip into recession at the end of 2008, which bottomed in the first quarter of 2009, the contraction only lasted three quarters.
With quarterly growth of 0.8% at the end of 2009, South Africa is expected to see an improved growth outcome this year, with 2010 averaging 2.7%, and the 2011 forecast running at 3.6%.
In addition, the expectation of a fiscal deficit of 7.3% of GDP for 2009 2010 has been revised to 6.8% of GDP, due to improved revenue collection and subdued expenditure.
The fiscal deficit was expected at 6.2% for 2010 2011 but this is likely to be revised closer to 5% as the economy grows at a faster pace than Treasury expected.
Key is that South Africa itself did not experience a banking crisis due to the well regulated nature of the industry, aided by exchange controls and substantial bank supervision, which prevented any contagion.
Instead, South Africa was afflicted by the fact that the international credit crises morphed into a global recession, decimating export markets and causing 8% of the workforce to become unemployed.
The institution of the NCA National Credit Act mid 2008 limited consumer indebtedness at the peak of the boom, but did not prevent the private sector from reaching a heady household debt to disposable income ratio of 80% in 2009, well up from 60% in 2005.
The previous cumulative 5% hike in interest rates, beginning mid 2006, had little impact on the build up in debt, but coincided with the global economic slowdown, leading to five successive quarters of contraction in household consumption, beginning in the third quarter of 2008.
Interest rates were then cut by 5.5% since December 2008, with 3% in the past financial year.
In early 2010, consumer spending showed signs of fragile recovery.
CPI inflation continued on its downward path throughout 2009, ending the financial year at 5.1% year-on-year.
Key to the easing in inflation has been Rand strength over most of 2009 and 2010, in particular against the Euro, supported by capital inflows into domestic bonds and equities on the back of a re-rating in sovereign risk, and still relatively high South African interest rates.
Rand strength was broad based across all major currencies but most pronounced against the Dollar and the Euro.
2009 2010 was a very tough year for the South Africa economy, with over one million jobs lost, but not one which was catastrophic fiscally and South Africa has emerged in a much better position than most developed countries.

Income statement analysis The overview that follows will highlight the main reasons for the variance in the major category line items on the face of the income statement during the period under review.
Further details on the key income drivers and significant variances in the various components of our operating income, expenses and profit can be found in the description of our principal businesses on pages 53 to 101.
Total operating income Total operating income net of insurance claims increased 11.3% from 1 490 million to 1 657 million.

Average funds under management have been supported by improved market indices and significant net inflows.
Transactional activity, however, remains mixed and below historic trends.
We have benefited from the repurchase of our debt, opportunities taken in the dislocated credit markets and good trading conditions across all geographies.
The figure includes Investecs 47.1% share of the directors estimate of the post-tax profit of Rensburg Sheppards plc for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Other operating income loss The consolidation of the operating results of certain investments held within our Private Equity portfolio is partly reflected in other operating income loss, which improved from a loss of 30.2 million to a gain of 22.7 million.
Impairment losses on loans and advances The weaker credit cycle has caused a decline in the performance of our loan portfolio.
Impairment losses on loans and advances have increased from 163.0 million to 205.4 million excluding Kensington.
The credit loss charge as a percentage of average gross core loans and advances is 1.16%, marginally higher than the 1.08% reported at 31 March 2009.
The percentage of default loans net of impairments but before taking collateral into account to core loans and advances has increased from 3.3% to 4.0% since 31 March 2009.
The ratio of collateral to default loans net of impairments remains satisfactory at 1.33 times 2009: 1.22 times.
Further information on our asset quality is provided on pages 128 and 129.
Impairment losses on loans and advances relating to the Kensington business amount to 81.2 million 2009: 93.2 million.
The total Kensington book has reduced to 4.7 billion from 5.2 billion at 31 March 2009.
The percentage of accounts in arrears has increased as the book continues to run off.

1 ROE assessment of economic capital utilised In order to assess the return on economic capital utilised, we believe that certain adjustments as detailed in the tables below should be made to the income statement analysis and balance sheet anlaysis as reflected under IFRS.
We believe that these adjustments are necessary as they reflect the actual utilisation of capital and return theron, notwithstanding accounting conventions.
Return on capital by segment The methodology applied in accessing the utilisation of our economic capital is as follows: A notional return on capital net of the costs of subordinated debt which is managed and borne in the centre is allocated from Group Services and Other Activities to the business segments based on their total capital utilisation Shareholders equity is increased to reflect permanent capital which is reflected under subordinated debt applicable prior to March 2009.
