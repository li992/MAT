During 2009 it was agreed, in consultation with the trustee of the uK plan, to reduce the level of top-up payments made in addition to normal cash contributions from 14.0m per annum such that, with effect from 1 February 2009, no further additional payments would be made until August 2010.
A new triennial funding valuation for the uK plan as at the end of 2009 was completed in July 2010, based upon which the company and trustee agreed a new schedule of contributions to commence in August 2010 whereby, whilst the company will make no further normal cash contributions, it will make top-up payments of 7.0m per annum until February 2016, targeted at eliminating the deficit in the uK plan by that date.

When the relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate bond yields is stable, the uK plans hedging strategy should deliver a broadly stable funding ratio the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities not just in relation to the uK plans economic liabilities, but also under an iAs 19 basis of valuation.
As at 31 December 2010, the estimated funding position incorporating the uK plans economic liabilities showed a funding ratio of 92%, while the iAs 19 valuation reflected a funding ratio of 101%.
this represents a valuation difference of 41m.
the Group continues to fund the uK plan with reference to its economic funding position.
