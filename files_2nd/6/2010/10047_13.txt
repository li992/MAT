Net deficit payments in the year were 20.7 million 2009: 20.0 million.
Following a recent actuarial valuation of the UK plan, agreement was reached with the trustees on the level of future funding.
This will see increases in deficit payments gradually being phased in over the next 15 years.
In the US, there is likely to be a short-term modest increase in funding as legislation, introduced during 2008 and 2009 to alleviate the impact of the economic downturn on funding requirements, starts to unwind.
