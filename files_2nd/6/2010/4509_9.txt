IAS 19 accounting It is the responsibility of the Trustee to set the method and assumptions for calculating the scheme liabilities under scheme Funding Valuation.
The assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 valuation used in the consolidated accounts are set by the Group in compliance with the guidance given in IAS 19 and advice from its actuary.
The discount rate used for calculating IAS 19 liabilities is the yield prevailing on AA rated corporate bonds.
Those used for ongoing funding valuation are based on actuarial advice taking into account the actual investment profile of assets between bonds and equities over the longer term.
This is the principal difference between the two sets of assumptions.
The valuation of the UK pension scheme under IAS 19 principles indicates a scheme deficit pre-tax at 27 March 2010 of 124.8m March 2009: 67.5m.
This significant increase in deficit during the period has mainly arisen due to the reduction, from 6.8 per cent to 5.8 per cent, in the bond discount rate used to value the scheme liabilities.
This is partly offset by the increased asset values from the market low point in March 2009 and the Groups ongoing regular contributions.
The charge to operating profits in respect of the UK pension scheme for 2009 2010 was 4.5m 2008 2009: 5.8m.
In addition, under IAS 19 there was a finance charge of 6.3m arising from the difference between the expected return on assets and the interest on liabilities 2008 2009: 1.8m.
