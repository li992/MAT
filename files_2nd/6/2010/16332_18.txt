Wells Fargo provides administrative support and is also a directed trustee of the plan.
Foreign exchange risks Ultras results are affected by both the translation and transaction effects of foreign currency movements.
By their nature, currency translation risks cannot be mitigated but the transaction position is actively managed.
The majority of sales made by Ultras businesses are made in local currency, thus reducing transaction risk.
However, this risk does arise when businesses make sales and purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies, most often in US dollars.
To reduce the potential volatility, Ultra attempts to source, in US dollars, a high proportion of the product sold in US dollars.
For the remaining net expense, the Groups policy is to hedge forward the foreign currency trading exposure in order to increase certainty.
Traditionally, forward cover has been established for 18 to 24 months worth of net US dollar ows into the UK.
