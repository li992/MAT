order to develop new products and processes to maintain the long-term growth of the Group.
This research and development encompasses new innovative products within our core metrology business, as well as the application of our technology in the area of healthcare, including dental and specific applications in the medical field.
The development of new products and processes involves risk, such as with development time, which may take longer than originally forecast and hence involve more cost.
Also, being at the leading edge of new technology, there are uncertainties whether new developments will perform as planned and in some cases, projects may need to be halted.
Research and development also involves beta testing at our major customers to ensure that new products will meet the needs of the market at the right price.
Expenditure is only capitalised once the commercial and technical feasibility of a product is proven.
These risks are minimised by operating strictly managed research and development programmes with regular reviews against milestones achieved and against forecast business plans.
Defined benefit pension schemes With the closure of the UK and Irish defined benefit schemes to new employees and future accruals for existing members, the major risk surrounding accounting for pension costs and future funding arise from investment performance within the portfolio and actuarial assumptions.
This year has seen the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense bear an actuarial loss of 14.9m 2009 loss of 13.0m.
The UK defined benefit scheme is secured by a registered charge on certain of the Groups UK properties.
The Pension Regulator has confirmed that it does not propose to issue any scheme funding directions under Part 3 of the Pensions Act 2004.
