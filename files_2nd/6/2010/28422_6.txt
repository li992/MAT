20 BUSINESS REVIEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVERVIEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVERVIEW NIC NICANDROU CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 2010 was a good year for Prudential as we delivered strong performance APE SALES in our key growth metrics.
EEV new business profit new business profit was up 25 per cent to 2,028 million 2009: 1,619 million and IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns IFRS operating 23% 3,485m profit increased 24 per cent to 1,941 million 2009: 1,564 million.
2,844m On our capital metric of net underlying free surplus generation we improved 21 per cent to 1,714 million 2009: 1,414 million.
Prudentials ability to deliver on all of these metrics is testament to the quality of our businesses and marks us out among our peers.
Our ongoing focus on driving value over volume coupled with our advantaged product and geographic business footprint and the financial discipline that is ingrained within all 2009 2010 of our businesses has resulted in the Group delivering excellent performance in the year and gives us confidence as we look into 2011 and beyond.
Growth 1 In life insurance, APE sales in 2010 were up 23 per cent to 3,485 million 2009: 2,844 million and new business profit has increased by 25 per cent to 2,028 million 2009: 1 2,028m 1,619 million as our new business margins increased to 58 per cent 2009: 57 per cent.
New business profit 1 Asia produced APE sales of 1,501 million 2009: 1,209 million and new business 1 profit of 902 million 2009: 725 million in 2010, both gures up 24 per cent on the prior year.
AER sales performance across Asia was strong, particularly in Indonesia up 49 per cent, Malaysia up 40 per cent, Hong Kong up 19 per cent and Singapore 58% up 37 per cent where we have a powerful market presence.
Our agency and New business margin bancassurance channels both continue to ourish, each growing at a rate in excess of 25 per cent, and our health and protection rider strategy remains highly successful, with health and protection products representing 27 per cent of new business premiums in 2010.
Jackson delivered APE sales of 1,164 million 2009: 912 million and 761 million of new business profit 2009: 664 million, up 28 per cent and 15 per cent respectively on the prior year.
The decline in our new business margin in the US from 73 per cent in 2009 to 65 per cent in 2010 was expected.
Nevertheless, Jackson successfully defended most of the exceptional margin gains achieved in 2009 in taking advantage of the extreme dislocation prevalent in the corporate bond market.
Jackson has capitalised on the weakened competitive environment in the US life insurance market and has emerged as one of the top three players in the variable annuity market in terms of sales and number two in terms of net ows.
However, our expansion in variable annuities has been opportunistic and this market share may not be sustained as competition re-emerges over the medium term.
In the UK, we delivered total retail and bulk annuity APE sales of 820 million 2009: 723 million and new business profit of 365 million 2009: 230 million, up 13 per cent and 59 per cent respectively.
At a retail level, new business profit of 257 million was up 15 per cent from 223 million in 2009 at an expanded margin of 35 per cent versus 31 per cent in the prior year.
This reects improved margins on with-profits bond sales where we have seen volumes 11 per cent higher on improved demand and the strong annuity margins experienced in 2009 continuing into 2010.
Note 1 Excluding Japan which ceased writing new business in 2010.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW 21 In asset management, we have delivered 8.9 billion of net inows over 2010 compared In terms of profitability, with 15.4 billion in 2009, a year which benefited from exceptionally high ows into we have successfully built M&Gs xed income funds due to the credit spread environment at the time.
M&G is the on the momentum seen last driver of our inows in asset management, producing 9.1 billion 2009: 13.5 billion year and delivered another of net inows in the period 7.4 billion retail, 1.7 billion institutional.
M&Gs track strong performance thanks record in attracting positive net inows is highly impressive, ranking number 1 in the to a continued focus on UK retail market for the last nine consecutive quarters, making it one of the leading our core disciplines of asset managers in Europe.
At the end of 2010 it had external funds under management value creation and capital of 89.3 billion, an increase of 19.0 billion from the position at the beginning of the conservation.
year: adding these funds to internal amounts, M&Gs total funds under management were 198.3 billion.
Asia asset management continues to make great strides forward attracting 1.8 billion of retail and institutional inows in 2010 2009: 556 million.
These were offset by 2.1 billion of outows 2009: 1.4 billion inows in low margin money market funds where sales and redemptions tend to be highly volatile.
It is encouraging to note that we continue to grow our balance sheet with shareholderbacked policyholder liabilities up by 22 per cent to 122 billion, benefiting from both net inows and investment market movements.
We continue to see positive net inows into our life businesses, with a net 9.7 billion being received in 2010, an increase from the net 7.2 billion received in 2009.
In asset management our Group net inows as a percentage of opening external funds under management stands at 9.9 per cent for 2010.
Both measures emphasise the significant organic growth we are delivering across the Group.
In addition, the returns we expect to generate on the capital we invest in writing life new business have also reached a new high.
For every 1 we invested in new business strain in 2010 we expect to generate 2.2 of post-tax new business profit and our initial capital investment is expected to be paid back within two years.
Profitability In terms of profitability, we have successfully built on the momentum seen last year and delivered another strong performance thanks to a continued focus on our core disciplines of value creation and capital conservation.
We have delivered record profitability in 2010 with Group IFRS operating profit up 24 per cent to 1,941 million 2009: 1,564 million and Group EEV operating profit based on longer-term investment returns EEV operating profit up 20 per cent to 3,696 million 2009: 3,090 million equivalent to an annual return on embedded value of 18 per cent 2009: 15 per cent.
Central to this achievement is the active management of our portfolio of products and businesses, which in 2010 saw us cease writing new business in our Japanese life operations, exit from the equity release market in the UK, reduce our appetite for sales of xed annuities in the US and target, instead, the highly profitable markets in South-East Asia including Hong Kong and variable annuities in the US.
We have also remained opportunistic in the UK bulk annuity market and entered into one large transaction which comfortably exceeded our high return and short payback requirements.
In Asia, long-term business IFRS operating profit was up 29 per cent to 536 million in 2010 2009: 416 million, a strong performance in and of itself, even before factoring in the 63 million one-off credit to the 2009 result from a change in reserving basis in Malaysia.
The result benefited notably from strong performance in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.
In addition, management actions to close Japan to new business and refocus our operations in Korea and Taiwan have also helped to eliminate some of the negatives that were holding back our profitability.
The ongoing build-out of distribution across South-East Asia, the success of our health and protection rider strategy, and the underlying strength of the economies in which we operate should drive continuing strong growth in Asia IFRS operating profit going forward.
Asias long-term EEV operating profit, a measure of the economic value creation in the year, grew by 31 per cent in 2010 to 1,450 million 2009: 1,105 million further underlining the creation of sustainable value by these operations.
22 BUSINESS REVIEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVERVIEW CONTINUED CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVERVIEW In the US, long-term business IFRS operating profit was up 35 per cent from Our strategy of efficiently 618 million in 2009 to 833 million in 2010.
Jacksons impressive growth in the variable deploying our capital annuity market is a key driver behind its improved profitability.
The fees on assets that to those products and Jackson earns on separate account assets are the highest across the Groups unit-linked geographies with the most businesses, and these revenues have increased signicantly as these assets have grown attractive profitability by over 51 per cent during 2010 to 31 billion at the end of the year.
The majority of this characteristics has, over asset growth has come from 5.8 billion of net inows in the period 2009: 3.6 billion.
the past three years, Jacksons general account has also contributed to the growth in IFRS profits during the transformed the capital period.
The size of the general account was up slightly during 2010, and closed the year position of our business.
with policyholder liabilities of 29 billion but the average spread margin that we earn on these liabilities increased from 179 bps in 2009 to 243 bps in 2010.
This included a 108 million benefit from various transactions undertaken during 2010 to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration, as well as management actions to lower crediting rates on xed annuities.
These actions also had the effect of improving the 2010 EEV operating profits by 18 per cent to 1,458 million 2009: 1,233 million.
In the UK long-term business IFRS operating profit was up by 11 per cent from 606 million in 2009 to 673 million in 2010.
Our UK business continues to optimise the balance between growth and cash generation.
The improvement in IFRS operating profit reects the benefit of cost saving initiatives, higher with-profits income and increased annuity profits arising principally from a bulk annuity contract which contributed 63 million to the total.
At eight per cent, growth in EEV operating earnings to 936 million 2009: 870 million was in line with our strategy.
In asset management IFRS operating profit was up 27 per cent to 378 million compared to 297 million in 2009.
M&G had a strong year benefiting from rising markets and the strong inows described above, resulting in IFRS operating profit up 19 per cent to 284 million in 2010 2009: 238 million.
Asia asset management produced IFRS operating profit of 72 million up 31 per cent on the prior year 2009: 55 million, also benefiting from rising markets and an element of improving mix as 1.8 billion of high margin retail and institutional net inows offset 2.1 billion of low margin money market net outows.
Capital generation Our strategy of efficiently deploying our capital to those products and geographies with the most attractive profitability characteristics has, over the past three years, transformed the capital position of our business.
Across the Group, we are now producing very significant amounts of free capital, which we measure as free surplus generated.
Our first priority for the use of this capital is reinvestment in new business as we can achieve attractive internal rates of return IRRs and rapid paybacks on this investment.
However, such is the scale and efficiency of our businesses, we are now producing significant amounts of free surplus over and above that which we can reinvest in new business.
This excess free surplus generation is being used to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and to increase cash returns to our shareholders.
In 2010, we generated 2,359 million of underlying free surplus from our in-force business, up 13 per cent from 2,089 million in 2009, and we reinvested 645 million of this into writing new business.
Asia is the priority destination when it comes to reinvesting our capital and Prudential Corporation Asia PCA s growth is not constrained by the supply of capital from the Group.
In the US, we invest in an opportunistic manner reecting the market and competitive environment at the time.
In the UK, we take a selective approach and focus only on lines of business where we believe we have both the scale and expertise to compete successfully.
In asset management, our businesses require minimal capital to fund growth.
Thus, the split of the investment in new business in 2010 was 280 million into Asia, 300 million into the US and 65 million into the UK.
The IRRs on this invested capital were more than 20 per cent in Asia, the US and the UK: with payback periods of three years, one year and four years respectively.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW 23 Of the remaining free surplus generated after reinvestment in new business, 935 million was remitted from the business units to Group.
This cash was used to meet central costs including those associated with Solvency II implementation of 180 million, service net interest payments of 231 million and meet dividend payments net of scrip of 449 million.
In 2010, we also incurred significant exceptional cash outows relating to the AIA transaction costs of 377 million pre-tax and we utilised our central resources to fund the acquisition of UOB Life of 276 million.
Our central cash resources amounted to 1,232 million at the end of the year, comfortably above the 1 billion holding company cash buffer we seek to retain.
The remaining free surplus generated in the period was retained within our businesses and this will bolster local capital ratios.
The total free surplus balance deployed across our life and asset management operations increased from 2,531 million at the beginning of the period to 3,338 million at the end of the period.
New financial objectives Growth and Cash The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties.
Prudentials actual future financial condition or performance or other indicated results may differ materially from those indicated in any such forwardlooking statement due to a number of important factors including those discussed under the heading Risk factors in this announcement.
See the discussion under the heading Forward-looking statement at the front of this announcement.
At our 2010 investor conference entitled Growth and Cash we announced new financial objectives demonstrating our confidence in continued rapid growth in Asia, and increasing levels of cash remittances from all of our businesses.
These objectives were dened as follows: 1 i Asia growth and profitability objectives : To double the 2009 value of IFRS life and asset management pre-tax operating profit in 2013 2009: 465 million : and To double the 2009 value of new business profits in 2013 2009: 713 million.
1 ii Business unit cash remittance objectives : Asia to deliver 300 million of net cash remittance to the Group in 2013 2009: 40 million : Jackson to deliver 200 million of net cash remittance to the Group in 2013 2009: 39 million : and UK to deliver 350 million of net cash remittance to the Group in 2013 2 2009: 284 million.
1 iii Cumulative net cash remittances : All business units in aggregate to deliver cumulative net cash remittances of at least 3.8 billion over the period 2010 to end-2013.
These net remittances are to be underpinned by a targeted level of cumulative underlying free surplus generation of 6.5 billion over the same period.
Notes 1 The objectives assume current exchange rates and a normalised economic environment consistent with the economic assumptions made by Prudential in calculating the EEV basis supplementary information for the half-year ended 30 June 2010.
They have been prepared using current solvency rules and do not pre-judge the outcome of Solvency II, which remains uncertain.

24 BUSINESS REVIEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVERVIEW CONTINUED CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVERVIEW The table below shows our progress towards these objectives from our results in 2010.
We believe we have made a strong start towards achieving these objectives.

In 2009, the net remittances from the UK include the 150 million in 2009 arising from the pro-active financing techniques used to bring forward cash emergence of the in-force book during the financial crisis.
The 2010 net remittances include an amount of 120 million representing the releases of surplus and net financing payments.
In 2010 net remittances from business operations increased to 935 million, equivalent to 55 per cent of underlying free surplus generated after investment in new business of 1,714 million.
The increased level of net remittances further illustrates both the strong and improving capital generative nature of our business, with a greater proportion of this capital being returned to the corporate centre in the form of dividends.
The delivery of the 2010 to 2013 financial objectives will see this trend continue.
Capital position, financing and liquidity The Group has continued to maintain a strong capital position.
At the end of 2010 our IGD surplus stood at 4.3 billion 2009: 3.4 billion, with coverage a very strong 3.0 times the requirement.
All of our subsidiaries maintain strong capital positions at the local regulatory level.
In particular, Jacksons RBC ratio has continued to strengthen throughout the period under review and at the end of 2010 this ratio stood at 483 per cent.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW 25 Solvency II, which is expected to be implemented from 1 January 2013, represents These results demonstrate a complete overhaul of the capital adequacy regime for European insurers.
We that we are maximising the welcome the risk-based focus of the Solvency II regime but, along with our European growth opportunities of our peers, we do have concerns about the degree of prudence built in within the high quality franchises in proposed calibrations for the standard formula.

peers, politicians and regulators to ensure a fair and reasonable outcome before the regime becomes law.
Our nancing and liquidity position has remained strong throughout the period.
The next call on external nancing is in December 2011 on the 500 million Tier 2 subordinated notes.
In early 2011 we successfully issued US$550 million Tier 1 subordinated debt in anticipation of calling the 500 million Tier 2 notes.
We continue to engage with rating agencies in order to provide insurance financial strength ratings for the Group.
Prudential is currently rated A by S&P, A2 negative outlook by Moodys and A by Fitch.
Embedded value EEV shareholders funds increased by 19 per cent during 2010 to 18.2 billion 2009: 15.3 billion.
On a per share basis EEV at the end of 2010 stood at 715 pence, up 19 per cent from the end of 2009 2009: 603 pence.
2010 dividend In view of the progress that the Group has made in recent years to improve IFRS operating profitability and free surplus generation, the Board has decided to rebase the full year dividend upwards by 4 pence per share, equivalent to an increase of 20 per cent.
In line with this, the directors recommend a final dividend of 17.24 pence per share, which brings the total dividend for the year to 23.85 pence per share 2009: 19.85 pence per share.
The scrip dividend scheme is not being offered in respect of this dividend.
In its place shareholders will be offered a Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP.
The Board will maintain its focus on delivering a growing dividend from this new higher base, which will continue to be determined after taking into account the Groups financial exibility and our assessment of opportunities to generate attractive returns by investing in specic areas of the business.
The Board believes that in the medium term a dividend cover of around two times is appropriate.
Summary 2010 was a good year for the Group in uncertain conditions as global economies emerged from the financial crisis.
These results demonstrate that we are maximising the growth opportunities of our high quality franchises in Asia, the US, and the UK.
We remain disciplined in our approach of optimising value and are very focused on improving the quality of our earnings.
We have accelerated the generation of free surplus and we are signalling our confidence in the future potential of our business by proposing an increase in the payout to shareholders.
26 BUSINESS REVIEW INSURANCE OPERATIONS ASIA ACCELERATING ASIA Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW 27 28 BUSINESS REVIEW INSURANCE OPERATIONS ASIA CONTINUED ASIA BARRY STOWE CHIEF EXECUTIVE PRUDENTIAL CORPORATION ASIA The Asian economies continue to lead the world in terms of current and prospective growth and it is clear that Asias historic reliance on exports is increasingly balanced with rapidly growing domestic consumption.
Across the region, we are seeing major demographic and socioeconomic changes with the emergence of a sizeable and growing middle class.
The Asian Development Bank estimates that there are now over 1.9 billion middle class Asians, a threefold increase since 1990 and this means that, within a generation, hundreds of millions of households in the region have ascended from poverty to living standards and lifestyle aspirations that are consistent with those seen in Western Europe and the US.
These are urbanised households that are smaller, that are better educated, that want good quality housing, consumer goods, access to good medical services, transport, holidays, entertainment, education, to provide a quality of life for their children that is better than the one they had and not least to have a long life with a comfortable retirement.
Household savings rates in Asia have historically been multiples of those in the UK and US and in markets where little exists in the way of state backed social security benets or welfare support, the need to save in case of an unplanned life changing event such as a medical incident involving hospitalisation is real and strong.
As households have become wealthier the quantum of these emergency funds has increased materially, resulting in significant amounts of undeployed or under-deployed capital waiting to be brought into the formal economy as they migrate to insurance companies and banks balance sheets.
Life insurance companies are ideally placed to provide some financial protection and security to household balance sheets.
Although there will inevitably be some short-term uctuations in demand for life insurance and asset management products as other factors come into play, the fundamental social and political drivers for growth in these sectors will continue to support long-term growth.
Market overview Overall, Asias life insurance industry saw a sharp recovery in new business volumes during 2010 as markets moved beyond the 2008 2009 crisis.
The competitive landscape for the life sector varies by market but has largely remained consistent with that seen in prior years.
Most markets feature a mix of local and multinational players whose denitions of business success may differ.
Competition is primarily around securing distribution.
With insurance penetration rates being generally low, growth is less constrained by the size of the market than by companies ability to further expand it by adding distribution and making their products available to parts of the population who have never used them.
A large proportion of sales in markets with low penetration are to consumers who have never bought a policy before, thus expanding the market itself.

Across the region there is little direct competition on products: there are no channel distribution platform patents or copyrights in life insurance, or on product pricing, where regulators and improving its productivity typically define the parameters for the industry.
Focus on regular premium The regions life insurance regulators tend to adopt a conservative stance and remain products with comprehensive suite of protection riders focused on driving development of the sector in a way that balances the need to ensure consumers have, first and foremost, access to appropriate products that are sold in a fair Drive value through operational and transparent manner with the need to reward shareholders for taking on the risks efficiency of investing in the development of a relatively young and capital intensive industry.
The industry also employs millions of people in the region, an important consideration when high unemployment rates can be a catalyst for political friction.
India saw the most impactful regulatory change during 2010, which in summary, was designed to shift the emphasis of the industry away from products which are mostly investment orientated and encourage more traditional savings and protection.
A positive development in a number of markets has been the development of the financial press.
Many leading publications carry regular sections on personal financial planning and there is healthy debate on the uses of particular types of product.
Prudential is a champion of improving standards of financial literacy.
Strategy overview The overarching objective for Prudential in Asia is to continue building scale profitably, APE SALES leveraging our advantaged platform.
The strategic priorities articulated in 2006 remain entirely relevant and continue to be driven in a highly focused and disciplined way.
While market outperformance in terms of new business growth is an indicator of scale, we do not pursue volume for its own sake as we put profitability, returns on capital and 24% 1,501m capital efficiency ahead of topline growth.
1,209m One of the key components of our strategy is driving agency distribution scale and productivity.
Our agency structures are differentiated by market depending upon their size and maturity with the management emphasis balanced between recruitment newer markets like Indonesia and Vietnam and productivity growth more established markets like Hong Kong and Singapore.
However this is a simplication as those two priorities are always present and not mutually exclusive: local management will always 2009 2010 focus on both.

Prudentials product mix continues its emphasis on regular premium policies and protection riders.
The high proportion of health and protection, standalone and riders, at 27 per cent of new business premiums in 2010, supports the new business profit margins and reects the higher proportion of risk based products in our book than some competitors who focus on single premium investment orientated policies.
Prudential currently insures over 11 million life customers in Asia and has 15 million in-force policies.
Highlighting the value Prudential policies have for our customers, we paid out 2.6 billion in claims and maturities during 2010.
This customer base is a tremendously valuable asset as over 40 per cent of new business APE came from existing customers in 2010 excluding India.
This reects our enduring relationship with our customers and how our solutions are meeting their needs over time.
The customer retention rate continues to improve and at 91 per cent it is one per cent up on 2009.
Financial performance New business for the fourth quarter was a new record at 435 million, up eight per cent on the same period last year, which was already a record quarter and the full year 2010 was 1,501 million up 24 per cent on 2009 and an impressive 44 per cent ahead of 2007, the last full year to be unaffected by the 2008 2009 financial crisis.
Agency remains the largest distribution channel accounting for 66 per cent of new business volumes and with the proportion from bancassurance increasing from 25 per cent to 26 per cent.
The proportion of linked and protection business remained broadly in line with prior year at 41 per cent and 27 per cent respectively.
With the economic recovery, the size of average cases, excluding India, increased nine per cent.
Importantly, our continued emphasis on regular premium business is reected in its 93 per cent contribution to total APE, which is also in line with prior year.
New business market share statistics for full year 2010 are not yet available but based on our estimates and market intelligence we expect to have retained or improved our market rankings in most markets across the region.
Consistent with our value over volume priority we have maintained our product and 1 pricing disciplines.

Jackson undertook various interest rate swap transactions during 2010 to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration, benefiting spread income in 2010 by 108 million.
Acquisition costs have increased in absolute terms compared to 2009 due to the significant increase in sales.
However, acquisition costs as a percentage of APE has fallen from 76 per cent in 2009 to 73 per cent in 2010 as more advisors are electing to take asset based commissions which are paid over the life of the policy based on fund value.
This asset based commission is not a deferrable acquisition cost and is expensed in the current period as an administration expense.

Excluding this effect, the underlying amortisation increased 61 million due to higher gross profits.
Administration expenses totalling 344 million in 2010 compared to 259 million in 2009, with the increase due primarily to higher asset based commissions which are excluded from acquisition costs.
With the improvement in the bond markets in 2010, and active management of the investment portfolio to reduce certain investment risks, Jackson realised net gains of 11 million in 2010 compared to net realised losses of 506 million in 2009.
Jackson incurred losses, net of recoveries and reversals, on credit related sales of bonds of 89 million 2009: less than 1 million.
Write downs were 124 million 630 million in 2009, including 71 million on RMBS and 39 million on ABS.
More than offsetting these losses were interest related gains of 224 million 2009: 125 million, primarily due to sales of lower rated CMBS and corporate debt.
Gross unrealised losses improved from 966 million at 31 December 2009 to 370 million at 31 December 2010.
The net unrealised gain position has also improved signicantly, from 4 million at 31 December 2009 to 1,210 million at 31 December 2010 due primarily to a decline in the US Treasury rates.
Jackson delivered record retail APE sales of 1,164 million in 2010, representing a 28 per cent increase over 2009.
With no institutional sales in 2010, total APE sales were also 1,164 million, the highest total in the companys history.
This achievement further demonstrates the resilience of Jacksons business model, as well as stability of our high-quality product offerings, exceptional wholesaling support and consistency demonstrated throughout the economic downturn.
While the equity markets rebounded in 2010, reaching two-year highs in December, and in light of continued volatility in US equity markets and historically low interest rates, customers continue to seek to mitigate equity risk while receiving an acceptable return through the purchase of variable annuities with guaranteed living benets.
Jackson is a beneciary of this trend while being well placed to benefit from the huge wave of baby boomers starting to retire, as they increasingly use variable annuities to structure their retirement income.
In 2010, record variable annuity APE sales of 948 million were up 48 per cent from 2009.
Jackson ranked third in new variable annuity sales in the US in 2010 with a 1 market share of 11 per cent, up from fourth and a market share of eight per cent in 2009.
With significant sales increases and continued low surrender rates, Jackson held steady 4 with its ranking of second in variable annuity net ows in 2010.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW 39 Fixed annuity APE sales of 84 million were down 20 per cent from the prior year, as consumer demand for the products fell due to the continued low interest rate environment.
Jacksons new business opportunities were balanced with the goals of capital and cash conservation.
Jackson ranked eighth in sales of traditional deferred xed annuities through the third quarter of 2010, with a market share of three per cent 2 compared to 13th with a two per cent market share for the full year 2009.
Fixed index annuity FIA APE sales of 109 million in 2010 were down 24 per cent from 2009 as Jackson focused its marketing efforts on the higher margin variable annuity products.
Jackson ranked sixth in sales of xed index annuities through the first three quarters of 2010, with a market share of five per cent, down from fourth 3 and a market share of eight per cent for the full year 2009.
Retail annuity net ows increased 38 per cent, benefiting from record sales and continued low levels of surrender activity.
Jackson achieved extraordinary EEV new business margins in 2009, partially as a result of our ability to take advantage of the extreme dislocation prevalent in the corporate bond market.
While the recovery in the corporate bond market has led to somewhat lower EEV new business margins due to lower spreads in 2010, we continue to write new business at internal rates of return in excess of 20 per cent.
The exceptionally high EEV spread levels in 2009 included an allowance that crediting rates and spreads would normalise in the future.
EEV basis new business profits of 761 million were up 15 per cent on 2009, reecting a 28 per cent increase in APE sales offset somewhat by lower new business margins.
Total new business margin was 65 per cent, compared to 73 per cent achieved in 2009.
The variable annuity new business margin of 72 per cent in 2010 decreased somewhat from 81 per cent in 2009, as lower assumed separate account returns and lower assumed spreads on the guaranteed funds were partially offset by an increase in-the take-up rate on guaranteed benets particularly guaranteed minimum withdrawal benets.
The xed index annuity new business margin decreased from 51 per cent in 2009 to 41 per cent in 2010 due to decreased spread assumptions and lower interest rates, offset somewhat by longer maturity contracts sold in 2010.
These same interest rate and spread factors also caused the xed annuity new business margin to normalise from 57 per cent to 34 per cent.
For both products, the spread assumptions decreased due primarily to abnormally high investment yields during 2009.
Total EEV basis operating profit for the long-term business in 2010 was 1,458 million, compared to 1,233 million in 2009.
In-force EEV profits of 697 million for 2010 were 22 per cent higher than 2009 profit of 569 million.
During 2010, EEV basis operating profit benefited as a result of the interest rate swap transactions noted earlier.
Including this benefit, experience variances and other items were 201 million higher in 2010 due primarily to favourable spread and persistency variances that were partially offset by lower expense and mortality variances.
In 2010, Jackson invested 300 million of free surplus to write 1,164 million of new business 2009: 326 million and 912 million, respectively.

The Fund business has continued has delivered investment returns of 82.1 per cent over ten years, which compares to innovate to maintain favourably with other with-profits funds and the FTSE All-Share Index total return and enhance its position of 43.3 per cent over the same period.
This strong performance has shown that in the market.
with-profits, when invested in an actively managed, and nancially strong fund like Prudentials, continues to be a very attractive medium to long-term investment, offering strong annualised returns compared with other investment options.
Prudentials with-profits customers benefit from the security offered by Prudentials large inherited estate, with the free assets of the with-profits fund valued at approximately 6.8 billion at the year end, valued on a realistic basis.
In the Wholesale market, Prudential UKs aim is to continue to participate very selectively in bulk and back-book buyouts using its financial strength, superior investment track record and annuitant mortality risk assessment and servicing capabilities.
In line with this approach, in the fourth quarter of 2010, Prudential UK signed a bulk annuity buy-in insurance agreement of 88 million APE.
Building capabilities In September 2010, Prudential UK announced a five-year exclusive agreement with Santander to distribute its market-leading investment bonds in the UK.
Prudential UKs Flexible Investment Plan, including PruFund, will be available to Santanders UK customers in 1,300 high street branches throughout the country.

Prudential UK will continue to maintain a very strict focus on value and only participate in capital-efficient transactions that meet its strict return on capital requirements.
Including this transaction, Prudential UKs new business margin increased from 32 per cent to 45 per cent.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW 45 Higher sales and margins resulted in total EEV new business profits increasing by 59 per cent to 365 million.
This improvement included the impact of the bulk annuity transaction, but also reected improved retail margins, in particular on with-profits bonds.
Retail EEV new business profits at 257 million were 15 per cent up on 2009 223 million.
IFRS total operating profits before restructuring costs were up nine per cent at 719 million, reecting increased sales.
Commission received on Prudential-branded General Insurance products contributed 46 million to IFRS operating profits in 2010, 5 million lower than 2009 as the book of business originally transferred to Churchill in 2004 is decreasing as expected.
EEV total operating profit of 982 million was up seven per cent mainly due to an increase in new business profits.
In-force EEV operating profit included 37 million from renewal expense assumptions and 41 million from the change in the long-term tax rate assumption from 28 per cent to 27 per cent.
These positive impacts were offset by a 40 million negative net impact from the strengthening of mortality improvement assumptions, partially offset by the release of excess margins previously held.

Prudential UK writes with-profits annuity, with-profits bond and with-profits corporate and individual pensions business in its Life Fund, with other products backed by shareholder capital.
The weighted average post-tax IRR on the shareholder capital allocated to new business in the UK was in excess of 20 per cent.
The average free surplus undiscounted payback period for shareholder backed business written in 2010 was four years.
As announced at the half-year, the business met its cost savings target of 195 million per annum, six months early.
Prudential UK has commenced a number of cost saving initiatives to reduce costs by a further 75 million per annum on a consistent basis by the end of 2013.
The business has already made good progress towards this objective in 2010.
