MALUSI MKHIZE SENIOR MANAGER, BASE METAL REFINERY BMR Malusi joined Lonmin in 2008 as an Automation Manager at the Base Metal Refinery BMR.
In August 2010, Malusi was appointed Senior Manager responsible for the BMR.
Malusis background is in electrical engineering and technology management and he has extensive experience in introducing new processes and systems.
The core focus of Malusi and his team is in improving PGM efficiencies and recoveries in a safe environment, whilst removing the two base metals, nickel and copper, from the matte they receive from the smelter, so that a high quality PGM concentrate is sent to the Precious Metal Refinery.
During the March 2010 BMR stock take, the BMR completed a successful plant control system upgrade which helps ensure efficient and stable plant operations.
Malusi and his Automation team played a significant role in ensuring that the project was completed safely and in time for production to recommence on schedule.
The BMR team has identified a number of other areas where they can increase efficiency and improve recoveries.
These include close monitoring of inventory in the process, continuous improvement of measuring systems and assays to improve Metals accounting, managing plant availability, implementing an integrated security model to minimise theft of metal and improving the quality and reducing losses of copper and nickel.
All these actions require integrated management plans to be put in place by Malusi and his management team.

Commodity price risk Our policy is not to hedge commodity price exposure on PGMs, except gold, and therefore any change in prices will have a direct effect on the Groups trading results.
For base metals and gold, hedging is undertaken Alan Ferguson where the Board determines that it is in the Groups Chief Financial Officer interest to hedge a proportion of future cash flows.
The policy is to hedge up to a maximum of 75% of the future 12 November 2010 cash flows from the sale of these products looking forward over the next 12 to 24 months.
The Group has undertaken a number of hedging contracts on Nickel, Copper and Gold sales using forward contracts.
The approximate effects on the Groups results of a 10% movement in the 2010 financial year average metal prices achieved for Platinum Pt $1,525 per ounce and Rhodium Rh $2,308 per ounce would be as follows: Pt Rh EBIT $108m $23m Profit for the year $64m $13m EPS cents 32.3c 6.8c These sensitivities are based on 2010 costs and volumes and assume all other variables remain constant.
Fiscal risk The South African Government introduced a new Mining Royalty on 1 March 2010.
The Royalty is calculated based on a percentage of Gross Sales.
The percentage is calculated using a formula depending on whether the Company sells concentrate, ore or refined products.
The Royalty percentage is subject to a minimum rate of 0.5%.
The formula for refined products is: % of Gross Sales Adjusted EBIT x100 0.5 Gross Sales x 12.5 Adjusted EBIT for the purpose of the Royalty calculation is statutory EBIT adjusted for, amongst other things, depreciation and a capital deduction based on Mining Tax rules.
The Mining Royalty charge for this financial year amounted to $5 million.
