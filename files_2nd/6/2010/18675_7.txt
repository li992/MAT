Going concern The directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are: timing and value of property sales availability of loan finance and related cash flows future property valuation and its impact on covenants and potential loan repayments committed future expenditure future rental income and potential bad debts repayment timing and value of trade receivables The forecast cashflows have been sensitised to eliminate those cash inflows which are less certain and to take account of a potential further deterioration of property valuations.
From their review the directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue to be operational as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
