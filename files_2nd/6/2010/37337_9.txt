com annualreport2010 martin Following a period of exceptional turbulence in the global economy, 2009 10 saw the return of positive financial dynamics in our market and a robust performance from the Group.
Pro t before tax was 1,069.3m, compared to a loss of 4,773.2m for the previous 12 months.
In my Financial Review last year I indicated that revenue pro t, our measure of underlying pro t before tax, would fall in 2009 10 as a result of the economic environment and the impact of the sales required to maintain our liquidity and sound capital base.
We saw the effect of these factors during the year, with revenue pro t down by 20.0%, from 314.9m to 251.8m.
Asset sales have an adverse effect on revenue pro t, but our disposals during the year served to enhance the balance sheet.
Our Security Groups AA rating was reaf rmed and we were able to extend 650m of bank facilities to 2014.
This meant we ended the year in an excellent position from which to address opportunities as our market evolves.
While revenue pro t was down, the value of our assets grew by 10.3%.
Our gearing ampli ed the valuation gains, with adjusted diluted net assets per share up by 16.5%, from 593p to 691p.
Looking into 2010 11, we expect revenue pro t to be adversely affected by the full year effect of the sales we made in 2009 10, together with some lease expiries on properties we are preparing for redevelopment.
On the other hand, we see good opportunities to grow income through letting up developments and voids in our existing portfolio, while reducing void-related costs.
We will also obtain some bene t from acquisitions made early in 2010 11.
The measures we took during the year have enabled us to emerge in good shape from some very dif cult conditions.
Over the following pages we set out a detailed review which shows how the combination of market conditions and our actions have translated into hard facts and gures.
You will see that we now have the financial strength to compete and succeed as changing conditions bring opportunities to drive revenue pro t growth in the medium term.

Revenue profit, our measure of underlying profit before tax, reduced by 20.0% from 314.9m to 251.8m.
Basic earnings per share was 144.04p compared to a loss per share of 918.04p last year.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was 34.08p 2009: 62.57p, down 45.5% on the comparable period.
The combined investment portfolio including joint ventures was valued at 31 March 2010 at 9.54bn which included a valuation surplus of 863.8m or 10.3% over the year.
Net assets per share increased by 111p 17.4% from 639p at the end of March 2009 to 750p in March 2010, with adjusted diluted net assets per share increasing by 16.5% from 593p at March 2009 to 691p.
Profit before tax The largest driver behind the improvement in the profit before tax was the valuation surplus on our combined investment portfolio including joint ventures of 863.8m 2009: 4,743.7m deficit.
The market value of our properties increased by 10.3% 2009: 34.2% decline.
London property values have been favourably impacted by significant interest from global investors and, although letting conditions in the retail sector remained challenging, our retail assets performed well, particularly in the second half of the year.
Revenue profit Chart 16 Revenue profit is our measure of the underlying pre-tax profit of the Group, which we use internally to assess Revenue pro t m our income performance.
It includes the pre-tax results of our joint ventures but excludes capital and other one-off items.
251.8m 20% Table 17 shows the composition of our revenue profit including the contributions from London and Retail.
Revenue profit declined from 314.9m last year to 251.8m mainly due to a 12% decline in net rental income.
In total, net rental income was 77.6m lower than last year, with 68.6m of the decline due to the sale of investment properties.
Significant disposals during the year included Portman House, W1: One Wood Street, EC2: 40 50 Eastbourne Terrace, W2: Bullring, Birmingham: Fremlin Walk, Maidstone and 50% of Princesshay, Exeter.
Net rental income from the like-for-like portfolio declined by 19.6m, largely due to the failure of a number of retailers and a 3.0m decline in turnover rents from our Accor hotel properties.
Compared to last year, developments added 12.4m with the increase coming from our schemes in Bristol, Cardiff and Livingston.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share was 144.04p, compared to a loss per share from continuing operations of 918.04p last year, the improvement being predominantly due to the valuation surplus on the investment property portfolio 98.7p per share compared to a loss last year of 791.7p per share.
In the same way that we adjust profit before tax to remove capital and one-off items to give revenue profit, we also report an adjusted earnings per share figure.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing activities reduced by 45.5% from 62.57p last year to 34.08p per share this year.
This was largely due to the reduction in revenue profit and the full year impact of the additional shares following the Rights Issue last year.

Taken together with the three quarterly dividends of 7.0p, our full year dividend will be 28.0p per share 2009: 51.7p or 212.2m 2009: 283.3m.
Property Income Distribution This is in line with guidance given at the time of our Rights Issue and in our 2009 Annual Report.
PID During the year we introduced a scrip dividend scheme, which provides shareholders with the option to receive their dividend in shares as opposed to cash.
The take up for the dividend paid on 15 January 2010 was Who can claim exemption from 33%, resulting in a cash saving of 17.6m, while the scrip dividend take up for the third quarterly dividend paid on 1 April 2010 was 41%.
Following the implementation of the scrip alternative, our Dividend Reinvestment deduction of withholding tax on 1 Plan DRIP was suspended.
A scrip alternative will be offered for the final dividend payment on 30 July 2010.
Shareholders who wish to participate but have not yet completed a Mandate Form should download this form UK companies from our corporate website and send the completed form to our Registrars, Equiniti.
Mandate Forms must be received by Equiniti at least 15 working days before the relevant dividend payment date to be eligible for that Charities particular dividend.
The calculation price for the scrip dividend alternative in respect of the final dividend payable Local Authorities on 30 July 2010 will be announced on 30 June 2010 and will be based upon the share price on 23, 24, 25, 28 and 29 June 2010.
UK Pension Schemes All of the dividends paid and payable in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2010, comprise Property Income Distributions PID from REIT qualifying activities to the extent that these dividends are paid Managers of PEPs, ISAs and in cash.
PIDs are subject to 20% withholding tax for relevant shareholders.
Scrip dividends are not treated as Child Trust Funds qualifying towards the Group PID requirement and are not subject to 20% withholding tax.
Who is unlikely to be able to claim exemption from deduction of withholding Net assets At 31 March 2010, our net assets per share were 750p, an increase of 111p compared to the year ended tax on Property Income Distributions?
The increase in our net assets was primarily driven by the increase in value of our investment 2 Overseas shareholders property portfolio.
In common with other property companies, we calculate an adjusted measure of net assets which we Individual private shareholders believe better reflects the underlying net assets attributable to shareholders.
Our adjusted net assets are lower than our reported net assets primarily due to an adjustment to our debt.

At 31 March 2010, adjusted diluted net assets per share were 691p per share, an increase of 98p or 16.5% from 31 March 2009.
Table 18 summarises the main differences between net assets and our adjusted measure of net assets together with the key movements over the year.

At 31 March 2010 the net deficit was 6.5m, compared to a 3.0m surplus recognised at 31 March 2009.
The change is primarily due to the actuarial assumptions adopted increasing the liabilities of the scheme by more than the return on the schemes assets.
This has been partially offset by additional employer contributions agreed as part of the triennial funding review concluded in January 2010.
Further details regarding the defined benefit pension scheme, including the assumptions adopted and the related sensitivities, can be found in note 29 to the financial statements p126128.
Cash flow, net debt and gearing During the year, net debt decreased by 660.2m to 3,263.4m.
This reduction was primarily driven by proceeds from the disposal of investment properties 826.2m and the disposal of our joint venture interest in the Bullring, Birmingham 209.8m.
The only investment property acquired in the year was the Atlas development site opposite Buchanan Galleries in Glasgow.
Capital expenditure in the year totalled 219.6m of which 102.7m related to the development at One New Change, London, EC4.
We also invested 65.2m in our joint ventures, consisting mainly of 81.7m on our major developments in Cardiff and Bristol offset by capital repayments of 10.1m and 7.7m from Bristol and Bullring, respectively.

Under the rules of the REIT regime, we need to maintain an interest cover in the exempt business of at least 1.25 times to avoid paying tax.
As calculated under the REIT regulations, our interest cover of the exempt business for the year to 31 March 2010 was 1.73 times.
The reduction is principally due to the reduction in net debt and increase in net assets.
Details of the Groups gearing are set out in Table 20, which also shows the impact of joint venture debt, although the lenders to our joint ventures have no recourse to the Group for repayment.
Adjusted gearing, which recognises the nominal value of our debt, reduced from 97.3% at 31 March 2009 to 72.1% at 31 March 2010.
Adjusted gearing including our share of joint ventures reduced from 105.9% to 80.2% over the same period.
In common with other property companies, we also show our Group LTV ratio.

Financing strategy Chart 21 The Group monitors and adjusts its capital structure with a view to promoting the long-term success of the Funding structure business and maintaining sustainable returns for shareholders.
A key element of the Groups capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets the Security Group.
This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market as well as shorter-term flexible bank facilities, both at competitive rates.
Our secured debt structure provides for different operating environments which apply in Secured tiers determined by levels of LTV and Interest Cover Ratios ICR, although it is LTV which is the more likely 1 Group determinant of which operating environment applies.
These ratios do not trigger an event of default until LTV London & Retail exceeds 100% or historic or projected ICR is less than 1.0 times.
However, our operating environment becomes more restrictive at higher levels of LTV lower levels of ICR.
There are minimal operational restrictions on the Group in Tier 1 LTV below 55%, our current level, and Tier 2 LTV: 55% to 65%.
Above an LTV of 65%, our operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions designed to encourage a reduction in gearing Unsecured Secured loans loans including mandatory debt amortisation.
notes etc In addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure in the NonOther lenders Secured lenders restricted Group.
These assets are typically our joint venture interests or other assets on which we have raised separate, specific finance.
By having both the Security Group and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable freedom to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate finance for the specific asset Non or joint venture.
Restricted 2 Group Dedicated third party funding or loan from Secured Group 1.
Retail and London assets totalling 7,766.0m, securing 3,532.5m of net debt.

As a result of this decision, the Security Group temporarily Chart 22 entered a more restrictive operating environment in June 2009.
Expected debt maturities nominal m The focus for the year, therefore, was on our cash flows, the level of available facilities and the maturity of our debt.
During the year, we refinanced 650.0m of our existing committed bilateral facilities, extending them in 2,500 to the financial year ending March 2015.
Outside the Security Group, our joint venture in St Davids, Cardiff raised 2,000 a new 290.0m facility, of which 74.4m is currently drawn our share 37.2m.
We also issued an innovative AAA-rated 360.0m amortising bond secured on the income stream from our Government-let property at 1,500 Queen Annes Gate, London SW1.
1,000 Our success in raising new debt and extending existing facilities, together with the cash raised from investment property sales, enabled us to repay 2.1bn of drawn credit facilities in the Security Group by 500 November, which returned the Security Group to the more flexible Tier 1 operating regime.
Cash and committed but undrawn facilities were 2,447.0m.

Hedging Chart 23 We use derivative products to manage our interest-rate exposure, and have a hedging policy which requires at Security Group LTV history % least 80% of our existing debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at 90 fixed interest rates for the coming five years.
Specific interest-rate hedges are also used within our joint ventures 80 to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt.
