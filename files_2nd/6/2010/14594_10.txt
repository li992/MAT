Financial Review Reported sales were up 14.6% at 901.9 million.
On an organic constant currency basis, sales increased by 11.6%.
Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items which management has defined as amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration fair value adjustments, profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses, unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments, gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate see Note 3.
As noted in the 2009 annual report, the definition has been modified for 2010 to include the income statement effects arising from the adoption of IFRS 3 Revised.

Favourable Group finance director movements in foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately 11.9 million 1.5% and revenue from acquisitions contributed 11.6 million 1.5%.
Therefore, on an organic constant currency basis, sales increased by 11.6% year-on-year.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 79% to 142.1 million 2009: 79.2 million.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect of approximately 2.0 million and acquisitions contributed an additional 1.2 million.
On a like-for-like basis, 142.1m therefore, operating profit increased by 59.7 million.
Of this, 73.1 million is due to an Operating profit up 79% increase in gross margin from the higher sales, offset by like-for-like overheads increasing by 13.4 million.
The increase in net overheads is inclusive of the year-on-year increase in restructuring benefits of 12.3 million and the year-on-year decrease in restructuring and post-acquisition integration charges of 13.2 million.
Underlying overheads therefore grew 15.8% by 38.9 million, of which approximately 27 million relates to the reinstatement of costs Operating margins up 5.7pp which were temporarily cut or frozen in 2009 mainly salary-related and certain discretionary costs, and the balance of 11.9 million relates to the increase in variable overhead costs arising from increased sales activity and normal cost inflation.
Operating margins increased from 10.1% to 15.8%.
The year-on-year decrease in net finance costs was 1.2 million from 11.0 million to 9.8 million.
This includes 0.7 million from refinancing the $75 million US private placement which matured in September 2010 with a five-year term loan facility carrying an interest rate of 3.12%, 5.1 percentage points lower than the US private placement note it replaced.
The balance of the year-on-year reduction in net finance costs 0.5 million arises from a reduction in average net debt, offset by an increase in the effective average interest rate caused by holding large cash balances at a lower interest rate.
Profit before tax increased by 94% from 68.2 million to 132.3 million.
Statutory operating profit, after including acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation of 12.3 million 2009: 10.7 million and acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration fair value adjustments of 1.9 million 2009: nil, due to the adoption of IFRS 3 Revised from 1 January 2010, increased by 87% from 68.5 million to 127.9 million.

Of this, 4.1 million is attributable to the fair value of deferred and contingent consideration expected to be paid in future years.
In addition, a further 4.5 million was paid in respect of prior year acquisitions, making the net cash outflow in the year 62.6 million.
An amount of 1.9 million was spent on incidental costs mainly professional fees, which makes the total acquisition-related cash flow in 2010 64.5 million.
The acquisitions mainly took place in the fourth quarter of 2010 and contributed 11.6 million of incremental sales and 1.2 million of operating profit.
Taxation The effective tax rate on adjusted profits was 24.2% 2009: 23.2%, an increase of 1pp, mainly due to a higher proportion of the profits being earned in the more highly taxed USA.
On a statutory basis, the effective tax rate was 19.8% 2009: 21.4%.
The effective tax rate continues to be below the weighted average statutory tax rate of 27.6% 2009: 25.1%, primarily as a consequence of a tax-efficient inter-company financing structure and research and development tax incentives.
Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2010 25 Financial Review continued Earnings per share Earnings per share increased by 91% from 45.4p to 86.6p, reflecting the net impact of a 94% increase in profit before tax slightly offset by the increase in the weighted average number of shares from 115.4 million in 2009 to 115.8 million in 2010, due to company share option exercises satisfied from treasury shares and an increased tax rate.
Statutory basic earnings per share increased by 125% from 36.9p to 83.1p.
The difference between the two measures is shown in the table below.

A major contributory factor to this result was a reduction in working capital during the year of approximately 20 million.
Average working capital and year-end working capital expressed as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.4% 2009: 14.3% and 9.8% 2009: 12.4%, respectively.
This reflects the continuing effort by management to keep working capital to a minimum, despite the increased value of sales.
Capital expenditure during the year equated to 2.1% of sales 2009: 1.8% and, at 18.9 million 2009: 14.2 million, was 115% of depreciation and software amortisation 2009: 85%.
Overall, net debt decreased by 37.7 million 2009: decrease of 38.2 million from 26 Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Highlights Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements 123.9 million to 86.2 million.
Interest cost, excluding the financing charge arising from IAS 19, was covered by operating profit 15.8 times 2009: 7.4 times.
Financing and treasury The group finances its operations from both retained earnings and third-party borrowings, the majority of which are currently at fixed rates of interest.
As at 31 December 2010, the group had 229 million of committed facilities denominated in different currencies, consisting of 99 million of private placements maturing in October 2013, 80 million of revolving credit facilities maturing between October 2011 and September 2012, a five-year 48 million term loan maturing in September 2015 and 2 million from three bank loans secured on property of three of our businesses.
The revolving credit facilities were undrawn at the year end.
In addition, the group had a cash balance of 64.7 million and other uncommitted facilities, mainly in the form of overdraft facilities at our local operations.
At the year end, the groups borrowings amounted to 150.9 million, 99% of which were at fixed interest rates 2009: 94%.
The ageing profile at the year end showed that 1% of the year end borrowing is due to mature within one year 2009: 31% and 99% is due to mature in between one and five years 2009: 69%.
229m Currency Committed facilities The group has both translational and transactional currency exposures.
Translational exposures arise on the consolidation of overseas company results into sterling.
Transactional exposures arise where the currency of sale or purchase invoices differs from the functional currency in which each company prepares its local accounts.
The transactional exposures include situations where 64.7m foreign currency denominated trade debtor, trade creditor and cash balances are held.
Cash balance After matching currency of revenue with currency of costs wherever practical, forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a proportion up to 75% of the remaining forecast net transaction flows where there is reasonable certainty of an exposure.
At 31 December 2010, approximately 61% of the estimated net euro, US dollar and Japanese yen exposures for 2011 were hedged using forward exchange contracts mainly against the Swiss franc, sterling, the euro and the Danish krone.
The largest translational exposures are to the US dollar, euro, Danish krone and Swiss franc.
Translational exposures are not hedged.
The table below shows the key average exchange rates compared to sterling during 2010 and 2009.

Defined benefit pension schemes The company operates a number of pension schemes throughout the group.
The net pension liability in the balance sheet before taking account of the related deferred tax asset of 3.5 million has decreased to 14.1 million 2009: 23.5 million.
The movement can be summarised as follows: m Deficit in defined benefit pension schemes at 1 January 2010 23.5 Gain as a consequence of the UK change in inflation previously indexed to RPI, now CPI 2.9 Actuarial gains 2.4 Contributions in excess of service cost 4.9 Interest costs on pension scheme liabilities net of expected return on pension scheme assets 0.5 Exchange difference and other movements 0.3 Deficit in defined benefit pension schemes at 31 December 2010 14.1 The movement in individual plan deficits is shown in the table below: UK Germany Netherlands Switzerland Total Deficit as at 1 January 2010 14.3 7.0 0.3 1.9 23.5 Decrease increase in deficit 10.6 0.1 0.1 1.0 9.4 Deficit as at 31 December 2010 3.7 7.1 0.4 2.9 14.1 The reduction in the UK deficit is mainly as a consequence of the increase in investment returns arising from a recovery in equity values supplemented by the continuing deficit recovery contributions made to the plan.
These contributions were increased to 2.6 million in 2010 formerly 2.0 million p. a. and augmented by a special funding contribution of 1.9 million made during the year, putting the group on track to eliminate the UK deficit by the end of 2012.
It should be noted that actions taken in earlier years have contained the pension deficit and reduced risk: the UK plan was closed to new members in 1996 and closed to future accruals in 2009.
In addition, the UK plan is largely protected from interest rate and inflation rate volatility due to swaps held by the plan but remains exposed to equity volatility, corporate default and mortality experience.
A programme to reduce equity volatility commenced in 2008 by transitioning towards long-term corporate bond holdings matched to pensioner and deferred pensioner liabilities.
At 31 December 2010, 70% of the UK plans assets excluding swaps were held in corporate bonds with the remainder in equity investments.
In July, the UK government announced that CPI should be used as the basis for statutory minimum pension increases.
The impact of the change to CPI from RPI for the UK plan, where the pension rules mandate inflation according to the deemed statutory index, was a credit to the income statement of 2.9 million within administrative expenses.
The 1.0 million increase in the Swiss deficit arose largely from a combination of adverse exchange rate movements and lower than expected asset returns.
