Financial Review Introduction and summary I am pleased to report solid Invensys has made continued progress on a number of key results for the year despite operational and financial priorities set out at the start of difficult global economic the year.
In response to market conditions we implemented a number of restructuring programmes in Invensys Operations Management Wayne Edmunds and Invensys Controls to improve the efficiency of the cost base Chief Financial Officer and to reposition resources to respond better to global market opportunities.
These actions benefitted the profit performance of Invensys Operations Management and Invensys Controls in the second half of the year.
We are confident that this investment will continue to benefit us significantly in upcoming years.
We maintained good cash and cost management discipline and continued to strengthen our financial position despite difficult market conditions.
Our achievements in this financial year include: Cash conversion of 107%, free cash flow of 100 million and net cash at 31 March 2010 of 363 million.
The Group remains debt free.
We invested in new product development by increasing ourinvestment in research and development spend to 130million, representing 6% of Group revenue.
We also invested in new sales capabilities, particularly in emerging markets, to drive futuregrowth.
We earned an investment grade rating from the Standard & Poors credit rating agency.
We continue to manage our UK Main Pension Scheme inaway that minimises the level of volatility within it.
The conservative investment policy of the Scheme has helped itto cope well with significant movements in the financial markets, and the updated valuation does not have any impact on the expected cash flows under the agreed funding plan.
Our cash flow and balance sheet strength allowed us to raise the total dividends for the year from 1.5 pence per share last year to 3.0 pence per share.
We grew our order book overall and were particularly pleased with our success in winning large infrastructure projects in emerging markets: 40% of the Group order book is now made up of orders from emerging markets.
A detailed look at our financial performance for the year and financial position at the year end is set out in the sections that follow.
