The definitions of these measures are consistent with Gross NAV and Triple NAV as described and shown in the table above.
This definition of Gross NAV requires us to remove any balances for deferred tax on property revaluations and the fair value of derivatives as calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
Triple NAV requires certain of these adjustments to be reinstated and, in addition, a deduction is made for contingent tax which is calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the full inherent gains at the balance sheet date.
