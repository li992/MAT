The risk that we do not comply with existing regulations is mitigated by making compliance a priority throughout all levels of the business and by investing significant resources in our compliance systems and controls.
The risk that existing regulations change such that we can no longer conduct our business efficiently or profitably is mitigated by maintaining strong relationships with regulators and by contributing to any consultations on proposals that might affect our business.

This is supported by ongoing business continuity planning and testing of disaster recovery facilities, as well as maintaining BS ISO IEC 27001:2005 Information Security Management System standards in respect of IT and data security.
Combating online fraud is also paramount and the Group has embedded controls at all process levels to mitigate this risk and these are constantly evolving.
We also use external fraud mitigation software and have built up a highly experienced fraud prevention capability.
In addition, our success is closely aligned to the abilities and experience of our employees.
Our performance could be adversely affected by the loss of the services of key individuals.
In order to mitigate this risk, we seek to create an open and supportive working environment for our employees.
Reward and incentive schemes are regularly reviewed in order to ensure the Group continues to be successful in attracting and retaining the calibre of employees necessary to meet our objectives, while aligning these schemes with our risk appetite, compliance and treating customers fairly objectives.
The Group also has a senior management succession plan in place which is regularly updated.
