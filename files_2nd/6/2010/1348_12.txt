Useful lives of property, plant and equipment We record expenditure for property, plant and equipment at cost.
We depreciate equipment using the straight-line method over its estimated useful economic life which ranges from three to 20 years with a weighted average life of eight years.
We use an estimated residual value of 10% of cost in respect of most types of our rental equipment, although the range of residual values used varies between zero and 30%.
We establish our estimates of useful life and residual value with the objective of allocating most appropriately the cost of property, plant and equipment to our profit and loss account, over the period we anticipate it will be used in our business.
We may need to change these estimates if experience shows that the current estimates are not achieving this objective.
If these estimates change in the future, we may then need to recognise increased or decreased depreciation expense.
Our total depreciation expense in the year ended 30 April 2010 was 187m.
