Rentokil Initial plc Annual report 2010 Business review 21 Financial review Acquisitions The group acquired businesses in the year for a net consideration of 19.6m.
Details of businesses acquired and revenue and operating profit therefrom are set out in note 30 to the accounts.
Pensions The groups total IAS 19 net deficit was 11.9m at the end of 2010 compared with 64.3m at December 2009.
The group has a number of small defined benefit schemes outside the UK but the principal scheme the Scheme is in the UK.
The Scheme had a net surplus of 5.0m at December 2010 compared with a net deficit of 47.9m a year earlier.
This positive movement of 52.9m was due primarily to an increase in the fair value of assets and a 35.0m credit to pension liabilities as a result of using CPI rather than RPI for calculating certain pension increases.
The net surplus comprises the aggregate of the value of the Scheme assets and liabilities: the Scheme assets increased by 69.6m to 1,048.4m driven primarily by an increase in the value of our interest rate swap portfolio.
The Scheme comprises approximately 20% equities and 80% bonds and other financial instruments: and the Scheme liabilities increased by 16.7m to 1,043.4m driven by: a reduction in yield on AA corporate bonds the yield determines the discount factor used to calculate the net present value of the future scheme liabilities the lower the yield, the greater the liabilities.
this was partially compensated for by the use of CPI 3.0% rather than RPI 3.7% as longer-term outlook for inflation this drives our view on future pension increases.
Asset allocation is determined by the pension trustees in conjunction with the company.
The company has commenced discussions with the pension trustees in relation to the triennial valuation of the Scheme as at March 2010 and any funding implications arising from this.
