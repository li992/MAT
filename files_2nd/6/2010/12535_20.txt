Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 16 Financial Review Economic background Oil prices strengthened during the course of 2010 as hopes rose of economic recovery, particularly in Asia.
Brent crude prices averaged US$79.5 bbl for the year, against US$61.7 bbl in 2009.
Premiers portfolio of crudes sells at an average of 20 cents premium to Brent and, taking into account the timing of our crude oil liftings, average actual realisations for the year were US$79.7 bbl 2009: US$66.3 bbl.
Stronger economic conditions in South and South East Asia provided a positive backdrop for our gas operations in these regions.
Total gas demand in Singapore, driven by increasing population and new industrial developments, mainly on Jurong Island, rose from 814 BBtud in 2009 to 872 BBtud in 2010.
According to independent analysts, it is expected to continue to rise over the next few years, allowing our gas sales to steadily increase above current contracted levels.
Though LNG import facilities are now under construction in Singapore, there continues to be good prospects for additional pipeline gas sales in the future.
Offtake under our existing gas sales contracts in 2010 averaged 160 BBtud 2009: 153 BBtud with the share of the Premier-operated Block A rising from 41 per cent to 45 per cent, due to strong production performance from the Anoa field.
In Pakistan, gas remains a critical component of the countrys energy needs, meeting around 45 per cent of total energy requirement.
Total domestic gas production has remained at around 4 billion cubic feet bcf per day and with demand continuing to grow at around 10 per cent per annum, an increasing production shortfall is likely to arise in the coming years.
With significant gas reserves remaining, we are well placed to maintain or increase production through additional compression facilities and development drilling.
Income statement Production levels in 2010, on a working interest basis, averaged 42.8 kboepd 2009: 44.2 kboepd.
On an entitlement basis, which under the terms of our PSCs allows for additional Tony Durrant government take at higher oil prices, production was 38.3 Finance Director kboepd 2009: 40.2 kboepd.
Working interest gas production averaged 156 mmscfd 2009: 156 mmscfd during the year, or approximately 63 per cent of total production.
Average gas prices for the group were US$6.26 mscf 2009: US$5.18 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, which are linked to HSFO pricing, in turn closely linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$13.9 mscf 2009: US$11.0 mscf for the year.
Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 17 Profit after tax is a record US$129.8 million.
Cash flow from operating activities increased by 25 per cent to US$436.0 million.
Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong.
Production Total sales revenue from all operations reached record levels of US$763.6 million 2009: US$621.1 million 2008-2012 driven by the higher commodity prices.
Cost of sales was US$530.5 million 2009: US$361.4 million.
kboepd Unit operating costs were US$13.9 per barrel of oil equivalent boe 2009: US$12.2 boe reflecting 80 higher unit costs in the UK sector as production levels declined.
70 60 The tie-in in October 2010 of the Burghley field to our Balmoral facility in the UK North Sea will have 50 a positive impact on unit costs during 2011 and beyond as Balmoral complex costs will now be 40 shared pro rata to production levels.
30 20 Amortisation and depreciation includes an impairment charge of US$65.3 million relating to the 10 Scott and Balmoral fields in the UK 2009: US$24.0 million for the Chinguetti field in Mauritania 0 09 10 11 12 which mainly arose as a result of a significant increase in estimated future decommissioning costs.
Estimated The charge was calculated using a long-term Brent crude oil price of US$75 bbl 2009: US$70 bbl.
Underlying unit amortisation excluding impairment rose to US$12.6 boe 2009: US$9.6 boe largely as a result of increasing future abandonment provisions.
Exploration expense and pre-licence exploration costs amounted to US$68.2 million 2009: US$57.0 Reserves and resources million and US$18.9 million 2009: US$20.3 million respectively.
This includes the write-off of 2006-2010 exploration wells Oates, Bugle North, Greater Luno in the UK and Norway sectors.
It also includes Reserves Resources the effect of an impairment charge of US$12.8 million in respect of the Banda field in Mauritania.
mmboe 600 Despite extensive discussions with the Mauritanian Government, no agreement has been reached 500 on the nature or terms of a future gas development and it is felt appropriate to write-off capitalised 400 costs relating to this asset.
300 Net administrative costs were stable at US$18.3 million 2009: US$18.3 million.
200 Operating profits were US$127.7 million 2009: US$169.7 million.
Finance costs and other charges, 100 net of interest revenue and other gains, were US$65.5 million 2009: US$28.7 million reflecting lower 0 07 08 09 10 levels of interest income and higher levels of borrowing costs as borrowings from our capital investment programmes increased.
Also included in finance costs were fees of US$15.6 million 2009: US$10.5 million largely relating to the refinancing of US$1.1 billion of Premiers bank facilities in November 2010.
The charge arising due to the unwinding of the discounted decommissioning provision increased to US$16.2 million 2009: US$8.7 million reflecting the increase in total Profit after tax decommissioning provisions.
2006-2010 $ million Pre-tax profits of US$100.8 million 2009: US$79.9 million also reflect a positive adjustment of 140 US$38.6 million in respect of the groups commodity hedge portfolio 2009: US$61.1 million, charge.
120 This was driven by the unwinding of prior year provisions in respect of our oil and gas hedges.
100 80 The current tax charge for 2010 is US$61.4 million, an effective tax rate of 48 per cent of operating 60 profits.
This charge is offset by a deferred tax credit of US$90.4 million, resulting in a net tax credit of 40 US$29.0 million 2009: US$33.1 million, credit.
The deferred tax credit arises from the setting up of an 20 additional deferred tax asset of US$94.7 million, reflecting higher expected utilisation of UK tax losses 0 in line with generally increased oil prices.
As at year-end the group had an estimated US$1,112 million 07 08 09 10 of carried forward UK allowances, of which it is anticipated that US$972 million will be utilised in future years based on a long-term oil price of US$75 bbl.
This has resulted in recognition of a total deferred tax asset of US$278.2 million.
Profit after tax is therefore a record US$129.8 million 2009: US$113.0 million resulting in basic earnings per share of 111.9 cents 2009: US$104.1 cents.
Cash flow Cash flow from operating activities was US$436.0 million 2009: US$347.7 million after accounting for tax payments of US$67.9 million 2009: US$71.5 million.
Capital expenditure in 2010 totalled US$514.1 million 2009: US$303.1 million.

Following a successful refinancing in November 2010, total bank facilities amount to US$1,572 million.
As at year-end, drawn borrowings were US$485 million and issued letters of credit and performance bonds were US$185 million.
Undrawn facilities were therefore US$902 million, which, together with cash on hand, amounted to US$1,202 million.
Financial risk management Commodity prices The Boards commodity pricing and hedging policy continues to be to lock in oil and gas price floors for a proportion of expected future production at a level which ensures that investment programmes for sanctioned projects are adequately funded.
Floors are purchased for cash or via collars, funded by selling caps at a ceiling price.
This policy has provided sensible downside protection for the company over the period since 2008 and going forward to 2012, during which period over US$1 billion will have been invested in new development projects.
The requirement for future hedging for 2013 and beyond will be considered as new projects are sanctioned, taking into account expected future cash flows of the group and the size of the relevant investment programme.
At year-end, a total of 5.0 million barrels mmbbls of Dated Brent oil were hedged via collars for the period to end 2012 with an average floor price of US$47 bbl and an average cap of US$87 bbl.
This volume represents approximately 26 per cent of the groups expected liquids production over the period.
282,000 metric tonnes mt of HSFO, which drives our gas contract pricing in Singapore, was subject to collars covering the period to mid-2013.
These have a cap of US$500 mt equivalent to around US$85 bbl and represent around 19 per cent of our expected Indonesian gas production over the same period.
During 2010, oil price collars for 3.2 mmbbls and fuel oil collars for 120,000 metric tonnes expired at a cost of US$2.7 million 2009: US$nil.
In addition, forward sales of 0.4 mmbbls, transacted at the time of the Oilexco acquisition in May 2009, and a further 1.0 mmbbls sold forward in 2010, also matured, with a cash cost of US$5.4 million.
No forward sales were outstanding at year-end.
06 Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 19 Oil hedges are now incorporated within the pricing terms of physical offtake agreements, avoiding the requirement to revalue the outstanding hedges.
A credit of US$18.2 million 2009: US$8.5 million arises in respect of past mark to market provisions for oil hedges which have now expired.
Gas price hedging is still required to be marked to market as the hedges are held by counterparties independent of physical product sales.
A credit of US$20.4 million 2009: US$26.9 million, charge arises in respect of such mark to market movements, resulting in a total credit to the income statement of US$38.6 million in respect of commodity contracts 2009: US$61.1 million, charge.
Foreign exchange Premiers functional and reporting currency is US dollars.
Exchange rate exposures relate only to local currency receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Local currency needs are acquired on a short-term basis.
The group recorded a loss of US$0.4 million on such short-term hedging during 2010 2009: US$2.8 million, gain.
Interest rates Although the groups borrowing facilities are defined in floating rate terms, substantially all current drawings effectively have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates.
On average, therefore, the cost of drawn bank funds for the year was 5.2 per cent.
Mark to market movements on these interest rate swaps amounted to US$12.1 million 2009: US$0.8 million, charged to other comprehensive income.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view to minimising counterparty risks.
Insurance The group undertakes a significant insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with its exploration, development and production activities.
In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields.
Going concern The group monitors its capital position and its liquidity risk regularly throughout the year to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements.
Sensitivities are run to reflect latest expectations of expenditures, forecast oil and gas prices and other negative economic scenarios in order to manage the risk of funds shortfalls or covenant breaches and to ensure the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Despite economic volatility, the directors consider that the expected operating cash flows of the group and the headroom provided by the available borrowing facilities gives them confidence that the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern.
As a result, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Business risks Premier is an international business which has to face a variety of strategic, operational, financial and external risks.
Under these distinct classes, the company has identified certain risks pertinent to its business including: exploration and reserve risks, loss of key human resources, drilling and operating risks, security risk in area of operations, costs and availability of materials and services, economic and sovereign risks, market risk, foreign currency risk, loss of or changes to production sharing or concession agreements, joint venture or related agreements, and volatility of future oil and gas prices.
Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our assets, personnel and reputation.
Premier manages its risks prudently by maintaining a balanced portfolio, through compliance with the terms of its agreements and strict application of appropriate policies and procedures, and through the recruitment and retention of highly skilled individuals throughout the organisation.
Further, the company has mitigated risks by focusing its activities mainly in known hydrocarbon basins in jurisdictions that have previously established long-term oil and gas ventures with foreign oil and gas companies, existing infrastructure of services and oil and gas transportation facilities, and reasonable proximity to markets.
A summary of the principal risks facing the company and the way in which these risks are mitigated is provided on the companys website www.
