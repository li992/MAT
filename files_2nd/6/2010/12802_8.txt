Basic EPS 14.4p 36.1p 60 % The Group operates in two business segments: Punch Partnerships, a leased estate and Punch Pub Company, a managed estate.
The results of both business segments have been impacted by the strategic disposal programme, reduced consumer spending and upward cost pressures.
Pub numbers have reduced as the Group has focused on generating cash flow and strengthening the balance sheet through the disposal of underperforming or non core assets.

and brought forward tax losses.
As a result, no cash tax was paid in the year as compared with a net receipt of 8m in 2009. Financing costs Net underlying financing costs decreased by 18% to 239m in the year, principally due to the repayment of 684m of debt, 647m of which was ahead of schedule.
The weighted average interest rate for Group loans and borrowings, including the effect of interest rate swaps, at the balance sheet date was 6.8%.

Business review Financial review continued Exceptional items In order to provide a trend measure of underlying performance, profit is presented excluding items which we consider will distort comparability, whether due to their significant non recurring nature or as a result of specific accounting treatments.
9% Exceptional operating costs primarily relate to 218m impairment losses recognised due to further weakening in trading in our non core pubs.
The 209m impairment recognised within the leased division followed a review of the entire estate in which c. 1,300 pubs have been identified as non core, being considered not sustainable as pubs in the long term as having a higher alternative use value.
These pubs are likely to be sold or converted for alternative use within the next five years, and have been written down to their fair value, being the higher of their value in use and market values.
The 9m impairment recognised in the managed division relates to pubs which were actively being marketed for disposal at the year end and which have been written down to their fair value less costs to sell.
Accounting standards require that impairment charges are recognised in the income statement.
Uplifts in value are only reflected in the financial statements to the extent that they reverse a previous impairment charge.
Included within the impairment charge for the year are reversals on impairment losses previously recognised of 26m.
The impairment reversals are due to the forecast fair value less costs to sell being in excess of book values which had previously been written down to value in use, based on expected future cash flows.
Exceptional operating costs include 33m of additional provision for onerous leases, of which 12m is due to the lease reversions in the year.
In addition, the Group made a loss on pub disposal amounting to 6m, and 9m on disposal of goodwill, representing the apportioned value of goodwill allocated to those pubs disposed in the year.
Also included within exceptional operating costs is 2m of reorganisation costs following the further simplification of our organisational structure in the year.
The Group has continued to benefit from opportunities to purchase portions of its debt at prices below par resulting in an exceptional net credit of 44m being recognised in the year.
In addition, there was an exceptional financing charge of 68m, which arose from the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Whilst the interest rate swaps are considered to be effective in matching the amortising profile of existing floating rate borrowings, they either did not meet the definition of an effective hedge due to the relative size of the mark to market difference of the swaps at the date of acquisition or there have been changes to expected future maturity profiles.
The tax effect of the above items, together with the finalisation of prior year tax matters with HMRC had the net effect of a 37m tax credit in the year.

Capital structure At 21 August 2010 the share price was 77p compared with 103p at the start of the financial year, and at the year end date the market capitalisation of the Group was 496m.
During the year, 0.5m new shares were issued on the exercise of share based awards, for nil cash proceeds.
Following the successful completion of our placing and open offer in July last year, all of the convertible debt has been repaid.
At the year end, the nominal value of net debt amounted to 3,143m, compared to 3,465m at August 2009.
Following the repayment of our convertible bond, all of our debt is in the form of long term mortgage type finance, secured on our sizeable freehold property portfolio.
The debt fully repays over terms extending to 25 years and is all effectively at fixed rates of interest.
As with all debt finance of this type, there are covenant and performance tests.
We have three debt finance vehicles: Punch A, Punch B and Spirit, all of which have a key Debt Service Cover Ratio DSCR test.
Headroom in this key financial covenant has been maintained by our actions in repaying certain tranches of debt and by utilising cash held outside the debt structures to improve the operating margin performance within the debt structures.
