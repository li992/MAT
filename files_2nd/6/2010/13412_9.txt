The Closures division, which comprises beverage and specialty closures but excludes the High Barrier food container business, is currently being marketed for disposal.
Consequently, pursuant to accounting standards, it is presented in these financial statements within discontinued operations.
Further details of the trading results of Closures and the accounting impact of its potential disposal are set out in discontinued operations on page 30.
As the disposal of Closures has not been completed and the reclassification to discontinued operations was effected on 31 December 2010, we consider it appropriate to present certain parts of this financial review on a combined basis to provide a complete picture of group overview the Groups results for the year.
