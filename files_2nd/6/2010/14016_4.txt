Group management The Groups principal underlying aerospace market demand drivers are global passenger air miles, air freight demand, large commercial and regional and business jet build rates, and military aerospace programme spending in particular by the US Government.
Within land vehicle and energy markets, the principal demand drivers are Aerospace Flexonics passenger vehicle sales in North America, Europe and Brazil, divisional divisional mediumand heavy-duty diesel truck sales in North America and management management capital project spending in the global petrochemical and power generation industries.
Long-term forecasts for trends in these demand drivers are generally positive, which are anticipated to Aerospace Flexonics provide the foundation for future sustainable growth in revenue, operational operational profitability and associated cash flows from the Groups organic management management product portfolio.

However in response, in areas impact on profitability.
where these products have been retained, the Group successfully employs a strategy of retaining commercial and engineering expertise close to customers locations, principally in North America and Europe, so enabling effective support to be readily given to its customers whilst moving manufacturing selectively to low-cost country locations.
Some years ago the Group set up an operation in Mexico and is actively engaged in new aerospace programme bids to expand this facility.
Similarly, the Group is increasingly manufacturing products, in the Flexonics Division, in its lower cost operations in the Czech Republic, South Africa, Brazil and India.
Other low-cost country alternatives will also be considered at the appropriate time.

Recent significant actions taken include the closure of all North American non-union plans to new members, increases in contribution rates in the UK, a cap on future increases in pensionable salary of 2% implemented in the UK in 2009, and implementation of liability-driven investment strategies in all defined benefit pension plans.
A revised 10-year funding plan has recently been submitted to the UK Pensions Regulator, based on the actuarial valuation of the UK pension plan undertaken in April 2010.
Under this plan the Group is committed to contributing an additional 6.9m per annum above service cost previously 4.9m for the next nine years.
Given the Groups strong cash generation in 2009 and 2010, additional discretionary payments of 19m in total, over the two years, were made into the Groups pension plans over and above the level of payments that had been agreed with the plans Trustees.

The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on operations trading activities in foreign currencies.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Cash flow forecasts are produced monthly, together with appropriate capacity planning and scenario analysis, to ensure that bank covenant and liquidity targets will be met.
In considering the appropriate level of net debt the Group pays close attention to its level as compared to the cash generation potential of the Group, measured by adjusted profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
All of the Groups external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x.
At 31 December 2010 net debt was 0.7x the Groups level of EBITDA 31 December 2009 1.3x with significant funding headroom of 147m under the Groups committed borrowing facilities.

Engineering capability and manufacturing technology A key strength of the Group is its engineering capability and manufacturing technology.
The Group possesses significant product design and manufacturing engineering capabilities, which are essential to support the development of precision components for customers and improve production processes to help maximise production efficiency and product quality.
This in turn maintains and enhances the Groups reputation for delivering quality added-value products to its customers on time and at a competitive price.
