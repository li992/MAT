In addition, we announced our next generation 2010 has been another excellent and exciting year for Inmarsat service offering, Global Xpress, and are extremely excited by both from a financial and operational perspective.
We managed the incremental opportunities and long-term prospects which to deliver solid revenue and EBITDA growth and continue to this programme offers in the future.
However, our focus remains deliver substantial expansion in our operating cash ows.
We on growing our existing core business and delivering maximum ended the year with a strong balance sheet and signi cant value to shareholders, which we believe we are well positioned available liquidity.

based on the growth of normalised free cash ow, we are pleased to report that we have raised our dividend by 10% year-over-year.
As mentioned, 2010 has been an exciting year operationally.
Last year we commented on the acquisition of Segovia which We have reported solid revenue growth for the Group as a whole, was completed on 12 January 2010 for an initial consideration of but in particular Inmarsat Globals MSS business has again US$110.0m.
Additional amounts may be payable depending on delivered impressive performances in the aeronautical sector and the performance of the acquired business over the three years in leasing.
MSS growth has been driven by services such as following the acquisition.

The contingent consideration element relating to 2010 is estimated Our Stratos business has maintained its market share of Inmarsat at US$13.0m and will be paid during 2011.
We accounted for Globals MSS revenues of approximately 40%, which is US$10.9m of the contingent consideration as part of the initial encouraging given the increased competition and pricing purchase accounting, with the additional US$2.1m, which arose pressures within the distribution channel.

Whilst we are very pleased with the progress this year, the economic climate continues to look uncertain, especially in our In August 2010, we announced a major new investment project core government and maritime markets.

Global Xpress will be supported by a global impact of migration to new services and continuing competition network of Ka-band satellites, the Inmarsat-5 generation, and in our traditional MSS sectors, particularly maritime and will be primarily focused on providing super-high bandwidth aeronautical, means that we are cautious on our prospects for services to the wider maritime, energy, aeronautical and revenue growth in 2011.

The increase is due Depreciation and amortisation The increase in depreciation and amortisation of US$3.0m is due primarily to increased underlying Group revenues and EBITDA, the inclusion of revenue in respect of our Cooperation to the inclusion of the results of Segovia from 12 January 2010 and depreciation of assets relating to our Global Satellite Phone Agreement with LightSquared, the inclusion of Segovias results from 12 January 2010 and decreased net interest payable.

Income tax expense Gain on disposal of assets The tax charge for 2010 was US$72.4m, an increase of US$28.3m, or 64%, compared with 2009.
The increase in the tax charge is No gain on disposal of assets was recognised during 2010.
The gain on disposal of assets recognised during 2009 of US$2.1m largely driven by the underlying increase in pro ts for 2010 and the inclusion of the results of Segovia from 12 January 2010. arose from the transfer and disposal of assets by Stratos.
The effective tax rate for 2010 was 21.7% compared to 22.4% for Share of results of associates During 2010, we recorded US$1.2m in respect of earnings from 2009.
The 2010 effective tax rate was reduced by US$7.0m of non-recurring current year tax bene ts and a US$13.5m credit on associates compared to US$0.9m during 2009.
The earnings from associates arose from equity accounted investments held prior year tax positions.
The 2009 effective tax rate was reduced due to a one-off tax credit of US$8.8m recognised during 2009, by Stratos.
which arose from the recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to unutilised capital allowances in Stratos UK entities.
Acquisition-related adjustments During 2010, we recorded an adjustment of US$2.1m relating to Pro t for the period increased contingent consideration in respect of our acquisition of Segovia.
In line with IFRS 3 2008, the contingent consideration As a result of the factors discussed above, pro t for 2010 was US$261.1m, an increase of US$108.3m, or 71%, compared adjustment is charged as an expense to the income statement.
This is due to the better-than-expected performance of Segovia with 2009. against the earn-out targets in 2010.
During 2009, we recorded a US$8.8m adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill Earnings per share For 2010, basic and diluted earnings per share for pro t following the recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to unutilised capital allowances arising in Stratoss UK entities.
attributable to the equity holders of the Company were 57 cents US$ and 57 cents US$, respectively, compared with 33 cents Operating pro t US$ and 35 cents US$, respectively for 2009.
As a result of the factors discussed above, operating pro t during 2010 was US$460.6m, an increase of US$103.8m, or 29%, compared with 2009.

The decrease re ects the changes in the VDS discussed above and lower revenues from the services remaining eligible for VDS.
Although we removed our BGAN services from the VDS, we have implemented certain price reductions for BGAN services, resulting in a neutral position for wholesale BGAN prices.
INMARSAT GLOBAL MSS REVENUE BY SECTOR 2009 Maritime Sector Maritime 52% During 2010, revenues from the maritime sector were US$360.6m, Land mobile 22% an increase of US$3.6m, or 1.0%, compared with 2009.

However, we believe that the accelerated adoption of our FleetBroadband service has partially constrained BGAN PROGRESSION REVENUE AND ACTIVE TERMINAL NUMBERS our rate of revenue growth as the price of services using US$m 000 FleetBroadband is typically less than the price of equivalent 120 60 services on the terminals being replaced or upgraded.
However, 117.4 over time, we expect to offset this effect through usage growth in 98.7 100 50 response to increased service capability and faster speeds 49.2 available through FleetBroadband.
Although a lesser factor, 80 74.4 40 competition from VSAT service offerings has also increased since the announcement of our Global Xpress service.
In addition, we 60 30 33.6 believe the challenging economic and competitive environment 27.6 36.6 40 20 for the shipping industry during 2010 has also impacted our rate of revenue growth when compared to prior periods.
