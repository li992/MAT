Investment revenue anG finance costs Investment revenue and finance costs totalled a net cost of 27.4m 2009: 35.0m, a decrease of 7.6m.
The decrease excluding currency effects was 7.4m.
The principal reasons for this decrease were reduced average borrowings during the year, lower interest rates and a decrease in the net pension finance cost.
$GMusteG Srot EeIore ta[ Adjusted profit before tax was 231.3m, an increase of 18.8%.
Excluding currency effects the adjusted profit before tax margin was 5.3%, an increase of 40 basis points.
7a[ The tax charge of 57.1m 2009: 46.9m represents an effective rate of 26.7%, compared with 26.5% in 2009.
The slight increase in the rate is principally due to changes in the mix of taxable profits across the Group.
1.6 Earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS rose by 17.5% to 34.69p.
EPS and adjusted EPS are calculated on an average share base of 491.5m during the year 2009: 486.6m.
The increase in the average share base principally resulted from a full weighting of shares issued during 2009.

indd 53 14 03 2011 14:29 Section 3 Finance Review 2. Dividend Sercos policy is to increase the total dividend each year broadly in line with the increase in underlying earnings.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 5.15p per share, representing an increase on the 2009 final dividend of 17.0%, and bringing the total dividend for the year to 7.35p, a growth of 17.6%.
The final dividend will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 17 May 2011 to shareholders on the register as at 11 March 2011.
&DVK RZ The Group generated an exceptionally strong free cash performance with an inow of 185.8m 2009: 137.3m, an increase of 35.3%.
This included benets of around 20m from asset sales proceeds, a particularly high level of joint venture dividends and low tax payments.
Figure 2 analyses the cash ow.
As in previous years, we have designed the analysis to show the underlying cash performance of the Group the cash ows generated by subsidiaries plus the dividends received from joint ventures.
It therefore differs from the consolidated cash ow on page 108, which proportionately consolidates the cash ows of joint ventures.
The adjustment line in Figure 2 reconciles the movement in Group cash to the consolidated cash ow.

1 roup operating cash oZ Group operating cash ow of 225.3m 2009: 198.8m reects a conversion of Group EBITDA into cash of 88.0% 2009: 88.0%.
The working capital movement of 30.6m reects the requirements of a growing business.
3.2 Interest Net interest paid was 25.2m, compared to 31.5m in 2009 reecting the reduction in Group recourse net debt since 2009 and lower interest rates.
The reduction in tax paid during 2010 is due to increases in accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences in the period, additional tax relief on the December 2010 special pension contribution and tax refunds received during the year.
In 2011, we expect the cash tax rate to trend closer to our effective tax rate.
This is principally as a result of a higher proportion of overseas taxable profits which more than offsets the benefit of the tax relief on the special pension contribution.
1et e[penGiture on tangiEOe anG intangiEOe assets Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets in the year was 41.8m 2009: 49.8m.
Gross expenditure, excluding disposals, was 51.1m 2009: 52.3m representing 1.4% of Group revenue excluding joint ventures 2009: 1.6%.
On 30 June 2010, as part of forming a strategic partnership with Patni Computer Systems Ltd. Patni, a leading global provider of Information Technology services and business solutions, to provide services in education and e-learning in the UK and Irish markets, we disposed of a Learning software product to Patni.
Cash realised from the sale was 7.0m and profit on disposal of this asset was 1.4m.
In 2011, we are planning to invest around 20m in the implementation of SAP for HR across the Group.
'iviGenGs Irom Moint ventures Dividends received from joint ventures totalled 51.5m 2009: 46.3m, reecting an uncharacteristically high conversion rate of joint ventures profit after tax and non controlling interests into dividends.
This high rate reected the impairment charge of 4.2m resulting from our exit from the non-core South African joint venture Equity Aviation.
Excluding this, the conversion rate of dividends from joint ventures was approximately 95%.
In 2011, we expect the conversion rate to be closer to the normal rate of 80-90%.
3.6 Financing The movement in nancing resulted primarily from repayments on our bank facilities and non recourse debt.

The debt is excluded from all of our credit agreements and other covenant calculations, and therefore has no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Group non recourse debt reduced by 5.3m to 23.7m, as a result of 7.6m payments made in line with the debt repayment schedule on debt relating to our Driver Examination Services contract in Canada, offset by 2.3m increase in non recourse debt due to exchange movements.

Pensions The Group operates a number of dened benefit schemes and dened contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2010, the net liability included in the balance sheet arising from our dened benefit pension scheme obligations was 83.0m 2009: 113.6m, on a pension scheme asset base of 1.5bn.

Within this charge, the Groups contributions to UK and other dened contribution pension schemes increased to 76.0m 2009: 64.8m.
The service charge relating to the Groups dened benefit schemes was 30.5m 2009: 27.6m, and the movement was principally as a result of changes to the discount rate and ination assumptions as at the end of 2009 and increases in payroll.
Serco has three main types of scheme which are accounted for as dened benefit pension schemes.
Each type has its own accounting treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards.
These are: O Non contract specic schemes which do not relate to specic contracts or franchises.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss for the year to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the SOCI : O Reimbursable schemes where we have a right of full cost reimbursement and therefore include both the pension scheme deficit and offsetting reimbursable rights debtor in the balance sheet: and O Not certain to be reimbursable schemes relating to specic contracts or franchises, where the deficit will pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss on our share of the deficit for the year to the SOCI, recognise a recoverable intangible asset on the balance sheet at the start of the contract or franchise and amortise the intangible asset to the income statement over the contract or franchise life.

indd 57 14 03 2011 14:29 Section 3 Finance Review Serco has limited commercial risk in relation to the contract specic schemes, due to either the right of cost reimbursement or because the deficit will, in general, pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
Among our non contract specic schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
At 31 December 2010, SPLAS had a deficit of 16.4m 2009: deficit of 54.7m.
This deficit, which is calculated under IAS 19 using market rates at the period end, reects the effect of the market conditions on investment returns in the year and the net impact of a decrease in ination assumptions offset by a decrease in the applicable discount rate.
We have now completed the regular triennial review of SPLAS.
The actuarial deficit of SPLAS used in the review and calculated using prudent long-term valuation assumptions, was 141m at 6 April 2009 and was approximately 93m at 31 December 2010.
Following this review, the Group agreed with the Trustees to make a cash contribution of 60m to the scheme, with 20m paid in December 2010 and 40m in January 2011.
We continue to review the level of benets and contributions under the scheme in the light of our business needs and changes to pension legislation.
Figure 5 shows the sensitivity of the liabilities of our pension schemes to changes in discount rates and to adjustments in the actuarial assumptions for the rate of ination, members salary increases and life expectancies.

Treasury The Groups bank credit facilities comprise a 400.0m syndicated revolving credit facility, a syndicated amortising term loan for US Dollar 396.4m and bilateral revolving credit facilities for 35.0m and EUR 12.5m.
The syndicated revolving credit facility matures in September 2013 whilst the syndicated term loan is repayable between September 2011 and September 2013.
The bilateral facilities mature in December 2011 and April 2012 respectively.
In relation to the syndicated term loan, the next scheduled repayment of US Dollar 138m is due in September 2011.
As at 31 December 2010, 329.8m had been drawn down on these combined facilities 2009: 457.7m.
Excluding the effects of currency on the US Dollar denominated debt, the equivalent draw down would have been 320m.
In addition to the bank credit facilities, Serco has loan notes in issue under a private placement of 117.7m, which will be repaid evenly from 2011 to 2015.
All of the credit facilities of the Group detailed above are unsecured.
Going concern The directors have acknowledged the guidance Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009, published by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2009.
Whilst the current economic environment remains uncertain, the broad base of our contract portfolio and with over 90% of our customers being government bodies, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks as discussed in the section Principal Risks and Uncertainties successfully and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Groups revenues are largely derived from long-term contracts with governments which, historically, have been largely unaffected by changes in the general economy.
The contract portfolio is spread across a number of markets, sectors and geographies such that a downturn in any one segment is unlikely to affect the Group as a whole.
In addition, with an order book of 16.6bn and high visibility of future revenue streams 92% in 2011: 77% in 2012 and 66% in 2013, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks despite the current uncertain economic climate.
In September 2008, the Group secured medium-term nancing by entering into a five year syndicated revolving credit facility and bilateral facilities.
Including the term loan and US private placements, the Group has in excess of 816m of committed credit facilities.
As at 31 December 2010, the headroom on the facilities was approximately 369m.
The next repayment on these facilities falls due in September 2011 for an amount of US Dollar 138m.
The Group fully expects to meet this repayment through internally generated cash ows.
Based on the information set out above, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
