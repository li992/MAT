The Rank Group Plc: Annual report and financial statements 2010 36 Financial risk Going concern The Groups financial risk management strategy focuses on In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial theminimisation of risks for the Group.
The Groups funding, statements the directors have considered the issues impacting foreign exchange, liquidity, counterparty and interest rate risks theGroup during 2010 as detailed in the business review above are managed by the Groups treasury department in accordance and have reviewed the Groups projected compliance with its withapproved policies and are subject to internal audit review.
Based on the Groups cash All significant financing transactions and treasury policies are flow forecasts and operating budgets, and assuming that trading authorised by the board of directors.
Implementation of these does not deteriorate considerably from current levels, the policies is closely managed by the finance director and the directors believe that the Group will generate sufficient cash grouptreasury manager.
The treasury function is not run as tomeet its requirements for at least the next 12 months and aprofit centre.
Accordingly the adoption The key financial risks impacting the Group are liquidity risk, ofthe going concern basis remains appropriate.
interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Group has limited exposure to foreign exchange and this is not considered a key risk.
i Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available to pay obligations when they fall due.
Quarterly cash flow forecasts are prepared that identify the requirements of the Group and these are regularly updated to ensure sufficient financial headroom exists for at least 12 months.
This is coupled with a regular review of medium term funding requirements which, in particular, are updated alongside the Groups strategic plan process.
The Group negotiated new medium term facilities in 2007, as noted above, which mitigate the liquidity risk it may face.
ii Interest rate risk The Groups operating cash flows are independent of changes ininterest rates.
The Group primarily finances itself through syndicated bank facilities and the public debt market.
The bank facilities are multi-currency although borrowings are typically drawn in Sterling and euros at floating interest rates.
The Group currently has only US $14.3m of public bonds outstanding, which mature in 2018.
The Group normally uses interest rate swaps, caps and collars to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations and at the end of December 2010, 11% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates.
Group policy is to maintain between 40% and 60% of its borrowing at fixed rates.
The current low interest rates combined with the high cost of moving to fixed rates have led the Group to continue to operate outside of this policy for the time being.
iii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may not be able to settleamounts owing in full, when due.
Surplus cash is invested in short term financial instruments using a limited number of financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
Counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly and credit limits set to avoid significant concentration of risk with any one counterparty.
