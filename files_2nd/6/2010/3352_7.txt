Basic and adjusted earnings per share Basic earnings per share were 63.9 pence 2009: 38.1 pence.
Adjusted earnings per share were 66.1 pence 2009: 55.0 pence.
A reconciliation between basic and adjusted earnings per share is set out in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements on page 79.
Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude items not relating to underlying business performance, are considered to provide a better indication of Charters underlying performance.
The items excluded are exceptional items, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, acquisition costs, the non-cash net nancing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including in each case attributable tax and non-controlling interests.
Net exceptional costs in the year were 1.5 million, comprising restructuring costs of 9.9 million, of which 8.3 million relates to ESAB and 1.6 million relates to Howden, and a curtailment gain on cessation of certain US post employment medical benets in ESAB of 8.4 million.
In 2011, it is anticipated that there will be a further charge in respect of the restructuring of ESAB.
Amortisation and impairment of acquired goodwill and intangibles in the year was 5.8 million and includes an impairment charge of 3.2 million against the balance sheet carrying value of the Romar brand due to increasing sales by Romar under the ESAB brand.
Amortisation of acquired goodwill and intangibles was 2.6 million in the year, of which 1.4 million relates to ESAB and 1.2 million relates to Howden.

The total tax charge in the year of 25.2 million compares with tax paid of 36.5 million.
The tax charge is lower than the actual tax paid in the year primarily due to the net recognition of additional deferred tax assets in the year and the settlement of prior year tax liabilities.
Currency Charters results are sensitive to movements in exchange rates.
The translation impact of exchange rate movements on segmental sales and adjusted operating profit in 2010 is set out below: Underlying 2009 movement translated at constant at 2010 exchange exchange Currency 2010 rates rates uctuations 2009 m m m m m Revenue ESAB 1,157.6 95.0 1,062.6 31.2 1,031.4 Howden 562.0 82.4 644.4 16.6 627.8 Total 1,719.6 12.6 1,707.0 47.8 1,659.2 Adjusted operating profit ESAB 89.3 18.4 70.9 4.9 66.0 Howden 67.8 6.3 74.1 2.6 71.5 Central operations 11.2 0.7 11.9 11.9 Total 145.9 12.8 133.1 7.5 125.6 If the average rates of exchange in 2010 had prevailed in 2009, revenue and adjusted operating profit for 2009 would have been higher by 47.8 million 2.9 per cent and 7.5 million 6.0 per cent, respectively.
However, this is only the translation impact of currency movements.
It excludes the impact of currency movements on transactions when products are manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another.
The transaction impact of currency movements is not believed to have had a significant impact on the results for the year.

Cash, borrowings and facilities The net cash balance at 31 December 2010 of 1.8 million comprised cash balances of 83.3 million 31 December 2009: 75.6 million, and gross borrowings of 81.5 million 31 December 2009: 24.7 million.
Certain amounts of cash were held in various overseas jurisdictions for local working capital purposes or pending dividend payments and the remainder was held with a range of banks in the United Kingdom.
The credit status of institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
At 31 December 2010, in addition to net cash balances of 1.8 million, Charter had undrawn centrally-held committed borrowing facilities of 116.0 million.
These facilities, which total 170.0 million, are due to expire unless otherwise extended or renewed between 2011 and 2013.
Two of these facilities have been renewed since the year-end such that the total amount of facilities has increased to 185.0 million.
One facility for 25.0 million is due to expire in 2011.
The remaining facilities of 160.0 million have maturity dates that range between 2012 and 2015.
All these facilities are unsecured.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial and other covenants, the financial strength of Charter means that the covenants attaching to these facilities are not expected to prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required.
In addition, various other subsidiary undertakings have uncommitted and committed bank facilities in place, some of which are secured, to meet local funding requirements.
At 31 December 2010, Charter had 282.7 million of uncommitted bonding facilities, of which 141.1 million were provided by its principal bankers.
Bonds and guarantees totalling 120.7 million had been issued under these facilities.
Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing both the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of the Company.
In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered carefully the risks to Charters trading performance and cash ows as a result of the current global economic and financial environment.
The Directors have also had regard to Charters operating plan and budget for 2011 and have considered the principal risks and uncertainities to which Charter is exposed.
The Directors monitor the expected outturn for the full year on an ongoing basis both in terms of profit and cash and appropriate mitigating action would be taken if it became apparent that there was a risk that Charter might miss its previous forecasts.
significant accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the accounting policies set out in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 65.
Applying accounting policies requires the use of certain judgements, assumptions and estimates.
The following accounting policies have been identied as being the most significant and where there is most risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of Charters assets and liabilities within the next financial year: goodwill impairment: construction contracts: deferred tax: warranty and legal liabilities: and retirement benets.
