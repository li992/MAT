Performance review Financial review Pre-tax profit increase David Broadbent Finance Director 49.3% From continuing operations before exceptional items.
Strong performance in uncertain economic times Conditions in the markets in which we operate have been difficult since the onset of the global downturn in 2008.
Our approach during this period was to focus on maintaining acceptable levels of impairment, controlling costs and growing only where economic conditions improved and trading performance allowed.
We have demonstrated the resilience of the business model during this period and delivered a strong performance in 2010 with a record pre-tax profit of 92.1 million, an increase in pre-exceptional profit before taxation from continuing operations of 49.3%.
At the same time, borrowings reduced by 28.3 million to 304.3 million, the ratio of equity to receivables rose to 54.5% and headroom over our core funding covenants has increased.
Refinancing successfully completed During the year we were pleased to secure funding through to the end of 2013 to support growth in the business, in very difficult market conditions.
As part of this process we were able to remove our reliance on bank funding by securing new sources of funding through our inaugural Eurobond issue under our Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme as well as being recognised as the first non-domestic issuer of corporate bonds on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
We were also able to diversify and extend the maturity profile of our debt funding with the introduction of a significant proportion of five-year funding.
In 2010 we put in place the following debt funding structure: in August we issued e225 million 193.1 million five-year bonds at a fixed coupon of 11.5% under our EMTN programme: in September, we issued 200 million Polish zloty bonds 43.4 million maturing 30 June 2015 the PMTN bond.
The coupon is a floating rate of six-month WIBOR the relevant Polish bank reference rate plus a margin of 750 basis points: and 54 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Report: Business Review in November 2010 we entered into new three-year syndicated and bilateral bank Robust investment facilities totalling 198.3 million priced at 400 basis points over reference rate.
Resilient business There was no change to the Groups financial covenants arising from any of these model funding initiatives.
Effective risk The actual cost of the funding in local currency terms is usually higher than the management systems EMTN bonds coupon rate due to the markets in which we operate having higher 3.
Experienced base rates than the Euro.
In the period from the date the bonds were issued to the management team year end, the weighted average interest cost of EMTN funding, when translated into operating currencies, was 14.8%.
Good profitable growth Our syndicated and bilateral facilities reflect a broad banking group that has prospects a good strategic and geographical fit with our operations.
These facilities are provided by the following institutions: Citibank, HSBC, VUB, BZWBK, Unicredit, ING, Alior, DZ Bank and OTP Bank.
Robust investment proposition We believe that there are five key reasons why the Group represents a robust investment proposition.
Resilient business model We operate a long-established business model that was stress tested in the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn.
Most loans issued by the Group are for terms of around one year with, on average, just five months remaining at any time.
This enables us to readily change the risk return profile of the business to respond to changes in the external economic environment.
This speed of response, together with prudent provisioning, means that the impact of adverse economic conditions is reported in the income statement quickly: the reduction in profitability in 2009 was largely reported in the first quarter of the year with year-on-year profit growth resuming in the second half.
In 2010 we reported further increases in profitability on a quarterly basis and a record profit for the full year by concentrating on controlled growth and improved credit quality.
The business model generates good margins and returns.
In 2010 we generated a profit margin of 15.1% and a return on capital employed of 21.9%.
This includes a margin of 21.8% and return on capital employed of 29.5% in our established Central European businesses.
EPS Margin ROCE p % % Poland 13.07 20.0 27.2 Czech-Slovakia 11.11 30.3 39.2 Hungary 2.42 12.3 17.7 Central Europe 26.60 21.8 29.5 Central costs 3.43 Developing markets 1.40 3.4 6.4 Group 24.57 15.1 21.9 For this purpose equity has been calculated as 55% of receivables and tax has been allocated across the businesses at the Group rate.

Effective risk management systems We have well tested and effective risk management systems.
The Board is We operate a prudent, committed to high standards of corporate governance and now complies with objective and centrally all the requirements of the Combined Code.
Details of the Boards approach to controlled provisioning corporate governance are set out in the corporate governance statement of the system.
We employ standard operational and administrative processes to control our business across our markets using a robust IT platform and standard best practice processes, including effective financial control systems.
Specifically, we operate a prudent, objective and centrally controlled provisioning system that has the following key attributes: impairment provisions are assessed on a weekly basis: an impairment charge is made in the event of any missed payment or portion of payment, even if the agent fails to visit a customer: impairment charges are always calculated by reference to the customers original contractual repayment schedule, even when an extended repayment schedule has been agreed: customers are categorised into arrears stages by reference to their most recent 12-week repayment performance: provision percentages for each arrears stage have been derived using statistical modelling of past customer performance that estimates the amount and timing of cash flows: and separate statistical models are used for each product in each country and these models are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they reflect current performance.
The short-term nature of the loans combined with prudent provisioning means that impairment is charged to the income statement quickly.
Experienced management team The Groups Board has good experience of operating in public listed companies and international markets.
Our Senior Management Group has a strong and successful track record and combines long-term home credit expertise and wider financial services experience.
Biographies of the Board and Senior Management Group are set out in the Governance section of the Directors Report.

Our business model is cash and capital generative in an established market.

We are continuing to evaluate opportunities for new market entry in 2011.
Given that new market pilots typically run for a period of 12 to 18 months, this will not have a significant impact on our operating cash flows before 2013 at the earliest.

Good profitable growth prospects Earnings per share We believe that the Group has significant growth opportunities.
In our established markets there is an improving economic outlook which, together with reduced 24.57p competition and good credit quality, should yield improved profitability.
In our developing markets we see similar macro conditions together with the opportunity for further geographic expansion in order to leverage our existing investment.
2009: 17.78p A key component of our Group strategy remains to take the business model to From continuing operations before exceptional items.
new markets when the time is right.
2010 results Dividend per share We reported a pre-tax profit before exceptional items of 92.1 million compared to a profit of 61.7 million in 2009, an increase of 49.3%.
Our operating margin increased from 11.2% to 15.1%, largely driven by improvements in the ratio of 6.27p impairment to revenue and the cost income ratio.
Statutory profit before taxation was 88.2 million and includes an exceptional charge of 3.9 million comprising 2009: 5.70p exceptional financing costs totalling 6.8 million partially offset by a curtailment gain of 2.9 million arising on the closure of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual.
The exceptional financing costs primarily relate to the cost of closing out interest rate swaps upon refinancing.
Taxation The taxation charge for the year was 29.0 million 2009: 16.1 million, which represents an increase in the effective tax rate to 33% 2009: 26%.
The effective rate for 2010 was impacted by two significant factors.
As previously announced, the rate of corporation tax in Hungary is to be reduced from 19% to 10% with effect from 2013.
Whilst this is beneficial in the medium term it has resulted in a 4.4 million reduction in the Groups deferred tax asset and, therefore, has a one off adverse impact on the tax charge in 2010.
In addition, the special bank tax in Hungary, which was introduced in 2010, resulted in an incremental tax charge of 3.7 million: this tax is expected to be in place until 2012.
The effective rate is expected to be around 28% in 2011. Dividend Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 3.74 pence per share will be declared.
This represents an increase of 10% on last year and will bring the full year dividend to 6.27 pence per share 2009: 5.70 pence per share.
This is consistent with our progressive dividend policy and our stated intention to move to a pay-out ratio of 25% of post-tax profit.
58 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Report: Business Review Receivables and provisioning Contractual receivables Group receivables at the end of 2010 were 566.9 million 2009: 525.6 million.
The average period of receivables outstanding was 5.0 months 2009: 5.1 months 1,026.1m with 98.6% of year end receivables due within one year 2009: 98.0%.
Poland is the only market where we issue loans repayable over two years but this was also constrained significantly as part of the credit tightening put in place in 2008.
2009: 937.9m This represented 1.5% of Group credit issued 2009: 2.7% and 3.6% of year end Group receivables 2009: 2.7%.
Net receivables Our receivables book is valued by discounting the expected future cash flows in respect of outstanding customer loans by the relevant effective interest rate.
The expected future cash flows are adjusted to take account of our expectation of 566.9m future credit losses based on the age of the debt, the number of missed payments and the historical performance of similar loans.
Impairment charges are always 2009: 525.6m calculated by reference to the customers original contractual repayment schedule, even when an extended repayment schedule has been agreed.
Funding Headroom on funding Total Group borrowings have reduced by 28.3 million to 304.3 million reflecting facilities careful management of costs, coupled with the cash generative nature of our business model.
This compares with total facilities of 479.6 million, giving headroom on facilities of 175.3 million.
The maturity profile of facilities is 175.3m summarised as follows: Less than One to Four to 2009: 265.7m one year three years five years Total m m m m Short-term facilities 44.8 44.8 Term syndicated facilities 96.8 96.8 Term bilateral facilities 101.5 101.5 EMTN bond 193.1 193.1 PMTN bond 43.4 43.4 44.8 198.3 236.5 479.6 Borrowings 304.3 Headroom 175.3 Going concern The Board has reviewed the budget for the year to 31 December 2011 and the forecasts for the four years to 31 December 2015 which include projected profits, cash flows, borrowings and headroom against facilities.
The Groups committed funding through a combination of bonds and committed bank facilities are sufficient to fund the planned growth of our existing operations and new markets until November 2013.
Taking these factors into account the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the Board has adopted the going concern basis in preparing these Financial Statements.
