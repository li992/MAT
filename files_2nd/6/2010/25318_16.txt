Performance review Operational review Group Percentage change figures for all performance measures, other than profit or loss before taxation and earnings per share, unless otherwise stated, are quoted after restating prior year figures at a constant exchange rate CER for 2010 in order to present the underlying performance variance.
Profit before taxation in 2010 reflects continuing operations and is stated before an exceptional charge of 3.9 million.
In 2010 pre-tax profit increased to a record 92.1 million, an uplift of 49.3% driven by good growth in credit issued, better credit quality and improved cost efficiency.
This result is particularly pleasing because it is in line with the strategic plan which we developed in advance of IPFs stock market listing in 2007.
It also demonstrates the resilience of our business model during a challenging period for the global economy.
During the year we saw progressive improvement in economic conditions across all our markets with the exception of Romania and, whilst maintaining tight credit control, we were able to shift our focus towards growth, particularly in the final quarter of the year.
All markets delivered growth in customer numbers which increased overall by 7.5% to 2.2 million.
As expected, the rate of growth was strongest in our developing markets of Mexico, where customers grew by 14.1%, and Romania, where customers grew by 26.2%.
The profile of growth through 2010 is illustrated by the growth of credit issued split by quarter, shown in the table below: Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Full year Growth in credit issued 10.6% 3.0% 0.3% 9.0% 5.6% Growth in the first quarter was flattered by comparison to the heavily recession affected first quarter of 2009 and it was not until the second half of 2010 that we felt sufficiently confident in the economic outlook to push for growth.
In Quarter 3 we found caution amongst agents and managers remained a key factor inhibiting 42 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Report: Business Review growth.
In Quarter 4 we tackled this with an additional 2.8 million of investment in marketing, communication and incentives.
This proved successful resulting in a 9.0% increase in credit issued in the fourth quarter, providing a strong platform for further growth as we enter 2011.
Overall, the amount of credit issued to customers grew by 5.6% and, as a result, the value of customer receivables grew by 6.0%.
This produced an 8.1% increase in revenue to 608.7 million, reflecting the benefit of the mid-2009 increase in service charge.
Improvements in credit quality and collections performance driven by improving external conditions and our focus on these areas caused the impairment charge to reduce as a percentage of revenue by 2.3 percentage points from 29.9% in 2009 to 27.6%.
Together these factors produced an increase in net revenue of 11.9% to 440.6 million.
Agents commission costs increased by 4.0% to 68.0 million, in line with the growth of the business.
Costs were managed tightly and as a result the ratio of other costs to revenue improved by 1.2 percentage points to 40.5% in 2010 despite incurring 5.3 million of incremental performance related pay and the additional 2.8 million of costs to drive growth, as noted above.
On funding, credit market conditions remained challenging during 2010 and so we were particularly pleased to conclude our refinancing in 2010 with a diversification of sources and extension of maturity of debt financing: this included two successful five-year bond issues and the agreement of new three-year committed banking facilities.
This gives security of funding and allows us to progress our growth plans.
However, as we had expected, our borrowing margins increased and this led to a rise in finance costs which rose faster than revenue, up by 10.4% to 33.9 million.
The quarterly profit performance compared with 2009, set out in the table below, demonstrates the good progress made through the course of 2010: m Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Full year 2010 2.0 28.5 24.4 37.2 92.1 2009 8.5 17.6 18.0 34.6 61.7 Change m 10.5 10.9 6.4 2.6 30.4 % Change 123.5 61.9 35.6 7.5 49.3 The pattern of profit increase relative to 2009 shows the impact of the strong recovery from the recession-impacted first quarter of 2009 followed by slightly lower growth in the second and third quarters.
In Quarter 4 2010, the 2.8 million investment in additional marketing spend to accelerate customer and receivables growth slowed profit growth in that quarter but provides a sound platform for further and stronger receivables growth in 2011. www.
co. uk Directors Report: Business Review 43 Performance review Operational review continued Segmental split of results All our markets made a positive contribution to the increase in Group profitability and, as expected, Hungary made the largest contribution.
The segmental split of profit before tax by market is as follows: 2010 2009 Change Change Profit before taxation m m m % Poland 49.0 46.2 2.8 6.1 Czech-Slovakia 41.7 37.5 4.2 11.2 Hungary 9.1 7.2 16.3 226.4 Central Europe 99.8 76.5 23.3 30.5 UK central costs 12.9 12.7 0.2 1.6 Established markets 86.9 63.8 23.1 36.2 Mexico 3.5 0.3 3.2 1,066.7 Romania 1.7 2.4 4.1 170.8 Developing markets 5.2 2.1 7.3 347.6 Profit before taxation 92.1 61.7 30.4 49.3 From continuing operations and stated before exceptional charge.
Our established Central European businesses made progress in 2010, with sales growth and lower impairment driving a 30.5% increase in pre-tax profit to 99.8 million.
The strong recovery of our Hungarian business, which rapidly returned to profitability following the losses reported in 2009, was a key driver of this improvement with the businesses in Poland and Czech-Slovakia also reporting increased profits.
Poland had a difficult start to the year with unusually severe weather conditions leading to higher impairment, but thereafter performance improved as is demonstrated by growth in profits of 8.0% in the second half compared with 1.4% in the first half.
We were also pleased to successfully transition the business to a growth focus in the fourth quarter which, alongside a 3.2% increase in customers across the year, created a solid platform for further growth in 2011.
Taken overall, therefore, Poland made progress in 2010 and reported a 6.1% increase in pre-tax profit to 49.0 million.
The Czech-Slovakia business also made good progress in the year and reported increased profits of 41.7 million, an increase of 11.2% on the previous year.
Customer numbers increased by 0.8%, although low impairment rates meant that it was able to grow credit issued at a faster rate of 4.8% and this enabled the business to grow revenue by 7.7%.
Impairment remained low at 19.8% of revenue.
Hungary had an excellent year in 2010, recovering strongly from a very challenging year in 2009 during which the impact of the recession necessitated a restructuring and downsizing of the business.
Pre-tax profit increased by 16.3 million, turning a prior year loss of 7.2 million into a profit of 9.1 million.
Throughout the year, collections performance and credit quality in Hungary was the highest in the Group and this led to a significant reduction in impairment as a percentage of revenue to 15.3% compared with 40.2% in 2009.
Strong growth was achieved, particularly in the second half, with credit issued up 21.5% year-on-year.
44 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Report: Business Review This encouraging performance provides a strong platform to deliver further growth in Hungary and return the business to its former scale over the medium term.
Our Mexican business continued to grow and make progress.
Pre-tax profit increased from 0.3 million to 3.5 million, customer numbers grew by 14.1% to 598,000 and impairment improved to 36.5% of revenue.
In addition we opened three branches in a new region, Monterrey, at a cost of 0.8 million.
Mexico represents a key market for the Group and during the year we slowed growth to allow operations employees and agents to gain more experience in order to provide a sound base for future growth.
Alongside this we planned, and have recently implemented, a revised field organisation and pay structure to improve effectiveness.
We remain convinced of the long-term potential of the Mexican business to grow to at least three million customers generating a total pre-tax profit of 90 million per annum.
Our Romanian business made excellent progress during 2010 and reported a maiden profit of 1.7 million.
This was achieved against a difficult macro economic environment which was exacerbated by severe austerity measures implemented by the Government in July.
The impact of these measures was well managed, with the business not only growing but also improving credit quality and collections.
Customers now stand at 207,000, an increase of 26.2% on 2009, whilst impairment has reduced from 36.6% to 34.7% of revenue.
Efficiency levels also improved significantly with the cost-income ratio reduced from 55.3% to 42.6% in 2010.
Balance sheet and funding The Group balance sheet has continued to strengthen in 2010 and the level of equity compared with receivables has increased to 54.5% 2009: 49.4%.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had net assets of 309.0 million 2009: 259.8 million and receivables of 566.9 million 2009: 525.6 million.
The average period of receivables outstanding at the year end was 5.0 months 2009: 5.1 months with 98.6% of year end receivables due within one year 2009: 98.0%.
During 2010 we achieved our objective of securing longer-term debt funding from diversified sources and at the end of the year the Group had 479.6 million of debt facilities comprising 236.5 million of bond funding maturing in 2015, 198.3 million of committed bank facilities maturing in 2013 and 44.8 million of short-term facilities.
There were no changes to financial covenants arising from the refinancing and all covenants were comfortably met in 2010.
During the year total Group borrowings reduced by 28.3 million to 304.3 million, reflecting the cash generative nature of the business model.
This compares with total facilities of 479.6 million, giving headroom on facilities of 175.3 million.
Gearing, calculated as borrowings divided by shareholders equity, has reduced to 1.0 times 2009: 1.3 times.
co. uk Directors Report: Business Review 45 Performance review Operational review continued Foreign exchange Changes in foreign exchange rates had no significant impact on the 2010 results compared with the previous year.
Our policy is to hedge the translation of reported profits only within the reporting period.
In January 2011 we hedged the rates used to translate the majority of forecast profits for Poland, CzechSlovakia, Hungary, Mexico and Romania for 2011.
These rates overall are similar to those used to translate the results for the 2010 financial year.
Regulation and legislation The new EU Consumer Credit Directive CCD has been implemented in all our European markets except Poland, which is expected to complete implementation in Quarter 3 of 2011.
The most significant features are increased transparency and consumer rights together with a harmonisation of the definition of the Annual Percentage Rate APR.
In addition, the CCD standardises the rebate accruing to a customer in the event of full or partial early settlement.
As previously indicated, we expect the changes to early settlement rebates to increase the rebate expense by approximately 15 million in 2011.
The Romanian Government added some additional requirements as the CCD passed into law in December 2010.
These will require some modifications to our product structures and credit policies, which we are in the process of making, but we do not expect them to have a material impact on the business.
In Poland, the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection has conducted a review of practices in respect of customer early settlement rebates and has challenged the practices of a number of lenders, including IPF.
We believe that the new early settlement regime to be introduced in accordance with the CCD will address their concerns and we have explained and confirmed the legality of our current practices.
The next stage of the process is a further hearing which has been set for 3 March 2011.
New markets New country entry remains a key element of our long-term strategy.
At present our research is focused on the Ukraine and Bulgaria which are adjacent to our existing Central European markets and would enable us to leverage existing management teams.
In both potential new markets there remain issues to resolve before we would consider entry on a pilot basis.
46 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Report: Business Review Operating review Central Europe Central Europe comprises our operations in Poland, Czech-Slovakia and Hungary.
Together these markets reported a pre-tax profit of 99.8 million for 2010 compared with 76.5 million for 2009.
This represents an increase in profit of 23.3 million, with 16.3 million of this arising from the improved performance of the Groups Hungarian business.
2010 2009 Change Change Profit before taxation m m m % Poland 49.0 46.2 2.8 6.1 Czech-Slovakia 41.7 37.5 4.2 11.2 Hungary 9.1 7.2 16.3 226.4 Central Europe 99.8 76.5 23.3 30.5 The performance of each of the Central European markets is covered in more detail below.
Poland Overall Poland made progress in 2010, reporting an increase in profit of 6.1% to 49.0 million.
Performance improved as the year progressed and as the impact on collections and impairment of the unusually severe weather conditions experienced in the first quarter of the year lessened.
During the year management successfully transitioned the business from its focus on collections for much of quarters two and three, to growth in the fourth quarter.
co. uk Directors Report: Business Review 47 Performance review Operational review continued Customers increased by 3.2% to 782,000 compared to 2009 and this is an important ingredient for stronger growth as we enter 2011. Credit issued grew by 2.1%, although growth in the fourth quarter was higher at 5%.
Average net receivables fell by 1.8% year-on-year, reflecting a flat second and third quarter, but revenue was 4.1% ahead of 2009.
This was due to the full year impact of the increase in service charge that was implemented in the second half of 2009.
Impairment increased by 13.3% to 75.1 million.
This was in part due to the spike in impairment as a result of the severe weather conditions in the first quarter of 2010 which did not fully unwind across the year, but also weaker than expected later stage collection of loans issued in 2009.
As a result the impairment charge in 2010 represented 30.6% of revenue compared to 28.1% in 2009.
The credit quality of debt written in 2010 has improved and we expect the impairment charge to move down into our target zone of 25.0% of revenue in 2011.
Finance costs were 1.4 million lower than 2009 due to lower levels of borrowing partially offset by an increase in the rate of interest paid on borrowings following the refinancing in the second half of the year.
Agents commission costs increased in line with growth and the increase in other costs was limited to 2.1% despite higher performance bonus payments and marketing costs.
In 2011 we will focus on growing customer numbers towards our medium-term target of one million customers, together with improved credit quality.
Czech Republic and Slovakia The Czech-Slovakian business delivered an increase in pre-tax profit of 11.2% to 41.7 million through a combination of growth and a slight reduction in impairment as a percentage of revenue.

Average net receivables grew by 11.3% whereas growth in revenue was lower at 7.7% due to the impact of higher early settlement rebates paid to customers in Slovakia following the implementation of the EU Consumer Credit Directive in July 2010.
Collections performance remained robust, which was reflected in impairment as a percentage of revenue reducing slightly to 19.8% 2009: 20.2%.
Finance costs increased by 7.5% due to the impact of higher funding costs partially offset by lower levels of borrowing.
Agents commission costs increased in line with growth at 2.8% and other costs increased by 5.9%.
The key focus for 2011 is to generate stronger customer growth.
We expect this will lead to some weakening in credit quality but there is room for this as impairment as a percentage of revenue is well below our benchmark level.
Overall, we are expecting Czech-Slovakia to continue to make good progress.
Hungary Hungary has recovered strongly from the very difficult macro-economic environment that it faced in 2009, demonstrating the resilience of the business model.
It reported a profit of 9.1 million in 2010 compared with a loss of 7.2 million in 2009 including 3.0 million of restructuring costs, an improvement of 16.3 million, driven mainly by much lower levels of impairment.
co. uk Directors Report: Business Review 49 Performance review Operational review continued Following the restructuring and downsizing of the customer base in June 2009, the key task for 2010 was to return credit quality to target levels and to re-start growth.
To support this there was a need to rebuild the confidence of agents and managers.
The management team in Hungary achieved good credit quality during the first half, creating the platform for a return to growth in the second half when credit issued grew by 21.5%.
The business ended the year with 238,000 customers, an increase of 4.8%, and we aim to rebuild the customer base to its previous level of 300,000 plus over the medium term.
Average net receivables were 9.0% lower than 2009 due to the impact of the downsizing and this together with the impact of the CCD Early Settlement Rebates resulted in a 11.9% reduction in revenues.
However, this was more than offset by the improvement in credit quality.
Credit quality and collections performance have been excellent in 2010 with impairment as a percentage of revenue at 15.3% compared to 40.2% in 2009.
Agents commission costs reduced in line with lower revenue.
Expenses were broadly flat year-on-year, after adjusting for the 3.0 million of restructuring costs incurred in 2009, reflecting a rise in the cost of field performance incentives and bonus costs.
Financing costs were 0.5 million lower than 2009 due to reduced borrowing requirements partially offset by higher funding costs.
While challenges remain, the Hungarian economy is slowly recovering and competition remains weak.
We aim to achieve faster growth in customer numbers and credit issued in 2011, with impairment as a percentage of revenue likely to move up as the proportion of new customers in the loan book increases.
Overall, the business is in very good shape and a sound platform has been built for further progress in 2011.
50 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Report: Business Review Mexico Our Mexican business continued to grow and make progress.
In addition, we opened three branches in a new region, Monterrey, at a cost of 0.8 million.
Mexico represents a key growth market for the Group and we are keenly aware that we need to ensure that our operational processes and levels of experience form a sound foundation for the substantial future growth we plan to achieve.
During the year we recognised the need to increase the level of experience of our local managers and agents.
Accordingly, we slowed growth to allow operations employees and agents to gain more experience and we have recently implemented a revised field organisation and pay structure as part of our strategy for improving effectiveness.
co. uk Directors Report: Business Review 51 Performance review Operational review continued Customers have continued to grow in Mexico, increasing by 14.1% to 598,000.
The rate of growth in credit issued was lower at 4.9%, reflecting our focus on maintaining credit quality.
Average net receivables were 23.8% higher year-onyear, reflecting the very strong growth towards the end of 2009.
This delivered good revenue growth of 24.9%.
The impairment charge as a percentage of revenue improved to 36.5% in 2010 2009: 37.0%.
This reflected a higher impairment charge in the first quarter followed by progressive improvements throughout the rest of the year as the strengthening of management practices had a positive impact on collections and impairment levels.
Impairment as a % of revenue Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Year 2010 44.3 35.9 35.5 30.7 36.5 2009 40.3 36.7 38.1 34.2 37.0 Finance costs increased by 22.9% to 5.9 million which was due to the higher cost of the Groups new funding structure.
Agents commission cost increased broadly in line with revenue.
Other costs increased by 18.9% to 44.1 million in order to support the strengthening of the business and its expansion into Monterrey.
The cost-income ratio improved from 45.6% to 43.6% in 2010.
During 2011, we will allow our operational changes to settle in and gain traction but expect faster growth as the year progresses.
We aim to open five new branches, all in the Puebla and Guadalajara regions.
We do not intend to open any further branches in Monterrey whilst we gain insight into the performance of the current three branches.
Overall, during 2011 we expect our Mexico operation to improve its scalability and to further improve performance.
We remain convinced of the long-term potential of the Mexican business to grow to at least three million customers, generating a total pre-tax profit of 90 million per annum in the long term.
Romania The business in Romania delivered a maiden profit of 1.7 million, a 4.1 million improvement from the loss of 2.4 million reported in 2009.
This represents an excellent performance, particularly in light of economic conditions, which remain difficult in Romania.
The austerity measures introduced by the Government in July 2010 included a 25% reduction in public sector salaries and a 5% increase in the VAT rate.
The impact of these measures has been well-managed with the business both growing strongly and also improving its credit quality and collections performance.
52 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Report: Business Review The results of our Romanian operation for the year are set out below: 2010 2009 Change Change Change at m m m % CER % Customer numbers 000s 207 164 43 26.2 26.2 Credit issued 74.6 64.1 10.5 16.4 20.5 Average net receivables 41.5 28.6 12.9 45.1 50.4 Revenue 50.5 35.8 14.7 41.1 46.0 Impairment 17.5 13.1 4.4 33.6 37.8 33.0 22.7 10.3 45.4 50.7 Finance costs 4.9 1.9 3.0 157.9 206.3 Agents commission 4.9 3.4 1.5 44.1 48.5 Other costs 21.5 19.8 1.7 8.6 13.2 Profit loss before taxation 1.7 2.4 4.1 170.8 The business passed the 200,000 customer milestone in November 2010 and ended the year with 207,000 customers, an increase of 26.2%.
This growth has been achieved without geographical expansion, which remains on hold until we become more confident about the economic outlook.
Credit issued grew at a similar rate of 20.5%.
Average receivables grew by just over 50% to 41.5 million reflecting this growth and stronger growth in 2009 and this led to a 46.0% increase in revenue during 2010.
Management have done well to improve credit quality and collections performance despite the Governments austerity measures.
This is reflected in an improvement in impairment as a percentage of revenue to 34.7% 2009: 36.6%.
We expect impairment to continue to improve in the next couple of years and track down to our expected 25-30% range for a mature market.
Finance costs increased by 3.0 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing requirements together with an increase in funding costs following the Groups refinancing.
Agents commission increased in line with revenue to 4.9 million.
Other costs increased at a rate that was much lower than the growth in revenue reflecting the impact of leveraging the existing infrastructure base.
This resulted in a significant improvement in the cost-income ratio from 55.3% to 42.6% in 2010.
