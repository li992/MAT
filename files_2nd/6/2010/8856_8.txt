Return on Invested Capital The groups return on invested capital ROIC fell by 1.3% to 15.8%.
Underlying operating profit was 26.7 million lower than Robert MacLeod last year at 271.8 million and average net assets were 24 million Group Finance Director lower at 1,717 million.
The groups ROIC of 15.8% was still well ahead of our pre-tax cost of capital, which we estimate to be 10.8%.
Our long term group target for ROIC remains at 20% on a pre-tax basis.
Over the previous few years we had been making good progress towards that target but the global recession significantly impacted our performance.
Demand reduced in a number of our markets, particularly the automotive market, and we now have spare capacity.
However, the medium term outlook for the group remains encouraging with growth in catalyst demand underpinned by new emissions legislation which is already in place.
Once global activity starts to recover, the groups ROIC should improve again as capacity utilisation increases.
