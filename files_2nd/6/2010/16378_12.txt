Report of the Directors About Unilever Financial review 2010 The virtuous circle of growth is starting to work for us.
We have successfully accelerated our growth and at the same time have continued the steady and sustainable expansion of our underlying operating margin and strong cash flow.
Delivering against our priorities Volume growth: accelerated Volume growth ahead of our markets Underlying volume growth accelerated in 2010 to 5.8%, the best that Unilever has achieved for more than 30 years.
We set out two years ago to reignite our volume growth and to grow ahead of our markets.
That is what we are starting to do: our volume shares are up in all regions and in most categories.
Volume growth was broad based.
In our emerging markets business we grew volumes by around 10% over the year as a whole, with the key businesses of China, India and Turkey all delivering growth well into double digits.
Only in Central and Eastern Europe did we see more subdued growth, although even here volumes were comfortably up in difficult markets.
In the developed world, where growth has been very hard to achieve Underlying volume growth over the recent past, our volumes were also up by around 2%, again ahead of the market, in both Western Europe and North America.
We gained volume share in all regions, with particularly strong performance in key emerging markets such as China, Indonesia, South Africa and Argentina.
Western Europe also saw strong volume share gains, led by the Netherlands, France and Italy.
Volume shares were also up in most of our core categories, with deodorants, skin cleansing, household care, ice cream and dressings all achieving notable gains during the year.
Steady improvement in margin Underlying operating margin: Underlying Operating Margin for the year increased by 20 basis points.
It was another year increased ofthesteady and sustainable improvement that we have been targeting.
Cost saving programmes again delivered strongly, with 1.4 billion of savings in theyearfollowing a similar amount in 2009.
Much of the success in savings came in thesupply chain, and as a result gross margin, at constant currency, improved for the year despite negativeunderlying price growth and modestly higher commodity costs.
Positive mixandimprovedvolume leverage also contributed positively to gross margin.
At the same time as increasing underlying operating margin we also increased substantially the advertising and promotions investment put behind our brands at constant currency Change in underlying operating margin the increase was more than 300million or 30 basis points in the year.
This came after an even bigger increasein 2009, meaning an additional 700 million behind the building of our brandequities over the last two years.
Aside from the gross margin increase, the key driver of margin improvement was a reduction in indirect costs, withthe organisation now leaner and a new discipline exerted in all areas of the cost base.
Strong cash flow: delivered Healthy cash delivery bn Working capital reduced as a percentage of turnover and has now been negative for over 12 months.
The cash conversion cycle improved by 17 days, from 20 days in 2009 to just three in 2010.
We are close to best in class in our management of payables and receivables, but in inventories we still see scope for further improvement.
This strong performance in working capital management was reflected in free cash flow, which was again healthy at 3.4 billion.
Over the last two years our combined free cash flow of 7.4 billion represents around 90% of net profit.
This is robust performance, particularly at a time when we are investing heavily in the future growth of the business in areas such as capital expenditure, as we build new capacity to support our rapid Free cash flow volume growth in emerging markets.
The 0.7 billion reduction versus 2009 reflected a smaller inflow from working capital in 2010, following the exceptional benefit of 1.7 billion taken in 2009.

Operating profit at current rates of exchange grew by 53.4%.
Although underlying margin improvement made an important contribution, the most significant factor behind this substantial increase was the profit achieved on the disposal of the Italian frozen foods business in the fourth quarter.
Market conditions were difficult in most parts of the region throughout 2010, with Greece, Ireland and Spain proving especially challenging.
Northern European markets were morepositive, particularly the UK and France, with consumer confidence remaining relatively stable despite the imminent onset of austerity packages.
Competition continued to be intense, andin some markets and categories levels of price promotional activity accelerated towards the end of the year.
This trend was particularly marked in the Home Care category.
Against this competitive background, underlying sales growth ofnegative 0.4% represented robust performance.
Particularly encouraging was volume growth, which at 1.4% was a step up from the slight decline seen in 2009.
Key countries contributing to this positive growth momentum were the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands, all of which grew volumes by 2% or more, in all cases ahead of their respective markets.
Volumes in Germany were broadly flat, and in Greece, Spain and Ireland volumes were down, reflecting the very difficult conditions in each of those markets.
Volume market share performance was positive for the region asa whole, and for most major units with the exception of Spain.
Particularly strong progress was made in the Netherlands, where over the year major share gains were seen in ice cream and deodorants.

Underlying price growth was negative 1.8%, reflecting actions taken to ensure market positions were protected against high levels of price competition.
Underlying operating margin for the year was up sharply, by 170 basis points.
This reflected the success of costsaving initiatives, which reduced indirect costs significantly.
Advertising and promotions spend was also lower, although investment levels remained competitive as reflected in the improved volume and share performance.
Other key developments in the year focused on the sharpening ofthe portfolio through acquisitions and disposals.
The sale ofthe Italian frozen foods business was completed in the fourth quarter, as was the acquisition of the Personal Care business of Sara Lee.
In addition, smaller bolt-on acquisitions were announced in the ice cream business in Denmark and Greece, and have subsequently been completed.

Financial instruments are classified according to the purpose forwhich the instruments were acquired.
This gives rise to the following classes: held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, and available-for-sale financial assets.
Please refer to note 1 onpages 77 and 78 for a description of each of these categories.
Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value, with changes in fair values booked through profit or loss unless the derivatives are designated otherwise and effective as hedges offuture cash flows, in which case the changes are recognised directly in equity.
When the hedged cash flow results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedged items that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in fair value of net investment hedges in relation to foreign subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity.
