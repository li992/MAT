70 FINANCIAL REVIEW The Consolidated Financial Statements of Fresnillo plc are prepared in accordance with International Fifinancial Reporting Standards IFRS.
This Financial Review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance understanding of the Groups financial statements.
i The full Financial Statements and their accompanying notes can be found on pages 114-158.
COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE In 2010, the Fresnillo Group generated strong financial results driven by the rally in precious metal prices, the contribution of Soledad-Dipolos and the robust operational performance of the Group mines.
These were somewhat mitigated by: i higher exploration expenses and by higher depreciation expense resulting from recent capital investments, both in support of the Groups organic growth strategy: and ii higher adjusted production costs reflecting a stronger peso, rising electricity and diesel prices and an increase in activities to ensure continuous operations, as well as higher taxes and profit sharing.
As a result, attributable profit in the year, excluding the effect of the Silverstream revaluation rose 72.3% from US$308.0 million in 2009 to US$530.8 million in 2010.

Fresnillo plcs financial performance is determined by the level of efficiency in executing the Groups strategy and the impact of several external factors.
The quality of our asset base, the ability to maximise its potential, and personnel and managements skills are among the most important internal drivers underlying our financial results.
The external variables with material impact on Group performance are dependent on market conditions and are thus outside of Fresnillo plcs control.
These include: Precious metal prices volatility in the global economy and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe fostered safe-haven investment demand, resulting in gold and silver prices reaching record levels.
In 2010 the average realised price of silver increased 40.0% to US$21.39 per ounce, while the average gold price reached US$1,252.05 per ounce, a 26.6% increase year-over-year.
The Groups Income Statement is considerably impacted by these variables, as 95% of our revenues come from these metals.
In addition, the strengthening of forward silver prices in 2010 significantly impacted the valuation of the Silverstream contract, considered to be a derivative instrument under IFRS, which resulted in an unrealised pre-tax gain of US$191.8 million recognised in the income GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 71 statement.
Expectations of future silver price is one of the key assumptions underlying the valuation of this contract and analysis of the impact on the contracts value of changes in the price of silver is provided in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.
We maintain a policy not to hedge silver and gold price exposure and therefore provide shareholders with full exposure to fluctuations in silver and gold prices.
Foreign exchange rates The average spot exchange rate of the Mexican peso to the US dollar was revalued from MxN13.52 per US dollar in 2009 to MxN12.64 per US dollar in 2010.
This variable had an adverse effect on the Groups production costs, as costs denominated in Mexican pesos approximately 70% of total costs increased when converted to US dollars.
The negative impact of the 6.5% average revaluation within the costs was estimated at US$9.5 million.
The spot exchange rate at 31 December 2010 was MxN12.36 per US dollar, representing a 5.4% revaluation when compared to the MxN13.06 per US dollar at the beginning of the year.
The Groups taxable profits are determined under Mexican GAAP in pesos and this revaluation had an adverse effect on the peso value of US dollar-denominated net monetary asset position, with the Silverstream Contract and cash and cash equivalents being the most important.
As a result, a foreign exchange loss under Mexican GAAP was generated, lowering the Groups taxable profits.
Inflation of key operating materials yeAr over yeAr chANge Steel for drilling 0.1% Explosives 4.8% Tyres 1.3% Sodium cyanide 24.4% Other reagents 11.3% Oils and other lubricants 10.4% Weighted Average 1.9% The net increase in the weighted average input cost over the year was 1.9%.
The average unit price of several operating materials fluctuated in 2010, reflecting prevailing economic conditions.
Reagents such as zinc and copper sulphates increased significantly over the course of the year reflecting the higher prices of those metals.
Average prices for sodium cyanide however, an important reagent used in the gold leaching process, declined.
Further increases in the unit prices of all inputs are expected for 2011, reflecting the increase in demand to support expansion plans within the broader mining industry.
Electricity Fresnillo plcs weighted average cost of electricity increased by 24.6% when compared to 2009.
This followed the expected rate increase from the Comisin Federal fide Electricidad CFE, the national utility, with recovering economic conditions prompting the Mexican government to reverse its policy of reducing electricity prices to control inflation.
The unit price of electricity for 2011 is expected to move in line with CFEs average generating cost.
Diesel The weighted average cost of diesel in Mexican pesos increased by 19.6% year-on-year reflecting the Mexican governments decision to align fuel and diesel prices with international rates.
In accordance with this policy, a similar increase is anticipated for 2011.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report 72 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Treatment and refining charges Treatment and refining charges TRCs, which are deducted from adjusted revenues for the purposes of revenues as disclosed in the income statement, are reviewed annually in accordance with international benchmarks.
The treatment charge per tonne of lead concentrate, including the escalator, remained steady, while treatment charge per tonne of zinc concentrate increased by 3.2% when compared to 2009.
However, this increase was completely offset by a 29.7% decrease in the refining charge per ounce of silver, which represented 42% of total treatment and refining charges.
As a result, total TRC charges decreased by 6.9% year-on-year, despite the increase in volumes of product sold.
The effects of the internal and external factors impacting each of the items of the Income Statement are further described below.

3 Derivatives terminated prior to the IPO in 2008.
Total revenues for the full year rose to a record US$1,409.5 million, a 65.8% increase when compared to 2009.
The main contributor to this significant increase was adjusted revenue which rose 56.1% to US$1,473.9 million.
Higher average realised metal prices accounted for 65.6% of the total US$530.0 million increase in adjusted revenues.
The remaining 34.4% of the favourable effect reflected the additional volumes of gold ounces sold from Soledad-Dipolos, Cinega and Herradura.
The Fresnillo Group has not entered into any silver and gold hedging contracts since its Initial Public Offering IPO in 2008 and does not intend to do so, thus providing full exposure to fluctuations in silver and gold prices.
In 2010, Fresnillo plc did not enter any new derivative contracts to hedge the price of lead and zinc by-products.
However, prior to the IPO, the Group used derivatives to reduce commodity price risks arising from the volatility of silver and gold prices.
In 2009, a final non-cash charge of US$25.0 million was reflected against adjusted revenues as a result of the hedging instruments that were terminated in 2007, but for which cumulative losses were recycled to the income statement at the time of the occurrence of the hedge transaction to which they related.
Silver share thus declined to 51% in 2010.

The main factors affecting the increase in cost of sales were: Adjusted production costs increased to US$312.0 million, a 48.7% increase when compared to 2009.
Of the US$102.2 increase, US$55.1 million, or 53.9%, related to production costs incurred at the new Soledad-Dipolos mine in its first year of commercial production.
In addition the revaluation of the average spot exchange rate resulted in a US$9.5 million adverse effect when converting peso-denominated costs to US dollars.
The discussion below factors out the impact of foreign exchange movements in the peso denominated costs for each category in order to reflect the underlying operational unit cost changes: Contractor costs rose by US$12.7 million as a result of: i stripping cost of the valles pit recorded in the income statement, while in 2009 these costs were capitalised: ii the increase in development works to ensure continuous operations: iii shotcreting and rock bolting activities carried out mainly at the Fresnillo mine to secure personnel safety: iv increased mine services which are typically conducted by contractors such as road maintenance and pumping: v additional volumes of ore and waste material hauled over longer distances at all our mines: and vi higher unit fees charged by contractors, which include the annual rise in labour costs, depreciation of the contractors equipment, operating materials and fuel and lubricants.
The cost of energy rose by US$10.7 million as a result of increases in electricity and diesel prices of 24.6% and 19.6% respectively.
Additional consumption of energy was associated mainly with higher production volumes at our mines, and to a lesser extent, to the longer haulage distances affecting consumption of diesel.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report 74 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Operating materials increased by US$6.0 million due to increased consumption of explosives, anchors, steel and lubricants related to the additional volumes of ore produced at the mines.
These increases were mitigated by operating efficiencies achieved through the Six Sigma methodology and other cost control initiatives.
The cost of personnel increased by US$2.4 million as a result of: i additional personnel hired at Herradura: ii a 6.5% increase in wages plus a 1% bonus in base salary: iii bonuses associated with the implementation of efficiency projects: and iv training to improve safety indices.
The cost of maintenance rose by US$2.3 million due to: i maintenance and repair of locomotives at the Fresnillo mine: and ii intensified use of equipment to load and haul ore and waste at the mines.
Other costs increased by US$3.5 million as a result of additional equipment insured, surveillance, freight and IT expenses.
Depreciation increased by US$38.0 million mainly due to the larger asset base following the completion of Soledad-Dipolos, higher production volumes which affected the depletion factor, and the purchase of additional high-capacity trucks and loaders.
The current year increase in work in progress as compared to the decrease in 2009 benefited the movement in COS by US$29.7 million.
In 2010, ore deposited at Soledad-Dipolos increased inventories of ore at this mine, while in 2009 a charge of US$12.9 million was recognised as a result of the decrease of mineral and concentrate inventories at Herradura.
Profit sharing rose by US$13.1 million due to higher profits at our operating mines.
The Fresnillo Group enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos.
The forward sales position that matured throughout 2010 was for US$77.5 million at an average rate of MxN13.17 per US dollar.
Forward contracts which matured throughout the year resulted in a US$2.9 million gain recognised in the income statement.
The outstanding net forward position as of 31 December 2010 was US$51.0 million with maturity dates throughout 2011.
Additionally, the Group entered into a combination of put and call options structured at zero cost collars.
During the year, collars hedging US$14.5 million of costs denominated in Mexican pesos matured.
Resulting in a US$0.2 million gain recognised in the income statement.
Collars hedging costs denominated in Mexican pesos equivalent to US$36.0 million will mature in 2011 with an average floor exchange rate of MxN13.03 per US dollar and cap of MxN14.23 per US dollar.
These instruments guarantee a minimum exchange rate should the market fall below the floor exchange rate.
Between the floor and cap exchange rates the Group sells US dollars at the market rate, and when the Mexican peso per US dollar exchange rate goes above the cap rate, the Company is obliged to sell US dollars at the contract rate.
GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 75 COST PER TONNE ANd CASH COST PER OUNCE Cost per tonne milled across our operating mines increased when compared to 2009 as shown in the table below.

In 2010 however, freight costs associated with ore transported from Fresnillo plcs mines to Met-Mex facilities, which are usually presented as a deduction to Adjusted Revenues, were reclassified and added to the cost of freight of inputs under production costs, thus illustrating the full impact of freight costs.
Cost per tonne figures presented within the 2009 Annual Report excluded freight charges against revenues, thus those figures are shown with a pro forma reclassification in order to be comparable with 2010 calculations.
The main variables explaining these increases on a mine by mine basis can be found in the Review of Operations on pages 32-55.

Cash cost per silver ounce at Fresnillo reflected a modest decrease see table below due to higher gold, lead and zinc by-product revenues resulting from increased sales volumes and higher metal prices.
In addition, the slight increase in volumes of silver produced and sold also mitigated the adverse effect of the higher adjusted production costs.
Cash cost per gold ounce at Cinega slightly increased reflecting the higher adjusted production costs associated with the development works at the mine and the 24.6% decrease in silver by-product production, partially offset by the higher zinc and lead by-product sales and the increased gold ounces sold.
Cash cost per ounce at Herradura decreased by 5.5% as a result of the higher gold ounces produced and sold at this open pit mine.
Cash cost per gold ounce at Soledad-Dipolos was US$383.15, higher than Herraduras cash cost due to the natural lower ore grade impacting total gold ounces sold.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report 76 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, before hedging gains and losses, is an important financial indicator to measure the profitability at each mine and at the Fresnillo Group as a whole.
This indicator considerably benefited from the higher precious metal prices, contributing US$327.9 million, of which 64.9% corresponded to the price of silver, 31.4% to the price of gold and the remaining 3.7% to the prices of lead and zinc by-products.
Operating performance was also an important contributor to Gross Profit excluding hedging effects.
The most important factor in the 2010 increase was the contribution of the new Soledad-Dipolos gold mine US$84.1 million, with higher production volumes at Herradura, Fresnillo and Cinega also benefiting gross profit.
In total, the favourable effect generated by higher sales volumes at these three mines was US$64.9 million.
Other favourable effects were lower treatment and refining charges and changes in work in progress due to the increase in Soledad-Dipolos inventories.
The benefits described above were somewhat mitigated by: i the adverse effect of the US$37.7 million increase in adjusted production cost: ii the US$27.2 negative impact of the higher depreciation expense: iii higher profit sharing: and iv the adverse impact of the revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar impacting peso-denominated costs.
The contribution by mine to the Groups Gross Profit, excluding hedging, changed this year due to the incorporation of Soledad-Dipolos which comprised 8.7% of the total, diluting the participation of the other three mines.
Fresnillo continues to be the biggest contributor with 59.2%, followed by Herradura and Cinega with 22.4% and 9.7% respectively.
AdMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Administrative expenses of US$52.6 million increased by 5.5% compared to 2009, and include administrative fees paid to Servicios Administrativos Peoles, S. A. fide C. v. SAPSA under the New Services Agreement NSA, legal and advisory fees, and expenses associated with administrative personnel working at the Groups corporate offices.
The increase was mainly related to additional administrative services provided by SAPSA related to the new Soledad-Dipolos mine and to the construction of Saucito.

An additional US$18.0 million related to the development of the Saucito mine and for the San Julin and Juanicipio advanced exploration projects was capitalised.
These projects have sufficient geological and technical information that allows for a reasonable expectation of becoming operating mines in the future.
Exploration expenses, including those capitalised, totalled US$100.1 million, representing a 77.2% increase over 2009.
As anticipated, Fresnillo plc conducted an intensive programme of exploration and mining works over the course of the year aiming to expand the resource and reserve base and confirm resources estimates.
This expenditure also included the Noche Buena pre-feasibility study, San Julin and Orisyvo scoping studies and the pre-feasibility study at Juanicipio.
As part of our organic growth programme, the exploration budget for 2011 has been increased to US$251.4 million, of which US$100 million is expected to be capitalised.
EBITdA eBitdA & eBitdA mArgiN Year ended 31 December, US$ millions 2010 2009 % change Gross Profit 974.48 528.32 84.4% Depreciation 105.22 67.23 56.5% - Administrative Expenses 52.60 49.87 5.5% - Exploration Expenses 82.11 49.06 67.4% eBitdA 945.00 496.62 90.3% eBitdA margin 67.0% 58.4% EBITDA, which is calculated as gross profit as reflected in the income statement plus depreciation less administrative and exploration expenses, achieved a new record level of US$945.0 million in 2010, a 90.3% increase year-on-year.
This key financial indicator benefited from the higher gross profit levels, partially offset by the increase in exploration expenses.
Similarly, EBITDA margin rose from 58.4% in 2009 to 67.0% in 2010.
Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report 78 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued SILVERSTREAM REVALUATION EFFECTS The Silverstream Contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value.
In 2010, the increase in fair value of the Silverstream asset was US$191.8 million, which represents a significant increase of 64.2% compared to the value as at 31 December 2009.
As a result, a corresponding non-cash gain was recognised in the income statement.
This unrealised gain comprised 18.8% of the Groups profit before tax, highlighting the increased impact of this instrument in the income statement.
Since the IPO, unrealised, non-cash profits associated with the Silverstream Contract have totalled US$211.2 million.
As silver prices are likely to move cyclically, any unrealised future losses would also be recognised in the income statement.
For example, the Group estimates that a 25% increase decrease in the expected future prices of silver as used in the valuation at 31 December 2010, would result in an unrealised gain loss respectively of US$120.2 million recognised in the income statement.
i Further information related to the Silverstream Contract is provided in the Balance Sheet section below and notes 15, 31 and 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE The foreign exchange result is caused by the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to US dollars.
In 2010, a US$3.3 million foreign exchange loss arose mainly as a result of: i the devaluation of the UK pound sterling against the US dollar on the dividends paid in pounds and the conversion of the pound sterling position held in treasury to US dollars: and ii the revaluation of the MxN US dollar exchange rate which affected the value of peso-denominated net liabilities when converted to US dollars.
This loss adversely compared with US$9.5 million foreign exchange gain recognised in the 2009 Income Statement, following the devaluation of the US dollar against the UK pound sterling, which affected the cash position denominated in sterling.
TAXATION Increased profit levels drove the income tax expense up to US$273.0 million, a 175.3% increase compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, the effective tax rate under IFRS was 26.7%, which is lower than the statutory 30% tax rate.
The main factors in the differential were: a the revaluation of the MxN US dollar exchange rate which generated i a foreign exchange loss registered under Mexican GAAP, lowering the Groups taxable profits: and ii movements in the US dollar equivalent tax value of assets that were originally valued in MxN and are not subsequently revalued for tax purposes with fluctuations in the Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate under Mexican GAAP: and b certain inflation adjustments for Mexican tax purposes that have no accounting effect.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR Profit for the year increased by 109.2% from US$358.3 million in 2009 to US$749.4 million in 2010.
Profits due to non-controlling interests minority shareholders rose to US$84.3 million in 2010, a 132.4% increase, as a result of the higher profits recorded at Herradura, profits generated by Soledad-Dipolos and the unrealised gain resulting from the Silverstream revaluation.
Both mines belong to Penmont, a company jointly owned by Fresnillo plc 56% and Newmont 44%.
Despite the 132.4% increase in non-controlling interests, profit attributable to Group shareholders increased by 106.6% to US$665.1 million in 2010.
Profit for the year, excluding the effects of the revaluation of the Silverstream Contract, increased by 78.7% from US$344.3 in 2009 to US$615.1 million in 2010.
Similarly, profit attributable to Group shareholders, excluding the Silverstream effects, rose by 72.3% to US$530.8 million in 2010.
GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 79 CASH FLOW A summary of the key items impacting the Groups cash flow is set out below: cASh floW Key itemS Year ended 31 December, US$ millions 2010 2009 % change Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital 983.6 548.8 79.2 Increase decrease in working capital 166.0 37.8 339.2 Net cash from operating activities 700.7 390.7 79.3 Silverstream Contract 55.6 39.0 42.6 Proceeds from development works at Saucito 25.6 10.7 139.3 Purchase of property, plant & equipment 340.3 261.2 30.3 Dividends paid to shareholders of the Company 182.6 93.6 95.1 Dividends paid to non-controlling interest 8.5 - N A Net increase in cash during the year 250.1 92.6 170.0 Cash at 31 December 559.5 312.2 79.2 The 79.2% increase in cash generated by operations before changes in working capital was a result of record profits generated at the mines.
However, this effect was mitigated by a US$166.0 million increase in working capital, which is mainly explained by: Trade and other receivables rose by US$116.7 million.
The main factor underlying this was the US$99.1 million increase in accounts receivables due from Met-Mex, of which 55% is attributable to the higher metal prices, 27% to the higher volumes of ore sold to Met-Mex, and 18% by modifications in the payment conditions between Herradura and Met-Mex associated with the dor production.
loans granted to contractors for the purchase of equipment further increased other receivables.
These loans are consistent with our strategy of supporting contractors.
Inventories increased as a result of the higher volumes of ore deposited at the Soledad-Dipolos pads and ore from development works at Saucito, which were stocked in preparation for commercial production in 1H 2011.
In addition, the inventory of spare parts, including tyres, increased in accordance with our policy to secure critical inputs subject to scarcity.
Despite the increase in working capital, cash flows from operating activities increased by 79.3% to US$700.7 million in 2010.
Other important sources of funds were US$55.6 million received in proceeds under the Silverstream Contract and US$25.6 million in proceeds generated from the sales of ore from the development works at Saucito and processed at the Fresnillo mine: the latter was credited to the cost of the project.
The Group invested US$340.3 million in the purchase of property, plant and equipment, a 30.3% increase when compared to spend in 2009.
Investments in these items in 2010 are further described below: Fresnillo plc 2010 Annual Report 80 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued purchASe of property, plANt ANd eQuipmeNt US$ millions 2010 Fresnillo mine 60.7 Mine development and construction of the San Carlos shaft.

The 2010 dividend payments reflected: i the final 2009 dividend of US$116.2 million and the 2010 interim dividend of US$66.4 million paid to Fresnillo plc shareholders: and ii US$8.5 million paid to Newmont, the minority shareholder in Penmont.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a net increase of US$250.1 million in cash and cash equivalents during the year.
The combination of this increase with the US$312.2 million balance at the beginning of the year and the unfavourable effect of exchange rate movements on cash of US$2.7 million, resulted in a net cash position of US$559.5 million as at 31 December 2010.
BALANCE SHEET In 2010, the Group maintained a solid financial position with no bank debt.
Cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 2010 were US$559.5 million, a 79.2% increase compared to year-end 2009.
The main factors driving the significant increase in cash and cash equivalents were fidescribed in the cash flow section.
Trade and other receivables of US$225.0 million rose as a result of the increase in metal prices and higher volumes sold.
Additionally, turnover of accounts receivables increased from 30 days in 2009 to 34 days in 2010 mainly as a result of extended payment terms on dor sold by Minera Penmont from 5 to 15 days after product delivery.
In addition, other accounts receivables increased as a result of loans granted to contractors to purchase equipment.
These increases were partially offset by the decrease in income tax refunds due, following the recovery of excess income tax paid in provisional payments during 2009 over the final income-tax return.
In accordance with the Silverstream Contract, Fresnillo plc is entitled to receive all of the proceeds in respect of the payable silver produced at the Sabinas mine owned and operated by the Peoles Group.
This contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument, with all payments received being credited against the carrying value of the related asset.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$298.6 million at the beginning of the year to US$427.7 million at the year-end reflects proceeds of US$62.8 million US$55.6 million in cash and US$7.2 million receivable offset by a revaluation effect of $191.8 million which is a non-cash gain reflected in the Group income statement.
Given the cyclical movements of silver prices, the value of the Silverstream asset could increase or decline in line with the movements of the silver price.
