The company has always prided itself on delivering outstanding customer service, but realised in 2003 that the standard of service provided by dealers varied greatly across its network and was leading to an overall decline in customer satisfaction.
Sinotrust, a majority-owned strategic partner of Experian, was appointed to help improve Guangqi Hondas dealership management and to reverse the decline.
Sinotrust is the largest automotive marketing solutions provider in China and has worked closely with Guangqi Honda to raise the level of customer satisfaction.
Central to this has been the development of a dedicated information management system, supported by four separate research methods, to monitor the sales and after-sales processes of Guangqi Honda dealers, as well as to collect customer evaluations and diagnose problems.
In the latest J. D. Power customer satisfaction survey, Guangqi Honda has jumped to number one from 16th place for after-sales service.
Jun Yu, Vice President and Senior General Manager of Guangqi Honda Automobile Sales Operations, concluded: Sinotrusts valuable insights and expertise in the automotive market have helped us to make significant improvements in our service capabilities and customer satisfaction.

By setting expectations in advance and avoiding the traditionally extensive paperwork for those qualifying for financial assistance, the relationship starts off on the right foot.
SearchAmerica, a part of Experian, is the industry leader in helping health care providers to make critical financial decisions about patients.
During the past three years, Integris Health, which operates 13 hospitals in Oklahoma, has been working with SearchAmerica to improve the patient experience by streamlining registration processes and applying the most appropriate financial strategies.
SearchAmericas sophisticated scoring and analytical solution has enabled Integris to instantly verify a patients identity, determine eligibility for charity care and Government assistance, and highlight fraudulent activity.
Patients are also classified according to their financial status and likelihood to pay, enabling collections processes to be carefully matched to the individual.
Greg Meyers, System Vice President of Revenue Integrity, Integris Health, explained: We wanted to apply the same level of care to the financial aspects of the patient relationship as to the clinical one.
SearchAmericas financial intelligence has helped us enhance patient relations, while increasing cash flow and reducing the number of unpaid accounts.
