Items that we consider to be 26 British Telecommunications plc Annual Report and Form 20-F 2010 Report of the Directors Financial review Net debt This measure is applied in context of BT Group plcs financial statements and is referred to in these financial statements.
Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swapped rates where hedged.
This denition of net debt measures balances at the expected value of future undiscounted cash ows due to arise on maturity of financial instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges and the use of the effective interest method as required by IAS 39.
In addition, the gross balances are adjusted to take account of netting arrangements.
BT Group plcs management consider BT Group plcs consolidated net debt to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
It is considered both useful and necessary to disclose net debt as it is a key measure against which performance against the groups strategy is measured.
It is a measure of BT Group plcs net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the groups cash position and indebtedness.
There are material limitations in the use of alternative performance measures and the use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
