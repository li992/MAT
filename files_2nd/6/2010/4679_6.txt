BUSINESS REVIEW DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Financial review Key performance indicators 09 Management uses a number of key financial indicators to assess the performance of the group.
Revenue growth - Value growth increase in sales achieved by the group relative to prior period - Volume growth increase in number of metres or kilos of product sold by the group relative to prior period Operating margin operating profit before exceptional items as a percentage of revenue Return on capital employed ROCE operating profit before exceptional items as a percentage of average capital employed.
Capital employed is defined as fixed assets plus current assets less current liabilities, excluding all balances related to interestbearing assets and liabilities, effective hedges related to interestbearing liabilities, any deferred tax balances, and any pension assets or deficits.
Net debt earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA measures the liquidity of the group Revenue Reported revenue for 2010 was 237.0 million 2009: 220.4 million, representing an increase of 16.6 million, or 7.5%, over 2009.
Of this increase, 3.7 million related to volume, 8.3 million to sales price and mix, and 4.6 million to foreign currency movements.
Sales revenues by product group: 2010 2009 Collagen casings 192.1m 175.6m Distributed products 25.3m 26.5m Other products 19.6m 18.3m Total 237.0m 220.4m Increased sales volumes were made possible by enhanced productivity from existing facilities, which also allowed us to increase inventory levels at the year end.
Sales volumes of edible collagen casings rose by 2.2%.
Excluding China, volumes increased by 11.5%.
Distributed products are mainly cellulose and fibrous casings sold on behalf of other casing manufacturers.
As previously noted, agreements relating to some distribution arrangements expired at the end of 2009, and we have not sought to renew them.
This resulted in a reduction of 9.4% in volumes of distributed product compared to prior year.
Other products had similar volumes year on year apart from collagen film, which grew 21%.
Overall, the volume impact on revenue amounted to a 1.7% increase.
Year on year revenue growth between 2007 and 2010: Sales Mix 2010 vs 2009 2009 vs 2008 2008 vs 2007 Volume 1.7% 4.3% 3.0% Price Mix 3.7% 4.6% 3.2% Exchange 2.1% 11.5% 11.0% Total 7.5% 20.4% 17.2% On a continuing operations basis Sales volumes increased overall, but there were significant movements between markets.
Pricing and sales mix improved in 2010, reflecting underlying price increases and a change in mix to higher value customers and markets.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Financial review continued 2010 revenue growth by geographical region compared to 2009: 10 Region 2010 Volume Price Mix Exchange Total Europe 131.8m 8.0% 1.0% -1.4% 7.6% Americas 48.6m 10.8% 3.3% 0.9% 15.0% Asia Pacific 56.6m -19.9% 11.1% 10.7% 1.9% Total 237.0m 1.7% 3.7% 2.1% 7.5% European sales increased in volume terms, and showed price growth coupled with a movement to higher-value products.
Growth in the Americas was driven by strong sales in Latin America, and selling prices moved ahead, but the adverse impact of selling lower-value products meant that the overall price mix benefit was limited.
In Asia Pacific, there was an overall reduction in volumes, but this was exclusively in China, with other countries in South East Asia showing strong growth.
Operating profit Movement between 2009 and 2010 operating profit before exceptional items: Operating profit 2009 27.4m Price Mix 7.4m Volume 1.7m Manufacturing 4.2m Exchange 1.9m Input costs -4.4m Operating profit 2010 38.2m Price Mix Overall, we achieved a profit improvement of 7.4 million from higher sales prices and a better sales mix.
Of this, 3.2 million resulted from actual increases in sales prices and 4.2 million from changes to customer and product mix.
Volume Profit impact of volume represents the gross margin earned on net additional sales between 2009 and 2010 by product group.
Manufacturing Manufacturing operations, through consistency, productivity and efficiency, again made a substantial contribution to the improved profitability of the business, amounting to 4.2 million.
The closure of an old factory in Korenov in the Czech Republic, halfway through 2009, resulted in approximately 3.0 million of cost savings for a full year, with a 1.4 million benefit in 2010 compared to 2009.
In 2009, our US operation experienced changes in hide supply which led to a temporary reduction in efficiencies and yields.
These issues were resolved during 2010, with significant improvements in manufacturing output from the US plant.
There were further improvements in our other plants from increased line speeds and improved yields.
Foreign currency Devro operates worldwide and with multiple currencies.
Its major transactional exposures arise from sales in euro, US dollars and Japanese yen whereas the manufacturing costs are in Australian dollars, Czech koruna, US dollars and sterling.
Translational exposures arise from the conversion of the results of overseas companies into sterling.
Sales revenues in 2010 included a 4.6 million benefit from exchange.
The translation into sterling of results denominated in other currencies and the impact of hedging contracts meant that, overall, the net impact of exchange rate movements on operating profit was a benefit of 1.9 million compared to 2009.
Of this, approximately 1.4 million was due to translation, mainly resulting from a stronger Australian dollar.
Input costs Due to more favourable supply contracts, energy costs showed a saving of 1.1 million compared to 2009.
We expect these costs to be slightly higher in 2011 and similar to 2009 levels overall.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 BUSINESS REVIEW DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Hide supplies stabilised during 2010, and costs were broadly in line with 2009.
11 Underlying labour costs have risen during the year in line with inflation.
Other operating costs have risen during the year, reflecting an investment in facilities and enhanced operational capacity, aimed at prompting future growth.
Impact on December results The adverse weather conditions at the end of the year in the UK, US and Australia caused disruption to production and sales across these markets.
These led to an overall loss of approximately 0.6 million, in lower sales, increased costs and lost production.
Operating margin Operating margin increased to 16.1% for the year, compared to 12.4% for 2009.
This was driven by improvements in sales prices, a shift of sales to higher margin products and customers, and improvements in manufacturing, partially offset by increased operating costs.
Capital investment Capital expenditure in the year was 26.9 million.
The major items of expenditure related to the installation of new high speed lines in our manufacturing facilities in the Czech Republic and Australia.
Environmental expenditure continued in 2010 with work on a co-generation plant in our factory in Bathurst, Australia.
In total, capital spend for 2011 is expected to be approximately 45 million.
Working capital 2010 2009 m No of days m No of days Inventories 28.7 60 26.0 58 Trade receivables 29.1 48 25.5 51 Other receivables 3.7 3.3 Accounts payable 11.6 30 10.9 30 Accruals and other payables 23.1 19.7 Total 26.8 24.2 Gross inventory levels have risen by 11.5% to replenish low levels of stock held at the end of 2009 and in anticipation of planned shutdowns in 2011 to upgrade lines.
Trade receivables increased because of the higher sales, but the number of days outstanding fell, reflecting our focus on cash management.
Financing Key financial measures: 2010 2009 2008 Net debt 12.2m 15.6m 24.0m Net debt EBITDA 0.24 0.39 0.74 Gearing 8.0% 13.7% 21.5% Return on Capital Employed ROCE 21.8% 16.6% 13.4% Management has a policy of distributing debt between the various currencies in which it operates: therefore the net debt figure may fluctuate based on exchange rate movements.
ROCE has improved as we continue to get more out of our existing asset base in terms of efficiency and production, and because new assets are more efficient than the ones they replace.
Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Financial review continued Interest cost 12 Net interest cost for the year was 0.7 million 2009: 0.8 million.
This reduction reflected both a lower absolute level of net debt and lower interest rates than in 2009.
Net finance expense on pension assets and liabilities amounted to 1.2 million compared with expense of 1.4 million in 2009.
This movement reflects the reduced reported deficit in the group pension schemes.
Tax The group had an effective tax rate, before exceptional items, of 21.6% for 2010 2009: 24.1%.
The group benefited from a lower tax rate in the Czech Republic in 2010, which included the impact of a tax incentive scheme.
The effective tax rate for 2011 is likely to be around 22%.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share before exceptional items for 2010 was 17.4p, up 48.7% 2009: 11.7p.
This reflected the improved operating margin and the lower tax charge in the year.
Pensions The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes around the world.
All of these are closed to new participants, but the liabilities related to existing schemes are considerable.
As noted above, during 2010, after consultation with our employees and pensioners, certain changes were made to the UK pension scheme, which has been kept open to future accrual for existing members.
These changes resulted in a reduction in liabilities of the scheme and an income statement credit of 18.9 million, which has been treated as an exceptional item in the accounts.
During the year, the value of the assets in the schemes rose along with worldwide equity markets.
The value of liabilities, however, remained broadly unchanged, with the adverse effect of a fall in discount rates offset by the reduction in liabilities due to the changes made to the UK scheme.
The net impact was a decrease in the IAS 19 deficit of the schemes, which at 31 December 2010 amounted to 13.4 million 2009: 31.8 million.
Further additional contributions will be made to the schemes during 2011 with the aim of continuing to reduce this deficit.
Going concern Devro has committed borrowing facilities of 51.0 million that fall due for renewal in January 2012.
At 31 December 2010, the group was operating comfortably within the covenants relating to these facilities.
We believe that Devro is well financed and has sufficient liquidity to fund the capital expenditure required to continue to grow the business.
The group has held discussions with its bankers about its future borrowing needs and no matters have been drawn to our attention to suggest that renewal may not be forthcoming on acceptable terms.
After making enquiries, and considering the question carefully, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Dividend With the improvement in performance, the Board is proposing an increase of 40% in the dividend for the year, making a final dividend of 5.0 pence per share 2009: 3.575 pence, bringing the total for the year to 7.0 pence per share 2009: 5.0 pence.
This will be payable on 6 May 2011 to shareholders on the register as at 1 April 2011.
Based on the proposal for the full year, dividend cover excluding exceptional items will be 2.5 times.
