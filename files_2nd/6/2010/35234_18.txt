The year on year reduction in income from those sales of 10.8m was partly offset by additional income of 6.4m from lettings, rent reviews and new acquisitions net of voids.
Helped by very low void levels during most of the year and 51.17p dilapidations receipts of 1.6m, net rental income for 2010 was 111.3m which was only 2.0m lower than the previous year.
That figure also took account of a further recovery of 1.7m of from 50.49p in 2009 commercial rates rebates from prior years though that was less than the 2.8m rates credit recognised in 2009: this exercise is continuing but recoveries are expected to be lower in the future.
Including other fee income, net property income for the year was 113.0m against 114.8m in 2009.
With effect from 1 January 2010 and as already explained in the interim results, the Group changed its method of presentation of loan arrangement costs and non-utilisation fees to align the treatment with standard practice.
There is no impact upon the Groups net asset value, underlying profit or the overall profit or loss before taxation as a result of these changes and the minor presentational effect on the previously reported figures is shown in note 1.

This was to 20.9m from 17.5m in 2009 due mainly to increased staff predominantly due to property revaluation movements, the surplus and office costs as we added further breadth and depth to the arising in 2010 from the revaluation of the Groups property portfolio management team for the next cycle of development projects.

These items are not likely In the light of the anticipated level of redevelopment over the to be significant in future periods and, if they are excluded, the next few years, we have also reviewed thoroughly the Groups underlying profit before taxation for the year moves to 53.8m policy with respect to interest capitalisation on developments.
IAS 23 permits the capitalisation of interest on development expenditure as long as this is applied consistently, an approach followed by all of our peer group in the UK REIT sector with significant development activity.
Accordingly, and in order to improve comparability within the sector, the Board has concluded that the Group will capitalise interest on development projects with effect from 1 January 2011: for 2010, this would have reduced finance costs by 1.0m and for 2011, it is expected to increase adjusted profits by about 2.3m.
This change of accounting policy The Group will commence does not alter our approach to financial management within the capitalisation of interest Group and the Groups interest cover bank covenant calculations, which are monitored closely and forecasted as part of our on developments from business planning, are generally unaffected by the change of 1 January 2011 accounting policy.
Taxation The current year tax charge relating to the non-REIT part of the business was 1.0m after allowing for losses brought forward.
The prior year tax credit benefitted from the reversal of tax provisions as losses from prior years were utilised.
The deferred tax provision in 2010 was almost unchanged as the effect of the higher revaluation surplus was almost entirely offset by the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate which will fall to 27% from 28% in April 2011.
48 Performance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 Financing, net debt and cash flow Maturity profile of debt facilities m In 2010 and in response to the more favourable economic 2026 175 conditions in our markets, we reinforced our investment in the Groups property portfolio with capital expenditure and property acquisitions totalling 197.5m.
After netting off the proceeds 28 2018 received from property disposals, mainly from Crossrail in 90 2017 December, the net cash outflow relating to the portfolio during the year was 189.0m.
This contrasts with 2009 when proceeds from 2016 disposals exceeded capital spending by 90.7m.
The net cash 100 2015 generated from operations in 2010 also decreased to 46.5m, the 2014 125 reduction from the previous years figure of 66.4m due mainly to 2013 575 lower rental receipts following the property sales in 2009 and the 6.5m contribution from the sales of trading properties in 2009.
32 2012 As a result of these factors, the Groups net debt at the balance 2011 sheet date increased to 887.8m from 720.8m in 2009.
Drawn In spite of this level of investment in the portfolio, overall gearing Headroom levels have fallen since 1 January 2010 due mainly to the uplift in property values.
Taking account of unamortised loan arrangement costs, the overall loan to value ratio fell to 35.7% at 31 December 2010 from 36.4% in 2009 and balance sheet gearing fell to 59.4% from 61.9% a year earlier.
Overall interest cover for the year was 328%, almost unchanged from the 2009 figure.
Turning now to the Groups debt facilities, we took the decision early Two facilities totalling in 2010 to set about refinancing the 200m facility that was due to expire in December 2011.
There has been much written about the availability and pricing of secured senior finance and it is undeniable that margins and arrangement fees have increased substantially in the last two to three years.
What the overall data mask is that, for 190m some borrowers, senior debt is all but unavailable while for others such as ourselves, there is still an appetite from lenders to provide were arranged during new or replacement facilities on appropriate terms.
the year Derwent has historically borrowed almost exclusively on a secured basis from the UK clearing banks, with whom we continue to enjoy an excellent relationship.
The terms of these loan facilities provide the Group with a high level of flexibility.
This remains a fundamental element in our financing strategy and we were pleased to agree a new 100m fully revolving five-year secured facility with HSBC in November 2010.
It has been apparent for some time that the UK banking sector faces considerable pressure to reduce its exposure to commercial property lending.
We were, therefore, also intent in our strategy on introducing a new relationship from the wider group of established property lenders and signed a new 90m partrevolving seven-year secured facility with Eurohypo in December 2010.
This facility has a ratcheted margin which falls as LTV ratios decrease.
The amount drawn under the Eurohypo loan has been fixed for seven years by means of an interest rate swap at a cost, based on the existing loan to value ratio, of 4.73% pa inclusive of margin.
As a combination, these two new facilities provide us with flexibility and reasonable pricing in the context of current market conditions.

This additional income has been taken to the income statement in 2010, as required by IAS 39.
The weighted average length of unexpired debt facilities at 31 December 2010 was 5.2 years, only marginally down from 5.3 years at the 2009 year end.
The other main financing activity during 2010 took advantage of the low interest rates then prevailing to extend and blend downwards the weighted average rates that are paid under interest rate swaps.

As at 31 December 2010, the proportion of overall debt fixed was 70% though this increased to 78% in January 2011 following the new swap contract referred to above.

While the available facilities represented a reduction of 108m since the previous year end, the level of uncharged properties has increased by 146m to 484m during the same period giving us the scope to acquire new projects such as the new acquisitions in Page Street and Tottenham Court Road.
The Group retains a healthy balance sheet and we have been able to increase the dividend again this year by 7.4% in accordance with our policy of a progressive dividend backed by careful cash flow management.
In order to provide our shareholders with choice, we are also offering a scrip alternative for this years final dividend as is now permitted under the REIT regime rules.
