result BeFore tax For the year ended 31 December 2010 there was a profit before tax of 620.2 million, compared with the loss of 453.1 million in 2009.
The profit in 2010 reflected increased property values.
The table below reconciles the profit for the year to the adjusted profit before tax of 144.5 million.
2010 2009 Analysis of profit loss before tax m m Adjusted profit before tax 144.5 130.0 Adjustments: Profit Loss on the sale of investment properties and associate subsidiary 22.8 163.4 Revaluation gains losses on investment properties 447.0 403.9 Revaluation gains losses on development properties 0.1 40.2 Revaluation changes in associate 0.5 1.7 Release of provision relating to formerly owned property 5.3 Recycled exchange differences 9.8 Goodwill impairment 2.0 Distribution from other investments 4.6 13.1 Change in fair value of derivatives 1.7 4.1 Profit Loss before tax 620.2 453.1 In 2010 adjusted profit before tax increased by 14.5 million, or 11.2%, compared with the previous year.
Acquisitions, lower interest costs, rent reviews in the UK and indexation in France and increased management fees receivable all contributed to the higher profit.
However, their impacts were partly offset by the effects of disposals, the cessation of capitalised interest at Union Square, Aberdeen and exchange rate movements.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, adjusted earnings per share were 19.9 pence, an increase of 0.2 pence compared with 2009.
Although adjusted profit was significantly higher in 2010, the number of shares used to calculate earnings per share reflected the full year impact of the rights issue in March 2009.
Detailed calculations are shown in note 10A to the accounts on page 75 and these are summarised in the following table: 2010 2009 Change Adjusted profit for the year m 140.2 125.3 11.9% Average number of shares in issue million 706.0 637.2 10.8% Adjusted earnings per share pence 19.9 19.7 1.0% 28 financial review financial review continued net rental inCome Net rental income for 2010 at 284.7 million was 8.9 million, or 3.0%, lower than the prior year.
The reduction reflected disposals in 2009 and 2010, although the impact was partly mitigated by income from acquisitions, a full years contribution from recently completed developments, rent reviews and lettings in the UK portfolio and indexation in France.
Net rental income for 2010 and 2009 is shown in the tables opposite, analysed by investment properties owned throughout both years and those properties which have been acquired, sold or been under development at any time during the two year period.
On a like-for-like basis, net rental income for the Group as a whole increased by 3.5% principally as a result of rent reviews, lettings and a lower bad debt expense in the UK retail portfolio.
A lease expiry at Bercy 2, Charenton-lePont was the main factor behind the 1.6% reduction in income from the French portfolio.
In 2010, net rental income included net income from car parks of 11.3 million 2009: 8.6 million and rent related to tenants turnover amounting to 5.1 million 2009: 3.5 million.
Net income from the sale of advertising and merchandising opportunities in our shopping malls was 4.8 million in 2010, compared with 3.9 million in 2009.
We have changed the way we present lease incentives in 2010.
Previously, the amortisation of lease incentives and related costs was included within other property outgoings.
These items are now within gross rental income as we consider this a more appropriate treatment.
There is no impact on net rental income or net profit and prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect the change.
Property outgoings were 42.2 million in 2010, down from 45.3 million in the previous year.
The decrease principally reflected disposals in theyear and lower vacancy.

Higher employment costs, principally reflecting recruitment, increased costs by 2.6 million, but this was more than offset by 6.7 million of additional management fees receivable, including fees from the Thornfield development and management contract.
Following the completion of The Rock, Bury, during 2010, fees from the Thornfield contract will be lower in 2011. net FinanCe Costs Excluding the change in fair value of derivatives, capitalised interest and investment income, net finance costs were 108.0 million in 2010, some 25.5 million or 19% lower than the 2009 equivalent of 133.5 million.
The proceeds from disposals have been used to repay debt and we have benefited from lower interest rates, reduced commitment fees and a full years impact from the proceeds of the 2009 rights issue.
Reflecting the low level of development activity in 2010, interest capitalised was 1.7 million, compared with 10.0 million in 2009.
The Groups average cost of borrowing in 2010 was 5.0%, marginally less than the average cost for 2009 of 5.1%.
share oF results oF assoCiate Our 25% investment in the company which owned Bishops Square, London E1, was sold in December 2010.
The property and its related debt were accounted for as an associate up to the point of disposal.
Hammersons share of net rental income and interest costs in 2010 amounted to 2.0 million.
tax Due to its status as a UK REIT and French SIIC, the Group bears minimal current tax.
Deferred tax is also low now that foreign dividends are exempt from UK corporation tax.
30 financial review financial review continued dividend The Board is recommending a final dividend of 8.8 pence per share, which together with the interim dividend of 7.15 pence, makes a 2010 total dividend of 15.95 pence per share.
This compares with a total dividend for 2009 of 15.45 pence per share.
The final dividend, for which the record date is 11 March 2011, will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax if appropriate, but shareholders will be offered a scrip dividend alternative.
Further details of the scrip scheme are provided in a letter which is being sent to shareholders on 21March.
Where shareholders elect for the scrip alternative, this will not be treated as a PID and will not be subject to withholding tax.
Shareholders should note that there is no guarantee that the Board will offer a scrip dividend alternative for future dividends.
Cash FloW In 2010, cash generated from operations was 237 million compared with 239 million in the prior year and, largely due to lower interest costs, the cash inflow from operating activities was 133 million, up from 105 million in 2009.
Capital expenditure, including acquisitions, was 305million in 2010, whilst 555 million was raised from disposals.
Net debt at 31 December 2010 stood at 1.8 billion, a reduction of 330 million over the year, and comprised borrowings of 1.9 billion and cash and deposits of 126 million.
The proceeds from disposals, to the extent that they exceeded the cost of acquisitions and capital expenditure, were used to repay debt.
BalanCe sheet Equity shareholders funds at the end of 2010 were 3.5 billion, up by 530 million on the year, reflecting increased property values.
Adjusted net asset value per share, excluding deferred tax and other items, increased by 0.74, or 17.6%, to 4.95.

Our financing policy is to optimise the Groups weighted average cost of capital by using an appropriate mix of debt and equity.
The Board monitors the Groups financial structure with reference to guidelines which currently include gearing of no more than 85% for an extended period, interest cover in excess of 2.0 times and a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of ten times.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, these ratios were 52%, 2.6 times and 7.2 times respectively.
The Groups exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations is managed using appropriate hedging policies.
At the end of 2010, the weighted average maturity of the Groups borrowings was eight years and 94% of gross debt was at fixed rates of interest.
The maturity profile of our debt portfolio is shown in the chart below.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing, broadly equivalent to the ratio of net debt to shareholders equity, should not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income divided by net interest payable, should be not less than 1.25 times.
Three of the Companys unsecured bonds contain a similar gearing covenant and two contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175%.
The bonds do not contain an interest cover covenant.
Gearing was 52% at the end of 2010 compared with 72% at 31 December 2009.
The reduction reflected lower net debt and the increase in shareholders equity principally arising from the higher portfolio value.
The market value of the Groups debt at 31 December 2010 was 78 million higher than its book value, equivalent to 11 pence per share on an adjusted net asset value per share basis.
