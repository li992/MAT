Financial Commentary The financial performance in 2010 has been very strong.
On the back of the record new business figures, we are reporting strong growth in all profit measures.
A particular highlight is the more than doubling of the cash result, which provides further evidence of the growing maturity of the business.

Given the strong recovery in the markets during the year there was a 77.7 million charge, arising mainly on capital gains on equity holdings in the unit linked funds.
This compares to a negative charge of 21.4 million for the prior year.
Taking account of this policyholder tax, the pre-tax profit for the year was 161.9 million, compared with a pre-tax profit of 28.5 million in 2009.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 17 Financial Commentary continued SECTION 3: CASH RESULT AND CAPITAL Noted below are a number of issues regarding the post-tax cash result and the capital position.
Cash Result As noted in the section above, the Board believe that the EEV approach provides the most meaningful measure of the Groups operating performance.
However, it reflects all future cash flows, which in a growing company may be significantly larger than the current level of cash being generated.
To assist shareholders this section therefore provides disclosure on the underlying post-tax cash result of the Group.
The cash result is the combination of the cash arising from the business in force at the start of the year less the investment to acquire the new business in the current period.
In effect, a proportion of the cash arising from the in-force business is reinvested for future cash returns.
The cash result for the year at 48.3 million was more than double the 23.5 million in 2009.
The tables and commentary below provide an indicative analysis of the cash result.

In other words there is a cost which offsets the 11.9 million.
Like the net annual management fee, the unwind of surrender penalties has increased due to the higher stock markets and the new funds under management added during 2010: however, the increase has been partly offset by the fact that the funds under management added six years ago have completed the surrender penalty period.
In addition, the increase in the minimum pension age from 50 to 55 in 2010 means this treatment can be applied to more of our pension business.
As a result there has been an increase in the amount of the unwind of surrender penalties for 2010 compared to 2009.
Margin arising from new business: this is the cash impact of new business in the year after taking into account the directly attributable expenses.
The negative margin on new business represents the upfront net cash outflow from a certain category of pension new business where we are unable to apply surrender penalties.
The increase in the minimum pension age from 50 to 55 referred to above has reduced the proportion of the business where we are unable to use surrender penalties.
This, together with the increase in profitability of the distribution element of our new business activity, has reduced the new business strain.
Establishment expenses: these are the post-tax expenses of running the Groups infrastructure as shown in the table on page 22 but are shown as post-tax rather than pre-tax numbers.
