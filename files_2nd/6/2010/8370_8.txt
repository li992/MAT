Intertek Annual Report 2010 25 Financial Review Key financial performance indicators The Group uses a variety of key performance indicators KPIs to Key financial monitor the financial performance of the Group.
Similar indicators are used to review the performance of the operating divisions and performance indicators business units.
These KPIs are regularly reviewed by the Board and management and are used to assess past performance and set Revenue targets for the future.
A number of the KPIs also form part of the management incentive scheme whereby managers may receive annual bonus payments on achieving or exceeding a range of Up 11% targets set for the year.
Further information on management incentives is given in the Remuneration Report which starts on Organic revenue at constant rates page 54.
A critical performance indicator for the Group is the continuing Up 8% expansion of the revenue base.
Whilst the Group continues to seek opportunities for expansion through acquisitions, the Board places great emphasis on the achievement of sustainable organic revenue Adjusted operating profit growth.
During the year under review, total revenue increased by 11%, of which 10% came from organic revenue growth 8% at constant exchange rates.
This resulted in growth in both adjusted Up 9% operating profit and organic adjusted operating profit of 9% 6% at constant exchange rates.
Organic adjusted operating profit As a people intensive business, it is critical that costs are closely at constant rates controlled and that the cost base of individual operating entities remain relevant to underlying revenue generation.
Accordingly, the operating margin of individual operating entities is the subject Up 6% of critical review.
During 2010, the adjusted operating margin was 16.6% 2009: 16.9%.
Adjusted operating margin Strong cash conversion is crucial for the Group to fund its growth programme.
Working capital is kept to a minimum and each division 1 6.6 % has a range of targets on cash conversion.
Operating cash flow is routinely monitored to ensure that it is comparable with past performance and is consistent with budgeted activity.
Operating cash flow The Board seeks to achieve robust and consistently growing earnings per share performance.
Earnings per share performance also forms Down 3% an important part of the bonus criteria for management incentives.
Basic earnings per share measures actual earnings attributed to Operating cash flow operating profit shareholders in the financial year over the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share measures actual earnings attributable to shareholders in the financial year over the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 100 % but adjusted for the impact of potentially dilutive share awards.
These metrics are also adjusted to exclude certain costs see page 91, Diluted adjusted earnings per share to enable shareholders to gain a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
Up 10% The rate of return on invested capital measures the efficiency of Group investments: the higher the rate achieved means that investment gains compare more favourably with the cost of Dividend per share investment.
This is an important measure to assess the year on year efficiency of investment decisions.
It is also an important criteria in the decision making process when projects are competing for Up 10% limited funds.
