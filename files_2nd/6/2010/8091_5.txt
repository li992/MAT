Financial Review 2010 was a challenging year from a global trading perspective so I am pleased with these fi financial results which demonstrate the strength of a balanced portfolio and an ability to manage costs eff ectively.
Adam Walker, Finance Director Adjusted and Statutory Results In this Financial Review we refer to adjusted and statutory results.
Adjusted results are prepared to provide a more comparable indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Adjusted operating profit increased to 313.2m 2009: 309.5m driven by the slight increase in the adjusted operating margin from 25.3% to 25.5%.
The increase in adjusted operating profi t and margin demonstrates the benefi ts of our early actions to adapt our cost base to the challenging trading conditions.
As well as the increase in adjusted operating profi t, we are pleased by the way the Group has continued to convert profi t into cash.
Free cash fl ow generated by the Group was 231.4m, up 3%.
Translation Impact The Group generates the majority of its revenue overseas.
The largest exposure is to US Dollars with approximately 49% of Group revenue generated in USD and currencies pegged to the USD.
Each one cent movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa 3.9m impact on revenue and a circa 1.4m impact on operating profi ts.
Off setting any negative impact on operating profi ts are decreases to interest payable and tax payable.
For bank debt covenant testing purposes, profi t and debt translation is calculated at the average rate of exchange throughout the relevant period.
