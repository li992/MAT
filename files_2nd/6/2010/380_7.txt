31 Aegis Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Earn-outs and put options Our estimated future earn-out liabilities decreased by 6.5m to 63.7m at the end of the year.
Decreases in liabilities due to payments made in the year were partly offset by acquired earn-outs of 10.4m through Mitchell, revaluations of future liabilities and currency effects.
The vast majority of our earn-out commitments depend on the post acquisition financial performance of businesses acquired.
Liabilities in respect of put options increased by 3.1m to 34.5m 2009: 31.4m.
Cash flow Cash inflows from underlying operations were 250.2m 2009: 237.6m, up 5.3%, driven largely by improved profitability across the Group and working capital inflows.
Statutory cash inflows from operations were 232.5m, up 16.8% from 199.1m in 2009.
Net cash outflows on acquisitions and disposals was 164.7m, primarily relating to the acquisition of Mitchell Communication Group and our stake in Charm, as well as earn-out liabilities paid in the year.
Financing In 2010, the Group made good progress in extending its debt maturity and diversifying its debt profile and, as a result, the headroom on the Groups facilities increased.
In April 2010, the Group issued a convertible bond to raise 190.6m.
The convertible bond bears interest at 2.5% per annum and is convertible at the option of the holder into Aegis ordinary shares at an exchange price of 1.6444.
The final maturity of the bonds is 20 April 2015.
In July 2010, the Group successfully refinanced the revolving credit facility with a new 5 year 450.0m facility, syndicated amongst twelve international banks, the tenure of which has been lengthened until 2015.
We ended the year with a comfortable covenant position.
Our leverage covenant net debt EBITDA was 1.5 times compared to a covenant requirement of 3 times and our interest cover covenant EBITDA net interest was 8.2 times compared to a covenant requirement of 4 times.
Covenant Requirement 2010 2009 Leverage Less than 3 times 1.5 1.2 Interest cover Greater than 4 times 8.2 10.8 Under our committed central facilities, we had undrawn available facilities at the year end of 450.0m 2009: 376.4m.
The improvement in central headroom is a result of the convertible bond, the proceeds from which were used to reduce drawings under the Groups revolving credit facility.
Eight tranches of existing US private placement funding mature between 2012 and 2019.
Cash flow forecasts produced on a prudent basis for the next three years show that the Group has sufficient headroom and available facilities to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
