The metrics to their IFRS equivalents that are calculated in accordance increase is largely as a result of the growth in property values with the Best Practices Recommendations of the European Public particularly in the first half of the year, and recurring profit Real Estate Association EPRA.
SEGRO uses these alternative metrics as they highlight the underlying recurring performance of generated, offset by dividends paid and the impact of the property rental business, which is our core operational activity.
The EPRA metrics also provide a consistent basis to enable The EPRA net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders a comparison between European property companies.

EPRA nAv includes adjustments to include the unrecognised fair value uplift on trading properties and to exclude the fair value of derivatives.
The 2009 position has been changed accordingly.
Excluding these adjustments, the 2009 EPRA nAv as previously reported was 362 pence per share.

The total cost ratio for 2010 was 28.1 per cent compared to 29.9 per cent in 2009.

Such costs amounted to 22.7 million 2009: 21.2 million in the year.

ForeiGn cUrrencY translation eXposUre The Group has negligible transactional foreign currency exposure, but does have a significant currency translation exposure arising on the conversion of its substantial foreign currency denominated net assets mainly euro into sterling in the Group consolidated accounts.
The Group policy is to hedge between 50 per cent and 90 per cent of foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities of the same currency to protect the Groups reported consolidated net asset value, earnings, cash flows and financial gearing covenant.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had gross foreign currency assets amounting to 1,759.4 million, which were 81 per cent hedged by gross foreign currency denominated liabilities including the impact of derivative financial instruments of 1,417.4 million.
A 10 per cent movement in the value of sterling against all currencies in which the Group operates at 31 December 2010 would have changed net assets by approximately 32 million and reported adjusted gearing by less than 1 per cent.
including the impact of forward foreign exchange and currency swap contracts used to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets the impact on adjusted gearing would have been approximately 3 per cent.
The average exchange rate during 2010 was 1.17: 1.
Based on the hedging position at 31 December 2010 and assuming that this position had applied throughout 2010, if the euro had been 10 per cent weaker than it was against sterling throughout the year 1.29: 1, EPRA profits after tax for the year would have been approximately 4 million 3 per cent lower than those reported.
