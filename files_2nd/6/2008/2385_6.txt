2007 included $1,132 million for the acquisition of Chevrons Netherlands manufacturing company.
Capital expenditure in 2006 included $1 billion in respect of our investment in Rosneft.
Capital expenditure and acquisitions for 2004 included $1,354 million for including TNKs interest in Slavneft within TNK-BP and $1,355 million for the acquisition of Solvays interests in BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe and BP Solvay Polyethylene North America.
With the exception of the shares issued to Alfa Group and Access Renova AAR in connection with TNK-BP 2004-2006, all capital expenditure and acquisitions during the past five years have been financed from cash flow from operations, disposal proceeds and external financing.
c The number of ordinary shares shown has been used to calculate per share amounts.
d Net debt and the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity ratio are non-GAAP measures.
We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
Net debt has been redefined to include the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is claimed.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
Amounts for comparative periods are presented on a consistent basis.

Production and proved reserves exclude royalties due to others, whether payable in cash or in kind, where the royalty owner has a direct interest in the underlying production and the option and ability to make lifting and sales arrangements independently, and include minority interests in consolidated operations.
b Includes 21 million barrels 20 million barrels at 31 December 2007 and 23 million barrels at 31 December 2006 in respect of the 30% minority interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC.
c Includes 216 million barrels 210 million barrels at 31 December 2007 and 179 million barrels at 31 December 2006 in respect of the 6.80% minority interest in TNK-BP 6.51% at 31 December 2007 and 6.29% at 31 December 2006. d Includes 3,108 billion cubic feet of natural gas 3,211 billion cubic feet at 31 December 2007 and 3,537 billion cubic feet at 31 December 2006 in respect of the 30% minority interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC.
e Includes 131 billion cubic feet 68 billion cubic feet at 31 December 2007 and 99 billion cubic feet at 31 December 2006 in respect of the 5.92% minority interest in TNK-BP 5.88% at 31 December 2007 and 7.77% at 31 December 2006. f BP estimates proved reserves for reporting purposes in accordance with SEC rules and relevant guidance.
As currently required, these proved reserve estimates are based on prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.
There was a rapid and substantial decline in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 that was not matched by a similar reduction in operating costs by the end of the year.
BP does not expect that these economic conditions will continue.
However, our 2008 reserves are calculated on the basis of operating activities that would be undertaken were year-end prices and costs to persist.
During 2008, 1,085 million barrels of oil and natural gas, on an oil equivalent basis mmboe, were added to BPs proved reserves for subsidiaries excluding purchases and sales.
After allowing for production, which amounted to 937mmboe, BPs proved reserves for subsidiaries were 12,562mmboe at 31 December 2008.
These proved reserves are mainly located in the US 44%, Rest of Americas 17%, Asia Pacific 10%, Africa 11% and the UK 8%.
For equity-accounted entities, 646mmboe were added to proved reserves excluding purchases and sales, production was 491mmboe and proved reserves were 5,585mmboe at 31 December 2008.
Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 5.8 billion cubic feet bcf 1 million barrels.
