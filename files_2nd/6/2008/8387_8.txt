Treasury policy The Groups treasury policy is approved by the Board and seeks to ensure that: appropriate financial resources are available for the maintenance and development of the Groups businesses: Steve Hare the financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty Chief Financial Officer credit exposure is optimised: and treasury operates as a cost centre and no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Funding, liquidity and treasury management Operating within the strict controls of this policy, the Groups treasury function manages these financial risks, ensuring in particular that sufficient funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the Group.
In addition to the free cash flow of the Group, Invensys adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of longterm debt facilities and shortterm cash deposits.
Core funding and guarantee issuance is provided by bank facilities maturing in december 2010.
These facilities hold security over property, plant and equipment, working capital, cash and share certificates of subsidiaries.

The interest expense of foreign currency debt may also reduce the level of earnings exposed to exchange rate movements.
To implement this policy the Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and currency swaps Credit risk to manage its interest rate exposure.

assessed using ratings from major credit rating agencies.
Currency risk Further information on the risks arising from financial instruments Transaction exposure is included in Note 22 to the Group financial statements.
Currency transaction exposure arises when the Groups businesses face revenues or costs in a currency other than their own.
The incidence of this risk varies across the Group and is subject to change.
Usually however the majority of revenues and costs will be in the functional currency of the business unit undertaking the transaction.
Where this is not the case and the exposure is significant, it is the Groups policy for businesses to hedge their exposure.
The Group is also subject to exchange risk in making bids, particularly on major contracts.
The assumption of a specific exchange rate within a bid would lead to a change in the anticipated margin on the contract should a bid be successful: this risk is hedged if significant.
The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts to manage transaction exposure.
