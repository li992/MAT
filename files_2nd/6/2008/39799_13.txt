Going Concern As explained above, the Group had significant funds availability as at 31 December 2008, totalling 777.5 million and comprised of 165.8 million of cash deposits and 611.7 million of undrawn bank facilities.
The Group has a relatively good debt maturity profile, with significant long term funding in place.
Funds availability is more than adequate to meet the capital expenditure plans and other financial commitments of the Group for the foreseeable future.
In order to provide further financial flexibility, the Group renegotiated its bank gearing covenant to 160% in February 2009 and, on 4 March 2009 announced a fully underwritten rights issue which is expected to raise additional equity of approximately 500 million after costs.
The current economic conditions have created a number of uncertainties as set out on page 25.
Whilst there is uncertainty over future market-driven valuation movements which may affect our ability to remain within our bank covenants, we consider that the revised gearing covenant and the additional equity provide the Company and Group with sufficient financial flexibility for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
