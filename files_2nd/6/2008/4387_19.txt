Business review financial review Despite the rapidly deteriorating commodity price environment in the latter part of 2008, Dana has delivered another year of record financial performance.
A new high for average oil and gas production of 39,365 boepd a 29% growth over previous year allied to stronger average realised prices resulted in record revenue of 518.0m 2007: 311.5m : record profits for the financial year of 96.2m 2007: 63.0m and a 75% improvement in cash generated from operations.
Revenue Annualised average, working interest production for the year was 39,365 boepd 2007: 30,514 boepd, with 71% delivered from Europe 2007: 89%, principally reflecting the full David MacFarlane year contribution from the Egyptian acquisition which completed in the final quarter of 2007.
Finance Director Liquids accounted for 74% of total production 2007: 80% with 26% from gas 2007: 20%.
The Group realised the following average prices per working interest barrel of oil equivalent for hydrocarbon sales during the year: 2008 2007 UK Norway Egypt Total UK Norway Egypt Total Realised price per crude barrel $96.21 $94.21 $89.80 $94.39 $70.88 $80.77 $81.98 $72.40 sold Brent annual average $98.90 $72.45 $81.24 $88.44 Realised gas price per therm 46.9p 32.1p 46.5p 35.5p 25.3p 35.2p NBP average price per therm 57.5p 29.3p 38.3p Revenue per boe $78.45 $107.49 $28.55 $66.58 $56.99 $95.53 $38.05 $56.03 average during 2007 ownership period Differences from the average Brent price represent the timings of actual liftings and the premia or discount to Brent at which our equity crude is sold.
Realised gas prices represent a blended average of gas sold under long-term contracts from the Groups older established gas fields, and uncontracted gas from the Cavendish field, where gas is sold on a day-ahead basis.
The UK and Norway revenue per boe metrics reflect the composite effect of the above sales, adjusted for crude inventory movements, associated gas production and tariff and other income received.
In Egypt, the revenue per working interest boe reflects the Groups entitlement under the production sharing contract regime, and the excess cost recovery status of the individual production sharing contracts.
Consequently, the combination of increased production and higher overall realisations per barrel led to revenue increasing to a record level of 518.0 million 2007: 311.5 million, an increase of 66%.
