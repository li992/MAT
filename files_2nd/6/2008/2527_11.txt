Programming inventory The key area of accounting for programming inventory requiring judgement is the assessment of the appropriate prole over which to recognise amortisation in the income statement.
This assessment requires the Group to form an expectation of the number of times a programme will be broadcast and the value associated with each broadcast.
For general entertainment programming, in order to perform this assessment of amortisation prole, we consider the expected number of viewers a programme is likely to achieve on repeat broadcast, the alternative programming available to the programming scheduler, the potential marketing benets relating to the scheduling of certain programmes and the Groups assessment of its competitors scheduling intentions when determining the amount of programme expense to recognise for each broadcast.
