24 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL REVIEW Trading results for the year A detailed review of the trading results for the year is set out in the Chairmans statement, Chief Executives statement and the business reviews of ESAB and Howden.
Exceptional items In order to help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance, Charter presents items that are both material and non-recurring as exceptional items and excludes them from adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share.
The results for the year to 31 December 2008 include exceptional costs of 8.3 million, comprising restructuring costs of 6.2 million and costs incurred in connection with the change in holding company of 2.1 million.
The restructuring costs are in respect of the cost and capacity reductions being implemented by ESAB in response to the global economic downturn.
On 22 October 2008, Charter International plc became the ultimate holding company of the then Charter plc the former holding company of the Charter group pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement approved by the High Court and the shareholders of Charter plc.
Transaction costs attributable to the issue of shares by Charter International plc as part of the Scheme of Arrangement of 1.6 million have been charged directly to reserves.
Other costs of implementing the Scheme of Arrangement totalling 2.1 million have been charged to the income statement as an exceptional item.
The reasons for the Scheme of Arrangement were set out in the circular to Charter plc shareholders dated 8 September 2008.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share were 90.1 pence 2007: 82.7 pence.
However, adjusted earnings per share is considered to be a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 17.1 per cent to 99.2 pence 2007: 84.7 pence and were derived from basic earnings per share as set out below.
Per share Total earnings 2008 2007 2008 2007 pence pence m m Basic earnings 90.1 82.7 150.2 137.8 Items not relating to underlying business performance: Exceptional items 5.0 8.3 Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill 1.1 0.3 1.9 0.5 Losses on retranslation of intercompany loan balances 2.8 1.5 4.6 2.5 Taxation on items not relating to underlying business performance 0.3 0.3 0.5 0.5 Minority share of items not relating to underlying business performance 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.1 Adjusted earnings attributable to equity shareholders 99.2 84.7 165.3 141.2 Net financing charge credit The net financing charge, before retranslation of intercompany loan balances, of 1.9 million 2007: 4.1 million net credit comprised interest on retirement benefit obligations of 0.7 million, interest payable of 5.4 million, fair value loss on derivative financial instruments of 1.0 million and the unwinding of discounts on provisions of 0.4 million, offset by interest income of 3.3 million and other financing credits of 2.3 million.
Taxation In 2008, the total tax on profit on ordinary activities was 39.0 million 2007: 33.3 million, which comprised: 2008 2007 m m Current tax credit charge UK 0.7 1.0 overseas 54.7 39.4 54.0 40.4 Deferred tax credit UK 0.1 2.6 overseas 15.4 5.0 Tax charge on adjusted profit before tax, before share of post tax profits of associates 38.5 32.8 Tax on exceptional items overseas 1.5 Tax on amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill overseas 0.4 0.1 Tax on net gains on retranslation of intercompany loan balances UK 3.8 overseas 1.4 0.6 Tax charge 39.0 33.3 CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OUR BUSINESSES 25 The tax charge of 39.0 million compares with tax paid in the year of 49.7 million.
The tax charge is lower than the actual tax paid in the year principally due to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets in respect of historical tax losses.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 18.4 per cent 2007: 18.4 per cent, calculated as follows: 2008 2007 m m Profit before tax 197.7 178.1 Add deduct adjustments: exceptional items 8.3 amortisation of acquired intangibles and goodwill 1.9 0.5 net losses on retranslation of intercompany loan balances 4.6 2.5 share of post tax profits of associates 3.2 3.2 Adjusted profit before tax, before share of post tax profits of associates 209.3 177.9 Tax charge before taxation on adjustments above 38.5 32.8 Adjusted effective tax rate 18.4% 18.4% The adjusted effective tax rate in the year remained at 18.4 per cent, in line with the effective rate for the previous year, as the Group continues to benefit from increasing profits being generated in relatively low tax jurisdictions, such as China and Eastern Europe, together with the recognition and utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses.
The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to remain at approximately the same level in the short term.
Acquisitions Charter made three acquisitions during the year, details of which are set out in note 29.
The impact of acquisitions on the 2008 results was to increase ESABs revenue and operating profit by 10.4 million and 1.9 million respectively and to increase Howdens revenue and operating profit by 4.4 million and 0.5 million respectively.
In 2008, the annual revenue of the businesses acquired was 27.8 million.
Impairment review of tangible assets ESAB China Over recent years, ESAB has been investing in new factories in China for the manufacture and supply of welding consumables, standard equipment and cutting machines.
At 31 December 2008, the total net carrying value of property, plant and equipment of ESAB China was 39.1 million comprising land and buildings of 16.6 million, plant and machinery of 21.9 million and vehicles and office equipment of 0.6 million.
This investment includes 18.6 million in respect of the recently commissioned plants in Weihai for consumables and at Zhangjiagang for equipment.
In view of the trading performance, start-up costs and challenging economic environment in China, the Directors have conducted an impairment review in respect of the property, plant and equipment of ESAB China and, as a result, continue to believe that the fair value of these assets is in excess of carrying value.
Currency Charters results are sensitive to movements in exchange rates.
The translation impact of exchange rate movements on segmental revenue and operating profits before exceptional items is set out below: Underlying 2007 movement translated at constant at 2008 exchange exchange Currency 2008 rates rates fluctuations 2007 m m m m m Revenue ESAB 1,259.8 163.5 1,096.3 125.5 970.8 Howden 627.2 101.9 525.3 45.0 480.3 Total 1,887.0 265.4 1,621.6 170.5 1,451.1 Operating profit before exceptional items ESAB 148.6 1.2 149.8 23.2 126.6 Howden 73.1 9.1 64.0 6.4 57.6 Central operations 12.4 1.5 10.9 10.9 Total 209.3 6.4 202.9 29.6 173.3 CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 26 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Currency movements account for 11.7 per cent and 17.1 per cent of the year on year increase in sales and operating profits respectively.
However, this is only the translation impact of currency movements.
It excludes the impact of currency movements on transactions, for example when products are manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another.
The transaction impact of currency movements is difficult to quantify but it has had a negative impact on the 2008 results.
Trading results and cash flows of overseas operations have been converted into sterling at average rates of exchange whereas the balance sheets were converted at year-end rates of exchange.
The most significant exchange rates for the Group were as follows: At 31 Average At 31 Average December rate for December rate for 2008 2008 2007 2007 Rates of exchange to 1 US dollar 1.44 1.85 1.99 2.00 Euro 1.03 1.26 1.36 1.46 Chinese renminbi 9.81 12.90 14.54 15.22 Brazilian real 3.35 3.34 3.54 3.89 Czech koruna 27.77 31.64 36.20 40.43 Polish zloty 4.26 4.42 4.90 5.51 Balance sheet The following table shows a summary of the balance sheet: 2008 2007 m m Non-current assets excluding retirement benefits assets 526.4 335.1 Inventory 292.0 177.5 Trade and other receivables 573.2 412.0 Trade and other payables 512.2 369.1 Working capital 353.0 220.4 Derivative financial instruments and tax liabilities 91.0 54.9 Net retirement benefit obligations 139.3 76.6 Provisions 74.9 55.6 Other long-term liabilities 7.7 2.6 Net cash 51.8 88.2 618.3 454.0 Equity shareholders funds 578.3 426.4 Minority interests 40.0 27.6 618.3 454.0 During the year, total equity shareholders funds increased by 151.9 million to 578.3 million 2007: 426.4 million.
The principal components of this increase were the profit for the year attributable to Charter shareholders of 150.2 million and net exchange translation gains of 116.3 million, offset by net after tax losses on cash flow and net investment hedges of 36.0 million, net after tax actuarial losses on retirement benefit obligations of 45.8 million and dividends paid of 31.7 million.
As at 31 December 2008, the total equity attributable to minority interests had increased to 40.0 million 2007: 27.6 million, reflecting profit attributable to minority interests of 8.5 million and net translation gains of 8.3 million, offset by dividends payable of 4.3 million and other adjustments of 0.1 million.
The significant minority interests are the 30 per cent interest in Howden Hua Engineering Co Limited, the 45 per cent interest in Howden Africa Holdings Limited and the 44 per cent interest in ESAB India.
As at 31 December 2008, the Company had net retirement benefit obligations of 139.3 million 2007: 76.6 million.
This represents 24.1 per cent of equity shareholders funds as at that date compared with 18.0 per cent as at 31 December 2007.
Working capital has grown by 132.6 million to 353.0 million, an increase of 60.2 per cent.
Currency fluctuations account for 63.3 million of the increase, with acquisitions during the year contributing 6.4 million.
The underlying increase in working capital excluding acquisitions is therefore 62.9 million or 28.5 per cent.
Included within trade and other receivables are amounts receivable under construction contracts of 71.9 million 2007: 55.7 million.
Included within trade and other payables are amounts payable under construction contracts of 115.7 million 2007: 82.2 million.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OUR BUSINESSES 27 Retirement benefit obligations As shown in the table below, the net obligation in respect of pensions and other post-retirement benefits increased by 62.7 million in the year to 139.3 million.

Provisions At 31 December 2008, provisions were 74.9 million 2007: 55.6 million.
Of this amount, 35.5 million 2007: 29.7 million was in respect of legal and environmental claims and disputes.
Of the remainder, 6.1 million 2007: 1.0 million was in respect of disposals and restructuring, 28.0 million 2007: 21.3 million was in respect of warranty and product liability, and 5.3 million 2007: 3.6 million was in respect of other items.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 28 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Cash flow During the year, the net cash of 88.2 million at 31 December 2007 reduced by 36.4 million to 51.8 million at 31 December 2008.
Cash flows during the year are summarised below.
2008 2007 m m Operating profit 201.0 173.3 Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment 21.7 14.7 Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets 5.2 1.9 Charge for share-based incentives 0.9 0.5 Loss profit on sale of property, plant and equipment 0.2 0.3 Increase in inventories 57.4 30.5 Increase in receivables 28.1 62.4 Increase in payables 29.8 70.0 Movement in working capital 55.7 22.9 Movement in provisions 2.2 3.0 Movement in net retirement benefit obligations 16.0 21.1 Cash flow from operations 159.5 149.1 Capital expenditure 66.5 47.7 Capitalised development costs 4.4 2.9 Acquisitions 39.4 26.2 110.3 76.8 Disposals 2.4 Sale of property, plant and equipment 1.7 3.3 108.6 71.1 Dividends from associates 1.6 1.2 Net financing expense income 2.0 0.3 Dividends paid to minority interests 4.3 3.1 Dividends paid to equity shareholders 31.7 Tax paid 49.7 35.9 Share issue costs 1.6 Purchase of treasury shares 0.2 Net cash flow 37.0 40.5 New finance leases 0.4 0.1 Movement in interest payable accrual 0.1 0.1 Foreign exchange adjustments 1.1 4.6 Increase in net cash 36.4 45.1 Opening net cash 88.2 43.1 Closing net cash 51.8 88.2 Cash flow from operations generated 159.5 million 2007: 149.1 million, an increase of 7.0 per cent over the previous year.
This represents cash conversion of 79.4 per cent compared with 86.0 per cent in 2007.
The amount spent on acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of 39.4 million related to acquisitions in Singapore, Italy and Brazil, together with 0.5 million in respect of prior year acquisitions.
Free cash flow for the year, as set out below, was 40.2 million, compared with 67.4 million in 2007, and reflects a significant investment of 69.2 million 2007: 47.3 million on capital expenditure and development costs, net of disposal proceeds.
2008 2007 m m Cash flow from operations 159.5 149.1 Net interest paid received 2.0 0.3 Tax paid 49.7 35.9 Net cash flow from operating activities 107.8 113.5 Net capital expenditure including development costs 69.2 47.3 Dividends from associates 1.6 1.2 Free cash flow 40.2 67.4 Gross capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment 57.3 45.2 Depreciation 20.9 14.7 Ratio 2.7 3.1 CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OUR BUSINESSES 29 Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment of 57.3 million exceeded depreciation by 36.4 million 2007: 30.0 million.
Capital expenditure continues to be greater in ESAB than in Howden, the largest capital projects being ESABs new consumables and equipment plants in China.
Cash and borrowings As at 31 December 2008, cash balances were 95.7 million 2007: 118.5 million, of which the majority was held overseas for local working capital purposes or pending dividend payments.
Of the cash held overseas, 4.1 million 2007: 3.3 million is retained as cash collateral in connection with certain local trading practices or banking facilities.
The credit status of institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
As at 31 December 2008, gross borrowings were 43.9 million 2007: 30.3 million.
Going concern At 31 December 2008, in addition to net cash balances of 51.8 million, the Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 145.0 million, which are due to expire unless otherwise extended or renewed between 2011 and 2013.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial and other covenants, the financial strength of the Charter Group means that the covenants attaching to these facilities are not expected to prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required.
In addition, various members of the Group have uncommitted and committed bank facilities in place, some of which are secured, to meet local funding requirements.
At 31 December 2008, the Group had 233.1 million of uncommitted bonding facilities, of which 72.5 million were provided by its principal bankers.
Bonds and guarantees totalling 167.7 million had been issued under these facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing both the consolidated financial statements for the Group and the financial statements of the Company.
In reaching this conclusion, the Directors reviewed the cash flow forecasts based on the Groups budget for 2009, and operating plans, and have taken into consideration the net cash position at 31 December 2008, the availability of committed facilities, the covenants attaching to those facilities and the sensitivities inherent in the cash flow forecasts.
In particular, the Directors have considered carefully the principal risks to which the Group is exposed, including those summarised below.
The Directors monitor the expected outturn for the full year on an ongoing basis both in terms of profit and cash and appropriate mitigating action would be taken if it became apparent that there was a risk that the Group might miss its previous forecasts.
Contingent liabilities Details of contingent liabilities are set out in note 27.
Significant accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the accounting policies set out in note 1.
Applying accounting policies requires the use of certain judgements, assumptions and estimates.
The following accounting policies have been identified as being the most significant and where there is most risk of a material adjustment to the carrying value of the Groups assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
goodwill impairment construction contracts deferred tax warranty and legal liabilities retirement benefits Risks and uncertainties Charter, both directly and through ESAB and Howden, is exposed to a wide variety of markets and geographies and seeks to manage the risks and uncertainties which arise from this.
In certain instances, and where it is cost-effective to do so, exposures can be transferred to third parties, for example through insurance or through currency hedging.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by Charter, and the ways in which they are being managed, are set out below.
Economic recession Many regions in which Charter companies operate entered recession or experienced a sharp economic slowdown during 2008: these regions include in particular, the USA, Europe and parts of Asia, including China.
The consumption of steel, which is a key leading indicator for ESAB, saw unprecedented falls in the fourth quarter of 2008 across all major regions.
Whilst many governments have moved quickly to introduce policies aimed at alleviating the impact of the recession, it remains unclear how effective these policies will be in stimulating economic recovery.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 30 BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED ESAB experienced a sharp reduction in the demand for certain of its products in the fourth quarter of 2008 and has moved quickly to reduce output and manned capacity.
Whilst it believes that these steps are appropriate in the light of current forecasts for changes in demand, there can be no certainty that additional steps will not be required and that additional exceptional costs will not be incurred.
Howdens sales in 2008 were not impacted to any material extent by the economic slowdown.
However, Howden is expecting to face pressure on its order book if its customers reduce their capital expenditure budgets or defer projects until a later date.
Howden has the opportunity to take steps to alleviate the impact of any reduction in orders for new equipment or aftermarket sales, for example by making less use of sub-contractors, but a prolonged downturn could materially impact Howdens revenues and profit.
Whilst Howden to date has experienced only limited order cancellations and deferrals, it is possible that, were economic conditions to deteriorate further, this could have a material impact on revenues and profit.
Financing The second half of 2008, and the final quarter of the year in particular, saw an unprecedented reduction in the availability of banking facilities and other forms of financing.
Whilst the deterioration was general, some countries experienced more rapid or more pronounced reductions than others.
The immediate impact on Charter was relatively limited as Charter had previously negotiated additional committed bank facilities and Charters strong financial position means that it makes only limited use of its bank facilities.
In the light of the change in financial conditions, Charter reviewed certain aspects of the ways in which it conducts its business.
In particular, the credit-worthiness of customers was carefully reconsidered, in certain instances resulting in reduced credit being made available.
The economic recession may also result in disruption to or failure of suppliers of goods and services to Charter companies.
To date, this has not had any material effect on Charter but additional steps are being taken to monitor the financial condition and performance of suppliers and to mitigate the risk by identifying alternative suppliers where possible.
The reduced availability of financing facilities is likely to curtail capital expenditure by corporates and expenditure by households on consumer durable goods, which may have a negative impact on the demand for products and services supplied by ESAB or Howden and which may therefore have a material impact on the financial results of both businesses.
Actions of competitors ESAB and Howden both operate in competitive markets and are exposed to market behaviour such as aggressive pricing by a competitor seeking to enter a new market, or to maintain or grow sales in a weakening market.
As set out in the business review, both businesses have established strong market positions through technological leadership, strong brands and through providing cost-effective solutions to meet their customers needs.
Both ESAB and Howden intend to maintain their current positions through measures such as continued expenditure on research and development, product innovation and customer service.
Competitor action may result initially in reductions in profit, although these are more likely to be specific to particular product areas or geographies.
The businesses strong market positions will assist them in maintaining their longer term performance.
Foreign exchange: transaction risk Transaction risk arises from product being manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another.
In ESAB, manufacturing tends to be relatively close to the end-user, which naturally reduces currency exposures.
The principal currency transaction exposures arising within ESAB do so on account of the manufacture of product in Central Europe and Sweden which is exported to the Eurozone and, to a lesser extent, to other areas, such as the Middle East.
ESABs general policy is not to hedge currency exposures unless they relate to a significant specific contract, but to look to adjust prices charged to customers to take account of the changed exchange rates.
In 2008, with the appreciation of various Central European currencies against the euro and the US dollar, ESAB suffered transactional losses in the form of lower than expected margins on certain product manufactured at its Central European and Swedish factories and sold into the Eurozone or the Middle East.
In relation to Howden, exposure is principally in relation to the US dollar and pegged currencies such as the Chinese renminbi.
Howden substantially covers forward its committed trading exposures.
Foreign exchange: translation risk Translation risk arises from the profits and net assets of non-sterling businesses being translated into a sterling value which depends upon the exchange rate.
Apart from Howdens operations in Scotland and Northern Ireland and administrative functions in the UK, Charter has minimal operations in the UK.
The largest single profit translation exposures are in relation to the US dollar and the euro.
Generally, it is Charters policy not to hedge profit translation exposures: this may give rise to unexpected fluctuations in Charters reported profit.
The Company has significant investments in operations outside the UK: as a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the consolidated balance sheet.
In certain circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet exposures.
Gains and losses arising on such hedges are recognised as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes in equity until the items being hedged have impacted the income statement.
CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 OUR BUSINESSES 31 Certain liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies.
These include working capital items, which naturally offset corresponding working capital assets, and retirement benefit obligations.
Charter does not have any meaningful amounts of debt denominated in foreign currencies.
Litigation Charter, ESAB and Howden are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of their business: further details are contained in note 27.
Pension risk There are various post-retirement benefit schemes in place within Charter, ESAB and Howden.
The assets held by the various schemes are invested by the trustees primarily in equities and bonds.
During the second half of 2008 in particular, the values of equities have seen sharp falls.
The liabilities of each scheme are subject to movements in variables such as long-term interest rates and changes in life expectancy.
The net liability which appears on Charters balance sheet relating to overseas schemes is also subject to movements in exchange rates: the depreciation of sterling against the US dollar and against European currencies in general contributed to the increase in the net liability which took place during 2008 and may reoccur in the future.
Future cash contributions by the Company to the schemes are a matter for negotiations between the pension trustees and the Company, and also to changes in legislation.
Raw material prices Most products manufactured by ESAB and Howden contain steel or other metals whose prices are generally determined on world markets but subject to regional differences.
Prices can fluctuate significantly and the first half of 2008 saw unprecedented increases in the prices of various commodities, including steel.
ESAB was able to protect itself against future price increases and against disruptions in supplies through forward contracts and by increasing its stocks of raw materials.
ESAB was also generally able to pass through the higher steel prices to its customers.
Howden also makes use of forward purchase contracts and where appropriate would also include cost price accelerator clauses in its sale contracts.
Internal controls Charter has in place a system of internal controls covering its own activities and those of ESAB and Howden.
These controls are essential for the effective management of such geographically diverse businesses.
The Companys Audit Committee has been delegated formal responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
A failure of the system of internal controls could have a material impact on the Company.
