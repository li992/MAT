As regards disposal values our business model allows us flexibility always to minimise the risk that business interruption could occur as a result over the period we hold a vehicle, and therefore, in the event of a decline in of the system changes.
In Spain we successfully transferred the Fualsa residual values, we would attempt to mitigate the impact by ageing out our operations onto the Record IT systems in May 2008 without any material existing fleet.
We also commenced changing the IT systems platform for the UK business and this process will continue throughout 2008 09.
Additionally, the Group has an appropriate business continuity plan in the event of interruption arising from an IT systems failure.
