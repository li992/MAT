These US$332.5m, an increase of US$22.2m, or 7.2%, compared with gures include voice, data and subscription revenues.
This reects an increase in both data and voice revenue.
31 December 2008, active BGAN subscribers were 27,635 Revenues from data services in the maritime sector during 2008 compared with 15,817 as at 31 December 2007, an increase were US$227.8m, an increase of US$20.1m, or 9.7%, compared of 75% year on year.
BGAN growth has been driven largely by with 2007.
The increase in revenues from data services primarily new customers, the use of new applications by existing customers reects greater demand, as a result of the take-up and and the steady migration of customers from our GAN and utilisation of our Fleet services, which was partially offset by the R-BGAN services to our BGAN service.
Although we expect the decline in our mature Inmarsat-B service.
Inmarsat-B terminals migration to BGAN to have an impact in the future, we do not declined due to old ships being decommissioned and new expect migration adversely to impact overall land data revenues.
ships being tted with Fleet terminals, which has been driven by continued growth in the global shipping new-build market.
Revenues from voice services in the land mobile sector during Additionally, we experienced increased volume of the low- 2008 were US$11.3m, a decrease of US$3.5m, or 23.6%, speed data services, typically used for email.
This result continues the trend seen over introduced in November 2007, continues to gain early customer the last few years of declining voice trafc volumes resulting from acceptance and by the end of 2008 had passed 1,500 active competition, principally for our Mini M and large antenna Mini M terminals.
These terminals are predominantly being deployed services, from other MSS operators.
This decline was partially on rets of existing ships.
Revenues from voice services in the offset by the growth in voice trafc from BGAN customers and maritime sector during 2008 were US$104.7m, an increase of a small contribution from our IsatPhone service.
We have recorded growth for two consecutive years, reecting stabilisation and Aeronautical Sector signs of renewed growth in this sector.
The year has shown During 2008, revenues from the aeronautical sector were growth in demand for voice services particularly among users US$64.4m, an increase of US$20.1m, or 45.4%, compared with of our Fleet services including crew calling, offset by a reduction 2007.
The increase is primarily due to increased demand for our in voice usage on older services such as Inmarsat-B and the Swift 64 high-speed data service where active terminals increased discontinuation of Inmarsat-A.
Our Swift 64 service targets the government aircraft and business jet markets as well as being used by Land Mobile Sector commercial airlines.
In addition, revenues for low-speed data In 2008, revenues from the land mobile sector were US$141.8m, services benefited from increased industry demand.
an increase of US$16.0m, or 12.7%, compared with 2007.
Revenues from data services in the land mobile sector during 2008 were Leasing US$130.5m, an increase of US$19.5m, or 17.6%, compared with During 2008, revenues from leasing were US$79.7m, an 2007.
The increase is a result of continued strong growth and increase of US$13.5m, or 20.4%, compared with 2007.
The usage of BGAN, offset in part by the decline in GAN high-speed increase primarily relates to new maritime, land mobile and data trafc following reduced trafc levels in the Middle East, aeronautical lease contracts, partially offset by lower revenue competition from VSAT and the expected migration of users from navigation contracts.
Revenues from our R-BGAN service of US$8.6m, which was discontinued on 31 December 2008, were Other income lower compared with the previous year of US$14.0m, largely Other income for 2008 was US$16.3m, an increase of US$5.7m or due to the expected migration to our BGAN service.
The increase in other income primarily relates to additional revenue from sales of satellite phone services SPS end-user terminals.
As well as the sale of SPS BGAN progression end-user terminals, other income consists primarily of provision Revenue and terminal numbers of in-orbit support services, income from the provision of conference facilities and renting surplus ofce space.
Seasonality Impact of volume discounts In 2008, revenues were impacted by volume discounts which increase over the course of the year, with lower discount levels in early quarters and higher discounts in later quarters, as our distribution partners meet specic volume thresholds.
The effect of these volume discounts is most prominent in the third and fourth quarters.
During 2008, volume discounts were US$63.8m, an increase of US$12.5m, or 24.4%, compared with 2007, despite overall MSS revenues growing by 13.1%.
The total amount of volume discounts was affected by the growth in underlying revenue and by the consolidation of distribution partners.
Vizada Satellite Communications and Telenor Satellite Services completed a merger in September 2007, which resulted in additional volume discounts in 2008 compared to 2007.
From May 2009, following the new distribution agreements that will come into place on 15 April 2009, the seasonal impact of volume discounts is expected to be removed.
