Report of the Directors Financial review continued 15 individual assets and liabilities of the PPP investments.
Instead, they are held at fair value less costs to sell in the balance sheet and we do not recognise our share of the underlying net income of the PPP 58.5m p. a. investments, nor do we recognise in revenue pro t any pro ts on disposal of these PPP investments.
During the course of the year, we made 47.5m from the sale of Meter t and equity interests in Trillium Development lettings in year Investment Partners, the owner of the majority of Trilliums PPP investments.
We do, however, include in revenue pro t the interest cost associated with acquiring and owning these PPP investments, which amounted to 42m for the year.
This imbalance in accounting for revenue pro t, whereby we recognise interest cost but not revenues, has resulted in the decline in Trilliums contribution to revenue pro t. The net divestment of almost 800m of investment property sales reduced interest costs related to London and Retail.
This bene t was largely offset by higher interest costs at Group level of 14.7m following the payment in July 2007 of 316.2m as our REIT entry charge and our move to paying quarterly dividends.
An explanation of the year-on-year change in revenue pro t is given in Table 6, and a reconciliation between the loss pro t before tax and the revenue pro t is shown in Table 7.

In the same way that we adjust pro t before tax to remove capital and one-off items to give revenue pro t, we also report an adjusted earnings per share gure, although this includes some additional adjustments to revenue pro t. The adjustments to earnings per share are set out in note 11 to the financial statements.
They are based on the guidance given by European Public Real Estate Association EPRA with a limited number of further adjustments to re ect better our underlying earnings.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased from 70.20p per share in 2007 to 81.71p per share in 2008, a 16.4% increase.
The increase in adjusted earnings per share is largely attributable to a signi cantly lower tax charge following REIT conversion last year only bene ted for three months, partially offset by the interest costs associated with the PPP investments in Trillium.
Total dividend We are recommending a final dividend payment of 16.0p per share.
Taken together with the three quarterly dividends of 16.0p, our full year dividend will be 64.0p per share 2007: 53.0p, a 20.8% increase over last year.
A large part of this substantial increase is attributable to the tax we have saved by being a REIT for the full financial year.
REIT conversion also impacts on the make-up of the Groups dividend, which now consists of two components: a property income distribution PID from the REIT qualifying activities and a dividend distribution from the non-qualifying activities non-PID.
The aggregate of these two components will continue to be referred to as our total dividend.
We are obliged for certain shareholders to withhold tax, currently at a rate of 20% 22% prior to 6 April 2008, from the PID element of the dividend.
Our total dividend is therefore a gross dividend.
Table 8 sets out our quarterly dividends, the date on which they were paid, and how much of each dividend was a PID, together with similar details for our proposed final dividend.
A note on the tax consequences for shareholders and forms to enable certain classes of shareholder to claim exemption from withholding tax are available on our website at www.
Land Securities Annual Report 2008 16 Financial review continued The total dividend for the year is covered 1.3 times by adjusted earnings 2007: 1.3 times.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 July 2008, our final dividend, 64p which is 100% PID will be paid on 28 July 2008 to shareholders on the Register at 20 June 2008.
This years dividend is up 20.8% on 2007 For the next financial year, our first quarterly dividend will be 16.5p of which 90% will be a PID.

The fall in value of our investment property portfolio was responsible for the decline in net assets.
In common with other property companies, we calculate an adjusted measure of net assets which we believe better re ects the underlying net assets attributable to shareholders.
Adjusted net assets are lower than our reported net assets primarily due to the debt adjustment we make.
Under current accounting standards, we do not show our debt at its nominal value, although we believe it would be more appropriate to do so and we therefore adjust our net assets accordingly.
At the year end, adjusted diluted net assets per share were 1956p per share, a decrease of 10.3% from last year end.

Financing strategy and financial structure Chart 15 Funding structure Our nancing strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to equity ratio gearing to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders while maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The Security Group 3 Total property assets 11.0bn The last 12 months has seen a major upheaval in the international debt markets, beginning with defaults on sub-prime mortgages in the US.
As a result of the nature of international banking, the contagion quickly spread around the world impacting the ability of domestic banks to make advances as their capital ratios came under pressure.
The implications for borrowers like Land Securities continue to unfold.
Initially the UK bond markets were effectively closed, and whilst this has historically been an important source of funding for the Group, our demerger plans have meant that the Group would not have accessed such longterm nancing at this time.
In the UK market, we have seen the following effects an increase in the cost of debt, the imposition of more onerous covenants, increased execution time and increased execution risk.
Despite these conditions, Land Securities has executed eight different nancing arrangements during the course of the year, either directly or through joint ventures.
We have been able to continue to access the debt markets as a result of our on-going debt investor relations programme, a responsible creditor track record and a high quality portfolio and debt structure from which to raise funding.
Under this structure see Chart 15, we bene ted from a lower cost of finance by utilising the credit strength of our investment portfolio without the more onerous restrictions of individually collateralised obligations.
Operational exibility is maintained through provisions which allow us to buy and sell assets, without restriction, and to undertake developments.
At 31 March 2008, our debt investors had security over 11.0bn of investment properties in this structure.
As previously stated, net debt increased by 5.8% from 5.1bn to 5.4bn as a result of our REIT conversion charge.
Despite only a moderate rise in net debt, gearing has increased from 47.1% to 56.2% principally due to the impacts of the revaluation fide cit on our equity.
Our interest cover ratio, excluding our share of joint ventures, has fallen from 2.43 times in 2007 to 1.93 times in 2008.
A large part of this reduction can be attributed to the accounting treatment of Trilliums PPP assets.
While we recognise the interest cost associated with acquiring these assets, we do not include our share of the underlying income they generate.
If we adjust the interest cost related to these assets, interest cover would be 2.23 times.
Under the rules of the REIT regime, we need to maintain an interest cover ratio in the exempt business of at least 1.25 times to avoid paying tax.
As calculated under the REIT 1.
Limited to the higher of 150m or 2% of total collateral value.
The borrower under the Secured Bank facility is LS Property Finance regulations, our interest cover ratio of the exempt business for the year to 31 March 2008 was 2.09 times.
