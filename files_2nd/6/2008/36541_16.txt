FINANCIAL REVIEW The financial information contained in this review is extracted or calculated from the attached income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, other financial statements, notes and the glossary of terms.
RESULT BEFORE TAX For the year ended 31 December 2008, there was a loss before tax of 1,611.5 million, compared with a profit of 110.4 million for 2007.
The significant change in the result before tax principally reflected the inclusion of unrealised property revaluation gains and losses in the income statement.
Revaluation losses of 1,649.9 million in 2008 compared with net losses of 5.0 million in 2007.
Adjusted profit before tax, which is analysed in the table below, was 113.7 million for 2008, reduced from 117.3 million in 2007.

The main reasons for the reductions in adjusted profit and earnings per share were the financing costs associated with the development programme and the REIT conversion charge, which more than offset increased net rental income.
Note 10A to the accounts on page 74 provides detailed calculations for earnings per share.
NET RENTAL INCOME In 2008, net rental income was 299.8 million compared with 275.7 million for the preceding year.
Additional net rental income from acquisitions and completed developments was largely offset by that lost as a result of disposals.
The increase therefore principally arose from properties owned throughout both years and the 11.6 million impact of exchange rate movements.
The tables below compare net rental income for 2008 and 2007, analysing the portfolio between investment properties owned throughout both years and those properties which have been acquired, sold or been under development at any time during the two year period.
On a like-for-like basis, our investment portfolio generated an increase of 3.7%, principally reflecting new lettings at the UK offices and indexation in France.
The slight fall in like-for-like net rental income for the UK retail portfolio resulted principally from higher property outgoings, which included marketing expenses associated with the launch of the recently completed shopping centre developments and bad debt expense.
Included in net rental income for 2008 is rent receivable of 4.1 million which has been accrued and allocated to rent-free periods and 3.0 million which is related to occupiers turnover.
Shopping centre car parks generated net income of 8.4 million in 2008, compared with 7.8 million in 2007.

In 2008 increased staffing costs, including 1.1 million in respect of the one-off redundancy payments arising from the staff reorganisation announced in November 2008, were offset by a reduction in professional fees.
The reorganisation and a cost reduction programme are expected to result in savings of around 3 million in 2009.
NET FINANCE COSTS Excluding the change in fair value of derivatives, bond redemption costs and capitalised interest, net finance costs were 179.7 million in 2008, 34.9 million or 24.1% higher than the equivalent 2007 figure of 144.8 million.
The increase reflected higher levels of borrowing, the cost of commitment fees for new borrowing facilities, the cost of funding the REIT conversion charge and 13.2 million arising from the movement in exchange rates over the year.
Interest of 35.9 million relating to the development programme was capitalised during 2008.
This was principally in respect of the developments at 125 Old Broad Street, Highcross, Cabot Circus and OParinor, which all completed during the year.
For 2008, the average cost of borrowing was 5.4%, around 50 basis points lower than the equivalent figure for 2007.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 32 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED ASSET IMPAIRMENT Following the termination in August by JPMorgan Chase of discussions relating to the development of their new European headquarters building, we have written off 15.9 million in respect of the costs incurred on the project.
TAX The Group now bears minimal current tax due to its status as a UK REIT and French SIIC.
For deferred tax, a provision is made for the UK tax that could arise on dividends to be received, under the SIIC rules, by Hammerson plc from French subsidiaries.
However, the UK government is proposing to introduce a corporation tax exemption for foreign dividends during 2009.
If this is enacted as proposed, virtually all the Group's net deferred tax provision of 108 million at 31 December 2008 should be written back.
The 2008 deferred tax credit of 38.3 million arose principally in respect of the decline in values of the French portfolio.
DIVIDEND The Board is proposing a final dividend of 15.3 pence per share, which together with the interim dividend of 12.6 pence makes a total dividend of 27.9 pence per share for 2008, representing an increase of 2.2% on 2007.
It is intended that 3.8 pence of the 2008 final dividend will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the remaining 11.5 pence per share being paid as a normal dividend.
The record date for the final dividend is 20 February 2009.
New shares issued in conjunction with the proposed rights issue will not be eligible for this dividend.
CASH FLOW Cash generated from operations for the year ended 31 December 2008 was 346 million compared with 208 million for 2007.
The effects of exchange, increased rental income, the expiry of rent-free periods, and an increase in the rents received from tenants by the end of 2008 compared with the previous year, all contributed to the increase.
There was a cash inflow from operating activities for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 30 million.
The comparative figure for 2007 was an outflow of 29 million.
The increase in cash generated from operations described above was partially offset by higher interest outflows and 37 million paid in respect of prior year UK tax liabilities.
Disposals raised 245 million whilst acquisitions, principally reflecting payment for the City of Londons 25% long leasehold interest in Bishops Square and capital expenditure, amounted to 514 million.
After taking account of the net cash inflow from financing activities of 328 million, there was a net increase in cash and deposits of 89 million in 2008.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 33 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED BALANCE SHEET The decline in property values was the main reason for the fall in equity shareholders funds from 4.4 billion to 2.8 billion and the corresponding reduction in adjusted net asset value per share from 15.45 at the end of 2007 to 10.36 as shown below.

In 2008, interest cover was below the guideline as a number of major developments were nearing completion.
The ratio is anticipated to improve over the next two years as rental income flows from completed developments.
The Groups exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations are managed using appropriate hedging policies.
Net debt at 31 December 2008 was 3,333 million comprising borrowings of 3,453 million and cash and deposits of 120 million.
At the year end, approximately 65% of gross debt was at fixed rates of interest and the average maturity of the Groups borrowings was just over seven years.
The chart below shows the maturity profile of our debt portfolio.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 34 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Maturity analysis of gross debt and undrawn facilities at 31 December 2008 m 1000 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2028 Bank debt drawn Other debt Undrawn facilities Euro bonds Sterling bonds During 2008, we arranged a total of 850 million of additional committed financing comprising unsecured bank facilities of 450 million and a 400 million loan secured on the office building at Bishops Square.
The loan has a five-year term and carries a fixed rate of interest of 6.3% per annum.
The 500 million 6.25% bonds which matured in June 2008 were redeemed and the 31 million loan financing the retail park at Parc Tawe was repaid.
In December we extended the maturity of 100 million of undrawn committed facilities from December 2009 to December 2010.
Undrawn committed facilities of 200 million mature in December 2009, borrowings of 33 million mature in 2009, 72 million in 2010 and 40 million in 2011.
At the end of 2008, undrawn committed facilities were 367 million which, together with cash and shortterm deposits, provided liquidity of 487 million.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing, broadly defined as the ratio of net debt to shareholders equity, should not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income divided by net interest payable, should be not less than 1.25 times.
Three of the Companys unsecured bonds contain a similar gearing covenant and two contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175%.
The bonds do not contain an interest cover covenant.
Gearing at the end of 2008 was 118% compared with 57% at the end of 2007, the increase principally resulting from the reduction in the portfolio value, particularly in the second half of 2008, and the increase in net debt arising from the strengthening of the euro and the funding of the development programme.
Interest cover was 1.67 times compared with 1.90 times for 2007.
It is anticipated that interest cover will rise over the next few years as development activity slows and income is received from completed developments.
The market value of the Groups debt at 31 December 2008 was 614 million lower than its book value.
This was equivalent, after tax relief, to an increase of 1.52 in net asset value per share.
