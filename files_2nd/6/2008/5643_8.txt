31 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Liquidity risk Filtronas objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
The Company is funded by a multi-currency syndicated facility from its bankers of 215.0m.
The syndicated facility matures in May 2010.
In addition, during the year, the Company put in place additional bilateral facilities totalling US$40.0m, which mature in November 2009.
As at 31 December 2008, the available bank facilities totalled 242.8m, of which 198.1m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term flexibility.
Foreign currency risk The majority of Filtronas net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets and by using forward foreign exchange contracts.
However, in response to the significant weakening of sterling against particularly the US dollar and euro in the fourth quarter of 2008 and to reduce the effect of currency movements on the Groups net debt, the Company temporarily suspended its normal policy, repaid substantially all of its US dollar and euro denominated financial liabilities and replaced them with sterling denominated debt.
As a result, at 31 December 2008, Filtronas net assets were exposed to the impact of foreign currency translation.
The Company does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement.
The majority of Filtronas transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited.
However, where they do occur, the Groups policy is to hedge a percentage of the exposures over a period up to 15 months using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Principal exchange rates Principal exchange rates for Filtrona were: Average Closing | 2008 2007 2008 2007 US$ : 1.85 2.00 1.44 1.99 : 1.26 1.46 1.03 1.36 The translation impact in 2008 of the movement in exchange rates was to increase revenue by 37.1m and operating profit by 6.3m.
