11 CLS Holdings plc Annual Report & Accounts FINANCIAL REVIEW INTRODUCTION The second tender-offer, announced in November 2008, was concluded on 7 January 2009.
The terms of this tender offer Due to the continued downturn in the global economy were to buy back 2 in every 9 shares at 350p per share, a total during 2008 causing further downward pressure on distribution of 48.0 million.
If the results of this tender offer property values, the Group has suffered a loss before had been taken into account as at 31 December 2008, the taxation of 142.2 million for the year 31 December 2007: adjusted NAV per share would have been 732.1 pence per loss of 72.6 million, and an after tax loss of 78.1 million share, an improvement of 84.9 pence from the year end and 31 December 2007: loss of 32.5 million.
Adjusted net only 4.2 per cent down on 31 December 2007. assets reduced from 517.6 million at 31 December 2007 to 399.6 million, a reduction of 118.0 million or 22.8 per cent GOING CONCERN The directors regularly stress-test the statutory net assets from 403.1 million to 338.6 million.

NET RENTAL INCOME of 61.3 million decreased by 7.5 per cent December 2007: 66.3 million primarily due to disposals of properties in the first half of the year.
OTHER INCOME amounted to a net loss of 4.9 million December 2007: income 7.1 million and included a 3.6 million contribution from Wyatt Group formerly Lunarworks.
Our associate companies Catena AB and Bulgarian Land Development Plc BLD, in common with many listed real estate companies, suffered from downward valuation adjustments during 2008.
Consequently our share of their results for the year amounted to a loss of 7.5 million compared to a net profit of 0.5 million in 2007.
We have however received dividend income of 1.5 million from Catena during 2008, so this investment remains cash generating to the Group.
A net loss of 4.6 million arose on the mark-to-market of shares held as investments and other listed share trades, including a provision of 3.0 million on our investment in Note AB.
OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses set out in the financial results table above comprised administrative expenditure of 16.1 million December 2007: 27.7 million and net property expenses of 3.6 million December 2007: 3.2 million.
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE amounted to 16.1 million December 2007: 27.7 million : 2008 2007 Difference m m m Core property group 9.6 12.5 2.9 London Bridge Quarter LBQ 8.7 8.7 Wyatt Media Group 6.5 6.5 Total 16.1 27.7 11.6 Our investment in London Bridge Quarter LBQ, which included our share of the joint venture developing Southwark Towers and New London Bridge House, was disposed of in early January 2008 and therefore no costs were incurred on this project during the year.
The substantial cost savings made on the core property business in 2008 relate principally to lower headcount and a slimmed down senior management team 1.9 million, the re-location of the head office to a property held by the Group 0.5 million and tighter control over professional fees 0.5 million.
NET PROPERTY EXPENSES of 3.6 million December 2007: 3.2 million included legal, letting and other fees of 1.2 million, reflecting letting success across all regions, advertising and marketing costs of 0.1 million and void costs of 0.8 million.
Repair and maintenance costs were 0.5 million, depreciation amounted to 0.1 million and bad debts were 0.2 million.

Interest receivable of 20.5 million is comprised of two main items: 8.6 million was earned from average cash reserves during the year of 168 million, combined with an 11.9 million foreign exchange translation gain mostly from Euro cash balances held by the Group being re-translated at the exceptionally low GBP to Euro rate that arose at the end of December.
This category also includes a net gain on forward foreign currency exchange contracts entered into during the year of 2.4 million.
The average cost of borrowing for the Group at 31 December 2008, is set out below: UK France Germany Sweden Total December 2008 Average interest rate on fixed rate debt 6.7% 4.9% 5.2% 6.2% Average interest rate on variable rate debt 6.1% 5.4% 5.6% 4.5% 5.3% Overall weighted average interest rate 6.7% 5.3% 5.3% 4.5% 5.8% December 2007 Average interest rate on fixed rate debt 6.8% 4.6% 5.1% 5.4% 6.2% Average interest rate on variable rate debt 7.2% 5.4% 5.5% 5.7% 5.8% Overall weighted average interest rate 7.0% 5.2% 5.2% 5.6% 6.1% Financial instruments The adverse impact of fair value movements in interest rate instruments was 21.0 million 2007: adverse 1.5 million.
This amount is almost entirely relating to a floating to fixed rate swap transaction on one property, fixing below 5 per cent on a long-term basis over a principal sum of 106.0 million.
At 31 December 2008, with global interest rates falling heavily and long-term yield curves relatively flat, this instrument was marked down accordingly.
We believe that this swap transaction is an attractive long-term hedging instrument.
It is important to note that if this swap is held to maturity, the net fair value movements reported through the income statement over its life will be zero, leaving only the impact of fixing the interest rate over the life of the instrument.

Such sales are accounted for by taking any deductions for latent tax and guarantees provided through the valuation line of the properties within the corporate vehicles.
This resulted in the pretax loss on disposal of French subsidiaries.
In conjunction with the disposals however is a reduction in the Groups potential liability for deferred tax, in this instance amounting to 34.6 million.
This movement is shown within the deferred taxation line, thus the net effect on the Group of the French disposals is a profit after tax of 18.6 million.
PROFIT ON SALE OF INVESTMENT PROPERTIES Disposals of properties in the UK and Germany were by conventional sale of the buildings, which released a profit on disposal of 6.5 million and 0.6 million respectively, and a further release of deferred tax of 7.0 million.
NON-RECURRING COSTS As reported in the Chairmans statement at the 2007 year end, CLS was considering a number of options to re-structure the Group in order to release reserves for future distributions, to align the structure to the Groups panEuropean operational focus and to enable the Group to compete more effectively with other UK property investors enjoying REIT status.
Non-recurring costs of 1.2 million were incurred in the year in relation to this proposed change.
The release of reserves was completed and the Group structure is being reviewed to rationalise the number of entities.
IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLES The Groups investment in the Wyatt Group of companies was re-assessed during the year as a result of operational and trading difficulties within the markets that Wyatt operates.
The result of this re-assessment was the write-off of all goodwill relating to our investment in this business, a total of 22.0 million.
We continue to closely monitor our investment in Wyatt, but the carrying value at 31 December 2008 is immaterial to the CLS Group.
TAXATION Current tax In 2008 the Groups current taxation charge has benefited from the utilisation of losses, significant capital allowances and amortisation deductions.
Outside the UK and Sweden these factors will have less effect in the future as corporation tax losses are used against expected profits and as amortisation deductions decrease in existing subsidiaries.
Deferred tax The results of the Group include full provision for deferred taxation relating to potential gains on the sale of properties at current valuations, as required by IAS 12.
The amount provided represents the maximum potential tax liability on gains from property disposals.
The method of calculation for the estimate of deferred tax was revised in 2007 to include the effect of indexation allowance available if properties in the UK were to be sold, resulting in a credit to the income statement of 31.4 million in that year.
The method was revised during the 2007 financial year as the Group considered that it was more appropriate to assume that it would recover the carrying amount of its investment properties through use followed by eventual disposal.
This is evidenced by the decision taken in 2007 to dispose of a significant proportion of the portfolio, completed during 2008.
Prior to the 2007 financial year, the Group had been predominantly long-term investors in property with occasional disposals, and therefore it was more appropriate to determine the tax base as being that of returning value through continued collection of rental income.
For the year ended 31 December 2008 the IAS 12 deferred tax credit included in the Income Statement was 67.7 million.
This is after, where appropriate, recognition of tax losses and the reversal of timing differences.
The provision for deferred tax reduced net assets by 61.0 million 31 December 2007: credit of 42.3 million and reduction in net assets of 114.6 million respectively.
We consider it is unlikely that this full liability will crystallise because it takes no account of the way in which the Group would realise these gains.
In particular the deferred tax provision takes no account of the way in which properties are expected to be sold, or of elections available to ensure that deductions claimed previously for capital allowances are not reversed.
REVIEW OF THE BALANCE SHEET INVESTMENT PROPERTIES The Groups property portfolio amounted to 798.8 million, showing a net decrease of 376.5 million over its value at 31 December 2007 of 1,175.3 million.

REFURBISHMENT In the UK, expenditure on refurbishments amounted to 2.6 million, principally on upgrading our property at Spring Gardens to meet the tenants requirements.
Other improvements were made to Great West House and Cap Gemini House.
The bulk of refurbishment and development expenditure was carried out in Germany at our properties in Landshut Munich and Bochum 11.1 million.
Various smaller refurbishment works in France amounted to 1.2 million.
DISPOSALS The detail of the disposals made during the year is covered in the Business Review, but the significant items were the disposal of our share in LBQ in the UK 110.2 million, the sale of a portfolio of properties in France to LFPI 97.7 million, Victor Hugo and the Pascal buildings in Paris 40.4 million and 29.3 million respectively, the sale of 1 Leicester Square 29.0 million and Coventry House 23.8 million.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE The gross foreign exchange translation gains on properties was 118.8 million, of which 65.7 million related to France, 47.5 million was in respect of Germany and 5.6 million arose in Sweden.
Taking into account the effect of foreign exchange translation on loans to finance these assets, the net effect was a gain in reserves of 40.5 million.
Based on the valuations at 31 December 2008 and annualised net contracted rent receivable at that date of 59.2 million, the portfolio shows a yield of 7.4 per cent, an increase of 90 basis points since 31 December 2007, reflecting the increased volatility in the markets, lower volume of comparable transactions and prudent valuations.
The following exchange rates were used to translate assets and liabilities at the year end: Euro GBP 1.0461 SEK GBP 11.4474.

This decrease in fixed rate funding is mainly due to the mix of loans redeemed as a result of sales of properties during the year.
New Printing House Square was financed in 1992 through a securitisation of its rental income by way of a fully amortising bond.
This bond has a current outstanding balance of 35.9 million December 2007: 36.7 million at an interest rate of 10.7 per cent with a maturity date of 2025.
In addition, there is a zero coupon bond, with a current outstanding balance of 7.6 million December 2007: 6.9 million, with matching interest rate and maturity date.
These debt instruments have a significant adverse effect on the average interest rate.
The net borrowings of the Group at 31 December 2008 were 406.3 million December 2007: 676.7 million, the decrease being influenced by gross loan repayments and redemptions of 298.4 million, principally resultant from sales of properties.
There was also an adverse translation effect in respect of loans held in Euros and SEK of 77.9 million.
The contracted cash flows from the properties securing the loans continue to cover all ongoing interest and loan amortisation obligations.
Of the Groups total bank debt of 601.6 million 54.2 million 9.0 per cent is repayable within the next 12 months, with 270.1 million 44.9 per cent maturing after more than five years.
OTHER INVESTMENTS Consists of equity investments amounting to 14.3 million December 2007: 8.4 million.
The majority by value are listed corporate and financial bonds, which are carried at market value of 10.8 million.
The bonds were bought at a significant discount to the nominal value and have very attractive coupon rates and yields to maturity.
The remaining 3.5 million consists mainly of listed investments.
INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATE COMPANIES The Group holds investments in two principal associate companies carried in our books at 39.3 million.
The Group holds 29.1 per cent of Catena AB, a Swedish listed property group held at 25.1 million, being the Groups share of the adjusted net assets of Catena excluding any provision for deferred tax, which we believe is unlikely to ever crystallise.
Although Catena made a loss for the year due to adverse fair value movements on its properties, our share of which was 3.2 million, it also included positive foreign exchange movement of 3.1 million, a write-off of goodwill amounting to 3.9 million and our share of their negative reserve movements of 0.2 million.
The second associate is Bulgarian Land Development Plc in which our holding of 35.8 per cent is carried at 14.1 million after our share of its losses in the year which amounted to 1.1 million, write-off of opening goodwill of 1.4 million, the recognition of negative goodwill of 2.1 million in respect of additional shares purchased in the year, and our share of their positive reserve movements of 2.2 million.
SHARE CAPITAL The share capital of the Company amounted to 16.7 million at 31 December 2008, represented by 66,745,471 ordinary shares of 25 pence each, of which 5,000,000 shares were held as Treasury shares.
At 31 December 2008 there were therefore 61,745,471 shares quoted on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
The Treasury shares are not included for the purposes of any proposed tender offer buy-backs or for calculating earnings and NAV per share.
A capital distribution by way of tender offer buy-back was made in November 2008 resulting in the purchase and cancellation of 2,575,644 shares and the distribution of 10.9 million to shareholders.
A further tender offer of 2 in every 9 shares at 350 pence was proposed on 1 December 2008 and approved at an AGM held on 18 December 2008.
The offer was settled on 7 January 2009 and resulted in the purchase and cancellation of a further 13,721,215 shares and the distribution of 48.0 million.
After the January 2009 tender offer buy-back there were 48,024,256 shares in issue, of which the Mortstedt family holds 57.7 per cent.
Market purchases during the year totalled 3,744,342 shares at an average price of 344.7 pence per share.
