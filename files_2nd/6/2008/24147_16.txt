We are growing the more profitable International businesses and have repositioned our trading focus in the UK, building on our core strengths in protection and group pensions, exiting the unfunded commission paying pensions segments and taking a more tactical approach to investments.
We have also initiated a major cost reduction programme to reduce the UK cost base by an annualised 40m by the end of 2009.
PAGE 38 CASH GENERATION Our products typically consume cash in the year of sale because of acquisition costs and the need to establish prudent reserves.
They then return cash in later years.
We are improving the cash generating capability of the business in order to invest in attractive opportunities and pay real dividend increases.
We manage the cash invested in writing new business relative to the cash generated by our in-force business.
IFRS PROFITABILITY PAGE 40 IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards is our primary accounting basis.
It includes the cash surplus earned during the period but differs from the EEV basis see below in that, with one exception, it does not recognise future cashflows in profit.
The exception to this is that negative reserves on certain product lines are now permitted.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH PAGE 43 Financial strength is critically important as it demonstrates our solvency and stability and inspires confidence in the company.
We manage a range of financial strength measures, including the Insurance Groups Directive IGD capital requirements, the realistic solvency requirement for our with-profits business, the regulatory solvency basis for all life companies and our internal economic capital requirements.
PAGE 46 EEV PROFITABILITY EMBEDDED VALUE PAGE 48 EEV European Embedded Value is an alternative accounting basis.
EEV profit reflects the long-term shareholder value added during the year taking into account the future cashflows that are expected to arise from sales and the effect of updating previous assumptions with actual experience.
We use a market consistent EEV approach and we use a gilt return to represent Charles Bellringer Chief Financial Officer risk-free returns.
