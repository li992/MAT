The Groups business plan is to develop technologies that provide The Groups products comprise: patented products and methods which support our product Co-ordinate measuring machine CMM probes and strategies.
These solutions include, high-speed, high-accuracy, accessories, which are used for accurate post-process inspection error-corrected dimensional measurement systems, motion of components on CMMs.
With Renishaws latest Renscan5 controllers with enhanced high-speed performance, ultra high- 5-axis scanning technology, manufacturers can inspect complex resolution encoders and the development of novel approaches to components at unprecedented speed without compromising materials analysis.
Based upon our core technologies, the Group is developing Machine tool probes and tool setting systems, used for market opportunities in a range of other industries.
These include automated component identification, workpiece and tool printing, scientific research, dental, process control in chemical, setting and component inspection, which can be fitted on CNC semiconductor and material production, and motion feedback turning and milling machines.
