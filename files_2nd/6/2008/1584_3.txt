Financial Review for the year ended 31 December 2008 The following financial review includes certain financial information extracted without adjustment from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
This financial information is a summary and you should read the entire Annual Report carefully.
Operating Results Revenues for 2008 totalled $503.2 million, up 47% from $343.4 million in 2007.
Sales were positively impacted in 2008 by organic growth, together with the full year impact of the ZANTAZ acquisition.
These results reflect our ongoing strategy focussed on licensing of our core IDOL software and pre-configured applications.
Cost of revenues excluding amortisation of purchased intangibles in 2008 totalled $45.0 million, up 15% from $39.1 million in 2007.
The increase is driven by the increased revenues.
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from 15% in 2007 to 13% in 2008.
This decrease has been driven primarily by the successful implementation of a number of efficiencies within the ZANTAZ hosted business that have been realised as a result of the combination of the IDOL technology with existing ZANTAZ infrastructures.
Amortization of purchased intangibles arise in connection with acquisitions.
Amortization of purchased intangibles in 2008 totalled $19.5 million, up 50% from $13.0 million in 2007.
The increase is primarily attributable to the full year contribution in 2008 of amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in connection with the ZANTAZ and Meridio acquisitions.
Gross profit in 2008 totalled $438.7 million, up 51% from $291.3 million in 2007, commensurate with the increase in revenues but also affected by the cost trends discussed above.
Gross margins increased as planned following the completion of the integration of ZANTAZ and the transition of the core ZANTAZ business to higher margin sales.
Research and development expenses in 2008 totalled $78.4 million, up 26% from $62.3 million in 2007.
The increase in research and development expenses from 2007 to 2008 was primarily due to increased headcount and associated expenses, both from increased investment in the companys core technology together with new investment arising from the ZANTAZ acquisition.
Sales and marketing expenses totalled $135.2 million in 2008, up 29% from $104.4 million in 2007.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses from 2007 to 2008 was primarily due to increased advertising, additional headcount and an increase in sales commissions due to an increase in sales and a change in the geographic and size-of-transaction mix, all of which also increased with the expansion of the group in 2008.
General and administrative expenses totalled $42.6 million in 2008, up 31% from $32.5 million in 2007.
The increase in general and administrative expenses from 2007 to 2008 was due to an increase in average headcount due to a full year contribution from ZANTAZ and Meridio together with the legal, accounting and tax advice necessitated by the enlarged group.
Post-acquisition restructuring costs totalled $1.2 million in 2008, versus $1.8 million in 2007.
Such costs were non-recurring costs associated with the acquisition of ZANTAZ and Meridio.
Gain loss on foreign exchange totalled $5.1 million gain in 2008, compared to a loss of $0.6 million in 2007.

Profit from operations totalled $186.5 million in 2008, up 110% from $88.6 million in 2007.
The increase in profit from operations from 2007 to 2008 reflects an increase in revenues from 2007 to 2008 offset by cost increases discussed above.

In 2007 the company wrote off an investment in a privately held company.
Interest income totalled $3.4 million in 2008, down 52% from $6.9 million in 2007.
Interest income in 2008 was impacted by higher cash balances throughout 2008 compared to 2007, but offset by interest rates which fell materially during the year in all territories.
Interest payable totalled $1.9 million in 2008, down 20% from $2.4 million in 2007, as a result of a combination of lower interest rates and continued scheduled capital repayments.
Profit before tax totalled $185.7 million in 2008, up 103% from $91.4 million in 2007.
The increase in profit before tax reflects an increase in revenues from 2007 to 2008 offset by smaller increases in costs discussed above.

The groups effective tax rate fell from 31.7% in 2007 to 29.1% in 2008.

Autonomy Corporation plc 6 Financial Review for the year ended 31 December 2008 Key Risks The key risks to which the business is exposed are summarized as follows: Our business depends on our core technology, currently marketed under the brand IDOL, and our strategy has been, and for the foreseeable future will continue to be, to concentrate our efforts on developing and marketing software based on our proprietary technology.
Technology which significantly competes with the companys technology would present a material risk to the company.
Expenditures increasing without a commensurate increase in revenues, and rapid changes in market conditions, could result in poor operating results.
The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact revenues and gross margins.
The continuation of unfavorable economic and market conditions.
Our reliance on sales of our products by third parties such as value added resellers makes it difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.
Our ability to expand sales through indirect sellers.
The continued service of our executive directors.
The hiring and retention of qualified personnel.
Errors or defects in our products, which could negatively affect our revenues and the market acceptance of our products and increase our costs.
Problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions.
Claims by others that we infringe on their intellectual property rights.
The companys policies applicable to employees addressing key business risks, including financial, communications, whistle blowing and health and safety, are made available through policy manuals and the companys intranet site.
The processes to identify and manage the key risks to the success of the company are an integral part of the internal control environment.
Such processes, in addition to those discussed above, include strategic planning, appointing highly skilled managers with accountability, regular monitoring of performance and setting and communicating high standards and targets for ethics, safety and health.
Key Performance Indicators The company has several key performance measures used internally to monitor and challenge performance and to assist investment decisions.
The elimination of low margin businesses and continued operational efficiencies have contributed to the increase in 2008.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 92%.
The increase in operating margins and EPS is a reflection of significantly increased revenue, due to a combination of strong organic growth and the full year impact of acquisitions, versus the companys relatively fixed cost-base.
Cash balances have increased significantly during the year.
This is driven by the cash generated from operations of $178.8 million offset by tax payments, capital expenditure and repayment of debt.
The company continues to invest heavily in research and development, with an increase of 26% in 2008 from 2007.
