REVENUE GROWTH Revenue for the second half of 2007 08 increased by 19 million over the WITH MORE THAN first half to 980 million, as we returned to revenue growth with demand for our IP, data and hosting products outstripping the decline in traditional 40% OF REVENUE voice revenue.
FROM IP, DATA IP, data and hosting We have a full suite of IP, data and hosting products enabled by our AND HOSTING next generation network, the Multi Service Platform.
This product set includes market-leading services and applications, such as fixed mobile convergence, digital marketing and next generation video conferencing.
IP, data and hosting revenue of 774 million in 2007 08 increased by 8%, despite the disposal of our web design business WTG on 1 February 2007 and our structured cabling business Allnet on 2 April 2007, which together contributed 66 million of revenue during 2006 07.
The underlying growth rate of these products is therefore 19%.
Within this, our hosting revenue grew by 27% to 121 million in 2007 08.
IP, data and hosting as a proportion of revenue has increased to 40% for the year ended 31 March 2008, up from 34%, 31% excluding Allnet and WTG, in the prior year.
Legacy products Revenue from our legacy products has reduced from 191 million to 96 million over the last 12 months and now represents only 5% of revenue.
This decline was expected as customers choose to migrate to more advanced services, such as IP-VPN.
Traditional voice Traditional voice revenue has declined by 11%, from 1,201 million in 2006 07 to 1,071 million in 2007 08 as we move away from unprofitable routes and low margin traffic and customers migrate to other products such as email and IP voice.
Consumer broadband In September 2006, we ceased to provide consumer broadband products and moved to a wholesale strategy.
Accordingly, we did not generate any consumer broadband revenue in 2007 08, compared with 29 million in 2006 07.
30 Gross margin Gross margin increased by 15 million to 803 million, our fourth consecutive half of absolute gross margin growth.
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue has increased from 37% to 41%, which reflects 41% the change in our product mix towards IP, data and hosting, and activities to reduce cost of sales.
GROSS MARGIN These activities include improving network utilisation, reducing our reliance UP FROM 37% on other network operators, and ongoing programmes relating to supplier renegotiations and process efficiencies.
Operating costs Operating costs have reduced by 120 million compared with 2006 07 to 584 million.
This reduction represents an improvement of 17% compared with the prior year, and operating costs now represent 30% of revenue, an improvement of three percentage points.
We delivered cost savings through a number of projects.
These included driving efficiencies in support functions, by reducing total year end headcount by 9% and off-shoring some non-customer facing roles, such as finance.
We have renegotiated network maintenance contracts, rationalised our network and fibre assets and worked with suppliers to use their services more cost effectively, reducing operating costs.
Further reductions resulted from the move to a wholesale strategy in the C&W Access business in 2006 07, the subsequent integration of C&W Access into the main enterprise business, and the disposal of our structured cabling and web design businesses.
Operating costs for 2007 08 include a 14 million net credit relating to our defined benefit pension scheme, compared with a 4 million net credit for 2006 07.
EBITDA EBITDA before exceptionals has more than doubled from 84 million to 219 million an increase of 135 million.
As a percentage of revenue, EBITDA has improved from 4% to 11% with an EBITDA margin of 12% in the second half of 2007 08.
EBITDA of 219 million is above our revised guidance issued in November 2007 of 205 million to 215 million, and significantly better than guidance issued in May 2007 of 165 million to 185 million due to the continuing success of our turnaround plan.

32 Our net cash outflow of 73 million for the year includes a trading cash outflow of 103 million and a 30 million inflow from non-trading items.
The 103 million trading outflow represents 110 million trading outflow in the first half of 2007 08 followed by a trading cash inflow of 7 million in the second half.
This cash generation is a significant milestone as Europe, Asia & US has not generated cash for many years.
Exceptional items of 40 million and movement in exceptional provisions of 16 million are largely attributable to restructuring costs including redundancies and property costs.
The movement in working capital and other provisions of 46 million for 2007 08 includes the impact of a 14 million net pension credit.
The inflow of 22 million in the second half of 2007 08 reflects our improvement in working capital management.
Cash capital expenditure of 222 million reflects a mix of investments in both customer and infrastructure projects.
Acquisitions and disposals of 46 million predominantly relate to the sale and leaseback transaction completed on 2 April 2007 for 88 million partially offset by a 49 million payment of deferred consideration relating to the acquisition of Energis, payable to their long-term creditors.
The total cost of the turnaround for the Europe, Asia & US enterprise business before it returned to cash generation has been 242 million excluding 88 million from the sale and leaseback transaction, and C&W Access to the extent it is separately identifiable.
This represents a 38 million improvement over the 280 million guidance given at the May 2007 preliminary results.
IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 08 WE GENERATED TRADING CASH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS 33 Business review
