CASE STUDY THE MALMO ARENA MULTIPLE SECURE SERVICES FOR A MULTI-USE ARENA.
Malmo is a multi-use, multi-purpose, multi-visitor venue.
The Malmo Arena launch was the culmination of one-and-a-half years of construction and preparation.
It was clear early on that Malmos requirements were not standard.
Malmo Arena is multi-use because it hosts everything from major sports events to concerts.
Multi-purpose because Malmo sits in the middle of a site combining retail, leisure and residential uses.
And multi-visitor because there are leisure, business, and tourist visitors at the site, says Peter Narbe who headed up the Malmo project for G4S.
A range of services was required to keep overall costs under control, which G4S achieved through a hybrid service model: vetted, trained security personnel and hospitality personnel for reception, ticketing, stewarding and front-of-house services.
G4S ensures resourcing levels are uniquely geared to each event.
All of the venues cash management needs are met by G4S while sophisticated systems combat counterfeit tickets.
No two events are the same at Malmo Arena.
But for every visitor it offers the experience of a lifetime.
G4S is always there throughout, ensuring the visit is safe, secure, and fun.
