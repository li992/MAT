40 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Business Review continued Group Financial Review The Group continued its growth in 2008, achieving record financial results.
Commodity prices rose strongly throughout the first nine Year ended 31 December 2008 compared months of the year underpinning this growth, partially offset by production cutbacks impacting in Q4 2008 introduced in response to the year ended 31 December 2007 to the economic downturn.
Revenue increased US$2,717 million, or 66.2%, to US$6,823 million 2007: US$4,106 million.
Higher sales prices accounted for 104.4% of this growth, whilst reduced sales led to a fall of 4.4%.
The inclusion of Serov, the new aluminium smelter and Tuoli added revenues of, US$496 million, US$280 million and US$6 million respectively.
Like-for-like revenue increased US$1,937 million, or 47.2% to US$6,040 million.
The Ferroalloys Division accounted for 76.0% of the increase: and the Iron Ore Division for 26.2%.
Whilst benefiting from strong commodity prices, the Group maintained a good control of operating costs.
Cost of sales rose US$387 million, or 22.8%, to US$2,088 million 2007: US$1,701 million.
Like-for-like Group cost of sales increased US$121 million, or 7.1%, to US$1,819 million 2007: US$1,698 million.
Higher materials and labour costs were the main factors driving this increase.
The Alumina and Aluminium Division experienced the largest underlying cost increase, mainly due Groups revenue to a significant increase in raw materials prices.
The inclusion of Serov, the new aluminium smelter and Tuoli increased the cost of sales by, 2008 US$6,823 million 4.2 billion respectively, US$155 million, US$103 million and US$11 million.
2007 US$4,106 million Distribution costs increased US$58 million, or 15.5%, to US$431 million 2007: US$373 million.
There was an increase of US$29 million Groups operating profit in the Ferroalloys Division, a consequence of increased transportation costs mainly due to increases in certain costs that are set in relation to sales price duties, commissions and insurance, higher freight costs 20 08 US$3,850 million 4.2 billion driven up by increased fuel costs and the adverse impact of a strong 2 007 US$1,421 million euro.
There was an increase of US$17 million in the Iron Ore Division, as proportionally more product was transported to China.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined US$184 million, or 30.4%, to US$422 million 2007: US$606 million.
This decline was principally due to US$182 million of expenses attributable to the IPO in 2007.
Group operating profit increased US$2,429 million, or 170.9% to US$3,850 million 2007: US$1,421 million.
The Ferroalloys Division contributed 68.0% of this growth, or US$1,651 million including US$197 million from Serov.
The Iron Ore Division contributed 19.6%, or US$476 million.
Exchange rates did not have a material impact on the Groups financial results.
Group finance income increased US$74 million, or 127.6%, to US$132 Ferroalloy Divisions operating profit million 2007: US$58 million primarily due to interest income on IPO proceeds invested in money market securities and increased bank 20 08 interest income.
Group finance costs decreased US$15 million, or 9.5%, US$2,689 million 4.2 billion to US$143 million 2007: US$158 million primarily due to the paying 2007 US$1,038 million down of the trade finance facility offset by foreign exchange losses.
Impairment Due to the global economic crisis and the consequent impact on commodity prices and demand, we have considered the recoverability of long-term assets.
We have adopted the value-in-use approach and used our strategic planning models, which are on a life-of-mines basis, to calculate future discounted cash flow for each cash-generating unit.
The impairment review concluded that no impairment provisions were required.
Ferroalloys Division The Ferroalloys Division achieved outstanding results in the year, although the heightened pressures of the economic slowdown began to impact in Q4 2008.
The results reflected much higher average sales prices for the year and a good control of costs.
In response to the significant weakening in demand following the economic slowdown, production was cut back in Q4 2008 by approximately 35% referenced to the 2007 sales volumes run rate, DO NOT USE TRACKING ON ANY PART OF THIS JOB!
ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 41 or 85 thousand tonnes, principally high-carbon ferrochrome, with an accompanying reduction in chrome ore extraction.
In addition the Group cut back production in the higher cost operations of Serov, by approximately 40% against Q3 2008, and in Tuoli, where production was suspended.
Late in 2008 the Division cut back a further 15 thousand tonnes, sales being supplied from inventory, in order to minimise stock being carried forward.
In Q4 2008 total ferroalloys production excluding Serov and Tuoli declined 34.4% relative to Q3 2008, reducing full year production of the ongoing businesses to below that of the prior year.
Manganese related production, a product of opportunity for the Group although not a significant business, was reduced in response to the market environment.
Despite these cutbacks in Q4 2008 production volumes achieved a solid performance compared to the prior year, largely due to the strong results achieved in the first nine months of 2008.
Chrome ore extraction declined 5.6% to 4,331 thousand tonnes, or 4,207 thousand tonnes excluding Serov 2007: 4,590 thousand tonnes.
The underlying decline reflected a reduction in open pit mining, ahead of planned growth in underground mining in the years ahead.
The decline in extraction was partially offset by a 4.9% growth in the processing of low-grade stockpiled ore.
The internal consumption Ferroalloys Division of saleable chrome ore rose to 71.5% 2007: 69.1%.
