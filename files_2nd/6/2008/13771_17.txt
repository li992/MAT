Sage, such as reputation, employees and security.
Many of the risk factors affecting Sage are considered to be business risks which can be effectively mitigated by ensuring appropriate controls are in place.
However, some of the risk factors affecting Sage are inherent risks based on our location, type of business and other external factors predominately beyond our control.
Noted below are the principal inherent risks that we face.
This section of the report should be read in conjunction with the Internal control and risk management section of the report, found on pages 51 and 52. International factors As an international company, we face potential challenges from economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors across the globe.
In the current economic environment, this situation has intensified.
We have operations in many international markets which leads to various risks inherent in administering the complexities of a global business.
A variety of international regulatory requirements and unexpected changes to economic and market conditions are examples of specific risks associated with managing an international business.
Any failure to maintain compliance with foreign laws or changes in local regulations or any failure to adapt to international market changes or local business conditions could have a material, adverse impact on our business.
In current economic conditions, our defensive business model and the significant percentage of our revenue which is recurring give comfort and support against economic exposure.
As we grow through acquisitions and expand our geographical coverage, we continually review all relevant requirements to ensure appropriate policies and controls are developed.
By acquiring businesses which are well established in their own region, we rely on the experience of local management to understand the local regulatory environment.
In addition, our group-wide compliance programme seeks to ensure that local operating companies continually manage and review local rules and regulations.

This ability to adapt is vital in maintaining current products, attracting new customers and retaining existing customers.
Changing technology places demands on employees, particularly research and development teams, to stay up to date with technology changes and customer demands.
Continued success in developing new products and services, anticipating and reacting to customer needs and satisfying market demand, depends on Sages ability to adapt to changing technologies.
