Bringing new confidence to the buying of used cars Experians vehicle history information is a vital component in the used car buying and selling process.
It reveals if a vehicle has been stolen or previously salvaged, whether it has been water damaged or involved in an accident, whether the mileage is correct and other valuable insights.
Interpreting all this information can be time consuming though, particularly for people wanting to compare different vehicles quickly and easily.
Thats why Experian has developed the AutoCheck Score in the US, a world first for the vehicle industry.
The AutoCheck Score distills all the history information Experian holds on a vehicle into a single, numeric score and then compares it to vehicles of similar age and type.
The AutoCheck Score is a valuable tool for used car buyers and sellers, and has been proven to increase confidence in the vehicle purchase decision.
