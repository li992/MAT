Following changes to the contract with Roshan, we expect to see a decline in enterprise revenue in Monaco & Islands in 2008 09 and we are working to replace this revenue.

In the Caribbean, our operating costs grew by US$30 million, of which US$13 million relates to higher call centre and administration costs in Jamaica.
The remaining US$17 million predominantly relates to additional support costs as we migrate to new data networks and additional costs following the launch of mobile services in BVI.
Operating costs in Panama as a percentage of revenue were steady at 24%, increasing by US$13 million to US$146 million in support of our rapid revenue growth there.
In Macau, operating cost control continued to be world class at 19% of revenue despite our strong growth.
There, our operating costs increased by US$6 million to US$54 million.

EBITDA We grew our EBITDA by 3% compared with 2006 07 to US$830 million representing an EBITDA margin of 34%.
Excluding Jamaica, our EBITDA would have increased 12% and our EBITDA margin would have been 37%.
EBITDA of US$830 million is in line with our revised EBITDA guidance range of US$820 million to US$840 million issued in November 2007, but less than our original guidance issued in May 2007 of US$840 million to US$860 million due to the weakness in the performance in Jamaica as highlighted above.
Our EBITDA increased by 9% in the second half of 2007 08 to US$432 million compared to the first half.
The US$11 million improvement in Jamaicas EBITDA in the second half of 2007 08 compared with the first half is a sign of the early progress made by the new management team, appointed in August 2007, who are focused on transforming the business.
We expect Jamaicas recovery to continue in 2008 09.

This additional spectrum will increase network capacity, reduce network congestion in key areas and add data functionality.
