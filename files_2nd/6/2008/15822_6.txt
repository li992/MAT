Performance 13 Operating and financial review Operating results 2008 compared with 2007 Group Overview The Group changed its presentation currency from sterling to the US dollar with effect from the beginning of 2008.
Comparative figures for 2007 and 2006 that were originally presented in sterling have been re-presented in US dollars on the basis set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Sales were reduced by $268.8 million due to disposals of businesses principally the disposal of Stant and Standard-Thomson in 2008 and Dearborn Mid-West in late 2007, but this was partially offset by the net currency translation gain of $157.9 million.
Underlying sales fell by $322.8 million, principally due to reduced demand in most of the Groups end markets.
Adjusted operating profit was $403.4 million 2007: $530.5 million.
The adjusted operating margin was 7.3% 2007: 9.0%.
Reduced volumes and initiatives to lower inventory levels led to lower fixed cost absorption that, combined with higher raw material prices that were not fully offset by price increases, led to lower profitability.
The benefits of the restructuring initiatives mitigated to some extent the impact of lower sales.
John Zimmerman Finance Director In these challenging and uncertain times, our strategic and tactical priorities are clear: We will remain focused on protecting the financial fundamentals generating cash and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
We will protect our existing operations by being vigilant to the ever-changing business environment and reacting quickly and decisively.
We will also continue to drive down expenses and focus our efforts on executing Projects Eagle and Cheetah.

Management subsequently reviewed the recoverability of assets of the Groups businesses in light of the continued weakness in the Groups end markets, which was compounded by an increase in the discount rates that are required to be used for the purpose of the impairment tests.
Additional fixed asset impairments were taken as part of the decision to implement Project Cheetah to restructure the manufacturing footprint of the Group.
As a consequence of these developments, a further non-cash impairment of $167.3 million was recognised in the second half of 2008.
As a result, the total impairment recognised during 2008 was $342.4 million, of which $228.6 million Group adjusted operating profit bridge related to goodwill and $113.8 million to property, $ million plant and equipment.
Goodwill allocated to Stackpole 22.1 10.3 20.4 135.7 $157.2 million and to Gates Mectrol $37.4 million 530.5 was written-off in its entirety and goodwill allocated to Selkirk was written down by $34.0 million to $38.3 million.
Stackpoles property, plant and equipment was written down by $65.9 million.
Of the remaining $47.9 million impairment of property, plant 403.4 and equipment, $36.9 million related to other Industrial & Automotive businesses and $11.0 million to Building Products businesses.
Impairments recognised during the year are analysed in notes 19 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs arise from major projects undertaken to rationalise the Groups operations and to improve our cost competitiveness.
In 2008, restructuring costs were $26.0 million and principally related to the closure of Power Transmissions facility at Moncks Corner, South Carolina, further rationalisation of the Lasco Bathware business in the US, the closure of Hart & Cooleys production facility at Tucson, Arizona, and further costs associated with the outsourcing of IT services that began in 2007.
In 2007, restructuring costs were $27.6 million and principally related to the rationalisation of production facilities within the Lasco Bathware and Philips Products businesses in the US, the outsourcing of IT services and the initiatives within Fluid Power and Air Systems Components that began in 2006.
