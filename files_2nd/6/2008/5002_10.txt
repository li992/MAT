The aggregate gross assets of the schemes at 30 April 2008 were 721.8 million and the gross liabilities at 30 April 2008, calculated under IAS 19, were 797.7 million, resulting in the recognition of a gross balance sheet deficit of 75.9 million 30 April 2007: 18.6 million, a net deficit of 54.5 million 30 April 2007: 13.0 million after the establishment of a deferred tax asset of 21.4 million 30 April 2007: 5.6 million.
The increase of 57.3 million in the gross deficit was principally due to changing the mortality assumptions for the UK scheme to PMA92 PFA92 medium cohort, and reduced asset values.
In order to control the future costs and financial obligations of these schemes, the Groups UK dened benefit pension scheme is closed to new members.
The lower current service cost in 2007 08, 8.7 million compared with 9.4 million in 2006 07, is principally due to reduced membership of the scheme.
