The three key drivers of this increase are price, Costs mix and the acquisition of GB Airways.
In terms of price, inflationary Underlying costs 2008 2008 2007 2007 increases have been incurred through additional charges being levied million per seat million per seat and legislation being introduced e. g. the new PRM Passengers with Reduced Mobility charge has been passed by the EU, poorly handled Ground handling charges 212.2 4.09 156.1 3.51 by airports and partially passed on to the airlines.

The main driver of the increase in costs has been significant Net ownership costs 138.4 2.67 106.9 2.41 over-inflationary price rises in airport passenger related charges.

easyJet recruited 315 pilots and 1,198 cabin crew.
After taking account of leavers, this resulted in an 18% increase in crew complement.
Although the improvement in crew productivity has taken longer than expected, and it is affected by the lower aircraft utilisation in the winter months, crewing numbers are now back to planned levels.
Crew costs continue to be a key opportunity for efficiency improvement and will be helped by investment in crew support systems.
