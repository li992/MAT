well in bill Prepaid energy volumes have increased over the prior year despite reductions in domestic prices in the first half of the year.
The increase results from our network and general growth and from our increasing sector share, particularly in the Midlands, where a competitor lost exclusivity.
The more recently announced increases in domestic energy payments prices should have a beneficial effect on transaction volumes going forward.
PayPoint has also continued to achieve strong growth in the rest of the bill and general payments sector.

During the year, PayPoint processed 1.1 billion of mobile top-ups in the UK, equating to 26% of the sector 2007: 24%.
The two most popular methods for topping up remain e-voucher and electronic top-up.
Automatic Teller Machines ATMs New machines have been rolled out at an average rate of 39 per month 2007: 49 per month.
We have continued to be proactive in churning poor performing sites for redeployment and this higher than expected level of churn has reduced the net increase to 13 per month.
The estate has maintained a high number of transactions per site, averaging over 620 transactions per month 2007: 630 per month, split between cash withdrawals and balance enquiries with the latter representing slightly more than half of the transactions.
Installed ATMs have grown to 2,016 at the year end 2007: 1,860.

net, combining Metacharge and SECPay, has traded profitably.
We have completed the first phase of integration of these two businesses which involved the co-location of their hardware platforms at a hosted data centre reducing the number of hosted data centres from three to one and the provision of full disaster recovery from our Welywn Garden City operations base.
We have made good progress towards completion of a single billing platform, the first part of the second integration phase will encompass the development of new products and focus attention on sales to increase the merchant base.
At the end of the current year, we will merge the trading companies into a single company to complete the integration.
PayPoint in Romania Pay Store SRL was acquired from the RTC group on 15 May 2007 for 10.3 million.
Pay Store is one of the largest independent mobile top-up providers in Romania, selling both electronic top-ups and paper scratch cards.
The company has traded at a small loss as expected.
We have invested in strengthening the management team, switched the processing from a local provider to our processing centre in Welwyn Garden City, built a new sales team, started branding of our agent outlets, upgraded systems to mirror 6 the UK infrastructure and developed our bill payment offering.
Nearly all Romanians pay their bills in cash and are poorly served by existing payment channels.
Further investment is expected as we expand the network in Romania beyond our original plans.
Pay Store is well placed to benefit from the migration of paper scratch cards to electronic top-ups and following the launch of bill payments, to capture a significant share of the bill payment market as privatised utilities look to rationalise current inefficient and costly cash collection channels.
Network growth Terminal sites have increased to 23,895 2007: 17,537.

We are established as a premier convenience loading channel for cash onto both prepay and stored value cards, which have developed into strong sectors in the USA and are now being marketed with increasing success in the UK.

In Romania, we plan to install 1,500 Paypoint terminals this year.
These will complement the existing terminal base and provide initial coverage for a national bill payment network.
This investment will result in losses in Romania in the first half.
net, which is currently trading profitably, growth should accelerate in the latter part of the year, following the introduction of the new single company branding, website and product set in the first half.
Trading since the period end is in line with the companys expectations.
In the first half, the growth in the core business will be offset by the continuing losses in Pay Store and the shorter trading period of 26 weeks 2007: 27 weeks.
The directors are confident of continuing growth for the year overall, although the impact on revenue growth from the introduction of the exclusive TV licence contract will not recur in the current year.
