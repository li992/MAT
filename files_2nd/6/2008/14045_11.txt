Financial performance Sercos strong performance in 2008 is reflected in our financial results, with double-digit revenue growth and a further increase in margins.
We generated good cash flow, and have a strong funding position.
Sercos income statement for the year is summarised in Figure 1 below.
This includes the results of joint ventures which are proportionately consolidated.
Figure 1: Income statement Year ended 31 December 2008 2007 Increase m m Revenue 3,123.5 2,810.7 11.1% Gross profit 456.8 406.2 12.5% Administrative expenses 291.6 264.2 Adjusted operating profit 165.2 142.0 16.3% Investment revenue and finance costs 19.9 18.8 Adjusted profit before tax 145.3 123.2 17.9% Amortisation of acquired intangibles 9.2 8.6 Profit before tax 136.1 114.6 18.8% Tax 36.5 32.2 Profit for the year 99.6 82.4 20.9% Effective tax rate 26.8% 28.1% Adjusted earnings per share 22.20p 18.57p 19.5% Earnings per share 20.49p 16.98p 20.7% Dividend per share 5.00p 4.25p 17.6% 1.1 Revenue Revenue grew by 11.1% to 3,123.5m, benefiting from the growth of existing contracts and the contribution of new wins.
Underlying revenue growth, which excludes the effects of changes to currency exchange rates, acquisitions, disposals and significant contract divestments, was 10.3%.
1.2 Gross margin Gross margin the average contract margin across our portfolio was 14.6%, a small increase of 0.1% on 2007.
1.3 Investment revenue and finance costs Investment revenue and finance costs totalled a net cost of 19.9m 2007: 18.8m.
A reduction in the Groups underlying borrowing costs was offset by an increase in the net pension funding cost charged to the income statement.
1.4 Profit before tax Adjusted profit before tax was 145.3m, an increase of 17.9%.
This represented a margin of 4.7%, up from 4.4% on 2007.
Profit before tax increased by 18.8% to 136.1m.
1.5 Tax The tax charge of 36.5m 2007: 32.2m represents an effective tax rate of 26.8%, compared with 28.1% in 2007.
The decrease in the effective tax rate principally reflects the fall in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% in April 2008.
1.6 Earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS rose by 19.5% to 22.20p.
EPS and Adjusted EPS are calculated on an average number of shares in issue of 485.7m during the year 2007: 482.4m.
The increase in the average number of shares in issue resulted from the exercise of employees share options.
qxd:Serco AR08 - Design 20 03 2009 17:32 Page 40 2. Dividend Sercos policy is to increase the total dividend each year broadly in line with the increase in underlying earnings.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 3.52p per share, representing an increase on the 2007 final dividend of 16.6%, and bringing the total dividend for the year to 5.00p, a growth of 17.6%.
The final dividend will be paid on 20 May 2009 to shareholders on the register on 6 March 2009.
Cash flow The Group generated a free cash inflow of 94.2m, 3.4m lower than in 2007.
The free cash flow in 2007 benefited from a low working capital movement and a lower level of cash tax.
Figure 2 analyses the cash flow.
As in previous years, we have designed the analysis to show the actual cash performance of the Group being the cash flows generated by subsidiaries plus the dividends received from joint ventures.
It therefore differs from the consolidated cash flow on page 83, which proportionately consolidates the cash flows of joint ventures.
The adjustment line in Figure 2 reconciles the movement in Group cash to the consolidated cash flow.
Figure 2: Cash flow Year ended 31 December 2008 2007 m m Operating profit excluding joint ventures 107.8 92.2 Non cash items 39.4 47.6 Group EBITDA 147.2 139.8 Working capital movement 21.6 0.2 Group operating cash flow 125.6 139.6 Interest 25.0 25.6 Tax 11.8 5.4 Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets 31.8 47.9 Dividends from joint ventures 37.2 36.9 Group free cash flow 94.2 97.6 Disposal of business undertakings 1.9 3.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries 322.2 7.4 Financing 289.0 71.0 Special pension contribution.

3.1 Group operating cash flow Group operating cash flow of 125.6m 2007: 139.6m represents a conversion of Group EBITDA into cash of 85% 2007: 100%.
The strong levels of organic growth in the business require working capital investment and this is reflected in the 2008 movement of 21.6m.
3.2 Interest Net interest paid was 25.0m, compared to 25.6m in 2007.
Tax paid in 2007 and the first half of 2008 was lower than expected as a result of the tax relief on the special pension contributions made in 2006 and 2007.
The increase in 2008 reflected that there was no further tax relief available in the second half of the year on these contributions.
Cash tax is below the equivalent charge in the income statement as a result of accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences.
qxd:Serco AR08 - Design 20 03 2009 17:32 Page 41 3.4 Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets in the year was 31.8m 2007: 47.9m.
This comprised gross expenditure of 48.7m, representing 2.0% of revenue excluding joint ventures 2007: 2.2%, and disposals of 16.9m.
The principal component of disposals was the sale and leaseback of a number of carriages on the Great Southern Railway in Australia.
This follows similar transactions in previous years to realise a further part of the substantial investment we have made in acquiring and successfully growing the business since 1999.
3.5 Dividends from joint ventures Dividends received from joint ventures totalled 37.2m 2007: 36.9m, a conversion rate of 84% 2007: 100% of joint ventures profit after tax and minority interest, excluding costs allocated by Group.
This is in line with our expectation of a conversion rate in the range of 80-90%.
3.6 Disposal of business undertakings On 23 June 2008, the Group disposed of its equity stake in Kilmarnock Prison Services Limited, in line with our strategy to realise cash from our equity and subordinated debt in private finance initiatives PFI projects.
This disposal follows the sale of equity and subordinated debt in six PFI projects in 2006.
Profit on disposal of the Kilmarnock stake was 2.7m, and the net cash inflow of 1.9m comprised gross sale proceeds of 6.2m offset principally by cash held within the entity to cover future debt repayments of 3.0m.
We retain the operating contract for Kilmarnock prison.
3.7 Acquisition of subsidiaries Acquisition of subsidiaries principally comprises the acquisition of SI International, Inc. on 29 December 2008, a provider of information services, technology, and network solutions to the US Government, for 289.8m.
The acquisition gave rise to goodwill of 305.2m.
Intangible assets arising on the acquisition have been recognised at 51.8m and will be amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected lives.
Given the proximity of the acquisition to the Groups year end, SI International, Inc. made no contribution to the Groups revenue, profit and operating cash flow in 2008.
Other acquisitions were InfoVision, an Indian business process outsourcing company, for which we paid 14.8m for an initial 60% shareholding in December 2008, and the Grosvenor Health Group, an occupational health service provider, acquired for 19.0m, in May 2008.
Fair values have been determined provisionally in respect of SI International, Inc. and InfoVision and may be subject to adjustment in the year.
3.8 Financing The movement in financing resulted primarily from a drawdown on our committed facilities to finance acquisitions made during the year.
Net debt Figure 3 analyses Sercos net debt.

qxd:Serco AR08 - Design 20 03 2009 17:32 Page 42 4.1 Group recourse net debt Group recourse net debt increased by 386.6m to 524.5m.
The net impact of acquisitions in the year added 322.2m to net debt.
Changes in currency exchange rates increased net debt by 32.3m.
Group cash and cash equivalents rose to 199.8m, an increase of 61.7m, primarily reflecting periodic changes in working capital.
Cash and cash equivalents includes encumbered cash of 10.4m 31 December 2007: 11.9m which is cash securing credit obligations and customer advance payments.
4.2 Group non recourse debt The Group's debt is non recourse if no Group company other than the relevant borrower has an obligation to repay the debt under a guarantee or other arrangement.
The debt is excluded from all of our credit agreements and other covenant calculations, and therefore has no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Group non recourse debt reduced by 25.2m to 34.1m, due to the disposal of our equity stake in Kilmarnock Prison Services Limited.
The remaining non recourse debt relates to our Driver Examination Services contract in Canada.
Pensions At 31 December 2008, the net liability included in the balance sheet arising from our defined benefit pension scheme obligations was 20.5m 31 December 2007: 52.2m, on an asset base of 1.2bn.
The net liability has fallen principally as a result of changes in the RPI and discount rate assumptions used to value the schemes, partially offset by lower than expected equity returns in the year.
Figure 4: Defined benefit pension schemes At 31 December 2008 2007 m m Group schemes non contract specific 0.7 67.9 Contract specific schemes: reimbursable 89.6 60.7 not certain to be reimbursable 24.4 14.0 Net retirement benefit liabilities 114.7 142.6 Intangible assets arising from rights to operate franchises and contracts 14.4 17.4 Reimbursable rights debtor 89.6 60.7 Deferred tax liabilities assets 9.8 12.3 Net balance sheet liabilities 20.5 52.2 Serco has three main types of scheme which are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.
Each type has its own accounting treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards.
These are: Non contract specific schemes which do not relate to specific contracts or franchises.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss for the period to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense SORIE : Reimbursable schemes where we have a right of full cost reimbursement and therefore include both the pension scheme deficit and offsetting reimbursable rights debtor in the balance sheet: and Not certain to be reimbursable schemes relating to specific contracts or franchises, where the deficit will pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss on our share of the deficit for the period to the SORIE, recognise a recoverable intangible asset on the balance sheet at the start of the contract or franchise and amortise the intangible asset to the income statement over the contract or franchise life.
Serco has limited commercial risk in relation to the contract specific schemes, due to either the right of cost reimbursement or because the deficit will, in general, pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
Among our non contract specific schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
At 31 December 2008, SPLAS had a surplus of 62.4m 31 December 2007: a deficit of 28.7m.
This movement in the scheme position reflects the reduction in volatility afforded by the Liability Driven Investment LDI strategy introduced in 2007 and a change in inflation and discount rate assumptions.
Figure 5 shows the sensitivity of the liabilities of our pension schemes to changes in discount rates and to adjustments in the principal actuarial assumptions for the rate of inflation, members salary increases and life expectancies.

Treasury In the year, the Group replaced its existing 400m bank credit facility with a new five-year 400m bank revolving credit facility which matures in September 2013.
The Group also arranged a term loan and bilateral facility totalling US Dollar 550m to fund the acquisition of SI International, Inc.
The term loan and bilateral facility are repayable between September 2010 and September 2013.
The facilities, which are syndicated with a group of 13 banks, are unsecured.
As at 31 December 2008, 560m had been drawn down on these facilities.
Serco has also issued US private placement loan notes totalling 117m, which will be repaid evenly from 2011 to 2015.
In total, the Group has 900m of committed debt facilities available, giving significant headroom to fund working capital and other known requirements.
Going concern The Directors have acknowledged the guidance on going concern and financial reporting published by the Financial Reporting Council in November 2008.
Whilst the current economic environment is uncertain, the broad base of our contract portfolio and with 90% of our customers being government bodies, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully, including those risks arising from the failure of customers to meet contractual obligations, and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
As disclosed in the Business Review of the Annual Review and Accounts, the Groups revenues are largely derived from long-term contracts with governments which, historically, have been largely unaffected by changes in the general economy.
The contract portfolio is spread across a number of markets, sectors and geographies such that a downturn in any one segment is highly unlikely to affect the Group as a whole.
In addition with an order book of 16.3bn and high visibility of future revenue streams 90% in 2009: 76% in 2010: and 65% in 2011, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks despite the current uncertain economic climate.
The Groups management of exposure to financial risk, including liquidity, foreign exchange, credit, interest rate and price risks, is disclosed in note 26 to the Annual Review and Accounts.
In September 2008, the Group secured medium-term financing by entering into a five-year revolving credit facility and bilateral facilities eliminating the near-term risk of refinancing the 400m bank facility maturing at the end of 2009.
Including the term loan and US private placements the Group has committed funding of approximately 900m.
As at 31 December 2008, the headroom on the facilities was in excess of 300m.
The first repayment on these new facilities falls due in September 2010 for an amount of US Dollar 92m.
The Group fully expects to meet this repayment through internally generated cash flows.
In addition, we have diversified both the number and geographical locations of the banks within the syndicate which has risen from nine to thirteen.
Based on the information set out above, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
