using the average cost to BP of supplies incurred during the year and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out FIFO method including any changes in provisions where the net realizable Finance costs and net finance income relating to pensions and other value of the inventory is lower than its cost.
Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on the historic cost of post-retirement benefits acquisition or manufacture rather than the current replacement cost.
In volatile energy markets, Finance costs comprises group interest less amounts capitalized, and this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income.
The amounts disclosed represent the difference between the charge to the income statement on a FIFO basis and any related interest accretion on provisions and long-term other payables.
Finance movements in net realizable value provisions and the charge that would arise using average cost costs for continuing operations in 2008 were $1,547 million compared of supplies incurred during the period.
For this purpose, average cost of supplies incurred during with $1,393 million in 2007 and $986 million in 2006.
The increase in the period is calculated by dividing the total cost of inventory purchased in the period by the number of barrels acquired.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial 2008, when compared with 2007, is largely the outcome of reductions statements as a gain or loss.

In order for investors to understand the operating performance of the group excluding the impact Net finance income relating to pensions and other post-retirement of oil price changes on the replacement of inventories, and to make comparisons of operating benefits in 2008 was $591 million compared with $652 million in 2007 performance between reporting periods, BPs management believes it is helpful to disclose this and $470 million in 2006.
The expected return on assets has increased information.
year on year as the pension asset base applicable to each year increased, but this has been offset in 2008 by higher interest costs reflecting the increase in discount rates applied to pension plan liabilities.
Taxation The charge for corporate taxes for continuing operations in 2008 was $12,617 million, compared with $10,442 million in 2007 and $12,331 million in 2006.
The group earns income in many countries and, on average, pays taxes at rates higher than the UK statutory rate of 28% for 2008.
The increase in the effective rate in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects the change in the country mix of the groups income, resulting in a higher overall tax burden.
The reduction in the effective rate in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily reflects the reduction in the UK tax rate and the fact that a higher proportion of income arose in countries bearing a lower tax rate and other factors.
Business results Profit before interest and taxation from continuing operations, which is before finance costs, other finance expense, taxation and minority interests, was $35,239 million in 2008, $32,352 million in 2007 and $35,158 million in 2006.

c The GIM is the average of regional industry indicator margins that we weight for BPs crude refining capacity in each region.
Each regional indicator margin is based on a single representative crude with product yields characteristic of the typical level of upgrading complexity.
The refining margins are industry-specific rather than BP-specific measures, which we believe are useful to investors in analyzing trends in the industry and their impact on our results.
The margins are calculated by BP based on published crude oil and product prices and take account of fuel utilization and catalyst costs.
No account is taken of BPs other cash and non-cash costs of refining, such as wages and salaries and plant depreciation.
The indicator margin may not be representative of the margins achieved by BP in any period because of BPs particular refining configurations and crude and product slate.
