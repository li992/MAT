The estimation process for recoverable reserves is complex and involves significant judgement and assumptions relating to the life of the mine, and ore reserves may change when new information becomes available.
These include assumptions as to grade estimates, recovery rates, commodity prices, exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and reclamation costs and discount rates.
The actual volume of ore extracted and any changes in these assumptions are accounted for prospectively as they could affect future depreciation rates and carrying values.
The majority of other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the appropriateness of useful economic lives at least annually and any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Contingencies Material contingencies facing the Group are set out in note 35 commencing on page 123 of the financial statements.
A contingent liability arises where: a past event has taken place for which the outcome will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events outside of the control of the Group: or a present obligation exists but is not recognised because it is not probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
A provision is made when a loss to the Group is likely to crystallise.
The assessment of the existence of a contingency and its likely outcome, particularly if it is considered that a provision might be necessary, involves significant judgement taking all relevant factors into account.
As laws and regulations in Kazakhstan continue to evolve, for example, in the areas of taxation, environment and subsoil rights, uncertainties regarding contingencies are greater than typically found in countries with more developed legal and regulatory frameworks.
