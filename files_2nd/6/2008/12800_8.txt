The Group operates in two business segments: a leased estate and a managed estate.
The results of both business segments have been impacted by the reduction in the estate, the slowdown in consumer spending, the smoking ban and rising costs.
Our pub estate has reduced year on year in both the leased and managed divisions, with average pub numbers falling 7%, following the completion of the strategic disposal programme in 2007.
