an essential role in enabling business to operate and compete, and our vision of the network becoming the platform for all forms of communication is being realised.
We saw growth from infrastructure refresh opportunities, and from projects that support clients business objectives around cost reduction, operational efficiency and improved customer service.
Strong demand for unified communications including voice and video solutions resulted in upgrades in the core connectivity fabric.
Similarly, an increasingly mobile workforces expectations for anywhere accessibility drove investment in wireless networks.
We also saw growth in virtual private networks, network security, performance optimisation and operational services.
The demand for unified communications also supported our Converged Communications business, which grew by 22.4%.
This business includes the Groups IP telephony and visual communications solutions.
Strong growth in video conferencing was driven by environmental concerns as well as ongoing pressure on travel costs.
Opportunities in this business stem from our leadership in global IP networking and solid relationships with key unified communications partners, including Cisco, Tandberg and Microsoft.
Concerns over data breaches extend into all areas of infrastructure the network, perimeter, endpoints, applications and data in transit.
Our Security line of business grew by 31.6%, as clients looked to implement multi-vendor solutions within a fragmented technology landscape and an environment of both increasing security breaches and evolving regulatory compliance requirements.
The Microsoft Solutions business grew by 25.5%.
This growth was supported by a servicesled approach to software procurement and deployment, in which we helped clients create Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 17 structured roadmaps to improve their Microsoft infrastructure while lowering software and operational costs.
The need for a robust deployment and management strategy is critical as clients take advantage of Microsoft unified communications technologies.
The DCS line of business grew by 2.0%, impacted by a few large deals in the prior year which did not repeat.
Clients continued to employ virtualisation and consolidation technologies to optimise performance, eliminate costs and improve energy efficiencies.
Expanding data traffic, as well as increasing regulatory compliance requirements also supported demand for storage, backup and recovery solutions.
Growth in CIS of 1.5% was muted as a result of the loss of a large outsourced CIS contract in Australia.
The line of business in that region has realigned its sales effort, and expects to record an improved outcome in the new year.
The fundamental drivers for this line of business, which offers a range of contact centre solutions, remain sound.
The call centre is a network super-user and as contact centres move away from distributed physical locations to virtualised single centres, there is a need for new technologies and management practices.

Principal risks and uncertainties 200 In terms of the UK Companies Act 1985, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is required.
The Groups Risk Management process is detailed in the 0 05 06 07 08 Corporate Governance report.
Set out below are some of the factors which could have an impact on the Groups long term performance.
These should not be regarded as a comprehensive range of all potential risks and uncertainties facing the Group.
800 Exposure to economic downturn 700 A significant portion of the Groups revenue is derived from clients in the Financial Services sector which has been impacted by the global credit crisis.
The Group also derives a significant 600 portion of revenues from the Telecommunications sector, and from multinational corporations.
500 To the extent that economic downturn or recession impacts our clients in these sectors, and 400 their willingness to invest in the Groups IT solutions, the Group could be exposed to a lower 300 level of revenue, and potentially the requirement to reduce its cost base.
200 100 A mitigating factor is that many of the Groups solutions are mission critical to clients, and these solutions are used to reduce costs and improve their productivity.
The Group monitors 0 demand for its products and services carefully, to ensure that its cost base is aligned to its revenues.
411 342 456 682 Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 27 Dependency on key vendors or disruption of key vendor relationships The Group has close and mutually beneficial partnerships with leading technology vendors, enabling it to provide its clients with the most advanced and flexible technology solutions.
The Groups relationship with these key vendors is important to its continued success.
Termination of a supply or services agreement or a significant change in vendor terms or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins, revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations.
While the Group has multiple vendor relationships with leading global and regional technology vendors, the most significant vendor relationship measured by volume of purchases is with Cisco Systems.
Factors mitigating the risk are the fact that the Groups geographic footprint, global procurement and logistics capabilities, and long standing local client relationships make it an important channel to market for its partners, and there is a mutual dependency on promoting stable and long term relationships.
Equally, the Group invests substantial time and resource in promoting and managing its partner relationships at every level within the organisation.
Exposure to country and regional risk political and economic The Group is present in 47 countries, and thus is subject to differing political, social, economic and market conditions.
Particular aspects of country-specific risks that may have an impact include changes to government policies, laws and regulations, including taxation.
We mitigate these risks by having a balanced global footprint between emerging markets and established markets, as well as by developing and retaining strong local and global management capability.
Dependence on major clients and contracts A significant portion of the Groups revenue is generated from longer term contracts and agreements with clients, and therefore the Group would be exposed if these agreements were not to be renewed.
However, no single client accounts for more than 5% of the Groups revenue and therefore the risk of the loss of an individual client is considered to be contained.
People retention Failure to retain and recruit key personnel could harm our ability to meet key objectives.
A key aspect of the Groups strategy is to provide an outstanding employment experience that attracts high quality employees and offers them the opportunity to grow personally and professionally.
The Group has a comprehensive programme to ensure employee retention, including: promotion and support of career development, a structured approach to employee incentives, consistency in reward and recognition, and effective communication with employees around the execution of strategy.
Professional liability execution and delivery The design, support, and project management nature of most client engagements requires the application of high standards of process control, compliance and delivery ability.
If the clients service level expectations are not met, the Groups reputation could be damaged and profitability impacted through the increased risk of litigation and damages.
The Group could also be required to provide corrective services to clients at no charge.
28 Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 Chief Financial Officers operating review continued The Group continues to invest in ensuring quality and rigour in its deal qualification, delivery and project management processes.
The Group also carries comprehensive general and professional liability insurance coverage.
Increasing complexity and variability of client contracts With the Groups global presence, it is in a position to win an increasing number of contracts with multinational clients.
These contracts are often logistically complex, requiring cross border co-operation and co-ordination.
Furthermore, the Group is investing in its management and outsourcing capabilities, and contracts entered into in this market typically involve more complex delivery and service level obligations.
The Group continues to invest in bid, project and commercial management capabilities to oversee the implementation of contracts both globally and locally.
In addition, the Group constantly adapts and changes its project management methodology in line with best practice.
Business continuity risk The ability to provide our clients with a seamless, high level of service is a critical element of the Groups service offering.
In particular, a large element of the Groups managed service revenues depends on remote infrastructure management, which in turn depends on resilient systems and internal IT infrastructure.
The Group has an ongoing business continuity programme to address this risk, and to ensure that alternative solutions are in place to adapt to any unforeseen disruption to critical business processes.
Regulatory compliance risks in particular taxation and transfer pricing The Group operates in 47 different countries, increasing the breadth and complexity of compliance with regulatory requirements in a variety of different jurisdictions.
Furthermore, there is an increasing scrutiny of and need to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
Accordingly, the Group needs to ensure that the various compliance risks are understood and effectively managed.
The Group acknowledges the importance of compliance with all regulatory requirements in the territories within which it operates, and continues to invest in the people and processes to effectively manage this obligation.
Dimension Data Annual Report 2008 29 Balance sheet risk and financial instruments The principal risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk.
Liquidity risk concerns the Groups ability to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
This risk is managed through a combination of careful working capital management and investment decisions, the use of working capital facilities, as well as the maintenance of a strong net cash position.
Credit risk is the risk of default by a counter party on its obligations to the Group, the most important of which relates to trade receivables.
While there is heightened risk as a result of the global credit crisis and likely economic downturn, the Group continues to manage the credit profile of its trade receivables very closely, and to provide for likely impairment where necessary.
The Group reports in US dollars, and currency risk is the risk of material negative impact on earnings as a result of currency fluctuations.
While the Group hedges its exposure to financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the trading currencies of the entities to which the instruments relate, it does not hedge its earnings.
Since the majority of the Groups earnings are in currencies other than the US dollar, currency fluctuations will impact reported Group earnings.
In particular, if the US dollar strengthens against the Groups major trading currencies South African rand, Australian dollar, Sterling or Euro this will reduce translated US dollar earnings.
