Growth in like-for-like revenue and reduction in cash to cash days are KPIs which were given special prominence during the year because of the more difficult markets within which the Group was operating.
The Group does not have the historical information to give a five-year record for these measures.
The other KPIs are those which have been presented in previous years with a five-year record.
They are all shown here for consistency, although growth in acquired revenue has ceased to be a key measure of performance in current markets.
Trading margin and return on gross capital employed are both based on trading profit, which excludes exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets.
