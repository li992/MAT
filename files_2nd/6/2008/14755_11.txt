Sales of Durex condoms increased by 8.4 per cent to 185.5 million as the premium ranges, such as Pleasuremax and Pleasuremax Warming, performed well.
The extensions to our distribution network in China and Eastern Europe are enabling Durex to target an ever wider consumer base.
Sales of the Durex Play range, which includes personal lubricants and vibrators, grew 15.4 per cent, or 4.3 million, to 32.2 million.
This category benefited from a strong performance of Durex Play 2 in 1 massage gel, in markets such as Italy, Spain and Eastern Europe.
Our lubricants range is now a well-established segment within the Durex portfolio with growing consumer demand and enhanced product offerings.
The brand development focus is on enhancing peoples sexual wellbeing, with product range extensions in each of the three core areas of condoms, personal lubricants and vibrators, where we have recently launched Ultra, Touch and new Allure.
We have also recently launched Durex Play O a first to market clitoral stimulating gel in France, with roll-out planned over the current financial year.
continued double-digit operating profit growth 29 Scholl footcare Sales of Scholl footcare were 113.6 million, up by 10.1 per cent.
This performance has been driven principally by the success of new products, such as Scholl Cracked Heel Repair Cream, together with strong performance of new Scholl pharmacy ranges in Germany and France.
Additional marketing investment and new product developments, such as the revolutionary Perfect Nail Treatment, continue to bring the Scholl brand name to a new generation of consumers and we expect to see continued strong performance within this category.
Scholl footwear Scholl footwear sales were 76.1 million, an increase of 6.9 million, or 10.0 per cent.
This performance has been achieved thanks to the solid sell-in of the Spring Summer 08 range, coupled with the positive consumer response to our revamped Autumn Winter 07 range.
Footwear enjoyed solid growth in Italy, Greece, France and Iberia and we also benefited from a positive footwear performance in South East Asia.
After several difficult years it is encouraging to achieve a turnaround in Scholl footwear sales.
We believe that we are now establishing a strong platform to ensure sustained growth in this category.
Orthaheel In November 2007 we completed the acquisition of the Orthaheel, Orthastyle, Vas and Vasyli brands and related assets in Europe and Asia Pacific.
These ranges of orthotic insoles and shoes are an excellent strategic fit with our existing Scholl business.
In the five months to year end these brands have generated sales of 1.8 million 1 million in Scholl footcare and 0.8 million in Scholl footwear.
We expect this performance to improve as we roll-out this brand to our established European markets during the current financial year.

The decline in the UK OTC brand portfolio outweighed the positive performance of Mister Baby and Sauber in Italy.

Litigation This is detailed in note 26.
Capital structure and treasury policy IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 require that certain disclosures relating to financial instruments are given in the financial statements, in order to provide information on the impact of such instruments on the Groups risk profile, how this may affect the Groups performance and financial position, and how those risks are managed.
The impact of those financial instruments is considered in notes 22 and 23.
Foreign exchange risk objective The nature of the Groups trading activities generates transactional foreign exchange rate risks.
These arise from the sourcing of raw materials from different countries, the location of Group production facilities throughout the world and the sale and distribution of finished goods in many locations.
The objective of the Groups foreign exchange policy is to minimise the trade exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the overseas entities and manage the risk from the centre.
This requires that all trading-related exposures should be centralised in accordance with prescribed procedures and timetables under the direction of the Group Treasury Function, which hedges the major exposures using forward contracts and options, usually up to a period of 12 months.
Interest rate exposure objective The interest rate risk management policy aims to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Groups net interest expense to acceptable levels.
This is achieved through balancing the ratio of fixed or hedged debt to those financial liabilities with floating interest rates.
Board approved instruments available to hedge this exposure include interest rate swaps, interest rate options and forward rate agreements.
Details of the interest rate analysis are given in note 23.
Liquidity risk The primary objective of the Group Treasury Policy is to ensure that the Group is able at all times to meet its financial commitments as they fall due.
To facilitate this, the Group Treasury department is responsible for the management of cash and liquid resources for the whole Group, and ensures that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet any reasonable change in funding requirements.
The Groups liquidity is defined as the aggregate of the Groups cash, liquid resources and central undrawn committed facilities as at 31 March 2008, amounted to 141.7 million 2007: 256.4 million.
