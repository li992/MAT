Outlook In light of the current economic uncertainties, we are not guiding on revenue for the 2009 financial year but will guide on a quarterly basis when we release the previous quarters results.
We believe that there will be upward pressure from the relaxation of the price control in the UK, the improved sales approach in Spain, and from continued growth of our internet products.
However, we also believe there will be considerable downward pressure on revenue from the tougher economic conditions.
We expect full year Group adjusted EBITDA to be broadly flat at constant exchange rates.
This comprises flat EBITDA in Yell UK, a slight increase from Yell Publicidad in local currency, offset by a marginal decline in the US, also in local currency.
This guidance assumes aggressive management of the cost base whilst maintaining investment, especially in the internet.
Exceptional costs of around 25 million are expected in the coming year as a result of the restructuring we are currently doing to ensure our cost base is redirected to deliver future expected growth.
