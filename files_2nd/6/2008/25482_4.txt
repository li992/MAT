Overview of the year Financial review This commentary and analysis of our financial results for the year ended 31 March 2008 provides an overview of our financial performance relative to the groups results for the year ended 31 March 2007.
Further detail on the performance of our business divisions is provided in the Divisional Review section of this report.
The commentary and analysis are based on our consolidated financial results presented in accordance with IFRS and denominated in Pounds Sterling.

The numbers have been adjusted for the 5:1 share split that took place on 4 September 2006.
In the medium to long-term, we aim to achieve adjusted EPS growth of 10% in excess of UK inflation in Pounds Sterling.
We continually strive to build and maintain a sustainable business model.
We intend to maintain a dividend cover of between 1.7 and 2.3 times based on earnings per share as defined above, denominated in Pounds Sterling.
We maintain this range to allow us the ability to apply a progressive dividend policy in terms of which dividends should grow in line with earnings.
Interim and final dividends will be declared and proposed in accordance with the above policy.

We are organised as a network comprising five principal business divisions: Private Client Activities, Capital Markets, Investment Banking, Asset Management and Property Activities.
In addition, our head office provides certain group-wide integrating functions such as Risk Management, Information Technology, Finance, Investor Relations, Marketing, Human Resources and Organisational Development.
It is also responsible for our central funding and other activities, such as our Trade Finance operations.
There are therefore a number of key income drivers for our business which are discussed below.

Due to the nature of our businesses, we have been and will continue to be affected by changes in a number of macro-economic fundamentals.
These include the condition of worldwide financial markets, general economic cycles, levels of exchange and interest rates, and inflation, in particular in the UK, South Africa and Australia, where the group derives most of its profit as well as, to a lesser extent, the US and Europe.
Fluctuations in exchange rates Our reporting currency is Pounds Sterling.
Certain of our operations are conducted by entities outside the UK.
The results of operations and the financial condition of our individual companies are reported in the local currencies in which they are domiciled, including Rands, Australian Dollars, Euros, and US Dollars.
These results will then be translated into Pounds Sterling at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our combined consolidated financial statements.
In the case of the income statements, the weighted average rate for the relevant period is applied and, in the case of the balance sheets, the relevant closing rate is used.
The table below sets out the movements in relevant exchange rates against Pounds Sterling over the reporting period.
These rates are indicative only and are not necessarily the rates at which the relevant currencies were converted into Pounds Sterling, for the purposes of preparation of our combined consolidated financial statements.

The most significant impact arises from the volatility of the Rand.
The average Rand: Pounds Sterling exchange rate over the year has depreciated by 7.0% and the closing rate has depreciated by 13.9% since 31 March 2007.
The following table provides an analysis of the impact of the Rand depreciation on our reported numbers.

For balance sheet items we have assumed that the Rand: Pound Sterling closing exchange rate has remained neutral since 31 March 2007.
For income statement items we have used the average Rand: Pound Sterling exchange rate that was applied in the prior period, i. e. 13.38.
Fluctuations in interest rates The shape of the yield curve, the time lag between changes in interest rates applicable to assets and liabilities, and the volatility of interest rates in each of our principal geographic markets can affect our net interest income, principal transactions generated by the Interest Rate and Forex desks and fees in our Capital Markets division.
As a matter of policy, we do not take on material unhedged, long-dated interest rate positions.
The table on page 80 sets out movements in certain interest rates, affecting our businesses over the reporting period.
2008 Investec Annual Report 16 Overview of the year Financial review Salient features of our results in the year under review A number of significant corporate actions have been undertaken during the year under review which have a bearing on our performance and these are highlighted below: The sale of the South African property fund management and property administration business to Growthpoint Properties Limited Growthpoint, as approved by the Competition Tribunal of South Africa on 18 October 2007.
A non-operating exceptional gain of 72.9 million pre-tax was made on the sale of this business.
The purchase consideration was satisfied by the issue of new Growthpoint linked units.
Furthermore, as announced on 6 November 2007, Investec disposed of 152 473 544 Growthpoint linked units representing its entire shareholding in Growthpoint, inter alia, monetising the proceeds on the disposal of the property fund management and property administration business.
Investec Bank Australia Limited acquired Experien Pty Ltd Experien as of 1 October 2007.

The business was acquired for 216.3 million, via the issue of 36.8 million Investec plc shares, with a net asset value at date of acquisition of 100.2 million after a special dividend of 13.7 million.
Kensington now forms part of the Capital Markets business in the UK.

Also included are facility arrangement fees, corporate finance fees and similar items that are transactional in nature and therefore create more erratic income streams, offset by fees and commissions payable which predominantly comprise brokerage payable, banking fees and similar charges.
Net fee and commission income increased by 5.7% to 551.3 million 2007: 521.5 million benefiting from increased transactional activity, particularly in the first half of the year, and higher average assets under management.

Income from principal transactions increased by 12.7% to 276.7 million 2007: 245.5 million.
The Growth and Acquisition Finance, Property, Private Equity, Direct Investments and Capital Markets trading divisions delivered a strong performance.
This result was negatively impacted by write downs of 48.9 million on US structured credit investments as discussed on page 47.
The current year's figure includes Investec's 47.3% share of the directors' estimate of the post-tax profit of Rensburg Sheppards plc for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Other operating income Other operating income amounts to 50 million 2007: 49.7 million.
The operating results of two investments held within the Private Equity portfolio have been consolidated largely into other operating income and administrative expenses.
Impairment losses on loans and advances As a result of the weaker credit cycle we have seen a decline in the performance of the loan portfolio resulting in an increase in impairment losses on loans and advances from 16.5 million to 58.8 million excluding Kensington.
The percentage of gross default loans to core loans and advances has increased from 1.31% to 1.71% since 31 March 2007.
Impairment losses on loans and advances relating to the Kensington business amount to 55.4 million.

Variable remuneration increased slightly from 205.8 million to 206.7 million.
Other operating expenses excluding variable remuneration increased by 28.1% to 625.1 million largely as a result of an increase in headcount in certain of our businesses in line with growth initiatives, an increase in costs associated with complying with regulatory requirements and the acquisition of Kensington.
Total expenses also includes 35.4 million from the consolidation of two private equity investments.
We achieved our target of less than 65% for operating expenses to total operating income, with the ratio improving from 59.0% to 56.1%.

2008 Investec Annual Report 25 Overview of the year Financial review ROE - assessment of economic capital utilised In order to assess the return on economic capital utilised, we believe that certain adjustments should be made to the income statement analysis and balance sheet analysis as reflected under IFRS.
We believe that these adjustments are necessary as they reflect the actual utilisation of capital and return thereon, notwithstanding accounting conventions.
The methodology applied in assessing the utilisation of our economic capital is as follows: A notional return on capital net of the cost of subordinated debt which is managed and borne by the centre is allocated from Group Services and Other Activities GSO to the business segments based on their total capital utilisation.
Basel II was introduced for the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
Total capital utilisation per business segment is initially based on their regulatory capital utilised per the standardised approach of Basel II incorporating credit, market and operational risk.
However, in line with the internal capital adequacy assessment process required in terms of Pillar II of Basel II, each business segments ultimate economic capital utilisation is enhanced to address the various other risks considered material for quantification purposes.
However, comparative figures for capital utilised is based on the amounts reflected in the 2007 report which is based on Basel I regulatory capital usage.
