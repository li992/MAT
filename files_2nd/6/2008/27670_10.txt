GROUP FINANCE DIRECTORS STATEMENT The Group has a sound capital footing and we are well placed to withstand the risks to which our business is exposed.
Each of our businesses has suf cient capital to continue writing new business and growing according to its current plans.
Philip Broadley Group Finance Director Funds under management held up well during year of market volatility During 2008, Old Mutual delivered robust investment performance in challenging markets.
Although net client cash ows were negative overall, we produced positive ows of 3.2 billion in our Skandia businesses and 0.1 billion in our combined South Africa businesses.
However, these were offset by out ows in our US and Asia Paci c businesses.
Excluding the out ows due to a cessation of securities lending which one of our US Asset Management af liates suspended during the year, net client cash ows were 2.4 billion for the year.
The result is pleasing, considering the challenges of delivering on absolute investment performance in the extremely volatile markets in 2008.
This is demonstrated through our closing funds under management, which held up well in the year overall, down five percent to 264.8 billion, in a period when markets such as the FTSE 100, the JSE Africa All Share Index and S&P 500 all fell more than 25 percent.
Breadth of sales product offering in diverse geographic markets Overall life sales on an APE basis held up well, supported by our businesses in Nordic and South Africa.
We continued to see the bene ts of our investment in the Nordic sales channel, where life APE sales were up 30 percent in local currency.
South Africa life sales were up 14 percent in rand terms.

Philip Broadley Group Finance Director Risks and uncertainties 4 March 2009 There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Groups performance and that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.
We have included our view of these principal risks as well as the impact of current economic and business conditions in the Business Review sections of this report.
The current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over the future levels of world equity markets, defaults in corporate bond portfolios, particularly in the United States, currency uctuations, demand for the Groups products and other economic factors.
These uncertainties have been considered individually and in combination in the Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and economic conditions in the markets in which the Group operates.
The results show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its available credit facilities and with an adequate level of capital, both at a Group level and within each of its major regulated Group entities.
To the extent that changes in trading performance and economic conditions prove to be more severe than thought reasonably possible, the Group has evaluated and concluded on feasible management actions that would be possible in such circumstances so as to ensure adequate levels of liquid and capital resources are maintained.
The Group continues to meet Group and individual entity capital requirements, and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Groups available credit facilities.
The Companys primary existing revolving current facility of 1.25 billion does not mature until September 2012.
