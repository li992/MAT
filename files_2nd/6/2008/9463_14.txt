Full year revenue growth was ahead of expectations at 5%, with some slowing in the second half in markets more exposed to Financial Services and IDT.
The Nordics, the UK and the International businesses delivered the most consistent revenue growth through 2008, while France, the Netherlands and Germany slowed more through the second half and into the fourth quarter.
In the Nordics, strength was driven by good growth in Norway and Finland.

At a Group level, Public Sector and Energy and Utilities continued to drive growth in 2008.
In these sectors, we had revenue growth across all geographies except International.
In IDT, a strong French performance offset weakness elsewhere.
As expected, there was weaker momentum in the Financial Services business into the second half, with challenging markets in the UK and the Netherlands being the most signi cant contributors to the decline.
Telecoms was stable, re ecting a mixed performance across our geographies in 2008.

Adjusted operating pro t before exceptional items mainly associated with the Programme for Growth and amortisation of intangibles initially recognised on acquisition was 267 million.
A 25 million increase in adjusted operating pro t in the UK was the largest single contributor to the improvement in pro tability.
We saw a margin improvement in four of our six geographies, with lower margins in the Nordics and the Netherlands compared to last year.
Margins in the Netherlands re ected a higher level of subcontracting to give greater cost structure exibility, while margins in the Nordics were somewhat diluted following a signi cant component of pass through hardware revenue from infrastructure management projects.
First half rebranding costs of 5 million were distributed among the geographies.
This was offset in the second half by the 5 million of net cost savings from the 25 million generated by the Programme for Growth, with the majority of the cost savings 20 million being reinvested in 2008.

Operating pro t was 86 million 2007: 110 million mainly as a result of increased exceptional items associated with the Programme for Growth.
Net exceptional items were 92 million 2007: 23 million.
84 million was associated with the Programme for Growth.
The largest component of this was restructuring charges incurred for employee redundancies and exiting property leases, particularly in the UK where we initiated our restructuring earliest.
A further 8 million relates to the WM-data integration.
Amortisation of intangible assets from acquisitions was 89 million 2007: 75 million.
The higher charge was mainly a result of movements in exchange rates.

In January 2008, we created a new Outsourcing Services division which became operational in key European geographies from Q1 2008 and was rolled out more widely by the end of the year.
Outsourcing Services revenue and pro t will be reported from 2009.
Outsourcing Services represents just under a third of 2008 revenue and incorporates around 9,000 employees working in our onshore, nearshore and offshore centres, with operations in 16 countries around the Group.
Applications Management represented 47% of 2008 revenue.
Having seen signi cant growth in 2008, Infrastructure Management represented 47%, with BPO at 6%.
Adjusted operating margin in this business re ects our strength in applications management and other value-added outsourcing, with Outsourcing Services margins of 6.6%.
Book to bill for the year was 116%.
Our investment in sales and marketing has resulted in an increased order backlog in Outsourcing Services and a 50% increase in the pipeline since the first half, with a signi cant increase in the volume of opportunities with our focus accounts.
At the end of 2008, our backlog and secured revenue covered over 80% of expected 2009 revenue.
During the year, we contested more large deals, more than doubling the number of wins with a value of over 20 million.
We have around 150 deals greater than 5 million in the current pipeline.
We continue to expect Outsourcing Services to be the fastest growing element of our revenue going forward, rising to 35% of total revenue from the 2008 level of 32%.

Revenue was up 7% on a pro forma basis to 1,000 million.
Sweden represented 54% of our Nordic revenue in 2008 2007: 55%.
Adjusted operating pro t was 88 million, giving an adjusted operating margin of 8.8%.
Double digit growth in the Public Sector was driven by a strong performance in Finland as well as ongoing revenue in the defence sector in Sweden.
In IDT, the more challenging economic environment in Sweden resulted in a slight decline over 2007.
In other sectors, double digit growth in Utilities and Financial Services with customers such as StatoilHydro and Swedbank more than offset a continuing decline in telecoms licence revenue in Telecoms and Media sector.
Lower telecoms licence revenue did, however, have some dilutive impact on margin, when coupled with higher pass-through revenue due to growth in infrastructure outsourcing projects.
In light of slower fourth quarter growth in the Swedish market, we have taken action to reduce Swedish headcount.
This will provide extra protection should the economy slow further in 2009.
Book to bill was 112%, driven by strong order intake in Norway and Finland in the second half of the year.
The momentum in these countries, combined with increasing numbers of larger opportunities using our blended delivery model in the applications management and infrastructure management areas across the Nordics, has resulted in a tripling of the pipeline in the Nordics since early 2008.

Revenue was up 5% on a pro forma basis to 721 million.
Adjusted operating pro t was 55 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 7.6%.
Despite a weakening in the economic environment and our signi cant exposure to IDT customers, our French business showed good growth in the second half.
IDT revenue was up 8% in 2008, with growth in outsourcing revenue from a signi cant contract signed with Michelin in the first half of the year.
In Financial Services, revenue was stable with ongoing outsourcing work focused on cost reduction protecting us somewhat from the impact of lower spending among customers.
Revenue in other sectors was up 5% overall, with revenue from utilities customers within the Energy and Utilities sector remaining particularly strong.
Public Sector revenue was also up, with strong growth in the second half of the year.
Our French consulting headcount continues to represent the largest component of our overall consulting capability.
While we saw some slowing in the number of opportunities in this area, consulting growth continued to be in line with overall French revenue growth in 2008.
The improvement in adjusted operating margin was a result of increased productivity levels and cost control in business units and central functions, and compared well against last year when we had a signi cant one-off cost related to management changes.
Our overall cost base bene ted from slower onshore recruitment, as we further increased our offshore and nearshore support into our French client base from Morocco and India.
New consulting wins in the second half with EADS and La Franaise des Jeux contributed to good order intake.

The UK business has shown strong growth over 2007, with revenue up 7% on a pro forma basis to 710 million.
Adjusted operating pro t for the year was 55 million, resulting in a signi cant improvement in adjusted operating margin to 7.8%.
The Public Sector, which represented 58% of revenue in 2008, was up 11% in 2008.
Phasing of contracts and a weak 2007 comparative resulted in second half revenue up 14% in the Public Sector.
Energy and Utilities continued to be our second largest sector and was up 4% for the year, with second half growth slowing following a very strong first half.
Across the other commercial sectors, steps taken earlier in the year to diversify our customer base resulted in overall revenue growth of 2%.
Financial Services, down 13%, continues to be our most challenging sector, re ecting a reduction in the volume of time and materials work.
The UK business continued to deliver increased volumes of work employing resources from our nearshore and offshore centres.
More than 25% of resources being deployed onto UK contracts are expected to come from these centres in 2009.
The strong improvement in adjusted operating margin mainly re ected a favourable comparison with 2007 when we incurred provisions relating to cost overruns on a UK contract.
There was also some bene t from a return to stability in the commercial sectors and the Programme for Growth activities in the second half of the year.
The reduction in of ce space and targeted redundancies will deliver substantial savings to overhead costs, with a headcount reduction of approximately 200 employees and nine buildings exited through 2008.
Book to bill for the year was 99%.
The improvements we have made in our sales and marketing capability have meant that we had good order intake across all sectors in 2008, including a 43 million, four-year contract with the Home Of ce for the new Independent Safeguarding Authority Scheme and the Criminal Records Bureau and our win with BT earlier in the year.
We enter 2009 with a signi cantly stronger pipeline than a year ago.

Revenue was up 2% on a pro forma basis to 573 million.
Adjusted operating pro t was 43m, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 7.5%.
As expected, a weaker economy and signi cant upheaval in the Financial Services sector in the Netherlands were contributors to lower customer spending, contributing to revenue declines in both the IDT and Financial Services sectors in 2008.
These trends are expected to continue into 2009.
Our Public Sector, Energy and Utilities and Telecoms sectors, which accounted for approximately 51% of revenue in 2008, grew 12%.
Public Sector showed continued strength, signing contracts with the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Defence.
Telecoms was also an important driver of growth, following a number of wins with KPN through the year.
We expect the business in the Netherlands to see particular bene t as we implement a consistent operational model across the Group.
Lower overheads, greater centralisation of billable resources and increased use of our blended delivery model are expected to address some of the labour market issues and use of subcontracting which affected margin in 2008.
Our success in positioning higher levels of offshore and nearshore resource with these clients to respond to customer cost reduction targets will be particularly important in 2009.
Book to bill of 109% re ected good order intake in Energy and Utilities and Public Sector.
We continue to expect to win more outsourcing business as customers continue to reduce their cost base.

Revenue declined 4% in the second half, mainly driven by the exit of a team of employees towards the end of the first quarter of 2008.
Adjusted operating pro t was 12 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 5.6%.
The German business improved margins for a second consecutive year, with good growth in Energy and Utilities, IDT and Public Sector.
Financial Services revenue decreased following the implementation of a major payments infrastructure project in 2007.
Signi cant wins in 2008 included larger orders than previously achieved, particularly in the Application Management and Managed Testing areas.

Adjusted operating pro t was 14 million, giving an adjusted operating margin of 4%.
Portugal accounted for approximately 26% of International revenue, with Portuguese customers remaining the largest contributor to Energy and Utilities revenue.
Australia continued to be an important contributor to International revenue, alongside Belgium and Brazil.
Brazilian growth contributed to stronger Energy and Utilities revenue over last year.
Financial Services was lower than 2007 following completion of a project in Asia.
Restructuring in our Portuguese business, a reduction in subcontractors and improved utilisation in a number of geographies, were positive contributors to margin.
