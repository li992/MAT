7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 7 7 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review The following review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes on pages 68 to 135 of this Annual Report.
Overview Shire plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as either Shire or the Group has the strategic goal to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician.
Shire focuses its business on ADHD, HGT and gastrointestinal GI diseases as well as opportunities in other therapeutic areas to the extent they arise through acquisitions.
Shires in-licensing, merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection and global rights.
Shire believes that a carefully selected and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively small-scale sales forces will deliver strong results.
Substantially all of Shires revenues, expenditures and net assets are attributable to the research and development R&D, manufacture, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two operating segments: Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT.
The Group also earns royalties where Shire has out-licensed products to third-parties which are recorded as revenues within All Other in the segmental analysis.
Revenues are derived primarily from two sourcessales of Shires own products and royalties: 91% 2007: 89% of total revenues are derived from product sales, of which 75% 2007: 76% are within the Specialty Pharmaceuticals operating segment and 16% 2007: 13% are within the HGT operating segment: 8% of total revenues are derived from royalties 2007: 10%.
Shires strategic objectives are set using a Balanced Scorecard approach.
Objectives are also set at the business, functional and therapeutic area levels and are aligned with the Group-wide strategic and operational objectives.
The Group therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management.
Key performance indicators are used to measure achievement of the objectives.
Strategic objectives are categorized into fields financial, customers, people & capabilities and operational excellence.
For 2008, Shires corporate objectives included: target net revenue and defined levels of revenue growth: target sales and contributions for core products: development of a strategy to improve customer care and customer service levels: drug application filing and launch targets for new products: development of a strategy to achieve the optimum Shire product portfolio: development of optimal manufacturing and supply chain strategy: development and communication of career development tools for employees: development and commencement of roll-out of Corporate brand positioning: and maintenance of robust risk management practices including internal controls.
The markets in which the Group conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated.
The healthcare industry is experiencing: pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs: increased R&D costs as development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators: challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers: low cost generic drugs entering the market on expiration of patent protection: and higher marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns in the US and competition for market share.
Shires strategy to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry-wide competitive pressures.
This strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas: Markets Historically, Shires portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the North American market.
With the acquisition of Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. TKT in 2005 and the establishment of our HGT business, Shire has substantially increased its presence in Europe and thereby diversified the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market.
Through the TKT acquisition, Shire acquired ELAPRASE global rights and REPLAGAL which is presently sold only outside the US and through the Jerini acquisition, FIRAZYR global rights.
In addition, 2008 saw the European launch of FIRAZYR and the continued roll-out of MEZAVANT and FOSRENOL in Europe.
For 2008, sales outside North America represented approximately 24% of product sales 2007: 24%.
Shires late stage development pipeline contains a number of products with rights outside of the US, including VYVANSE, DAYTRANA, velaglucerase alfa GA-GCB, SPD550, PLICERA, AMIGAL, AT2220 and METAZYM.
Shires continued expansion beyond North America will be driven by the development of products with patent protection in both the North and Latin American and European markets wherever possible.
In 2009 and 2010, subject to obtaining the relevant regulatory governmental approvals, regions outside the US should see: the continued roll-out of MEZAVANT in certain European Union EU countries: the launch of DAYTRANA EU and Canada : the continued roll-out of FIRAZYR in certain European and Latin American countries: the launch of VYVANSE in Canada: and the launch of Velaglucerase alfa in the EU.
This program of new product launches will require significant investment in advertising, promotional spend and in some cases, additional sales representatives.
The orphan disease nature of HGT products means that relatively low associated Selling, general and administrative SG&A and sales infrastructure investment is required, making them ideal products for Shire to launch into new markets.
In markets outside North America and Europe where products require significant SG&A and infrastructure investment, Shire will assess opportunities for internal investment versus distribution and or outlicense partners on a country-by-country basis.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 8 8 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review Patents and market exclusivity The loss or expiration of patent protection or market exclusivity with respect to any of the Groups major products could have a material adverse effect on future revenues and net income as generic manufacturers may produce similar drugs and be able to sell the Groups drugs at a lower price as their costs of development are significantly lower than Shires.
The Group anticipates that there will be one or more generic competitors to ADDERALL XR in the ADHD market beginning April 2009.
ADDERALL XR is, in revenue terms, Shires most significant product representing 36% of total revenues in 2008 2007: 42%.
The Group expects that sales of VYVANSE will partially offset any decline in sales of ADDERALL XR and that VYVANSE prescriptions will come from a number of sources, including patients who are new to ADHD treatment, patients who previously were taking ADDERALL XR, and patients who were taking another ADHD medication.
Shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its ADDERALL XR and CARBATROL patents, as well as the patents for certain other products.
These legal proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
R&D Over the last five years Shire has focused its R&D efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas, which meet the needs of the specialist physician.
The Group has also concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for later-stage pipeline products within its core therapeutic areas.
Evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the Groups development pipeline over the last five years.
Since January 2004, nine products have received regulatory approval: six in the US FOSRENOL and EQUETRO in 2004, DAYTRANA and ELAPRASE in 2006, LIALDA and VYVANSE in 2007 and three in Europe FOSRENOL in 2005, ELAPRASE and MEZAVANT in 2007.
The Group has one product in registration in the US INTUNIV and one in registration in the EU DAYTRANA.
Shires strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile.
R&D costs in 2009 will include expenditure on several pre-clinical to Phase 3 studies and Phase 3 b and Phase 4 studies to support recently launched products in the Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT businesses, and the development of new projects in both the Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT businesses.
Products under development SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS Treatments for ADHD VYVANSE for ADHD in EU and Canada In March 2008 the Canadian new drug submission was accepted for filing for the treatment of ADHD in children.
VYVANSE for the treatment of ADHD in children aged 6 to 17 in the EU is in Phase 3 development and Shire expects to submit the regulatory filing for VYVANSE in Europe in 2010.
DAYTRANA for ADHD in EU and Canada Regulatory submissions were filed for approval of the product with Health Canada in November 2007 and in the EU via the decentralized procedure, with the Netherlands as the reference member state in December 2007.
INTUNIV for ADHD in US In June 2007 Shire received an approvable letter from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA for INTUNIV.
Shire is conducting additional clinical work which is designed to enhance the label.
The New Drug Application NDA was re-submitted in January 2009 and it is anticipated that launch for use in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in the US will occur in the second half of 2009.
SPD487 Amphetamine transdermal system In November 2008 Shire terminated the agreement with Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. Noven for the development of the amphetamine transdermal system.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 9 9 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review Treatments for GI diseases LIALDA MEZAVANT for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis in the US Phase 3 trials investigating the use of the product to maintain remission in patients who have ulcerative colitis were initiated in 2006 for the US market and are continuing.
The product was given this indication on approval in the EU.
LIALDA MEZAVANT for the treatment of diverticulitis Phase 3 worldwide clinical trials investigating the use of the product for the treatment of diverticulitis were initiated in 2007 and are continuing.
Diverticulosis is among the most common diseases in developed countries and manifests as weaknesses or out-pouches of the bowel wall primarily in elderly populations.
Approximately 1520% of people with diverticulosis go on to develop diverticulitis which is an acute inflammation, infection and micro or macro-perforation of these out-pouches.
The current standard of care requires treatment with antibiotics and depending on the frequency or severity of attacks frequently may require surgery.
LIALDA is being investigated as a treatment to prevent recurrent attacks of diverticulitis.
SPD550 Larazotide Acetate: also known as AT-1001 for the treatment of Celiac disease SPD550 is being developed for the treatment of Celiac disease.
Celiac disease is a T-cell mediated auto-immune disease that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals and is characterized by small intestinal inflammation triggered by gluten.
SPD550 is a novel peptide that inhibits intestinal paracellular permeability by inhibiting stimulus-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement in epithelial cells that leads to the disassembly of tight junctions.
There are currently no approved pharmaceutical treatments to reduce the risk of recurrent attacks.
In December 2007 Shire acquired the worldwide rights to SPD550 Larazotide Acetate: also known as AT-1001 in markets outside of the US and Japan from Alba.
The two parties have established Joint Committees which will guide the development, manufacture and commercialization of the product.
Alba has initiated and is responsible for executing the ongoing Phase 2 program and certain non-clinical studies.
Additional development studies may be conducted jointly or by the individual companies prior to or after initiation of Phase 3.
Treatments for diseases in other therapeutic areas FOSRENOL for the treatment of pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease CKD Following the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee recommendation in October of 2007 on the use of phosphate binders, including FOSRENOL, to treat hyperphosphatemia in pre-dialysis CKD patients, Shire continues to work with the FDA to determine whether FOSRENOL can launch in the pre-dialysis CKD market in the US without conducting additional clinical outcomes trials.
JUVISTA Renovo Limited Renovo initiated its first pivotal European Phase 3 trial in scar revision in the fourth quarter of 2008 to support the filing of a European regulatory dossier.
If the outcome from Renovos multi-center, EU Phase 3 study is suitably positive, the data will be used to inform the strategy and design of Shires US development plan and to strengthen the chances of regulatory and commercial success in the US.
SEASONIQUE an extended cycle oral contraceptive In August 2006 Shire entered into a license agreement in respect of Duramed Pharmaceuticals, Incs Duramed oral contraceptive, SEASONIQUE.
Duramed markets SEASONIQUE in the US.
Shire has the rights to market this product in a number of territories outside of North America, including the larger European markets.
On February 24, 2009, Shire and Duramed amended this agreement and it will terminate on December 31, 2009.
Pursuant to this amendment, Shire agreed to return to Duramed its rights under the agreement effective February 24, 2009.
For further details on this amendment see the Liquidity and capital resources section of this Financial review.
Projects in pre-clinical development A number of projects are underway in the early stages of pre-clinical development for the Specialty Pharmaceuticals area.
HUMAN GENETIC THERAPIES Treatments for Angioedema FIRAZYR for hereditary angioedema HAE in the US FIRAZYR is a treatment for acute HAE which Shire added to the portfolio through its acquisition of a majority voting interest in Jerini during 2008.
FIRAZYR is a first-in-class peptide-based therapeutic developed for the symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of HAE.
HAE is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening genetic disease characterized by unpredictable recurring swelling attacks in the hands, feet, face, larynx, or abdomen.
Jerini received a not approvable letter for FIRAZYR for use in the US from the FDA in April 2008, and met with FDA in December 2008 to discuss the development of FIRAZYR.
It was agreed that an additional clinical study would be required before approval could be considered and that a complete response to the not approvable letter would be filed after completion of this study.
This additional study will be initiated during the third quarter of 2009.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 10 10 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review ERT Velaglucerase alfa GA-GCB for the treatment of Gaucher disease Velaglucerase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for the treatment of Gaucher disease.
Gaucher disease is the most common of the inherited lysosomal storage diseases and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.
As a result of this deficiency, certain lipids accumulate in specific cells of the liver, spleen and bone marrow causing significant clinical symptoms in the patient, including enlargement of the liver and spleen, hematological abnormalities and bone disease.
Shire has completed enrolment in a worldwide Phase 3 clinical program for velaglucerase alfa.
This comprehensive development program includes the evaluation of velaglucerase in nave patients and patients previously treated with imiglucerase across three clinical studies.
It is anticipated that this development program will support global filings in the second half of 2009.
HGT-1111 METAZYMfor the treatment of MLD Shire has an ongoing enzyme replacement therapy program for the treatment of MLD, which is a lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency in the enzyme arylsulfatase-A ASA.
In June 2008 Shire completed its acquisition from Zymenex of the global rights to a clinical candidate ASA, known as METAZYM.
METAZYM has completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in twelve MLD patients in Europe and an extension to this study is ongoing.
The product has been granted orphan drug designation in the US and in the EU.
The current plan is to initiate a Phase 2 3 clinical trial in the first half of 2009.
This product is now referred to as HGT-1111.
HGT-1110 was in development at Shire for the treatment of MLD following successful pre-clinical proof of concept studies.
The HGT-1110 program was replaced with the HGT-1111 development program upon completion of the acquisition from Zymenex.
HGT-2310Hunter syndrome with central nervous system symptoms, idursulfase-IT Following the acceptance by the FDA in January 2008 of Shires Investigational New Drug Application for idursulfase-IT HGT-2310formerly referred to as ELAPRASE for Hunter syndrome patients with significant central nervous system symptomsHunter CNS the Group plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2009.
HGT-1410 for Sanfilippo Syndrome  IIIA HGT-1410 is in development as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Sanfilippo Syndrome  IIIA, a lysosomal storage disorder.
Sanfilippo is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a deficiency of heparan-N-sulfatase, an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate.
The accumulation of heparan sulfate in tissues causes a neuro-degenerative disorder in children in which the central nervous system is primarily affected.
Pre-clinical development for this product is continuing.
HGT-2610 for the treatment of Krabbe disease Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy, GLD In November 2008 Shire announced that an enzyme replacement therapy was being developed for the treatment of Krabbe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder.
Krabbe is a rare, inherited lysosomal disorder resulting from a deficiency in the enzyme .
This neurodegenerative disease primarily affects infants, but can occur in adolescents and adults.
GLD is caused by degradation of the myelin sheath that normally covers nerve fibers, which leads to rapid degeneration of mental and motor function in these patients.
This program is in early development and pre-clinical studies.
Pharmacological Chaperone Technology In November 2007 Shire entered into a license agreement with Amicus under which it received the rights to three compounds, PLICERA, AMIGAL and AT2220, in markets outside the US.
PLICERA HGT-3410 for the treatment of Gaucher disease PLICERA is an orally-administered, small molecule pharmacological chaperone that is being developed for the treatment of Gaucher disease.
PLICERA has received orphan drug designation by the European Medicines Agency EMEA, which may provide it with up to ten years market exclusivity in the EU.
In March 2008 Amicus announced positive data from its Phase 2 clinical trial.
Results from the Phase 2 trial support the previously reported interim findings that PLICERA was generally safe and well-tolerated at all doses and increased target enzyme activity levels in a majority of patients.
Shire has rights to PLICERA in markets outside the US.
AMIGAL HGT-3310 for the treatment of Fabry disease AMIGAL is an orally-administered, small molecule pharmacological chaperone being developed for the treatment of Fabry disease.
AMIGAL has received orphan drug designation by the EMEA, which may provide it with up to ten years market exclusivity in the EU.
Amicus met with the FDA to discuss the AMIGAL development program in June 2008, and discussions are ongoing.
Discussions are also ongoing with the EMEA.
A final decision on the global development strategy will follow the conclusion of the discussions with both agencies.
Shire has rights to AMIGAL in markets outside the US.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 11 11 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review HGT-3510 for the treatment of Pompe disease HGT-3510 is an orally-administered, small molecule pharmacological chaperone being developed for the treatment of Pompe disease.
Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II or acid maltase deficiency, is a relatively rare neuro-muscular and lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited genetic mutations in a key enzyme called acidglucosidase GAA which result in deficient activity of the enzyme GAA.
The deficient activity of the GAA enzyme, which normally breaks down glycogen, results in lysosomal glycogen accumulation in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissue.
In June 2008 Amicus initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of HGT-3510, an orally administered, small molecule pharmacological chaperone being jointly developed for the treatment of Pompe disease by Shire and Amicus.
This trial was placed on clinical hold in February 2009 in response to reports of two serious adverse events probably related to treatment with HGT-3510.
Shire has rights to HGT-3510 in markets outside the US.
Early research products A number of additional projects are underway in the early stages of development for the HGT business area.
Business development As a result of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or market exclusivity, Shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in-licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long-term patent protection and market exclusivity.
The Group remains active in seeking out opportunities to acquire new products or companies that fit its business strategy, its existing therapeutic areas or are in complementary therapeutic areas.
During 2008 Shire: acquired more than 98% of Jerini, adding Jerinis HAE product, FIRAZYR, to the portfolio: and acquired the global rights to METAZYM, a clinical candidate arylsulfatase-A, from Zymenex.
In 2007, the Group acquired New River Pharmaceuticals, Inc. New River, allowing Shire to capture the full economic value of VYVANSE and gain control of the development and commercialization of this product.
In 2007 Shire also in-licensed the rights to AMIGAL, PLICERA and AT-2220, three pharmacological chaperone compounds for lysosomal storage disorders in markets outside the US: SPD550 for Celiac disease in markets outside of the US and Japan: and worldwide rights excluding EU member states to JUVISTA.
As part of its strategy of focusing on drugs with long-term patent protection in its core therapeutic areas, the Group will continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of non-core assets.
In 2007 the Group divested a portfolio of non-core products, including SOLARAZE and VANIQA, to Almirall and sold EQUETRO and transferred post-approval study commitments to Validus Pharmaceuticals Inc. Organization and structure During 2008, the Group undertook a court sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement, establishing Shire plc as the new Shire holding company.
For further details on the Scheme of Arrangement see Note 25 of the consolidated financial statements.
In 2008, Shire acquired more than 98% of Jerini and is in the process of integrating Jerini into the Group: integration and acquisition related costs expensed during the year to December 31, 2008 totaled $10.3 million.

Shire has the leading portfolio of products in the US ADHD market.
ADDERALL XRADHD ADDERALL XRs average share of the US ADHD market for 2008 fell to 22.6% 2007: 25.5%.
US prescriptions for ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2008 decreased by 5% compared to 2007 due to an 11% fall in average market share offset by a 7% growth in the US ADHD market.
Sales of ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2008 were $1,101.7 million, an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2007 2007: $1,030.9 million, with the decline in prescriptions being more than offset by price increases.
As previously disclosed, the United States Federal Trade Commission FTC informed Shire on October 3, 2006 that it was reviewing the ADDERALL XR patent litigation settlement agreement between Shire and Barr.
On June 22, 2007 the Group received a civil investigative demand requesting that it provide information to the FTC relating to its settlement with Barr and its earlier settlement with Impax Laboratories, Inc.
The Group is co-operating fully with this investigation and believes that the settlements are in compliance with all applicable laws.
Litigation proceedings concerning Shires ADDERALL XR patents are ongoing.
Further information on this litigation can be found in Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.
VYVANSEADHD VYVANSE was launched in the US in July 2007 as the first and only once-daily pro-drug stimulant to treat ADHD.
In April 2008 VYVANSE was approved by the FDA for use in adults and Shire launched VYVANSE for adult ADHD in June 2008.
In July 2008 Shire launched VYVANSE in 20mg, 40mg and 60mg dosage strengths, which are designed to increase the dosing flexibility of VYVANSE.
Product sales for the year to December 31, 2008 were $318.9 million 2007: $76.5 million.
Product sales growth was driven by the increase in average share of the US ADHD market 8.2% for the year to December 31, 2008 compared to 1.8% in 2007 and a price increase in April 2008.
DAYTRANAADHD Product sales for the year to December 31, 2008 were $78.7 million 2007: $64.2 million.
DAYTRANAs average annual share of the US ADHD market decreased to 1.8% in 2008 compared to 2.1% in 2007.
Despite the 11% decrease in prescriptions compared to 2007, sales of DAYTRANA grew 23% compared to the same period last year due to growth in the US ADHD market of 7% and lower sales deductions in 2008 over 2007, primarily due to reduced coupon expense.
During 2008 Shire announced two voluntary market recalls of a limited portion of DAYTRANA patches because certain patches did not meet their release liner removal specifications which may have resulted in some patients and caregivers having difficulties removing the liners.
The voluntary recalls were not due to safety issues.
Shire and Noven the manufacturer of DAYTRANA continue to pursue enhancements to the product and to work closely with the FDA to implement changes that may improve the usability of DAYTRANA.
There has been no interruption in the production of DAYTRANA.
US oral mesalamine market share Shires average annual market share of the US oral mesalamine market rose to 28.4% for the year to December 31, 2008 2007: 21.1%, driven by the growth of LIALDA since its launch in March 2007.
LIALDA MEZAVANTUlcerative colitis US prescriptions of LIALDA for the year to December 31, 2008 were up 204% compared to the prior year and LIALDAs average market share for 2008 increased to 11.7% 2007: 3.9%.
LIALDAs US product sales for the year to December 31, 2008 were $134.8 million compared to $50.3 million in 2007.
In April 2008, TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc.
TAP commenced co-promotion of LIALDA in the US in accordance with the co-promotion agreement entered into in March 2008.
This agreement adds more than 500 additional sales representatives from TAP which will increase the reach and frequency of sales calls covering an additional 22,000 doctors.
Sales of MEZAVANT outside the US for the year to December 31, 2008 were $5.6 million 2007: $0.2 million.
By December 31, 2008 MEZAVANT was available in five EU countries.
Launches are planned in other countries during 2009, subject to the successful conclusion of pricing and re-imbursement negotiations.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 14 14 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review PENTASAUlcerative colitis US prescriptions of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2008 were down 1% compared to 2007 primarily due to a small decrease in PENTASAs average annual market share from 17.2% in 2007 to 16.7% in 2008, offset by a 2% increase in the US oral mesalamine prescription market.
Sales of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2008 were $185.5 million, an increase of 5% compared to 2007 2007: $176.4 million.
Sales growth is higher than prescription growth primarily due to the impact of price increases.
 At December 31, 2008 FOSRENOL was available in 30 countries and global sales grew by 52% to $155.4 million for the year to December 31, 2008 2007: $102.2 million.
Sales of FOSRENOL outside the US for the year to December 31, 2008 were $69.5 million 2007: $40.1 million.
US sales of FOSRENOL for the year to December 31, 2008 were up 38% to $85.9 million compared to 2007 2007: $62.1 million.
FOSRENOLs average prescription share of the US phosphate binder retail market decreased to 8.1% for the year to December 31, 2008 2007: 8.6%.
Product sales increased despite the decrease in prescriptions due to price increases and a 34% increase in FOSRENOLs share of the non-retail market resulting from Shires continued focus on specialist physicians, clinics and dialysis centers.
In April 2008 Shire and Abbott Laboratories Inc. mutually agreed to terminate their Co-Promotion Agreement for FOSRENOL in the US.
Shire will continue to promote FOSRENOL on its own in the US and throughout Europe.
In February 2009, Shire received three Paragraph IV Notice letters, from Barr, Mylan and NATCO Pharma Limited NATCO advising the filing of Abbreviated New Drug applications ANDA for generic versions of 500mg, 750mg and 1,000mg FOSRENOL.
Shire is currently reviewing the details of these notice letters and, under the Hatch-Waxman regulations, has 45 days from the date of each notice letter to determine if it will file a patent infringement suit.
If Shire brings suit pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman regulations a 30-month stay of approval, commencing on October 26, 2009, will be imposed on the FDA on each ANDA which is the subject of such a lawsuit.

Shire receives royalties from GSK on worldwide 3TC sales.
GSKs worldwide sales of 3TC for the year to December 31, 2008 were $1,060 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the same period in 2007 2007: $1,110 million, but a decrease of approximately 7% on a constant exchange rate basis.
While the nucleoside analogue market for HIV has continued to grow, competitive pressures within the market have increased, leading to a decline in 3TC sales.
In 2007 generic drug companies filed ANDAs seeking approval for EPIVIR, COMBIVIR, ZEFFIX and EPZICOM in the US.
Pursuant to the GSK Shire license for lamivudine products, GSK has the right to enforce the licensed patents.
In November 2007 GSK filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Teva in the US District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of one of the patents relating to COMBIVIR.
The patent, which covers the combination of AZT and lamivudine to treat HIV, expires in May 2012.
Teva had filed an ANDA with the FDA with a certification of invalidity, unenforceability and non-infringement of that combination patent.
Teva did not challenge two other patents relating to COMBIVIR that expire in 2010 and 2016.
The case is in its early stages.

Other Other royalties are primarily in respect of REMINYL and REMINYL XL known as RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER in the US.
REMINYL and REMINYL XL are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia of the Alzheimer type and are marketed by the Group in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
In the rest of the world, they are marketed by Janssen, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson under the name RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER in the US.
Shire receives royalties on Janssens sales.
Certain companies filed ANDAs with the FDA for generic versions of RAZADYNE.
Janssen and Synaptech filed lawsuits against some of those ANDA filers.
A trial was held during the week of May 21, 2007.
Following a decision on August 28, 2008 which rendered the relevant patent invalid, generic versions of RAZADYNE were permitted to enter the US market.
REMINYL XL is a once-daily prolonged release formulation of REMINYL, which was launched by Janssen in the US in May 2005 as RAZADYNE ER.
Patent litigation proceedings relating to RAZADYNE ER are in progress in the US.
Certain companies filed ANDAs with the FDA for generic versions of RAZADYNE ER.
Janssen and Synaptech filed lawsuits against some of those ANDA filers for infringement of their patent rights relating to RAZADYNE ER as a result of the ANDA filing.
Sales of the REMINYL RAZADYNE range continue to grow in most countries, however, the entry of generic versions of RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER into the US market has significantly decreased sales in that region.
Cost of product sales The Cost of product sales increased by 27% to $408.0 million for the year to December 31, 2008 15% of product sales, up from $320.3 million in the corresponding period in 2007 2007: 15% of product sales.
For the year to December 31, 2008 Cost of product sales included charges of $48.8 million 2% of product sales 2007: $nil relating to the write-down of inventory and other exit costs in respect of DYNEPO which the Group has decided to stop commercializing, depreciation of $16.2 million 2007: $11.8 million and amortization of $1.7 million 2007: $1.2 million.
Cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales benefited from the impact of price increases on the Groups product sales and favorable changes in product mix in 2008 over 2007.
R&D R&D expenditure decreased to $526.6 million for the year to December 31, 2008 19% of product sales, from $576.4 million in the year to December 31, 2007 27% of product sales.
For the year to December 31, 2007 R&D included upfront and milestone payments totaling $155.9 million Renovo $75.0 million, Amicus $50.0 million, Alba $25.0 million and Noven $5.9 million for the in-licensing of pipeline products 7% of product sales.
For the year to December 31, 2008 R&D included $6.5 million 2007: $nil relating to the cost of exiting post-approval marketing commitments for DYNEPO, which the Group has decided to stop commercializing.
R&D also includes depreciation of $12.5 million 2007: $11.3 million.
R&D in 2008 over 2007 includes higher expenditure on projects in-licensed and acquired since the second half of 2007 including SPD550, PLICERA, AMIGAL, FIRAZYR and METAZYM together with Phase 3 b and Phase 4 studies to support new product launches.
Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses SG&A expenses increased 21% to $1,422.9 million in the year to December 31, 2008 from $1,178.8 million in the year to December 31, 2007.
This increase in SG&A expenses was less than the product sales increase of 27%, and as a percentage of product sales SG&A expenses in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 fell by two percentage points to 52% 2007: 54%.
SG&A for the year to December 31, 2008 includes intangible asset impairment charges of $97.1 million 4% of product sales 2007: $0.4 million of which $94.6 million relates to DYNEPO which the Group has decided to stop commercializing.
Amortization of intangible assets in 2008 increased by $31.6 million to $126.2 million 2007: $94.6 million : this increase resulted from a full years amortization in 2008 of the Groups VYVANSE intangible asset, of $55.8 million 2007: $28.9 million, and amortization in the second half of 2008 of the FIRAZYR intangible asset acquired through the Jerini business combination.
SG&A expenses also include depreciation charges of $48.5 million 2007: $42.1 million.
The year to December 31, 2008 also included costs associated with the introduction of a new holding company in 2008 totaling $14.8 million 2007: $nil.
Other increases in SG&A expenses in 2008 over 2007 principally relate to the increase in advertising, promotional and marketing spend to support commercialization of the Groups new products.
SG&A for the year to December 31, 2007 included a net charge of $17.0 million in respect of legal settlements, being a charge of $27.0 million for settlement of the TKT purported securities fraud class action shareholder suit partially offset by a $10.0 million release of existing legal provisions.
SG&A expenses in the year to December 31, 2007 further included a share-based compensation catch-up charge of $22.5 million for the 2005 awards.

The IPR&D charge in respect of FIRAZYR of $128.1 million relates to the US $64.1 million and the Rest of the World ROW $64.0 million markets.
In the US FIRAZYR received a not approvable letter from the FDA in April 2008, and in ROW it has not been approved by the regulatory authorities.
At December 31, 2008, Shires management estimated that future R&D costs until regulatory approval would be approximately $30 million.
This estimate can be affected by various factors, both internal and external, and is part based upon management estimates and assumptions.
For this reason, amongst others, the actual cash flows may vary from future estimated cash flows.
METAZYM HGT-1111 has completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in twelve MLD patients in Europe and an extension to this study is ongoing.
At December 31, 2008, Shires management estimated that future R&D costs until regulatory approval for METAZYM for the treatment of MLD in the US and the EU will be approximately $80 to $90 million.
This estimate can be affected by various factors both internal and external and is, in part, based on managements estimate and assumptions.
For this reason, among others, the actual cash flows may vary from forecast future cash flows.
During the year to December 31, 2007 Shire expensed the portion of the New River purchase price allocated to IPR&D totaling $1,866.4 million.
This amount represented the value of those acquired development projects which, at the acquisition date, had not been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including the adult indication of VYVANSE.
On April 23, 2008 Shire announced that the FDA had approved the adult indication of VYVANSE and Shire launched VYVANSE for adult ADHD in the US in June 2008.
In March 2008 the Canadian new drug submission was accepted for filing for the treatment of ADHD in children, and Shire expects to submit the regulatory filing for VYVANSE in Europe for the treatment of ADHD in children aged 6 to 17 in 2010.
At December 31, 2008 management estimated that future R&D costs until regulatory approval for VYVANSE for ADHD in markets outside the US are approximately $60 to $80 million.
These estimates can be affected by various factors and are, in part, based on managements estimate and assumptions.
For these reasons, among others, the actual cash flows may vary from forecast future cash flows.
Gain on sale of product rights For the year to December 31, 2008 Shire recognized gains of $20.7 million on the sale of non-core products 2007: $127.8 million.
For the year to December 31, 2008 these gains primarily relate to the sale of non-core products, including the dermatology products SOLARAZE and VANIQA, to Almirall in 2007, which were deferred at December 31, 2007 pending the transfer of relevant consents.
The gains of $127.8 million recognized in the year to December 31, 2007 comprise $114.8 million arising from the sale of non-core products to Almirall and $13.0 million of gains on the sale of other non-core products during 2007.
Integration costs For the year to December 31, 2008 Shire incurred $10.3 million of costs associated with the integration of Jerini into the Group and acquisition related advisory fees incurred by Jerini 2007: $1.3 million relating to the New River acquisition.
Interest income For the year to December 31, 2008 Shire received interest income of $25.5 million 2007: $50.6 million.
Interest income primarily relates to interest received on cash and cash equivalents.
Interest income for the year to December 31, 2008 is lower than the same period in 2007 due to lower average cash balances and lower average US dollar interest rates.
Interest expense For the year to December 31, 2008 Shire incurred interest expense of $139.0 million 2007: $70.8 million.
Interest expense for the year to December 31, 2008 includes $87.3 million 2007: $28.0 million in respect to the TKT appraisal rights litigation.
On November 5, 2008 Shire announced that it had successfully settled all aspects of this litigation with all parties.
Shire paid the same price of $37 per share originally offered to all TKT shareholders at the time of the July 2005 merger, plus interest.
The Delaware Chancery Court has approved dismissal of the case and Shire made payment to the dissenting shareholders on November 7, 2008.
The settlement represents a total payment of $567.5 million, representing consideration at $37 per share of $419.9 million and an interest cost of $147.6 million.
Prior to reaching this settlement, the Group accrued interest based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that may be awarded by the Court to those former TKT shareholders who requested appraisal.
This estimate of interest was based on Shires cost of borrowing.
Between the close of the merger and November 5, 2008 the Group applied this interest rate on a quarterly compounding basis to the $419.9 million of consideration to calculate its provision for interest.
Upon reaching agreement in principle with all the dissenting shareholders, the Group determined that settlement had become the probable manner through which the appraisal rights litigation would be resolved.
Under current law, although not applicable in this case because the merger was entered into before the relevant amendment to the law became effective the court presumptively awards interest in appraisal rights cases at a statutory rate that is 5 percentage points above the Federal Reserve discount rate as it varies over the duration of the case.
In connection with the settlement, the Group agreed to an interest rate that approximates to this statutory rate.
Based on the settlement, the Group amended the method of determining its interest provision to reflect this revised manner of resolution and upon reaching settlement with the dissenting shareholders recorded an additional interest expense of $73.0 million in its consolidated financial statements for the year to December 31, 2008.
For further details on the settlement of this litigation, see Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.

The impairment of the investment in Renovo Group plc was recognized at the end of the third quarter of 2008.
These amounts reflect unrealized holding losses that have been re-classified out of other comprehensive income into earnings in the period, as management have concluded that the impairment is other-than-temporary.
The decline in the market value of the Groups investment in Renovo Group plc initially arose from the results of clinical trials for JUVISTA announced over 2007 and 2008.
During the third quarter of 2008, in considering whether the decline in value was temporary or other-than-temporary under US GAAP the Group considered the following factors: the severity of the decline from historical cost 87% and its duration eleven months : market analysts targets of Renovo Group plcs share price for the next 1824 months: and the revised expected filing date for JUVISTA due to the adoption of a sequential rather than parallel Phase 3 development plan.
These factors, together with the significant decline in global equity markets during the third quarter of 2008 meant that the Group was unable to reasonably estimate the period over which a full recovery in the value of its investment in Renovo Group plc could occur.
As such, the Group concluded that for US GAAP purposes the decline in value was other-than-temporary.
In such circumstances US GAAP requires the full difference between the book value of the investment and the fair market value be recognized as an other-than-temporary impairment.
Accordingly the Group recognized an impairment charge of $44.3 million for its investment in Renovo Group plc through the consolidated statement of operations in the third quarter of 2008.
For purposes of computing the impairment charge fair value was assumed to be 0.26 per share, representing the closing price of Renovo Group plc securities on the London Stock Exchange on September 30, 2008.
If in the future JUVISTAs Phase 3 trials report positively and Renovo Group plcs other products progress through development, Renovo Group plcs share price could react favorably and the Group may recover some or all of this impairment loss.
Any future potential increases in the value of Renovo Group plc will be recognized through other comprehensive income.
The closing price of Renovo Group plc securities on the London Stock Exchange on December 31, 2008 was 0.20, and the carrying value of the Groups investment in Renovo Group plc was $3.6 million.
Other expense income, net also includes a gain of $9.4 million arising from the sale of Shires minority equity investment in Questcor Pharmaceutical Inc. a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on providing prescription drugs for central nervous system CNS disorders.
Shire received cash consideration of $10.3 million in respect of the sale.
Income taxes The effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2008 was 36.9% 2007: 4.0%.
Excluding IPR&D charges of $263.1 million 2007: $1,866.4 million which are either not tax deductible or for which no tax benefit is currently recognized, the effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2008 has increased by 6.6% to 18.5% 2007: 11.9%.
This increase in 2008 over 2007 is primarily due to the combined effects of a in 2008, significant unfavorable rate impacts related to other than temporary impairment charges on available-for-sale securities and an increase in the valuation allowance and, b in 2007, favorable impacts recognized related to non-taxable gains on the sale of non-core products rights which were partially offset by an increase in the FIN 48 provision.
The 2008 effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by exchange losses recorded in continuing operations.
Equity in earnings of equity method investees Net earnings of equity method investees of $2.4 million were recorded for the year to December 31, 2008 2007: $1.8 million.
This comprised earnings of $5.8 million from the 50% share of the anti-viral commercialization partnership with GSK in Canada 2007: $6.5 million, offset by losses of $3.4 million being the Groups share of losses in the GeneChem, AgeChem and EGS Healthcare Funds 2007: losses of $4.7 million.
Discontinued operations Losses from discontinued operations in the year to December 31, 2008 totaled $17.6 million, 2007: $nil, relating to those businesses acquired through the Jerini business combination that have been deemed by Shire and Jerini to be non-strategic to the combined business.
The loss from discontinued operations in the year to December 31, 2008 includes a charge of $12.9 million arising on the re-measurement of assets held for sale to their fair value less costs to sell at December 31, 2008.
At December 31, 2008 these assets held-for-sale had a carrying value of $14.9 million.
Results of operations for the years to December 31, 2007 and 2006 For the year to December 31, 2007 the Groups total revenues increased by 36% to $2,436.3 million, compared to $1,796.5 million in 2006.
Net loss for the year to December 31, 2007 was $1,451.8 million compared to a net income of $278.2 million in 2006.
The Groups net loss for 2007 was primarily attributable to the IPR&D write-off of $1,866.4 million following the acquisition of New River.

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS ADDERALL XR As a result of the launch of VYVANSE in July 2007 ADDERALL XRs average share of the US ADHD market for 2007 fell to 25.5% 2006: 26.1%.
US prescriptions for ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2007 increased by 3% compared to the same period in 2006 due to a 6% growth in the US ADHD market offset by the 0.6% fall in average market share.
Sales of ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2007 were $1,030.9 million, an increase of 19% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $863.6 million.
Product sales growth was higher than prescription growth due primarily to price increases in January and October 2007.
As previously disclosed, the FTC informed Shire on October 3, 2006 that it was reviewing the ADDERALL XR patent litigation settlement agreement between Shire and Barr.
On June 22, 2007 the Group received a civil investigative demand requesting that it provides information to the FTC relating to its settlement with Barr and its earlier settlement with Impax.
Patent litigation proceedings relating to ADDERALL XR are in-progress.
For further information see Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.
VYVANSE VYVANSE was launched in the US market in July 2007 and at December 31, 2007 its market share had reached 5.2% average annual market share 2%.
Product sales of $76.5 million for the year to December 31, 2007 were net of $42 million sales deductions, primarily coupons, wholesaler discounts and rebates.
All initial launch stocks of VYVANSE totaling $57.8 million were recognized into revenue during the year to December 31, 2007.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 20 20 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review DAYTRANA Product sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $64.2 million 2006: $25.1 million.
DAYTRANAs average share of the US ADHD market increased to 2.1% in 2007 compared to 0.8% in 2006 DAYTRANA was launched in June 2006.
US prescriptions of DAYTRANA for the year to December 31, 2007 over 2006 benefited from a full year of demand, 6% growth in the US ADHD market and higher market share.
For the six month period to December 31, 2007 prescriptions of DAYTRANA were up 31% compared to the same period in 2006.
During September 2007 Shire announced a voluntary market withdrawal of a limited quantity of DAYTRANA patches following feedback from patients and caregivers who had experienced difficulty in removing the release liner.
Patches are now being manufactured using an enhanced process, which Shire believes offers improved ease of use when peeling off the release liner.
The addition of VYVANSE combined with ADDERALL XR and DAYTRANAs market share helped Shire grow its total share of the US ADHD market to 31.1% at December 31, 2007 compared to 28.0% at December 31, 2006.
PENTASA US prescriptions of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2007 were up 3% compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to a 4% increase in the US oral mesalamine prescription market, offset by a 0.1% decrease in PENTASAs average market share from 17.3% in 2006 to 17.2% in 2007.
Sales of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2007 were $176.4 million, an increase of 28% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $137.8 million.
Sales growth is higher than prescription growth primarily due to re-stocking to normal levels in 2007 and the impact of price increases in November 2006 and August 2007.
LIALDA Shire launched LIALDA in the US oral mesalamine market in March 2007, and by December 31, 2007 LIALDA had reached a market share of 8.0% average annual market share 3.9%.
LIALDAs product sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $50.5 million.
All initial launch stocks of LIALDA totaling $34.3 million were recognized into revenue during the year to December 31, 2007.
The product was launched in the UK in November 2007, Canada in January 2008 and further launches are planned in the EU during 2008, subject to the successful conclusion of pricing and re-imbursement negotiations.
In the UK and Ireland the product will be called MEZAVANT XL and Shire plans to market the product in most other EU countries as MEZAVANT.
Since the launch of LIALDA in March 2007, PENTASA and LIALDAs combined share of the US oral mesalamine prescription market had grown to 24.9% as at December 31, 2007, up from 17.6% as at December 31, 2006.
FOSRENOL Global sales totaled $102.2 million for the year to December 31, 2007 2006: $44.8 million.
Sales of FOSRENOL outside the US for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $40.1 million compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $4.6 million.
US sales of FOSRENOL for the year to December 31, 2007 were up 54% to $62.1 million compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $40.2 million.
FOSRENOLs average market share of the US phosphate binder market increased from 8.5% in 2006 to 8.6% in 2007.
The increase in product sales is due to a small wholesaler stocking increase in 2007 compared to significant wholesaler fide-stocking of initial launch stocks in 2006, the continued shift to the 1 gram strength tablet launched in 2006, partially offset by higher sales deductions in 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 relating to a one-off provision made in 2007 for returns of the 750mg dose.
DYNEPO DYNEPO was launched in March 2007 in Germany and later in the year in the UK, France, Italy, and Ireland with sales for 2007 reaching $14.2 million.
CARBATROL US prescriptions for CARBATROL for the year to December 31, 2007 were down 5% compared to the same period in 2006.
This was primarily due to a comparable decline in the US extended release carbamazepine prescription market: CARBATROLs average market share remained constant.
Sales of CARBATROL for the year to December 31, 2007 were $72.3 million, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $68.3 million.
Product sales increased despite the decrease in prescriptions, due to a sales price increase in April 2007 and re-stocking to normal levels, partially offset by higher sales deductions.
Patent litigation proceedings relating to CARBATROL are in-progress.
XAGRID Sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $66.8 million, an increase of 25% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $53.3 million.
Expressed in transaction currencies XAGRID is primarily sold in Euros and Pounds sterling, sales increased by 15% due to growth in many of Shires existing markets, with exchange rate movements against the US dollar accounting for the remaining 10% increase.
HUMAN GENETIC THERAPIES REPLAGAL Sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $143.9 million, an increase of 22% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $117.7 million.
Expressed in transaction currencies REPLAGAL is primarily sold in Euros and Pounds sterling sales increased by 13% due to higher unit sales in Europe and Canada and the continued roll-out of REPLAGAL to new countries, including those in Latin America.
Exchange rate movements against the US dollar accounted for the remaining 9% increase in sales.
ELAPRASE Sales for the year to December 31, 2007 were $181.8 million 2006: $23.6 million.
Sales growth in 2007 was driven primarily by a full year of sales in the US ELAPRASE was launched in the US in August 2006, sales in Europe ELAPRASE was launched in several European markets in the first half of 2007, and pre-approval sales in several Latin American markets.
ELAPRASE was approved for sale and marketing in Japan in October 2007.

Excluding favorable foreign exchange movements of 4%, there has been a decline of 8% compared to the same period in 2006.
GSKs worldwide sales of 3TC for the year to December 31, 2007 were $1,110 million, a decrease of 2% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $1,138 million, but a decrease of approximately 7% on a constant exchange rate basis.
While the nucleoside analogue market for HIV has continued to grow, competitive pressures, such as new entrants to the market and products in competing markets, have increased leading to a decline in 3TC sales.
ZEFFIX Royalties from sales of ZEFFIX for the year to December 31, 2007 were $41.0 million, an increase of 18% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $34.8 million.
The impact of foreign exchange movements has contributed 8% to the reported growth: excluding favorable foreign exchange movements there has been an increase of 10% compared to the same period in 2006.
Shire receives royalties from GSK on worldwide ZEFFIX sales.
GSKs worldwide sales of ZEFFIX for the year to December 31, 2007 were $341 million, an increase of 13% compared to the same period in 2006 2006: $301 million.
This increase was mainly due to strong growth in the Chinese market and favorable foreign exchange rate movements.
Other Other royalties are primarily in respect of REMINYL and REMINYL XL known as RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER in the US, a product marketed worldwide excluding the UK and the Republic of Ireland by Janssen, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson.
Shire has the exclusive marketing rights in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Barr and other companies have filed ANDAs with the FDA for generic versions of RAZADYNE.
Janssen and Synaptech have filed lawsuits against some of those ANDA filers.

7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 22 22 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review Cost of product sales For the year to December 31, 2007 the Cost of product sales was 15% of product sales 2006: 17%.
The Cost of product sales for REPLAGAL in 2006 included a $47.0 million 3% of product sales adjustment in respect of inventories acquired through the acquisition of TKT.
Excluding the impact of this fair value adjustment, Cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in 2006 was 14%.
The increase in Cost of product sales as a percentage of products sales in 2007 over 2006 was primarily due to a shift in product mix resulting from increased sales of launched products, which had lower margins than existing products, and the write-off of inventory following the voluntary market withdrawal of a limited quantity of DAYTRANA patches.
For the year to December 31, 2007 Cost of product sales included a charge of $5.5 million for share-based compensation 2006: $3.2 million which included a $2.1 million cumulative catch-up charge 2006: $nil in respect of the 2005 awards, for further information see SG&A below.
R&D R&D expenditure increased to $576.4 million for the year to December 31, 2007 27% of product sales, up from $385.4 million in the year to December 31, 2006 25% of product sales.
For the year to December 31, 2006 R&D included $80.5 million New River $50.0 million, Duramed $25.0 million and Warren Pharmaceuticals Inc Warren $5.5 million of upfront and milestone payments 5% of product sales.
Excluding these upfront and milestone payments, the increase in R&D expenditure in 2007 was due to Phase 3 b and Phase 4 studies to support new product launches: the continuation of Phase 3 trials on velaglucerase alfa: the development of the Womens Health franchise and JUVISTA: and the pre-clinical development of three HGT projects and the Amicus products in-licensed in 2007.
For the year to December 31, 2007 R&D included a charge of $17.0 million for share-based compensation 2006: $5.4 million which included a $4.6 million cumulative catch-up charge in respect of 2005 awards, for further information see SG&A below.
SG&A expenses Total SG&A costs increased 27% to $1,178.8 million in the year to December 31, 2007 from $926.6 million in the year to December 31, 2006, which was substantially less than the product sales increase of 41%.
As a percentage of product sales, total SG&A costs were 54% 2006: 60%.
The increase in SG&A expenses in 2007 over 2006 included the impact of the following: an increase in the ADHD sales force to promote VYVANSE: the cost of the new GI sales force in the US: the increase in advertising, promotional and marketing spend to support VYVANSE, LIALDA MEZAVANT and ELAPRASE: and a net charge of $17.0 million in respect of legal settlements, being a charge of $27.0 million for settlement of the TKT securities class action shareholder suit partially offset by a $10.0 million release of existing legal provisions 1% of product sales.
For the year to December 31, 2007 SG&A included a charge of $52.7 million for share-based compensation 2006: $34.4 million, which included a $22.5 million cumulative catch-up charge 2006: $nil in respect of 2005 awards.
The depreciation charge for the year to December 31, 2007 was $42.1 million 2006: $43.3 million, inclusive of impairment charges of $1.8 million 2006: $0.5 million.
The increase in depreciation follows investment in Shires infrastructure to support the continuing growth of the Group.
The amortization charge for the year to December 31, 2007 was $95.0 million 2006: $57.4 million, inclusive of impairment charges of $0.4 million 2006: $1.1 million.
The increased charge is primarily due to the amortization of DAYTRANA, DYNEPO and VYVANSE intangible assets following the product launches in June 2006, March 2007 and July 2007 respectively.
The cumulative share-based compensation catch-up charge related to options issued by Shire in 2005 under the 2000 Executive Scheme.
These options were exercisable subject to certain performance criteria, including growth in Option EPS being reported diluted earnings per share as adjusted for one-off items agreed by the Companys Remuneration Committee between 2004 and 2007.
At the start of 2007 forecast Option EPS for the year was such that the Group thought it improbable that these 2005 awards would vest in 2008: rather it was thought that the awards would vest, based upon service conditions, in 2015.
Since then, business performance has improved over the course of the year particularly in the fourth quarter in which the business generated $144 million of additional net income over the same period in 2006, equivalent to 209% growth for the fourth quarter.
This strong performance in 2007 enabled the Remuneration Committee to conclude that the 2005 awards vested in 2008.
Accordingly the compensation charge for these awards based on the revised grant date fair value, was accrued over the three-year vesting period to 2008 rather than the ten-year period to 2015.
The catch-up charge has been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007 split $2.1 million to Cost of product sales, $4.6 million to R&D and $22.5 million to SG&A.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 23 23 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review IPR&D On April 19, 2007 Shire completed its acquisition of New River by way of a short-form merger, in an all-cash transaction.
The acquisition of New River allows Shire to capture the full economic value of VYVANSE, and gain control of the future development and commercialization of this product.
During the year to December 31, 2007 Shire expensed the portion of the New River purchase price allocated to IPR&D of $1,866.4 million.
This amount represents the value of those acquired development projects which, at the acquisition date, had not been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, specifically VYVANSE indicated for ADHD in non-pediatric patients in the US $1,786.8 million and VYVANSE in ROW $79.6 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2007 the Group reduced the values ascribed to intangible assets by $17.4 million and IPR&D by $29.7 million from amounts previously assigned in the preliminary purchase price allocation as a result of changes to preliminary estimates of deferred taxes in the purchase price allocation exercise.
On the acquisition date, VYVANSE had only achieved regulatory approval for use in pediatric patients in the US.
On June 29, 2007 Shire submitted a Supplement New Drug Application sNDA to the FDA for VYVANSE for the treatment of ADHD in adults in the US.
On April 23, 2008 Shire announced that the FDA had approved the adult indication for VYVANSE, and Shire launched VYVANSE for adult ADHD in the US in June 2008.
At December 31, 2007, management estimated that future R&D costs until regulatory approval for VYVANSE for ADHD in non-pediatric patients in the US are approximately $35 to $45 million.
This estimate can be affected by various factors and is, in part, based on managements estimate and assumptions.
On the acquisition date VYVANSE in ROW had not received regulatory approval.
Planning is underway for submission of VYVANSE for the ROW.
Management estimates that material net cash inflows would be anticipated one to two years after the approval and at December 31, 2007 management estimated that future R&D costs until regulatory approval for VYVANSE for ADHD in ROW are approximately $35 to $45 million.
The Group considers that these IPR&D assets have no alternative future use outside their current development projects and these assets have therefore been charged to expense in the consolidated statement of operations as of the acquisition date in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation FIN No.

Gain on sale of product rights For the year to December 31, 2007 Shire recognized gains of $127.8 million on the sale of non-core products.
Shire received $209.6 million net of $2.2 million of costs associated with the transfer of product rights from Almirall for a portfolio of non-core products comprising the dermatology products SOLARAZE and VANIQA and six non-promoted products across a range of indications, which were sold by Shire primarily in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Ireland.
This sale realized a total gain of $139.2 million, of which $114.8 million was recognized during Q4 2007.
The remaining deferred gain of $24.4 million will be recognized after the transfer of the relevant consents.
Shire received $24.8 million on the sale of other non-core products, realizing a total gain of $17.2 million, of which $13.0 million was recognized during 2007.
The remaining deferred gain of $4.2 million relating to these disposals will be recognized on the transfer of marketing authorizations.
During the year to December 31, 2006 Shire recognized a gain of $63.0 million on the disposal of ADDERALL to Duramed.
Integration costs For the year to December 31, 2007 Shire incurred $1.3 million of costs associated with the integration of the New River business 2006: $5.6 million relating to the TKT acquisition.
New River is now fully integrated and no further integration costs are anticipated.
Interest income For the year to December 31, 2007 Shire received interest income of $50.6 million 2006: $50.5 million.
Interest income primarily relates to interest received on cash balances.
Included in 2006 was interest of $6.5 million received from IDB Biomedical Inc. IDB on repayment of injectable flu development drawings arising on the disposal of the vaccines business in 2004.
Excluding this one-off item, interest income in 2007 is higher than in 2006 due to slightly higher average cash balances and higher average US dollar interest rates.
Interest expense For the year to December 31, 2007 Shire incurred interest expense of $70.8 million 2006: $26.4 million.
The increase in interest expense follows the acquisition of New River in April 2007 which was partly funded by $1.3 billion of term loans, utilized under the $2.3 billion Multi-currency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement.
These term loans were subsequently partially repaid using the proceeds from Shires $1.1 billion 2.75% Convertible Bond issued in May 2007.
The remaining $200 million of the term loans was also repaid during June 2007.
Interest expense for the year to December 31, 2007 includes a $7.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs following the repayment of these term loans.
In the years to December 31, 2007 and 2006 interest expense included a provision for interest 2007: $28.0 million: 2006: $24.6 million which had been accrued based on a reasonable estimate that may be awarded by the Court to those former TKT shareholders who requested appraisal.

Income taxes The effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2007 was 4.0% 2006: 26.8%.
Excluding the IPR&D charge of $1,866.4 million which is not tax deductible, the effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2007 has reduced by 14.9% to 11.9% compared to the year to December 31, 2006 as a result of an increase in favorable permanent differences of $32.8 million compared to the same period in 2006 including the tax effect of Shire plcs 2.75% Convertible Bonds, an increase in R&D tax credits, and the tax effect of the gain on disposal of product rights and a net reduction in valuation allowances of $4.7 million 2006: $125.5 million, partially offset by an increase in the provision for uncertain tax benefits and associated interest and penalties of $38.1 million 2006: an increase in tax contingencies of $187 million.
Equity in earnings losses of equity method investees Net earnings of equity method investees of $1.8 million were recorded for the year to December 31, 2007 2006: $5.7 million.
This comprised earnings of $6.5 million from the 50% share of the anti-viral commercialization partnership with GSK in Canada 2006: $6.2 million, offset by losses of $4.7 million being the Groups share of losses in the GeneChem, AgeChem and EGS Healthcare Funds 2006: losses of $0.5 million.
Liquidity and capital resources General The Groups funding requirements depend on a number of factors, including the timing and number of its development programs: corporate, business and product acquisitions: the level of resources required for the expansion of manufacturing and marketing capabilities as the product base expands: increases in accounts receivable and inventory which may arise with any increase in product sales: competitive and technological developments: the timing and cost of obtaining required regulatory approvals for new products: the timing and quantum of milestone payments on collaborative projects: the timing and quantum of tax and dividend payments: the timing and quantum of purchases by the Employee Share Ownership Trust, ESOT of Shire shares in the market to satisfy option exercises and the continuing cash generated from sales of Shires key products.
An important part of Shires business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available.
Shire intends to defend its intellectual property and as a result may need cash for funding the cost of litigation.
The Group finances its activities through cash generated from operating activities: credit facilities: private and public offerings of equity and debt securities: and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals.
Shires robust balance sheet includes $218.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008.
We generated $800.1 million of cash from operating activities during the year.
Shire has no debt maturing in the next three years and substantially all of Shires debt relates to its $1.1 billion 2.75% Convertible Bonds which mature in 2014, although these include a put option which could require repayment in 2012.
In addition, Shire has a committed facility until 2012 of $1.2 billion, which is currently undrawn.
However, the current financial situation which is affecting the banking system and financial markets, together with the current uncertainty in global economic conditions, have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets and a low level of liquidity in many financial markets.
As a result, the Group may not be able to access new equity or debt finance at the same level or cost as it has done previously.
Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 On May 9, 2007 Shire plc issued $1,100 million in principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 and convertible into fully paid Ordinary Shares of Shire plc of par value 0.05 each.
The net proceeds of issuing the Bonds, after deducting the commissions and other direct costs of issue, totaled $1,081.7 million.
The Bonds were issued at 100% of their principal amount, and unless previously purchased and canceled, redeemed or converted, will be redeemed on May 9, 2014 the Final Maturity Date at their principal amount.
The Bonds bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on November 9 and May 9.
The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Group, and rank pari passu and rateably, without any preference amongst themselves, and equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Group.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 25 25 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review The Bonds may be redeemed at the option of the Company the Call Option at their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest if: i at any time after May 23, 2012 if on no less than 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days the value of Shire plcs Ordinary Shares underlying each Bond in the principal amount of $100,000 would exceed $130,000: or ii at any time conversion rights shall have been exercised, and or purchases and corresponding cancelations, and or redemptions effected in respect of 85% or more in principal amount of Bonds originally issued.
The Bonds may also be redeemed at the option of the Bond-holder at their principal amount including accrued but unpaid interest on May 9, 2012 the Put Option, or following the occurrence of change of control.
The Bonds are repayable in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the Company to settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the Final Maturity Date and following exercise of the Put Option, by delivery of the underlying Shire plc Ordinary Shares and a cash top-up amount.
The Bonds are convertible into Shire plc Ordinary Shares during the conversion period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier of: i the close of business on the date falling 14 days prior to the Final Maturity Date: ii if the Bonds have been called for redemption by the Company, the close of business 14 days before the date fixed for redemption: iii the close of business on the day prior to a Bond-holder giving notice of redemption in accordance with the conditions: and iv the giving of notice by the trustee that the Bonds are accelerated by reason of the occurrence of an event of default.
Upon conversion, the Bond-holder is entitled to receive Shire plc Ordinary Shares at the initial conversion price of $33.5879 per Shire plc Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment as outlined below, being 2,977.26265 shares per $100,000 denomination.
The initial conversion price is subject to adjustment in respect of i any dividend or distribution by the Company, ii a change of control and iii customary anti-dilution adjustments for, inter alia, share consolidations, share splits, spin-off events, rights issues, bonus issues and re-organizations.
The shares issued on conversion will be delivered credited as fully paid, and will rank pari passu in all respects with all fully paid shares in issue on the relevant conversion date.
Direct costs of issue of the Bonds paid in the year to December 31, 2007 totaled $18.3 million.
These costs are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the five-year period to the Put Option date.
At December 31, 2008 $12.6 million of these costs remained deferred $3.8 million within other current assets and $8.8 million within other non-current assets.
In May 2008, pursuant to a court sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement, Shire Limited now known as Shire plc replaced Shire plc the former holding company of the Shire Group, Old Shire as the holding company of Shire and its subsidiaries.
Immediately prior to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective, Shire Limited was substituted for Old Shire as the principal obligor under the Bonds, and the terms and conditions of the Bonds accordingly amended.
In connection with the Scheme of Arrangement the following documents were entered into: i a supplemental trust deed dated April 15, 2008 between Old Shire, Shire plc and BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited as Trustee the Supplemental Trust Deed relating to a trust deed dated May 9, 2007 the Trust Deed constituting the US $1,100,000,000 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 the Convertible Bonds originally issued by Shire: and ii an accession and amendment agreement dated April 15, 2008 between Shire plc, Old Shire, BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited as Trustee and The Bank of New York as Paying and Conversion Agent the Accession and Amendment Agreement relating to a paying and conversion agency agreement dated May 9, 2007 the Agency Agreement between Old Shire, BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited as Trustee and The Bank of New York as Paying and Conversion Agent.
As a result of amendments to the Trust Deed, effected pursuant to the Supplemental Trust Deed, and to the Agency Agreement, effected pursuant to the Accession and Amendment Agreement, in connection with the Scheme, Shire plc was substituted in place of Old Shire as principal obligor under, and issuer of, the Convertible Bonds, and Shire plc acceded to, and assumed all Old Shire obligations under, the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement.
Old Shire ceased to be a party to the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement.
The Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds were amended and re-stated in order to, among other things, provide that the Convertible Bonds will, following the substitution, be convertible into Ordinary Shares of Shire plc.
Multi-currency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement In connection with the acquisition of New River, Shire plc entered into a Multi-currency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement the Facilities Agreement with ABN AMRO Bank N. V. Barclays Capital, Citigroup Global Markets Limited and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc the Arrangers on February 20, 2007.
The Facilities Agreement comprised three credit facilities: i a committed multi-currency five-year term loan facility in an aggregate amount of $1,000 million Term Loan A, ii a committed multi-currency 364 day term with a further 364 day extension option loan facility in an aggregate amount of $300 million Term Loan B and iii a committed five-year revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount of $1,000 million the RCF and, together with Term Loan A and Term Loan B, the Facilities.
Shire plc has agreed to act as guarantor for any of its subsidiaries that borrow under the Facilities Agreement.
On April 18, 2007 the Group fully utilized Term Loan A of $1,000 million and Term Loan B of $300 million to partially fund the acquisition of New River.
In May 2007 Shire issued $1,100 million principal amount of the Bonds.
The proceeds of the issue were used to repay and cancel $800 million of Term Loan A and all of Term Loan B in accordance with the terms of the Facilities Agreement.
The remaining $200 million drawn down under Term Loan A was repaid on June 29, 2007.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 26 26 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review On July 19, 2007, the Group entered into a syndication and amendment agreement in relation to the Facilities Agreement the Amended Facilities Agreement, which increased the RCF to an aggregate amount of $1,200 million, amended the covenant relating to the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA and syndicated the RCF between the banks with the following commitments: ABN Amro Bank N. V. $200 million : Barclays Capital, $200 million : Citigroup Global Markets Limited, $200 million : The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, $200 million : Lloyds TSB Bank plc, $200 million : Bank of America N. A.
$100 million : and Morgan Stanley Bank $100 million.
The RCF, which includes a $250 million swingline facility, may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on February 20, 2012.
The availability of loans under the RCF is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of any defaults thereunder and the accuracy in all material respects of Shires representations and warranties contained therein.
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the RCF for each interest period, as determined by the Group, is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin ranging from 0.40 to 0.80% per annum, depending on the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA for the preceding period and LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period.
Shire also pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35% per annum of the applicable margin.
The Amended Facilities Agreement includes requirements that i Shires ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as defined in the Amended Facilities Agreement does not exceed 3.5 to 1 for either the twelve-month period ending December 31 or June 30 unless Shire has exercised its option which is subject to certain conditions to increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive testing dates: and ii that the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest as defined in the Facilities Agreement must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for either the twelve month period ending December 31 or June 30, and iii additional limitations on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness, making of loans, giving of guarantees and granting security over assets.
Upon a change of control of Shire or upon the occurrence of an event of default and the expiration of any applicable cure period, the total commitments under the Facilities may be canceled and or all or part of the loans, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding may become immediately due and payable.
Events of default under the Amended Facilities Agreement include: i non-payment of any amounts due under the Facilities: ii failure to satisfy any financial covenants: iii material misrepresentation in any of the finance documents: iv failure to pay, or certain other defaults under other financial indebtedness: v certain insolvency events or proceedings: vi material adverse changes in the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the group: vii certain US Employee Retirement Income Security Act breaches which would have a material adverse effect: viii if it becomes illegal for Shire or any of its subsidiaries that are parties to the Amended Facility Agreement to perform their obligations or ix if Shire or any subsidiary of Shire which is party to the Amended Facility Agreement repudiates the Amended Facility Agreement or any Finance Document as defined in the Amended Facility Agreement.
In connection with the Scheme of Arrangement, with effect from May 23, 2008, Old Shire entered into an accession and amendment deed dated April 15, 2008 between Shire plc formerly Shire Limited, Old Shire, certain subsidiaries of Shire plc and Barclays Bank plc as Facility Agent the Accession and Amendment Deed relating to the Amended Facilities Agreement.
The following is a description of the material amendments to the Amended Facilities Agreement, affected pursuant to the Accession and Amendment Deed, which took effect on May 23, 2008, immediately prior to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective.
Shire plc acceded to the Facility Agreement as a borrower and guarantor, and Shire Holdings UK Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Old Shire, acceded to the Facility Agreement as a borrower.
Old Shire ceased to be a party to the Facility Agreement as a guarantor although it remains a party to the Facility Agreement as a borrower.
The Amended Facilities Agreement was amended and re-stated in order to take account of the fact that Shire plc is incorporated in Jersey and tax resident in the Republic of Ireland, to exclude the Scheme of Arrangement between Shire plc and its shareholders from the mandatory prepayment provisions contained in the Amended Facilities Agreement, and amend the financial covenants contained in the Amended Facilities Agreement in order to ensure that if any amount of interest awarded in the TKT appraisal rights litigation differs from that provided for in Shires accounts, any excess or shortfall would be treated as if it had been provided for on a pro-rata basis in accounting periods up to the time of judgment.
This amendment was made to avoid a technical breach of the Amended Facilities Agreement in the accounting period in which the any judgment occurs.
During the year ended December 31, 2007 the Group paid $14.5 million for the arrangement of the Facilities of which $1.2 million has been amortized in the year to December 31, 2008 $9.4 million amortized in the year to December 31, 2007.
Arrangement costs of $3.9 million, which relate to the RCF, remain deferred at December 31, 2008 and are being amortized over the estimated term of the facility $1.2 million within other current assets and $2.7 million within other non-current assets.
On November 7, 2008 Shire utilized $190.0 million of the facility to part fund the TKT appraisal rights litigation settlement.
The loan was repaid in full prior to December 31, 2008.

Cash flow from operating activities increased by $325.4 million to $800.1 million 2007: $474.7 million.
The increased cash flow from operating activities resulted from higher revenues and cash collection in 2008 over 2007, together with cash inflows from forward foreign exchange contracts in 2008.
These cash inflows were partially offset by interest payments to the TKT dissenting shareholders $147.6 million, cash paid to Zymenex for METAZYM $135.0 million and higher cash tax payments in 2008 over 2007.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to December 31, 2007 was $474.7 million resulting from a net loss of $1,451.8 million, non-cash items not affecting 2007 operating cash flows of $1,962.8 million predominately the IPR&D charge of $1,866.4 million and an increase in working capital of $36.3 million.

During the year to December 31, 2008 the Group additionally drew down $190.0 million of its revolving credit facility to part fund the TKT appraisal rights settlement this amount was subsequently repaid during the period.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,623.0 million for the year to December 31, 2007.
On April 18, 2007 the Group fully utilized Term Loan A of $1,000 million and Term Loan B of $300 million to partially fund the acquisition of New River, which, as described above, have subsequently been repaid in 2007.
Shire incurred $14.5 million of arrangement costs in respect of these facilities in the year to December 31, 2007.
In May 2007 Shire issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014.

The contractual obligations table above does not include payments yet to fall due upon the occurrence of certain milestones and other contractual commitments.
The most significant payments are as follows: i Alba Therapeutics Corporation Alba On December 14, 2007 Shire acquired worldwide rights to SPD550 also known as AT-1001, in markets outside of the US and Japan, from Alba.
SPD550 is Albas lead inhibitor of barrier dysfunction in various gastrointestinal disorders that is currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of Celiac disease.
Shire paid an upfront payment of $25 million expensed as R&D in 2007 and will pay further development and sales milestones up to a maximum of $300 million.
Shire will also pay tiered royalties on net sales of the product.
Tiered royalty rates will be single or double digit dependent on annual net sales.
Alba and Shire have formed a joint development committee to monitor R&D activities of SPD550.
Alba will fund all development until SPD550 has completed Proof of Concept, which is expected to be in the first half of 2009, after which Shire and Alba will share equally development costs under a joint development plan.
ii Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. Amicus On November 7, 2007 Shire licensed from Amicus the rights to three pharmacological chaperone compounds in markets outside of the US: AMIGAL for Fabry disease Phase 2, PLICERA for Gaucher disease Phase 2 and AT2220 for Pompe disease Phase 2.
Shire paid Amicus an upfront license fee of $50 million expensed as R&D in 2007, and will pay further development and sales-based milestones to a maximum of $390 million.
Shire will also pay tiered, double digit, royalties on net sales of the products.
Shire and Amicus will pursue a joint development program toward market approval in the US and Europe: expenses for this program will be shared equally.
iii JUVISTA On June 19, 2007 Shire signed an agreement with Renovo to develop and commercialize JUVISTA, Renovos novel drug candidate being investigated for the reduction of scarring in connection with surgery.

7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 29 29 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review iv Womens Health Products In August 2006, Shire and Duramed an affiliate of Barr entered into an agreement related to SEASONIQUE, a number of products using Durameds transvaginal ring technology and other oral products the Collaboration Products.
Under this agreement, Shire was required to re-imburse Duramed for US development expenses incurred in respect of the Collaboration Products up to a maximum of $140 million over eight years from September 2006, and Shire had the right to commercialize these products in a number of markets outside of North America, including the larger European markets.
US development expenses re-imbursed in the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $30.0 million, and at December 31, 2008 the maximum future re-imbursement for Duramed incurred US development expenditures was $95.6 million.
Shire also agreed to re-imburse Duramed for incurred US development expenditures in 2009 up to a maximum of $30.0 million.
In addition, Shire agreed to a one-time payment to Duramed of $10.0 million and to forego royalties receivable from Barr and cost of goods otherwise payable by Barr to Shire in 2009 under the License Agreement between the parties for the supply of the authorized generic of ADDERALL XR up to a maximum of $25.0 million.
v EQUASYM IR and XL On February 20, 2009, Shire announced that it has signed an agreement with UCB to acquire the worldwide rights excluding the USA, Canada and Barbados to EQUASYM IR and XL methylphenidate hydrochloride used for the treatment of ADHD.

vi Other R&D and sales milestones In addition to the commitments set out in i to iv, at December 31, 2008 the Group had commitments payable on achievement of specified milestones and fees payable for products under development in-licensed from third-parties of $1.0 million 2007: $5.3 million.
vii Capital commitments At December 31, 2008, the Group has committed to spend $95.4 million in respect of capital projects, including commitments for the expansion and improvements to office space at the Basingstoke UK headquarters and improvements to laboratory and office space leased by the HGT business at Lexington, Massachusetts which is expected to be all payable in 2009. Business risk management The Group has adopted a risk management strategy designed to identify, assess and manage the significant risks that it faces.
While the Group aims to identify and manage such risks, no risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss.
Set out below are the key risk factors, associated with the business, that have been identified through the Groups approach to risk management.
Some of these risk factors are specific to the Group, and others are more generally applicable to the pharmaceutical industry in which the Group operates.
The Group considers that these risk factors apply equally and therefore all should be carefully considered before any investment is made in Shire.
Risk factors related to the Groups business The Groups new products may not be a commercial success Shire has launched a number of new products in the last four years, including key new products ELAPRASE, VYVANSE, LIALDA, FIRAZYR and FOSRENOL ROW.
The commercial success of these new products, as well as other new products that the Group may launch in the future, will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians, patients and other key decision-makers, as well as the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals, the scope of marketing approvals as reflected in the products label, the countries in which such approvals are obtained, the authorization of price and re-imbursement in those countries where price and re-imbursement is negotiated, and safety, efficacy, convenience and costeffectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products.
The Group may not be able to grow revenues in its new products as quickly as anticipated if any or all of the following occur: if competitive products are genericized and the impact on the market negatively affects the prescribing of branded treatments for the indications that the Groups new products treat: if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the Groups new products not seen in clinical trials that impact the physicians willingness to prescribe the Groups new products: if issues arise from clinical trials being conducted for post-marketing purposes or for registration in another country or regulatory agencies in one country act in a way that causes concern for prescribers or patients in another country: if patients, payors or physicians favor older treatments over newer treatments: if government regulation is stricter for the Groups new products than for existing treatments: if the new products suffer a loss of patent protection or competitors successfully challenge or circumvent the Groups patents or regulatory exclusivity See Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements for details of current patent litigation : if planned geographical expansion into emerging markets is not successful: or if the size of the patient population for the new product is less than expected or the Group fails to identify new patients for the new products.
If the Group is unable to commercialize ELAPRASE, VYVANSE, LIALDA, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL ROW or any of its new products successfully, there may be a material adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 30 30 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review Any decrease in the combined sales of VYVANSE and ADDERALL XR will significantly reduce revenues and earnings In 2008, the combined sales of VYVANSE and ADDERALL XR were $1,420.6 million, representing approximately 47% of the Groups total revenues.
Sales of ADDERALL XR are expected to decrease significantly due to generic competition that is anticipated to commence on April 1, 2009.
Any factors that decrease the sales of ADDERALL XR more significantly than expected could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the entrance of generic competitors for ADDERALL XR or other leading ADHD medications could impact the sales of VYVANSE.
Other factors that could impact the sales of VYVANSE or ADDERALL XR include, but are not limited to: faster than anticipated erosion of ADDERALL XR sales by generic competitors: the development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals to VYVANSE and ADDERALL XR: issues impacting the production of VYVANSE or ADDERALL XR or the supply of amphetamine salts including but not limited to the ability to get sufficient quota from the US Drug Enforcement Agency DEA : technological advances including the approval of new competing products for ADHD treatments : changes in re-imbursement policies of third-party payers: government action intervention: marketing or pricing actions by competitors: public opinion towards ADHD treatments: any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention: product liability claims: and changes in prescription-writing practices.
Any decrease in the sales of 3TC could significantly reduce earnings The Group receives royalties from GSK on the worldwide sales of 3TC.
In 2008, the Groups royalty income relating to 3TC sales was $140.2 million 2007: $145.3 million: 2006: $150.9 million.
This royalty income stream generates a larger proportion of net income relative to the Groups own product sales as there are minimal costs associated with its generation.
Any factors that decrease sales of 3TC by GSK could significantly reduce the Groups earnings.
These include: development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals, including generic versions: loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents see Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements for details of current patent litigation : reduction in the production of 3TC: technological advances: government action intervention: marketing or pricing actions by GSKs competitors: any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention: public opinion towards AIDS treatments: and product liability claims.
The failure to obtain and maintain re-imbursement, or an adequate level of re-imbursement, by third-party payers in a timely manner for certain of the Groups products and parallel importation may impact future revenues and earnings The Groups revenues are partly dependent on the level of re-imbursement provided to the Group by governmental re-imbursement schemes for pharmaceutical products.
Changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the Groups sales, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the cost of treatment established by healthcare providers, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations are under downward pressure and this, in turn, could impact on the prices at which the Group can sell its products.
The market for pharmaceutical products could be significantly influenced by the following, which could result in lower prices for the Groups products and or a reduced demand for the Groups products: the ongoing trend toward managed healthcare, particularly in the US: legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs in many of the Groups markets: and price controls and non-re-imbursement of new and highly-priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established.
The prices for certain of the Groups products when commercialized, in particular products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases such as REPLAGAL and ELAPRASE, may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products.
The Group may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and re-imbursement for its products, including those that are likely to have a high annual cost of therapy.
The failure to obtain and maintain pricing and re-imbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect revenues and earnings.
Parallel importation occurs when an importer finds a cheaper price for a product or equivalent product on the world market and imports that product from the lower price jurisdiction to the higher price jurisdiction.
If the parallel importation of lower priced drugs is permitted in the US, it could have the effect of reducing sales of equivalent drugs in the US.
To the extent that parallel importation increases, the Group may receive less revenue and earnings from its commercialized products.
The parallel importation of prescription drugs is relatively common within the EU.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 31 31 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review A disruption to the product supply chain may result in the Group being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the Group being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis The Group sources its products from third-party contract manufacturers, and for certain products has its own manufacturing capability.
In the event of either the Groups failure or the failure of any third-party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards often referred to as Current Good Manufacturing Standards or cGMP in the countries in which the Group intends to sell or have its products sold, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
The Group dual-sources certain key products and or active ingredients.
However, the Group currently relies on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of DAYTRANA, FIRAZYR, LIALDA, PENTASA, REMINYL and XAGRID and relies on a single active ingredient source for each of ELAPRASE, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, REMINYL, REPLAGAL and XAGRID.
In the event of financial failure of a third-party contract manufacturer, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
This could have a material adverse affect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
There is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms, or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements.
The Group is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements The development and approval of the Groups products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities.
As the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications, regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the marketing approval.
The need to qualify a new supplier could delay the Groups development and commercialization efforts.
The Group uses bovine-derived serum sourced from New Zealand and North America in the manufacturing processes for REPLAGAL and ELAPRASE.
The discovery of additional cattle in North America or the discovery of cattle in New Zealand with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on these products, or prohibit the Group from using these products at all in such countries.
The actions of certain customers can affect the Groups ability to sell or market products profitably, as well as impact net sales and growth comparisons A small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the US and European markets.
In 2008, for example, approximately 56% of the Groups product sales were attributable to two customers: McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc.
In the event of financial failure of any of these customers, the Group may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues and earnings.
In addition, the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred.
Consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels, or otherwise reduce purchases of the Groups products.
Such actions could have an adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
A significant portion of the Groups Specialty Pharmaceuticals product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the US and Europe.
Consequently, product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers.
These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions, or other factors.
In addition, a significant portion of the Groups revenues for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are concentrated with a small number of customers.
Changes in the buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
The outsourcing of services can create a significant dependency on third-parties, the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate the Groups business and to develop and market products The Group has entered into many agreements with third-parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business.
If the third-party can no longer provide the service on the agreed basis, the Group may not be able to continue the development or commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis.
Additionally, it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships with the suppliers.
The Group has also entered into licensing and co-development agreements with a number of parties.
There is a risk that, upon expiration or termination of a third-party agreement, the Group may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third-party as commercial interests may no longer coincide.
In such circumstances, the Group may be unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and could be required to abandon or divest a product line.
In the event of breakdown, failure or breach of security on any of the Groups IT systems, the Group may be unable to maintain its business operations The Group operates several complex information systems upon which it is dependent.
The Group has back-up procedures and disaster recovery plans in place to enable the business to continue its normal operations and to mitigate any loss in the event of a failure.
However, in the event of breakdown, failure or breach of security of any of these systems or the associated suppliers, the Group may be unable to maintain its business operations.
This could lead to loss of revenue and delay in product development.
In addition, the Group is in the process of installing enterprise-wide information systems in its operations throughout the world.
Any failure in the operation of these systems could have an adverse effect on the Groups business operations.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 32 32 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review The Group may incur unexpected expenditure in order to comply with US environmental laws The Groups manufacturing sites are situated in the US and are subject to national, state and local environmental laws.
Compliance with environmental laws requires ongoing expenditure and any spillage or contamination found to be caused by the Group may result in clean up costs and financial penalties for the Group which could adversely affect the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
Contracts are used in all areas of operation of the business.
They may contain provisions that do not protect the Groups position or with which it cannot comply Contracts form the basis of agreement in many key activities such as mergers and acquisitions, arrangements with suppliers, outsourcing, product licensing and marketing.
These contracts may contain provisions that impose duties on the parties involved or may fail to contain adequate conditions to protect the Groups position.
The Group may be unable to meet its obligations under a contract or may be unable to require other parties to comply with their obligations and, therefore, may suffer financial loss or penalty.
Risk factors related to the pharmaceutical industry in general The actions of governments, industry regulators and the economic environments in which the Group operates may adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products profitably Changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry, in any country in which the Group conducts its business, may adversely impact the Groups sales, financial condition and results of operations.
In particular, changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation.
Changes in the general economic conditions in any of the Groups major markets may also affect the Groups sales, financial condition and results of operations.
The introduction of new products by competitors may impact future revenues The manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive.
Many of the Groups competitors are large, well-known pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources.
Companies with more resources and larger R&D expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications.
They may also be more successful than the Group in acquiring or licensing new products for development and commercialization.
If any product that competes with one of the Groups principal drugs is approved, the Groups sales of that drug could fall.
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change.
The Groups products could, therefore, be rendered obsolete or uneconomic, through the development of new products, technological advances in manufacturing or production by its competitors.
If the Groups projects or clinical trials for the development of products are unsuccessful, its products will not receive authorization for manufacture and sale Due to the complexity of the formulation and development of pharmaceuticals, the Group cannot be certain that it or its collaborative partners will successfully complete the development of new products, or, if successful, that such products will be commercially viable.
Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development, the Group or its collaborative partners must demonstrate through clinical and other studies that the product is of appropriate quality and is safe and effective for the claimed use.
Clinical trials of any product under development may not demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy required to result in an approvable or a marketable product.
Failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product.
In addition, regulatory authorities in Europe, the US, Canada and other countries may require additional studies, which could result in a increased costs and significant development delays, or b termination of a project if it would no longer be economically viable.
The completion rate of clinical trials is dependent upon, among other factors, obtaining adequate clinical supplies and recruiting patients.
Delays in patient enrolment in clinical trials may also result in increased costs and program delays.
Additional delays can occur in instances in which the Group shares control over the planning and execution of product development with collaborative partners.
The Group cannot be certain that, if clinical trials are completed, either the Group or its collaborative partners will file for, or receive, required authorizations to manufacture and or market potential products including a marketing authorization application or ANDA or that such application will be reviewed and approved by the regulatory authorities in a timely manner, if at all.
If the Group is unable to meet the requirements of regulators in relation to a particular product, it may be unable to develop the product or obtain or retain the necessary marketing approvals Drug companies are required to obtain regulatory approval before manufacturing and marketing most drug products.
Regulatory approval is generally based on the results of: quality testing chemistry, manufacturing and controls : non-clinical testing: and clinical testing.
The clinical development, manufacture, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive regulation, including separate regulation by each member state of the EU, the EMEA itself and federal, state and local regulation in the US.
Unanticipated legislative and other regulatory actions and developments concerning various aspects of the Groups operations and products may restrict its ability to sell one or more of its products or to sell those products at a profit.
The generation of data is regulated and any generated data is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
Required regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all.
In addition, other regulatory requirements for any such proposed products may not be met.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 33 33 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review Even if the Group obtains regulatory approvals, the terms of any product approval, including labeling, may be more restrictive than desired and could affect the marketability of its products.
Regulatory authorities also have the power amongst other things, to: revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products: require the recall of products that fail to meet regulatory requirements: and close manufacturing plants that do not operate in conformity with cGMP and or other regulatory requirements or approvals.
Such delays or actions could affect the Groups ability to manufacture and sell its products.
The failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue The Group enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing.
In these partnerships, the Group is dependent on its partner to deliver results.
While these partnerships are supported by contracts, the Group does not exercise direct control.
If a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties, the Group may suffer a delay in the development, a delay in the approval or a reduction in sales or royalties of a product.
The failure to secure new products or compounds for development, either through in-licensing, acquisition or internal research and development efforts, may have an adverse impact on the Groups future results The Groups future results will depend, to a significant extent, upon its ability to in-license, acquire or develop new products or compounds.
The Group also expends significant resources on research and development.
The failure to in-license or acquire new products or compounds, on a commercially viable basis, could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
The failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
The Group may fail to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business The Groups success depends upon its ability and the ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights.
Where possible, the Groups strategy is to register intellectual property rights, such as patents and trademarks.
The Group also relies variously on trade secrets, un-patented know-how and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third-parties to maintain its competitive position.
Patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the Group have been granted, or are pending in various countries, including the US, Canada, major European countries and Japan.
The Group intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the Group.
However, patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the Groups products or technologies or processes for formulating or manufacturing similar or functionally equivalent products.
The Groups patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn.
The Group cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third-party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to protect the Groups products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by third-parties.
In the regular course of business, the Group is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.
See Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements for details of current patent litigation.
Additionally, the Groups products, or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may now, or in the future, infringe the patent rights of third-parties.
It is also possible that third-parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or sale of the Groups products.
If third-parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology, it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the Group or its strategic partners from developing, manufacturing or selling its products.
The Group may need to obtain licenses for intellectual property rights from others to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
In addition, any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable.
The Group also relies on trade secrets and other un-patented proprietary information, which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors and partners.
These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the Group with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
If the Groups employees, scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the Groups products under development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the Groups property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers.
Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the Groups proprietary rights.
The failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection, for any reason, could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the Groups product sales.
The Group has filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with its products in various countries including the US and countries in Europe and Latin America and intends to trademark new product names as new products are developed.
In addition, with respect to certain products, the Group relies on the trademarks of third-parties.
These trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the Group or the third-parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks.
The Groups inability or the inability of these third-parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third-party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the Groups trademarks and dilute their value.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 34 34 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Financial review If a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side-effects, this could result in damage to the Groups reputation, the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the Group Unanticipated side-effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of the Groups products, or those of its competitors, could have an adverse effect on the Groups ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products.
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims, product recalls, litigation and associated adverse publicity.
The cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited.
A successful product liability claim against the Group could require the Group to pay a substantial monetary award.
If, in the absence of adequate insurance coverage, the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defense of such a claim, it could become insolvent.
Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms.
Although the Group carries product liability insurance, this coverage may not be adequate.
In addition, it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will be available.
Moreover, an adverse judgment in a product liability suit, even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal, could generate substantial negative publicity about the Groups products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products.
Investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to the Groups activities in the highly-regulated markets in which it operates may result in the distraction of senior management, significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines The Group engages in various marketing, promotional and educational activities pertaining to, as well as the sale of, pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly-regulated and the operations of market participants, such as the Group, are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the FDA, the US Department of Justice and the DEA in the US.
Any inquiries or investigations into the operations of, or enforcement or other regulatory action against, the Group by such regulatory authorities could result in the distraction of senior management for prolonged periods of time, significant defense costs and substantial monetary penalties.
Loss of highly-qualified management and scientific personnel could cause the Group subsequent financial loss The Group faces intense competition for highly-qualified management and scientific personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
It may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel.
The Group has agreements with a number of its key scientific and management personnel for periods of one year or less.
The loss of such personnel, or the inability to attract and retain the additional, highly-skilled employees required for its activities could have an adverse effect on the Groups business.
Treasury policies and organization The Groups principal treasury operations are co-ordinated by its corporate treasury function, which is based in the UK.
All treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by the Board.
As a matter of policy, the Group does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange swaps on which interest is at floating rate.
This exposure is primarily to US dollar and Euro interest rates.
As the Group maintains all of its investments and foreign exchange swaps on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed.
In the year to December 31, 2008 the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was approximately 3% per annum.
The largest proportion of investments was in US dollar money market and liquidity funds.
At December 31, 2008 the Group had debt totaling $1,145.6 million outstanding, comprising Shire plcs $1,100 million in principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Bonds, due 2014 which were issued in May 2007 and $45.6 million of building financing obligations.
The Group incurs interest at a fixed rate on both the Convertible Bonds and on the building financing obligation.
No derivative instruments have been entered into to manage interest rate exposure by February 20, 2009.
The Group continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place to manage the risk.
Foreign exchange risk The Group trades in numerous countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.
The main trading currencies of the Group are the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, Pound sterling and the Euro.
It is the Groups policy that these exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the subsidiarys functional currency.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation into US dollars of the balance sheet and income statement of non-US dollar functional subsidiaries.
These foreign exchange exposures are generally managed through natural hedging via the currency denomination of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The consolidated financial statements of foreign entities are translated using the accounting policies described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2008, the Group had swap and forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding to manage the currency risk associated with intercompany loans.
At December 31, 2008 the fair value of these contracts was a liability of $44.2 million.
Further details are included below.

The investment in public quoted companies and equity investment funds are exposed to market risk.
No financial instruments or derivatives have been employed to hedge this risk.
Credit risk Cash is invested in short-term money market instruments, including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits.
The money market and liquidity funds in which Shire invests are all triple A rated by both Standard and Poors and by Moodys credit rating agencies and the US onshore funds participate in the US Treasury Departments Temporary Guarantee Program.
The Group is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative contracts.
The Group limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which require counterparties to have a long-term credit rating of A A1 or better from the major rating agencies.
The internal credit limits are approved by the Board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury function.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts are major international financial institutions.
The Group has entered into many agreements with third-parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business.
Off-balance sheet arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Groups financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Inflation Although at reduced levels in recent years, inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business.
However, the Group believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years.
Dividend policy A first interim dividend for the first half of 2008 of 2.15 US 1.08 pence per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 6.44 US per ADS, was paid in October 2008.
The Board has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 7.76 US 5.47 pence per Ordinary Share equivalent to 23.28 US per ADS for the six months to December 31, 2008.
A first interim dividend for the first half of 2007 of 2.15 US 1.05 pence per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 6.44 US per ADS and 6.72 Canadian cents per Exchangeable Share, was paid in October 2007.
A second interim dividend for the second half of 2007 of 6.47 US 3.33 pence per Ordinary Share equivalent to 19.41 US per ADS was paid in April 2008.
This is consistent with Shires stated policy of paying a dividend semi-annually, set in US per Ordinary Share.
It is intended that the first interim payment each year should be constant in US dollar terms.
Dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by the Board when the second interim dividend is determined.
Any dividend growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year.
