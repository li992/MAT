Unilever communicates progress against these measures annually, and management remuneration is aligned with these objectives.

It is therefore not used as a liquidity measure within Unilever.
The movement in UFCF is used by Unilever to measure progress against our longer-term value creation goals as outlined to investors.
UFCF is cash ow from group operating activities, less net capital expenditure, less charges to operating profit for share-based compensation and pensions, and less tax adjusted to reect an ungeared position and for the impact on profit of material business disposals, but before the nancing of pensions.
The reconciliation of UFCF to the GAAP measures of net profit and cash ow from operating activities is shown below.
The tax charge used in determining UFCF can be either the income statement tax charge or the actual cash taxes paid.
Our consistently applied denition uses the income statement tax charge in order to eliminate the impact of volatility due to the variable timing of payments around the year end.
For 2006 the income statement tax charge on this basis was materially impacted by the tax effect of non-cash charges for the provision for preference shares and certain other non-cash items.

The progression of ROIC is used by Unilever to measure progress against our longer-term value creation goals outlined to investors.
ROIC is profit after tax but excluding net interest on net debt and impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets both net of tax, divided by average invested capital for the year.
Invested capital is the sum of property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent investments, software and nite-lived intangible assets, working capital, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at gross book value and cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves under an earlier accounting policy.
The reconciliation of ROIC to the GAAP measure net profit is shown below.
ROIC is based on total business profit, including profit on business disposals.
