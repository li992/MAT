Business Review Financial Review Introduction Clive Watson, Group finance director Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under IFRS.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items which management has defined as amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges, profits or losses on the termination or disposal of businesses or major fixed assets, unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments, net gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate.
Unless otherwise stated, all profit and earnings figures referred to below are adjusted measures for explanation of adjusted figures and reconciliation to the statutory reported figures see Note 3.
