Chief Executive Officers review of operations 2008 was a very good year for ARM as we continued to outperform the semiconductor industry in the growth of revenues, profitability and cash generation.
In addition, we reached several important milestones on the way towards achieving our vision of having all electronic products and services based on ARM technology, making life safer, simpler and more enjoyable for everyone.

We grew our licensing base to more Our customers come back to us It is at that stage, normally about than 580 processor licences which repeatedly because when they four years after the initial licence sale, will drive our long-term royalty buy into ARM technology, they are when ARM begins to earn royalty revenues.
We are also very pleased buying into a long-term roadmap revenue from that licence.

Personally, I find it encouraging that Smarter phones need more intelligent not only have mobile phones become ARM technology-based chips and, smarter, but the user experience has improved through better use of graphics and a more thoughtful user interface.
Smartphones are getting The LG Renoir smartphone more intelligent, and as they do we uses an ARM Mali graphics all find it easier to use them.

mobile computers: always on, always connected and always with the potential to enable communication, productivity or provide entertainment.
ARM has an extremely important role to play as mobile computers need ever higher levels of computing performance, but without compromising on battery life.
They also need PC-class operating systems, browsers, plug-ins and software.
I am very 6 ARM Holdings plc pleased, therefore, to see ARM and for network connection, and may The use of ARM in non-mobile devices our community of semiconductor, have internal storage and a keyboard is growing rapidly: our partners reported software and equipment manufacturers as a more sophisticated remote control.

We will monitor and more design wins and will continue to reap judge the balance between essential investment for the medium-to-longer royalties because ARM technology provides term benefit of the business and necessary financial prudence in a genuinely better solution for consumers.
Clearly 2009 is going to be a difficult this industry, we learned valuable Strengthening our world-leading year across all sectors.

We cannot product portfolio and a broad bring many new chip designs to market ignore these factors as we look into the customer base, and we continue and we expect many thousands of new year ahead.
However, we believe that to run a tight ship.

ARM will achieve more experience of managing the business and they are continuing a long-term licences and more design wins, and in these conditions: like many in will continue to reap royalties because ARM technology provides a genuinely better solution for consumers.
More ARM technology will be used in smartphones 2008 royalties by application units shipped in 2009 than in 2008, and we expect to continue to grow market share within other product categories.
