Conversion 25.4% 31.3% operating profit as a percentage of gross profit showing the Groups effectiveness at controlling the costs and expenses associated with its normal business operations and the level of investment for the future.
Conversion declined compared to last year reflecting the impact of the economic slowdown on demand for the Groups services, lower productivity and the lag in headcount reductions.
productivity 136.2k 144.2k Represents how productive fee earners are in the business and is calculated by dividing the gross profit for the year by the average number of fee earners and gross profit directors.
The higher the number, the higher their productivity.
productivity is a per fee earner function of the rate of investment in new fee earners, the impact of pricing and the general conditions of the recruitment market.
The reduction in productivity this year is as a result of the general deterioration in market conditions.

The movement in KpIs are in line with expectations set out in the discussion on operating profit and conversion rates in the financial review.
The ratio of fee earners to support staff at the end of 2008 has reduced from the level at the end of 2007.
This ratio improves when Group grows and headcount increases but tends to decline when Group headcount reduces as the infrastructure staff to support a higher number of teams, offices and countries cannot be flexed as quickly as fee generating staff.
Despite the significant uncertainty in the economy and its inherent risk and impact on the business, the Board has concluded, given the level of cash in the business, the geographical and discipline diversification, limited concentration risk, as well as the ability to manage the cost base, that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least twelve-months from the date of approval of accounts.
