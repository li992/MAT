Against this backdrop, profit and other financial indicators did not match the records of 2007.
However, I am pleased to report a set of strong and resilient financial results.
The solvency position of the Group remains strong.
Our prudent investment policy for shareholder assets, together with our approach of not offering products with options or guarantees, continues to immunise our capital base.

In 2007 there was a one-off increase of 19.7 million in life profits due to the adoption of an alternative tax methodology.

Other The other result comprises the cost of share options, the AIG goodwill payment and the other operations of the Group.
The share option cost for the year was 14.9 million compared with a cost of 12.5 million for 2007.
The slightly higher charge is the result of the new Partner PSP scheme launched at the start of 2008.
The AIG goodwill charge together with legal and professional costs incurred, amounted to 7.2 million.
The other operations of the Group contributed a small profit of 1.5 million for the year compared with 8.3 million for 2007.
The difference primarily relates to lower income from third party product sales and lower interest income.

The table and commentary below, based on the cash flow analysis set out on page 18, provides an analysis of the constituent parts of the IFRS post tax profit.
The loss associated with acquiring new business during the year was 44.7 million and should be viewed as an investment for future profits.
These profits will arise as net annual management fees less the future amortisation of the associated DAC and DIR in subsequent years.
