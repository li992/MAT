INTRODUCTION & BUSINESSES Finance Directors review The year to 31 December 2008 has been a significant year for Melrose PLC.
On 1 July 2008, the acquisition of FKI plc FKI was completed for 970.4 million.
This transaction increased the size of the Melrose Group by approximately six times.
Consequently the results shown for the year ended 31 December 2008 cannot be compared to the results for the year to 31 December 2007 in a meaningful way.
New segmental split of divisions Continuing operations The continuing operations at 31 December 2008 consist of four divisions, namely Energy, Lifting, Dynacast and Other Industrial.
This represents a new divisional split for Melrose necessitated by the acquisition of FKI.
