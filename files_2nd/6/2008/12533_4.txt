0 2006 2007 2008 Hedging and risk management The Boards policy continues to be to lock in oil and gas price floors for a portion of expected future production at a level which protects the cash flow of the group and the business plan.
Such floors are purchased for cash or funded by selling calls at a ceiling price when market conditions are considered favourable.
All transactions are matched as closely as possible with expected cash flows to the group: no speculative transactions are undertaken.
During 2008, oil hedges for 1.8 million barrels mmbbls matured for which a payment under the terms of the hedges arose during the year of US$8.1 million.
At the end of 2008 a total of 7.2 mmbbls was hedged approximately 1.8 mmbbls per annum under a physical offtake agreement representing approximately one half of UK oil production until December 2012 with an average floor price of US$39 bbl and a cap of US$100 bbl.
In early 2009, further hedging was undertaken which for the same volumes of 1.8 mmbbls a year lifted the floor to US$50 bbl for 2010 and 2011 in return for a cap reduction to US$80 bbl and a cash premium of US$5.8 million.
During 2008, gas hedges for 120,000 metric tonnes mt expired for which payments of US$7.8 million were made during the year.
At the end of 2008 a total of 522,000 mt of HSFO was hedged approximately 120,000 mt per annum representing one third of Indonesian gas production, until June 2013 with a floor price of US$250 mt and a cap of US$500 mt.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 14 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Premiers gas hedging is required to be marked to market at the balance sheet date.
The aggregate valuation is a US$2.9 million liability 2007: US$24.4 million liability generating a US$21.5 million non-cash gain in the 2008 income statement.
From 1 July 2008, oil hedges were incorporated within the pricing terms of physical offtake agreements for the underlying oil production.
Mark to market revaluations are not therefore applied to the new oil hedges at year-end.
Liabilities accrued under the old hedges will be amortised to the income statement over the life of the new hedges and the resulting gain is included in total gains for the year in respect of oil hedges of US$6.8 million.
As the group reports in US dollars, exchange rate exposures relate only to sterling receipts and expenditures, which are hedged in dollar terms on a short-term basis.
The group recorded a loss of US$2.5 million on such hedging at year-end 2007: US$0.4 million.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits, AAA rated liquidity funds and A1 P1 commercial paper subject to Board approved limits.
The group undertakes an insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with its exploration and production activities.
In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields.
Going concern The group monitors its capital position and its liquidity risk regularly throughout the year to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements.
Sensitivities are run to reflect latest expectations of expenditures, forecast oil prices and other factors to manage the risk of funds shortfalls or covenant breaches in order to ensure the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Further details of the group funding facilities and liquidity position are included in the financial statements and related notes.
Although the world economic crisis has created uncertainty at the current time, the directors consider that the headroom provided by the available borrowing facilities gives them confidence that it has adequate resources, including taking into account the subsequent event in note 26 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, to continue as a going concern.
As a result they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
