As expected, the net finance income in respect of defined benefit pension funds deteriorated by 1.3 million in the year mainly as a result of higher interest on liabilities.
Net bank interest improved by 0.6 million due to the good underlying cash flow and higher interest rates on cash deposits, and despite the funding costs of acquisitions in the year.
For 2009, we anticipate a deterioration in the interest position for two reasons.
Firstly, a reduction of around 4 million due to the sharp decline in the expected return on pension fund assets in 2009 following the fall in pension asset values in 2008.
Secondly, it is likely that in 2009 interest rates on cash deposits will be much lower than in 2008, impacting bank interest by around 1 million.
Associates We have minority shareholdings in our operations in India and Mexico which are reported as Associates outside the operating profit.
They are nevertheless an integral part of the Group and both produced good results.
The Groups share of the profit after tax of Associates increased from 1.6 million to 2.7 million.
profit before taxation The Groups pre-tax profit increased by 24% to 90.1 million 2007: 72.8 million.
Taxation The tax charge, excluding Associates, was 30.0% compared with 32.3% in 2007.
The reduction largely reflects a more favourable tax mix of profits and generally lower corporate tax rates.
We expect that the tax rate in 2009 will be broadly in line with 2008.

Watson-Marlow is replacing Rand Water's existing progressive cavity pumps with peristaltic pumps.
A major advantage of using peristaltic pumps is that they can run dry without any problems and will easily cope with abrasive chemicals such as silica and lime slurry, used in the treatment process at Rand Water.
Both these aspects can very quickly cause problems for progressive cavity pumps that require costly spare parts, labour and long downtime for maintenance.
Capital employed Increased capital expenditure, growth in business levels, significant movements in exchange rates and a small addition from acquisitions were reflected in a 29% increase in capital employed during the year, to 272 million at 31st December 2008 - at constant exchange rates the increase was 6%.
Working capital was up 2% at constant exchange rates largely due to increased stocks but trade debtors were up only 3% reflecting slower sales growth later in the year and an improvement in debtor days.
We continue to closely manage working capital levels in the deteriorating economic environment.
The three small acquisitions in the year added 1.5 million to capital employed.

22 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Capital expenditure As expected, capital expenditure in 2008 was higher than usual and net fixed assets increased by 12 million at constant exchange rates.
We invested in new premises in Korea, construction of which is nearing completion, land in China and commenced building a 6 million expansion to the Watson-Marlow tube and pump production plant in Falmouth which is scheduled to commence operation later in 2009.
We continued to invest in plant and machinery and IT systems to improve efficiency.
2008 2007 000 000 Capital expenditure 30,476 16,052 Depreciation and amortisation 16,689 13,147 Capital expenditure as a % of depreciation 183% 122% The numbers above exclude acquired intangible assets and capitalised development costs.
Capital expenditure in 2009 is expected to be exceptionally high at around 40 million, due in particular to the investments in China, Falmouth and Cheltenham.
The favourable movements in exchange rates, if maintained, will also contribute to higher values of capital investment on translation into sterling.
Intangible assets, investments in Associates and minority interests Intangible assets include goodwill capitalised prior to 2004 under the UK GAAP, and goodwill and other intangible assets capitalised on acquisition since the transition to IFRS.
Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful life and goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing.
Following the decision to close the Florida operation of our UltraPure business, we have written down the value of goodwill and certain of UltraPures other intangible assets to nil, resulting in a charge against the statutory operating profit of 3.1 million.
The intellectual property relating to product design and manufacturing know-how has been transferred to our Italian and USA companies and the related small intangible asset value has therefore not been impaired.
There were no impairments in 2007.
Intangible assets amounting to 17.3 million were recognised in respect of acquisitions during the year, largely in respect of Flexicon.
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets was 1.9 million 2007: 0.6 million of which 0.3 million 2007: 0.2 million related to Associates.
Capitalised product development costs and computer software are also included in intangible assets in accordance with IFRS.
The Group balance sheet also includes the cost of investment in our Associate companies in India and Mexico and our share of total equity.
During December we completed the purchase of the remaining 4.9% minority holding in our Spanish company for a consideration of 0.8 million.
Post - retirement benets The post-retirement benefit liability shown in the balance sheet increased significantly to 73.7 million 49.2 million net of deferred tax at 31st December 2008 compared with 21.5 million 14.7 million net of deferred tax a year earlier.
Pension fund asset values declined sharply as equity markets fell and underlying liability values were higher reflecting a change to more prudent mortality assumptions.
These impacts were mitigated by a rise in corporate bond yields used to value liabilities which consequently declined in this respect.
Most of the asset and liability values relate to the two main UK defined benefit pension schemes.
The triennial valuations of these were carried out as at 31st December 2007 and resulted in agreed additional cash contributions of 3.8 million per annum for around five years which commenced in the second half of 2008.
The actuarial funding position as at 31st December 2008 will have deteriorated and is likely to result in additional cash contributions starting in 2009.
At a glance Chairman's statement Business review Board of Directors Directors' report Financial statements Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 23 Case study: Global Group Manufacturing Strategy We are continually improving our global manufacturing processes in order to meet changing customer demands, improve ef ciency and generate cost savings for re-investment back into the business.
Within the last year, our UK manufacturing sites have introduced demand driven systems in many production areas.
This has resulted in signi cant improvements within the business including: Meeting customer demands more reliably Raising the ef ciency of our output Optimising production lines to only make what we sell Reducing stock build-up Generating real cost savings to the business We have developed a strategic global manufacturing plan to support faster geographic growth in developing markets, to reduce supply chain logistics costs, to take advantage of lower-cost manufacturing regions and to meet the increasingly challenging demands of our customers.
24 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Cash ow There was another good cash flow performance for the year.
Free cash flow was 39.0 million 2007: 39.0 million reflecting the strong profit increase but higher than usual net capital expenditure of 26.5 million 2007: 16.5 million.
Working capital changes absorbed 14.6 million, including additional pension payments, and taxation payments were 22.1 million.
Out of free cash flow, dividend payments made were up 14% at 23.2 million.
There was also an outflow of 13.9 million, largely in respect of the acquisition of Flexicon A S in February 2008 but also the smaller acquisitions of Colima in March 2008, PAK Machinery, the UK Flexicon distributor, in November 2008 and the remaining 4.9% minority interest in our Spanish company in December 2008.
There was a net outflow of 2.9 million in respect of the purchase of the Companys own shares into Treasury to satisfy the outstanding shares under the Groups share schemes, including an inflow of 3.9 million in respect of Treasury shares reissued mainly to meet share options exercised.
There was therefore a small net cash outflow of 0.9 million due to funding the increased capital expenditure, acquisitions and share buy-backs.
The favourable movements in exchange rates added 2.5 million to net cash balances which, together with the cash outflow for the year, meant that net cash balances were 17.4 million at 31st December 2008 compared with 15.8 million a year earlier.
2008 2007 000 000 Operating profit 85,669 68,720 Depreciation and amortisation 15,218 13,847 Equity settled share plans 1,519 1,259 Working capital changes 11,353 3,572 Additional contributions to dened benets schemes 3,236 5,726 Net interest paid 189 793 Income taxes paid 22,087 18,162 Net capital expenditure, including development 26,543 16,524 Free cash ow 38,998 39,049 Net dividends 23,189 20,271 Acquisitions 13,939 1,170 Shares purchased, less proceeds from issues 2,812 3,157 Cash ow before exchange 942 20,765 Exchange movement 2,501 1,620 Opening net borrowings cash 15,831 6,554 Closing net cash at 31st December 17,390 15,831 Capital structure Net cash of 17.4 million at 31st December 2008 comprised 52.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, and 34.7 million of debt.
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it and at the year-end undrawn, committed facilities were 32.5 million.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of availability of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
The Group has operations around the globe and therefore its balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and many other currencies, particularly the euro and US dollar.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in local currency where appropriate, consistent with maintaining a low cost of debt.
Our policy continues to be to maintain an appropriately strong balance sheet.
The Groups good cash generation is used to invest in expanding the business both organically and through suitable acquisitions.
The Group regularly considers the appropriateness of the structure of its balance sheet.
Historically, excess capital has been returned to shareholders through share buy-backs in addition to ordinary dividends.

LIFE is an acronym for Little Improvements from Everyone.
This programme started in April 2007, and since then more than 80 leaders have completed the programme.
Investment so far is approximately 250,000 and the payback through approximately 400 related improvement projects aimed at removing waste is around 2.5 million.
This has been a successful programme for the UK and it is being evaluated for possible future application in other regions.
The primary purpose of the programme is to develop competent and con dent leadership at a first-line supervisory level to support the business in achieving its business objectives.
This programme includes training our management people in lean manufacturing techniques, leading a winning team, problem solving and continuous improvement.
Case study: UK Watson-Marlow Peristaltic pumps improve process and improve pro t margin for apple pie manufacturer A manufacturer of traditional baked foods is achieving improved process ef ciency and better pro t margins thanks to the installation of peristaltic technology.
The introduction of hose pumps to this food processing plant has made production faster and completely eliminated the need for manual handling of products.
Following consultation with Watson-Marlows food applications specialists, the company opted for SPX hose pumps.
The low-shear design of the SPX range of hose pumps also allows the manufacturer to protect the contents of its pies, in this case apple chunks, thereby safeguarding its reputation for quality foodstuffs.
26 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Case study: USA Leading the class in emissions reduction and energy savings The University of Texas at Austin needed to upgrade their steam services, after we demonstrated our capabilities, provided projections and estimates for energy consumption and responded to their concerns.
Impressed with our approach and projected savings, the customer selected us to perform a steam trap survey.
We evaluated all steam traps on campus.
A total of 2,425 steam traps were found, of which 120 had failed open, wasting 4,380 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
An additional 267 traps had failed closed.
Spirax Sarco, Inc then provided a complete turnkey solution and as a result reduced both carbon footprint and energy consumption, saving an estimated $577K annually.
Piping upgrades also provided better hot water and hot air temperature control, as well as improving equipment service life and increasing the ef ciency of the steam system.
According to UT-Austins Lewandowski, Spirax Sarco did it all - they came in, surveyed the trap population, identi ed the failed traps, supplied and installed replacement traps.
They were under budget and on time generating an estimated saving of 27 million pounds of steam per year, equating to a reduction in our fuel bill of $577K a year.
We are pleased with the work performed by Spirax Sarco and the energy savings we will achieve through this project.
At a glance Chairman's statement Business review Board of Directors Directors' report Financial statements Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc 27 Risks and uncertainties The Group has well established risk management processes, including insurance cover, which are an integral part of the operation of our business and which are outlined in the Corporate Governance report on pages 34 to 37 of this Annual Report.
Whilst risk can never be eliminated, our processes allow us to identify and appropriately manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties.
These mainly arise from the inherent risks of operating a worldwide business largely using our own local sales companies to sell in local currency, direct to end-user customers, distributors, OEMs and contractors, a very wide range of products, mostly designed and manufactured in our own facilities in a number of different countries.
The business is well spread geographically, across tens of thousands of customers and across most industrial and commercial sectors.
This means that we do not rely excessively on any one customer, product application or industrial sector.
The principal risks and uncertainties are strategic, commercial, operational and financial.
Ultimately these affect our ability to deliver our prime financial objective, which is to provide enhanced value to shareholders through consistent growth in earnings per share and dividends per share as a result of maintaining our world leading position and investing in our businesses for growth.
Strategic risks and uncertainties include customer relationships, the competitive environment, political and economic upheaval, technological changes, the regulatory and legal environment, and investment in acquisitions.
These relate to maintaining our market and technological leadership including branding and reputation.
Commercial risks and uncertainties include issues such as product design and performance, product liability, competitor activity, relations with customers and suppliers, pricing and profit margins.
Our employees are key to managing and mitigating risks and uncertainties and we therefore invest significant resources in the training and development of our people.
Operational risks and uncertainties include health and safety and environmental issues, employee relations, mitigation of, and recovery from, major disasters, product quality and customer service.
We have for many years complied with recognised quality, health and safety and environmental standards and regulations and have applied project management disciplines in our business.
The Groups approach to the health and safety of employees is more fully described on page 39.
Appropriate measures are implemented locally, particularly in the manufacturing companies, and there were further improvements in health and safety in our operations in the year.
The environmental benefits from the use of Group products are more fully described on page 41.
General Managers of operating companies are responsible for local compliance with the Groups policy and with local legislation, and are required to report regularly.
The Group is committed to observing the highest standards of ethics in all its dealings with customers, suppliers, employees and all other stakeholders in the business.
The Group Business Code sets out very clearly the standards expected of all employees and it is the responsibility of all managers within the Groups businesses both to abide by those standards and to ensure that employees for whom they are responsible adhere to the standards.
The Chief Executive writes annually to all General Managers of Group businesses to remind them of the importance which the Group attaches to the Code and of their obligations to ensure compliance with the Code.
Additionally, General Managers are regularly required to certify compliance with the Code.
Financial risks and uncertainties include exchange rate exposures, interest rate movements, financial instruments, financial irregularities and protection of assets including pension fund assets.
The Group has a comprehensive Treasury Policy covering many of these issues and defining our approach to minimise and mitigate such risks.
Unless otherwise stated all profit measures quoted in the text above exclude the amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets of 1.9 million 2007: 0.6 million of which 0.3 million 2007: 0.2 million relates to Associates, and the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of 3.1 million 2007: nil.
