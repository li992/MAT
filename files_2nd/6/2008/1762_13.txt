in note 1 to the Group accounts.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represent the present value of the defined benefit obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
The main assumptions made in accounting for the Groups postretirement plans relate to the expected return on investments within the Groups plans, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries, the rate of increase in the retail price index, the mortality rate of plan members and the discount rate applied in discounting liabilities.
For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values and, in consultation with our actuaries, management decides the point within that range that most appropriately reflects the Groups circumstances.
Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the size of the deficit calculated under IAS 19.
The Group has allocated an appropriate share of the pension deficit to its equity accounted investments and other participating employers using a consistent and reasonable method of allocation which represents, based on current circumstances, the directors best estimate of the proportion of the deficit anticipated to be funded by these entities.
The Groups share of the pension deficit allocated to equity accounted investments is included on the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
The valuing of assets and liabilities at a point in time rather than matching expectations of assets and liabilities over time has no impact on short-term cash contributions to the pension plans.
These funding requirements are derived from separate independent actuarial valuations.
Additional details concerning the Groups retirement benefit plans are given in note 1 and note 22 to the Group accounts.
