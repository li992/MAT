The increase is largely explained by the strengthening of the US dollar and euro against sterling during the year.
This devaluation of sterling increased the sterling value of premiums written by 7% at 2007 rates of exchange.
The remaining increase was due to growth in our underlying business.
The group utilises four main currencies sterling, US dollar, euro and Canadian dollars.
Around 68% of our business is written in US dollars, 8% in euros, 3% in Canadian dollars, with the remainder in sterling.
Premium rates fell in our Lloyds business from the record highs of previous years.
Overall rate reductions in our Lloyds business were around 6%.
Such conditions made our underwriters much more selective in the risks they write applying some of the pricing tools and techniques built up whilst the market was more sturdy.
The reduction in our UK premiums was offset by growth in our US operations.
The balance of business written between our Lloyds business and our US operations is a key part of our strategy in managing the insurance cycle.
The US operation provides diversity to our product mix, enabling us to market our products through different, but complementary channels.
We can thereby achieve a less volatile product mix than purely Lloyds only.
The business remains well diversied both by type of business and geographical location.
This diversity provides protection from exceptional events, such as the US hurricanes seen in 2008, as well as enabling us to hold lower levels of capital to support the business.
The charts above show the composition of our portfolio in 2008, across types of insurance, settlement terms, classes of business and geographical regions.
Premium retention rates A large proportion of the business written within the group is generated from existing relationships with brokers and clients.
In 2008 we retained 80% of premium due for renewal during the year.
By sourcing business this way we are able to build up an understanding of our clients business and requirements, as well as giving us greater insights into the risks involved in each policy.
Historically, it is this renewal account which generates the most profitable business, as we are able to price this most accurately to achieve profit.

Overall, rates charged for business we renewed fell by 6% during 2008 2007: a reduction of 4%.
These reductions were in line with previous announcements and met our predictions at the start of 2008.
In the last quarter of the year we saw premium rates start to improve in most lines.
We expect this trend to continue and expect that we will see increases in rates in our business lines in 2009.
We believe the reasons for the increase are twofold: t 8 JUI UIF DSFEJU DSJTJT BOE TVCTFRVFOU mOBODJBM UVSCVMFODF XF IBWF TFFO JODSFBTJOH EFNBOE GPS DPWFS JO PVS specialty lines business particularly in errors and omission insurance for law rms, engineers and other professionals.
There is also an increased demand for highly rated insurance cover in these uncertain times, and we are nding many clients are turning to Beazley both within Lloyds and in our US admitted insurance company.

The hurricanes served as a timely reminder of the important role insurance and reinsurance plays in this region of the world.
Pricing of these risks has been adjusted accordingly as carriers struggle to maintain competitive margins at original pricing.
Of the business we have renewed in 2009 we have already seen rates charged for renewed business increase by 10% in energy, 8% in US commercial property and 8% in reinsurance.
Reinsurance purchased Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: t 5P NJOJNJTF UIF JNQBDU PG DBUBTUSPQIFT TVDI BT IVSSJDBOFT t 5P FOBCMF UIF HSPVQ UP XSJUF MBSHF PS MFBE MJOFT PO SJTLT XF VOEFSXSJUF BOE t 5P NBOBHF DBQJUBM UP MPXFS MFWFMT In 2008, reinsurance spend increased by 5% to 135.3m.
This increase was driven by increased protections being purchased in respect of the specialty lines portfolio, which offset savings secured in respect of the groups other core programmes.
Reinsurance pricing is expected to increase during 2009 reecting a demand and supply mismatch.
A combination of weakened balance sheets arising from investment losses, a restricted ability to raise new capital post-event and reduced capital market activity in the reinsurance space have contributed to this mismatch.
Supply is expected to be further restricted by counterparty credit issues as balance sheets are further impaired by recent economic and catastrophe events.
The group is rigorous in its selection and utilisation of potential reinsurance counterparties and this will continue to be a core focus in 2009.
com Claims The claims ratio increased by 5% in 2008 mainly driven by the impact of the 2008 US hurricane season the impact of this event alone increased the claims ratio by 4%.
Hurricanes The US hurricane season started in May 2008 and there were 13 named storms, six of which reached hurricane strength.
As in 2005, these storms caused catastrophic damage to the gulf region, this time extending from Florida into parts of Texas.
Beazley was most heavily impacted by hurricanes Ike and Gustav.
The net profit impact of these two storms to the group was 25.2m.
This gure is calculated by taking the cost of the storms themselves, net of any reinsurance recoveries we can make, less any hurricane margins we would ordinarily hold for these types of event.
We have applied the same approach in calculating this cost as we did in 2005, leaving some reserving margin to cover other events which may still occur.
The table below illustrates how the cost of the two hurricanes has been estimated.
Hurricane Hurricane Ike Gustav Total m m m Gross loss 63.4 7.7 71.1 Reinstatement premiums payable 1.2 1.2 Reinsurance recovery 21.9 0.2 22.1 Net Loss 42.7 7.5 50.2 Release of catastrophe margin 25.0 Net loss after release of catastrophe margin 25.2 We insure against hurricane damage in a number of our divisions, notably reinsurance, commercial property and offshore energy.
The costs to each of the teams varied, with the property group incurring the largest share at 15.7m, followed by the offshore energy account at 5.4m, and reinsurance at 4.1m.
The marine and property teams both benefited from reinsurance protection.
The release of catastrophe margin referred to above mainly relates to reserves the group would normally hold against the 2008 underwriting year.
A small proportion approximately 5m relates to releases from the prior periods reserves.
Beazley Annual Report 2008 29 Financial review | group performance continued Prior year reserve releases 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Prior year reserve releases Aside from the huricanes, we have continued to observe better than expected claims experience across our business lines.
This has allowed us to release the following claims reserves during 2008 with a comparison to that released in 2007.
2008 2007 m m Marine 12.8 10.0 Political risks and contingency group 11.6 8.9 Property 3.8 10.8 Reinsurance 16.6 9.9 Specialty lines 28.0 24.5 Total 72.8 64.1 Releases as a percentage of net earned premiums 10.7% 10.4% Beazley has a conservative reserving philosophy.
Initial reserves are set to include prudent margins which are released consistently over time as the uncertainty reduces.
To facilitate this, reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis.
Whilst underwriters and claim managers estimate reserves on a bottom up claim by claim basis, the actuarial team estimate reserves on a top down statistical basis.
By comparing the results from these different approaches, we are able to investigate areas of concern at an early stage or areas where the claims performance suggests reserve releases are possible.
In addition, at the end of 2004 we introduced a framework to monitor that we are maintaining this philosophy.
A reserve strength indicator is estimated for each class and underwriting year to quantify the reserve margin at a particular stage of development.
Establishing a risk appetite for the reserve strength indicator has produced a transparent and consistent reserve margin across underwriting years for each of our business lines and has led to objective reserve releases over time.
As it helps explain how pricing, reserving and capitalisation levels are interacting and changing over the market cycle it is also an important cycle management tool.
The chart above shows the reserve releases made to date since 2003 and is consistent with the growth in business written.
com m Net incurred loss ratio at each development year 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 93-96 97-00 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Development year 2 3 4 5 6 Specialty lines claims reserve releases During 2008, our specialty lines claims have continued to develop favourably, enabling us to make further releases during the year of 28.0m 2007: 24.5m.
The chart above shows the values of incurred claims by underwriting year for specialty lines.
As can be seen the underwriting years since 2003 have performed extremely well with incurred loss ratios claims as a percentage of premiums written consistently below prior years at each stage of development.
The chart also shows the ultimate loss ratio being held and premium written by the group for each underwriting year.
Premiums in this section are net of external commission.
The 2007 underwriting year is currently two percentage points above the 2004 underwriting year after two years of development.
Given the nature of the claims, we do expect some volatility in the progression of incurred loss ratios across the underwriting years.
As an illustration, the 2006 underwriting year after three years of development is in line with the 2003-2005 underwriting years despite relatively lower development after two years.
Analysis of the 2007 underwriting year indicates that the six claims with gross incurred claims over 1m that dominate the incurred loss ratio have been identied early by our claims managers and case reserves set up.
Separate analysis of claim frequency corroborates that this is a timing phenomenon rather than a trend.
The loss development tables set out in note 23 of our financial statements demonstrate how we have been able to release reserves over time against each of these years.
Sub-prime exposures and recessionary planning As we previously explained, the group established an internal working party in 2007 tasked with monitoring the sub-prime mortgage issue in the US.
In recent years, Beazley has had a limited appetite for professional liability risks within the financial institution sector which are viewed as the highest impacted areas.
Whilst the number of sub-prime related lawsuits as reported by Advisen has recently been updated to exceed 450, we provide directors and ofcers D&O coverage for only seven of the affected entities and other types of professional or liability related coverage for a further seven.
As such, we currently expect that our exposure will remain within our reserves.
During 2008, all relevant business areas have specically analysed the potential impact of a recessionary environment on their account in order to make the most of opportunities and mitigate the risks.
Execution of these plans is progressing well.
Our philosophy of having senior and experienced underwriters with a deep understanding of their industries is particularly important in a turbulent marketplace as risk selection is the first line of defence.
Technical pricing techniques are also used to supplement the underwriting decisions.
Beazley Annual Report 2008 31 Net incurred loss ratio % Financial review | group performance continued A consequence of a recessionary environment is the potential for increased claims frequency.
As such, we have recently performed a detailed review within our specialty lines team and report that, in the majority of business areas, claim frequency to date is stable across years.
In the few cases where we have seen the start of a trend, we have implemented remedial action.
It is important to distinguish between trends in claims numbers and trends in claims frequency.
To produce robust analysis, it is important to compare the claim numbers to the underlying exposure measures.
It is very difficult to predict changes in claims frequency and so we will continue to monitor not only the claims frequency but also changes to the underlying drivers of claims.
Feeding the results of these analyses back into the underwriting process is a further example of a cycle management tool being used.
Expenses The groups expenses ratio fell in 2008 from 39% to 34% due to four main factors: tPXFS TIPSU UFSN JODFOUJWF DPTUT 5IF CPOVT BOE JODFOUJWF DPTUT BSF CBTFE PO UIF HSPVQ T QSPmUBCJMJUZ XIJDI has reduced from a profit before tax of 138.5m in 2007 to 87.2m in 2008.

Employee numbers In 2008 we continued to build the business organically through growth in headcount particularly in the US.
By the end of 2008 we employed 550 people globally 2007: 490, a growth of 12% during the year.
The largest growth area was in the US where we increased headcount by 38 to 191.
Of the 550 group wide employees, 149 were underwriters 2007: 126, 50 worked as claims managers or claims administrators 2007: 43, whilst the remaining 351 2007: 321 were employed in group and support roles.
Talent management remains one of the groups core principles.
During 2008, as the market softened we commenced a programme of initiatives focusing on productivity of existing staff.
We held a series of workshops involving staff employed in underwriting, talent management, finance, information technology, marketing and operations.
com The objective of each workshop was to identify ways in which the organisation could free up time and resource enabling the group to focus on activities that benefit the business.
Savings have subsequently been made across these areas.
The table below sets out where our employees are utilised and also where, geographically they are employed.

The development of the financial crisis of 2008 has been well documented, with its origins in the excessive debt and loose lending strategies of the major Anglo-Saxon economies and the escalating losses in US sub-prime mortgages in 2007.
During the first half of 2008 it was the weaker institutions such as Northern Rock in the UK and Bear Stearns in the US that succumbed as the credit and wholesale banking markets began to freeze up.
However, the fact that neither was permitted to fail, with one being nationalised and the other hastily being taken over by JP Morgan, gave markets some confidence that certain institutions were genuinely too big or too interconnected to fail and that, while equity holders would suffer, senior creditors and bond holders were reasonably protected.
This view was reinforced in early September when two key US mortgage nancing institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were taken into conservatorship by the US Treasury.

The failure of Lehman was truly a game-changing event, as it precipitated a devastating loss of confidence throughout the global financial system and a complete seizure of credit and wholesale funding markets.
Interbank lending all but dried up and US three month Libor the rate banks borrow from each other rose from 2.8% in mid September to 4.8% in October.
Despite sharp cuts in ofcial interest rates and various government assistance plans, the financial system remained moribund.
It was only the coordinated bail out and government guarantee of much of the global banking system that prevented a wholesale financial meltdown.
Despite Beazleys relatively modest exposure to equities and hedge funds, and our efforts to reduce the risk in the portfolios, our exposure to credit, in the form of corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgage backed securities, as well as to equities and hedge funds, has resulted in mark to market losses that have severely impacted our investment returns.
In addition, our holdings of 11m nominal of Lehman senior debt as of the end of December has been marked down to a value just under 1m and our exposure to a Madoff feeder fund, valued at 3.8m, has been written to zero.
In both cases, we are working to recover maximum practicable value from these holdings.
During the second half of the year, we have reduced our exposure to corporate bonds and structured securities, while in November we cut our equity holdings by selling our position in the AllianceBernstein Global Style Blend fund, taking our equity weighting below 1%.
These proceeds have been largely kept in cash and short term government bonds.

The group maintains funds in cash for various operational purposes.
Certain of these cash balances are invested in money market funds.
The chart on page 34 highlights the returns received by currency and by investment type.
The groups cash and investment balance grew during 2008 mainly due to a benign two years for major claims, and the translation effect of our dollar balances being expressed in sterling at a lower exchange rate.
The Beazley group funds chart above highlights the growth in investment balances over the past five years.
Foreign exchange dierences arising on non-monetary items In 2008 the impact of the foreign exchange adjustment on non-monetary items is a credit to our income statement of 46.2m 2007: a credit of 8.2m.
Non-monetary items include unearned premium reserves, reinsurers share of unearned premium reserves, and deferred acquisition costs.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, these balances are carried at historic exchange rates, while monetary items are translated at closing rates.
This imbalance creates volatility in our accounts which cannot be hedged as the mismatch is not monetary in nature.
It is for this reason that we have always disclosed the item separately, through the segmental analysis in note 3, as well as on the face of our income statement.
The chart above illustrates the impact of the changes in exchange rate on the income statement for the group.
In the chart we have concentrated on our largest foreign currency exposure, US dollars and the impact this has on earnings.
Under IFRS, non-monetary items are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transactions or rates approximating this rate.
In a period of strengthening US dollars, such as 2008, the adjustment results in a positive profit impact as compared to revaluing all assets and liabilities at closing exchange rates.
The size of each balloon represents the size of the adjustment in each year, while the colour represents the profit before tax impact of the adjustment, blue being a positive impact and pink being a negative impact.

The total balance on intangibles increased by 23.8m in 2008 principally due to the acquisition of Momentum Underwriting Management Limited MUM see section below.
Acquisition of Momentum Underwriting Management Ltd Beazley completed its acquisition of MUM in November 2008.
Established in 2000, MUM is a leading specialist personal accident and life underwriting management agency based in London with an ofce in Australia.
MUM has recently changed its name to Beazley Underwriting Services Ltd, and plans to write $100m of gross premium for 2009 through our two new Lloyds syndicates 3622 and 3623.
MUM also has plans to add underwriting capabilities through Beazley ofces in the US.
The consideration payable, which will be met through Beazleys internal cash, comprises an upfront cash payment of $15m plus 2.4m representing net assets acquired, and further deferred payments of up to $22.5m payable in instalments between 2012 and 2014.
Goodwill recognised in respect of this transaction is 17.9m.
The deferred consideration is subject to the profitability of the business during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 underwriting years.
Investments and cash The groups portfolio remains mainly invested in high quality, short duration bonds.
We invest 6.1% 2007: 8.4% in alternative investments and equities to further diversify risks associated with investing solely in bonds.
The groups strategy is to use a number of specialists to manage the portfolios in order to diversify manager risk and to give us access to different investment styles and skill sets.

Following a strategic review, the board has decided to change our investment strategy in 2009.
The group is setting up an associate investment management rm, Falcon Money Management with the objective of enhancing investment returns while minimising investment risk.
Falcon will initially provide investment management and advisory services solely to Beazley and at a later stage to third party institutional clients.
Insurance receivables Insurance receivables represent broker balances receivable in respect of premiums we have written.
During 2008, broker balances increased by 44% to 287.8m primarily due to an increase in business written and the effect of foreign exchange movements.
We continue to outsource the collection of our Lloyds premium broker balances to JMD Specialist Insurance Services Limited, which operates within the Lloyds market as specialist credit controllers.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims 452.7m, and the unearned premiums reserve on reinsurance 85.9m.

These are estimated by both the underwriter and the syndicate actuary through the quarterly peer review process, a description of which is included in note 23.
Gross insurance claims increased by 64% in 2008 to 1,788.9m, mainly due to the increase in business written and the impact of foreign exchange movements.

These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and callable in 2009.
At the time of the 150m bond issue we entered into a derivative transaction, whereby we matched our investment and currency risk by swapping the sterling xed rate loan into the equivalent of: t b N PG nPBUJOH SBUF TUFSMJOH MPBOT BOE t N PG nPBUJOH SBUF 64 EPMMBS MPBOT These items have been accounted for using hedge accounting for both the oating rate and currency elements of the transaction.
In addition to these borrowings we operate a 100m 2007: 50m syndicated short term banking facility, managed through Lloyds Banking Group plc.
The facility was successfully renegotiated for two and a half years in July 2008 and is currently unutilised.
Currency profit hedging The group minimises its exposure to US dollars, the groups largest currency risk, by selling on a monthly basis, dollar profits as these are estimated to earn during the year.
By the end of each year we aim for US dollar exposure to be minimal.
At the end of 2008 we had 101.5m of US dollar net assets, which mainly relates to our investment in the US.
These are largely matched through a hedging transaction, taken out in 2006 an $80m cross-currency swap see above for details.
In 2008, the group sold $187m at an average exchange rate of 1.97.
We also sell year-end unhedged profits for the second largest currency exposure, euros, once a year.
In 2008, we sold `19.7m at an exchange rate of 1.27.
com Financial review | capital position The group has several requirements for capital: 1.
To support underwriting at Lloyds through syndicates 2623, 3622 commences trading in 2009 and 3623.
This is based on the groups individual capital assessment.
This may be provided in the form of either the groups cash and investments or debt facilities: 2.
To support underwriting in BICI in the US: and 3.
To make acquisitions of insurance companies or MGAs whose strategic goals are aligned with our own.
Our funding comes from a variety of sources: 1.
Of this balance, 78.6m is unavailable to the group because it relates to intangible assets, xed assets or undistributable syndicate profits: 2.
This has a first call date of 2009, and at this stage is likely to be repaid in full: and 4.
An undrawn banking facility of 100m.
In total, 60.3m has been repaid to shareholders during 2008.
We repaid 24.9m of shareholders funds, via a share buyback programme.
We repurchased 16.5m shares, at an average price of 147.7p, which the group now holds as treasury shares.
In addition, we paid a final dividend of 4.0p and a special dividend of 4.0p in May 2008, and an interim dividend of 2.2p, making a total distribution of 35.4m.

Beazley Annual Report 2008 39 Financial review | capital position continued Proposed rights issue and placing As mentioned in the chairmans statement, at a time when rates are improving, certain market players have a diminished appetite for risk and prospective insureds are seeking placement diversication.
We are well positioned to access new business opportunities as a result of: t PVS FYUFOTJWF 64 PGmDF OFUXPSL t PVS BCJMJUZ UP PGGFS EJWFSTJmDBUJPO UISPVHI UIF TZOEJDBUF TUSVDUVSF XJUIJOMPZE T BOE t UIF TUSFOHUI PG UIFMPZE T GSBODIJTF XIJDI BUUSBDUT CVTJOFTT CZ CFJOH BCMF UP QSPWJEF HSFBUFS VOEFSXSJUJOH DBQBDJUZ through its subscription market approach.
With such access and Beazleys record of unbroken profitability since establishment, the group is confident in its ability to leverage our underwriting expertise to take advantage of the current and expected market opportunity in its core lines of business.
To support this growth, we are proposing to raise 150m net of expenses by a fully underwritten rights issue and placing.
These funds will be used to: t QSPWJEF DBQJUBM TVQQPSU EVF UP UIF SFWJTJPO JO UIF FYDIBOHF SBUF GPS EPMMBS EFOPNJOBUFE CVTJOFTT t TVQQPSU UIF FYQBOTJPO PG UIF HSPVQ T FYJTUJOH VOEFSXSJUJOH BDUJWJUJFT UP UBLF BEWBOUBHF PG UIF JNQSPWJOH SBUJOH environment: and t GVOE UIF BDRVJTJUJPO PG 'JSTU 4UBUF.
BOBHFNFOU SPVQ OD Individual capital assessment The group is required to produce an individual capital assessment ICA which sets out the amount of capital that is required to reect the risks contained within the business.
Lloyds reviews this assessment to ensure that ICAs are consistent across the market.
In order to determine the ICA, we made significant investment in both models and process: t 8F VTF TPQIJTUJDBUFE NBUIFNBUJDBM NPEFMT UIBU SFnFDU UIF LFZ SJTLT JO UIF CVTJOFTT BMMPXJOH GPS QSPCBCJMJUZ PG occurrence, impact if they do occur, and interaction between risk types.
"A key focus of these models is to understand the risk posed to individual teams, and to the business as a whole, of a possible deterioration in the underwriting cycle: and t 5IF $"" QSPDFTT JT FNCFEEFE TP UIBU UIF UFBNT DBO TFF UIF EJSFDU BOE PCKFDUJWF MJOL CFUXFFO VOEFSXSJUJOH EFDJTJPOT and the capital allocated to that team."
This gives a consistent and comprehensive picture of the risk reward prole of the business and allows teams to focus on strategies that improve return on capital.
The ICA has increased from 306m to 360m to support the new 3623 and 3622 syndicates and to reect the more challenging underwriting and investment environments.
