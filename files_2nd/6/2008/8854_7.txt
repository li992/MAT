BUSINESS REVIEW John Sheldrick Group Finance Director Autocatalyst manufacturing facility.
Financial Review Introduction Johnson Matthey achieved very good results in 2007 08, with revenue well ahead of last year as a result of strong underlying volume growth and rising precious metal prices.
Sales excluding the value of precious metals increased by 20% with all three divisions achieving good growth.
Demand for catalysts was strong with expanding sales of diesel particulate filters and a full years sales of heavy duty diesel HDD catalysts to original equipment manufacturers in Europe and North America.
The group also achieved strong growth in Asia, particularly in China, both for emission control catalysts and process catalysts.
On 6th February 2008 we completed the acquisition of Argillon Group for 214 million.
Argillon is an international group specialising in catalysts and advanced ceramic materials, with leading technology for the control of emissions of oxides of nitrogen NOx.
Within its portfolio Argillon has non catalyst businesses manufacturing ceramic insulators and alumina products which Johnson Matthey has offered for sale.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS these businesses are classified as assets held for sale and their results shown in discontinued businesses below profit after tax in the income statement.
Also under IFRS we are required to capitalise certain intangible assets upon acquisition such as the fair value of customer relationships, technology and trademarks and then amortise their value through the income statement.
In presenting the groups results we have focused on operating profit before amortisation of these acquired intangibles which we believe provides a better guide to the underlying performance of the group.
