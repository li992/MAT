Investec plc silo excluding Investec Limited annual financial statements 2017 21 Financial review 02 Financial review continued An overview of the principal risks relating to our operations The most material and significant risks we face, which the board and senior management believe could have an impact on our operations, financial performance, viability and prospects are summarised briefly below with further details provided in section three of this annual report.
The board, through its various sub-committees, has performed a robust assessment of these principal risks.
For additional information pertaining to the management and monitoring of these principal risks, see the references provided.
Regular reporting of these risks is madeto senior management, the executives and the board at the group risk and capital committee GRCC and board risk and capital committee BRCC.
The groups board approved risk appetite framework is provided on page 51.
The board recognises even with sound appetite and judgement that extreme events can happen that are completely outside of the boards control.
It is however, necessary to assess these events and their impact and how they may be mitigated by changing the risk appetite framework if necessary.
It is policy to regularly carry out multiple stress testing scenarios which in theory test extreme, but plausible events and from that assess and plan what can be done to mitigate the potential outcome.

Our risk appetite continues to favour lower risk, income-based lending, with exposures well collateralised and credit risk taken over a short to medium term.
Investec has a limited appetite for unsecured debt, thus the credit risk mitigation technique most commonly used is the taking of collateral, with a strong preference for tangible assets.
Portfolio reviews including stress testing analyses are undertaken on all material businesses, where the portfolios are analysed to assess any migration in portfolio quality, highlight any vulnerabilities, identify portfolio concentrations and make appropriate recommendations, such as a reduction in risk appetite limits or specific exposures.

In addition, a number of committees and forums identify and manage risk at a group level.
The group risk appetite statement and framework sets out the boards mandated risk appetite.
The group risk appetite framework acts as a guide to determine the acceptable risk profile of the group by the owners of the groups capital.
The group risk appetite statement ensures that limits targets are applied and monitored across all key operating jurisdictions and legal entities.
The group risk appetite statement is a high-level, strategic framework that supplements and does not replace the detailed risk policy documents at each entity and geographic level.
The group risk appetite framework is a function of business strategy, budget and capital processes, our stress testing reviews and the regulatory and economic environment in which the group is operating.
The group risk appetite framework is reviewed in light of the above aspects and approved at least annually or as business needs dictate.
A documented process exists where our risk profile is measured against our risk appetite and this positioning is presented to the group risk and capital committee, board risk and capital committee and the board.

An asset is therefore categorised as unencumbered if it has not been pledged against an existing liability.
Risk Management monitors and manages total balance sheet encumbrance via a board-approved risk appetite framework.
The group utilises securitisation in order to raise external term funding as part of its diversified liability base.
Securitisation notes issued are also retained by the group which are available to provide a pool of collateral eligible to support central bank liquidity facilities, including the Bank of England's Funding for Lending and Term Funding Schemes.
The group uses secured transactions to manage short-term cash and collateral needs.
Details of assets pledged through repurchase activity and collateral pledges are reported by line item of the balance sheet on which they are reflected on page 246.
Related liabilities are also reported.
On page 223 we disclose further details of assets that have been received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing transactions where the assets are allowed to be resold or pledged.
The below asset encumbrance disclosures are based on the requirements set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation and the related guidelines issued by the European Banking Authority in June 2014.
Information on importance of encumbrance Encumbered assets have been identified in accordance with the reporting requirements under European Capital Requirements Regulation CRR.
As at 31 March 2017, 1 777 million of the group's assets were encumbered.

The impacts can be financial as well as non-financial such as customer detriment, reputational or regulatory consequences.
Operational risk is an inherent risk in the operations of a specialist bank and asset management group.
The group aims to appropriately identify and manage operational risk within acceptable levels by adopting sound operational risk management practices which are fit for purpose.
Operational risk management framework The group applies the standardised approach TSA for regulatory capital purposes in the assessment of operational risk.
The changing regulatory landscape includes The Basel committee on Banking Supervision BCBS proposing reforms on how banks calculate operational risk capital.
The group continues to work closely with regulators and industry bodies to remain cognisant of reforms.
The framework is embedded at all levels of the group, supported by the risk culture and enhanced on a continual basis as the discipline matures and in line with regulatory developments.
The operational risk management framework is supported by practices and processes which facilitate the identification, assessment and mitigation of operational risk.
Practices consist of the following: Scenarios Risk and control Internal risk External Key risk and capital assessment events risk events indicators calculation Reporting Qualitative Internal risk An external Metrics are Extreme yet Ongoing assessments events are data service is used to monitor plausible monitoring and performed on analysed to used to analyse risk exposures scenarios are reporting of the key business enable business operational risk against identified used to analyse operational risk processes, to identify trends events from other thresholds.

output assists significant decision-making identify, manage address control This provides in predictive operational and monitor weaknesses insight into capability and risk.
In addition, operational risks possible assessing the the output of and controls emerging risks risk profile of the this evaluation and input into business is used to scenarios analysis determine internal operational risk capital requirements Governance The governance structure adopted to manage operational risk within the bank operates in terms of a levels of defence model and includes principles relating to combined assurance.
The levels of defence model is applied as follows: Level 1 Business line management: responsible for identifying and managing risks inherent in the products, activities, processes and systems for which it is accountable Level 2 Independent operational risk function: key function is to challenge the business lines inputs to, and outputs from, the banks risk management, risk measurement and reporting systems Level 3 Independent review and challenge: required to review and challenge the banks operational risk management controls, processes and systems.
Risk tolerance The Operational Risk Tolerance policy defines the amount of operational risk exposure, or potential adverse impact of a risk event, that the bank is willing to accept.
The objective of the policy is to encourage action and mitigation of risk exposures and provides management with the guidance to respond appropriately.
Additionally, the policy defines capturing and reporting thresholds for risk events and guidance to respond to key risk indicators appropriately.
All exceptions and breaches of thresholds are reported to the relevant operational risk governance forums and to the GRCC who are responsible for escalation to the BRCC as appropriate.

Credit risk RWAs For Investec plc consolidated reporting, we have adopted the standardised approach for calculating credit risk RWAs.
Credit risk RWAs, which include equity risk, increased by 967 million.
The increase is primarily attributable to a growth in secured corporate and residential mortgage lending.
Counterparty credit risk RWAs and credit valuation risk CVA Counterparty credit risk and CVA RWAs decreased by 21 million mainly due to central clearing some of our derivative exposures.
Market risk RWAs We apply the standardised approach for calculating market risk RWAs.
Market risk RWAs decreased by 73 million primarily driven by a decrease in Fx risk which was achieved by hedging.
Operational risk RWAs Operational risk RWAs are calculated using the standardised approach increased by 121 million.
The increase is due to a higher three year average operating income.

The leverage ratio has been disclosed using both a transitional and fully loaded capital measure.
Investec plcs leverage ratio has increased as a result of increased exposures driven by loans and other advances to customers and cash and balances to central banks.
Investec Bank plcs leverage ratio has remained unchanged as a result of an increase in tier 1 capital, driven by profits generated during the year, which was offset by increased exposure.
