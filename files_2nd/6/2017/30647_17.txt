com Financial review continued Group performance continued Reinsurance purchased Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and non natural catastrophes such as cyber attacks: to enable the group to put down large lead lines on the risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
The amount the group spent on reinsurance in 2017 was $365.0m 2016: $341.6m.
The increase in purchased reinsurance was in line with our growth in gross premiums written of 7%.
Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims and expenses to total net earned premium.
A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio increased in 2017 to 99% 2016: 89% due to a high incidence of claims from natural catastrophes in the second half of 2017, which added circa 10% to the full year ratio.
Claims 2017 experienced a number of natural catastrophes with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the Mexican earthquakes and Californian wildfires, all of which were major contributors to an increase in net insurance claims of $220.1m, which brought the 2017 total net insurance claims to $1,075.7m 2016: $855.6m.
These claims, while large, were not outside of our expectation for such types of natural catastrophes.
The claims ratio increased to 58% 2016: 48%.
com Annual report 2017 Beazley 45 Reserve releases Beazley has a consistent reserving philosophy, with initial reserves being set to include risk margins that may be released over time as and when any uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range of 5-10% above our actuarial estimates, which themselves include some margin for uncertainty.
The margin held above the actuarial estimate was 5.0% at the end of 2017 2016: 6.6%.
This margin decreased in 2017 which was in part due to the catastrophe activity in the second half of the year, which resulted in much lower margins than usual in the affected areas.
As the overall margin is at the lower end of the range that management target, reserve releases in 2018 may be slightly lower than those over the last three years.
However, it is important to recognise that while there is strong correlation between the level of margin and future reserve releases, current year developments can also affect releases either positively or negatively.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
The reserve releases in 2017 increased to $203.9m 2016: $180.7m.
Our specialty lines division continued to increase its reserve releases as the post recession portfolio from 2012 onwards matures.
This divisions releases also included meaningful amounts from the 2014 2015 cyber portfolio, an area that has more year on year variability than the balance of the specialty lines account.
This counter-balanced lower releases on short tail classes, where the mechanical effect that reduced margins have on reserve releases, along with the effects of a large series of natural disasters, is now visible.

com Financial review continued Group performance continued Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased during 2017 to $774.4m from $720.3m in 2016.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2017 2016 $m $m Brokerage costs 431.1 390.0 Other acquisition costs 88.6 82.5 Total acquisition costs 519.7 472.5 Administrative expenses 254.7 247.8 Total acquisition costs and administrative expenses 774.4 720.3 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premiums they have increased slightly to 23% in the current year 2016: 22%.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with the groups accounting policy.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity e. g. underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
The group expense ratio remained unchanged compared to the previous year.
Internal administrative expenses have increased less than premium due to a continued conscious drive to challenge costs.
This was offset by the aforementioned small increase in acquisition costs versus our earned premium growth.
Foreign exchange The majority of Beazleys business is transacted in US dollars, which is the currency we have reported in since 2010 and the currency in which we hold the companys net assets.
Changes in the US dollar exchange rate with sterling, the Canadian dollar and the euro do have an impact as we receive premiums in those currencies and the majority of our staff still receive their salary in sterling.
Beazleys foreign exchange loss taken through the statement of profit or loss in 2017 was $3.1m 2016: loss of $9.5m.
Investment performance Geo-political headlines had limited overall impact on financial markets in 2017.
Instead, more traditional macro-economic considerations provided direction: improving global growth, controlled inflation and easy monetary policy helped equities and corporate credit exposures to rally strongly whilst, later in the year, expectations of rising interest rates, particularly in the US, led risk-free yields to increase significantly.
Our core portfolio of mainly fixed income assets, which constitute the majority of our investments, returned 1.6% overall in 2017 2016: 1.5% helped, as credit spreads declined, by the additional corporate bond exposures which we added in 2016.
Our capital growth investments, which target higher returns whilst accepting some additional volatility, increased to 14.8% of assets in 2017 2016: 12.0%, which was beneficial as these investments returned 11.0% in the period 2016: 5.6%, driven by strong performance from our equity and illiquid credit exposures.
Our overall investment return for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 2.9%, or $138.3m 2016: 2.0%, $93.1m.

The chart below shows the increase in our group funds since 2013.
Tax Beazley is liable to corporation tax in a number of jurisdictions, notably the UK, the US and Ireland.
Beazleys effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate mainly driven by the Irish, UK and US tax rates.
The weighted average of the statutory tax rates for the year was 18.7% 2016: 14.9% and has increased over 2016 due to an increased level of US based profits which are taxed at 35%.
We expect this rate to be around 16% to 17% in 2018 as the group benefits from a reduced US corporation tax rate and non-US profits hopefully revert to long term levels.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 22.6% 2016: 14.4%.
The increases compared to 2016 were due to the higher composite tax rate and a reduction of approximately $5m in the value of our US deferred tax asset following the reduction in the US corporation tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was enacted in 2017.
The application of the diverted profits tax legislation passed by the government early in 2015 still remains uncertain.
We have considered the implication of this and retain the view that this tax should not apply to Beazley see note 9 in the financial statements.
