Annual Bonus As explained on page 111, half of the annual bonus is paid in cash, with the other half being used to purchase the Companys shares which are subject to forfeiture for three years under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Scheme.
Long-term Incentives The value of the long-term incentives is the value of shares for the award where the performance period ends in the year together with the value of the dividends that would have been received during the three-year performance period.
The figures for 2017 have been calculated using the average of the Companys share price in the three-month period to 31 December 2017, being 11.71, as the actual vesting date of the PSP award is on 26 March 2018.
The figures for 2016 have been updated from the three month average figures used in last years report being 1,132,563 for David Bellamy and 754,804 for Andrew Croft, Ian Gascoigne and David Lamb to take into account the Companys share price on the date of vesting on 27 March 2017, being 10.57.
Pension Contributions Pension contributions, being 20% of base salary for all Directors, were capped by legislation and so a non-pensionable salary supplement was paid to the Executive Directors in full for David Bellamy, Andrew Croft and Ian Gascoigne and for the balance for David Lamb, who had a 3,333 contribution to the money purchase Group pension scheme.
Other The value of the SAYE options exercised by Ian Gascoigne on 24 March 2016 when the mid-market price of the Companys shares was 9.10.
David Lamb was a non-executive director of The Henderson Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc during the year and was paid and retained a fee of 23,000 in 2017 in connection with that role 2016: 23,000.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 St. James's Place plc 101 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued In this new role, Mr Bellamy will receive a total remuneration package of 230,000 per annum which includes basic salary and the monetary value of any company fringe benefits.

Mr Bellamy remains eligible for an annual bonus in respect of the 2017 financial year, subject to the usual performance conditions under the bonus plan: half of the bonus will be deferred into shares, in accordance with the Policy.
He will not receive a PSP grant in 2018.

Details of Variable Pay Earned in the Year Summary of Total Annual Bonus for 2017 Performance The performance conditions and weightings which applied to the annual bonus and the resulting payout were as follows: Weighting ratio and payout Weighting Payout % of maximum % of maximum n Financial 50% n Financial 50% n Strategic 50% n Strategic 46.67% Threshold Weighting Weighting EEV Operating Maximum Payout Payout Measure % of salary % of maximum Profit value Actual % of salary % of maximum Financial 75% 50% 655m 715m 918.5m 75% 50% Strategic 75% 50% Assessment by the Committee of the performance 70% 46.67% of the Executive Directors Total Payout 145% 96.67% In setting the operating profit target for the year it was assumed that the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes would have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
The actual outcome for the year included a combined positive impact to the operating profit from these two items of 47.8 million.
The Committee concluded that this positive outcome was as a result of management action during the year and should therefore be included when assessing the bonus payout for the year.
Had these changes not been included, the performance required for the maximum annual bonus payout would still have been attained.

The Committee considered these three groups when setting the strategic targets for 2017, together with other objectives set out in the 2017 business plan.
In serving our clients well, developing our employees and the Partnership for the future and striving to improve the effectiveness of our organisation, we will be best placed to meet our long-term business objectives, and create additional value for our shareholders.
We also focus on the importance of safe and sustainable growth through prudent management of risk and the highest standards of regulatory compliance.
The Committee assessed how well the Executive team had performed in relation to the objectives set at the start of the year.
The Committee did not place fixed weightings on the factors assessed, but made a judgement based on the Committees view of the relative importance and impact of those factors over the course of the year.
For some factors, the Committee put in place quantitative metrics, and for others qualitative judgements were made, depending on the nature of the strategic objective.
St. James's Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 102 Strategic Report St. James's Place Charitable Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information The Committee took into account the following: Objectives and performance Clients Although we did not conduct a Wealth Account Survey in 2017 18, the results for 2016 17 were very strong as reported last year, with 96% of clients saying they would recommend SJP to friends or contacts: Clients continued to benefit from above average performance across the majority of funds and portfolios over a range of time periods.
Across all ten-year periods, the equity fund managers outperformed their benchmark, on average, 78.7% of the time.
Over the three and five-year periods, the equivalent average outperformance rate was 65.4% and 73.9% respectively.
For the range of eight Growth and Income portfolios available to clients, outperformance compared to the relevant Asset Risk Consultants ARC Private Client Index peer group occurred in 81.6% of all three-year periods on average: Continued focus on customer outcomes with very encouraging results against measures in relation to disclosures and quality of documentation: The number of advice-related complaints remained very low relative to our overall scale: The Group won a number of industry awards, further details of which are set out on page 5, many of which were voted on by clients: and The above factors, together with good service levels, generally contributed to excellent retention of funds under management, with 95.7% of existing funds being retained excluding regular income withdrawals and client numbers increasing by 11% see page 20 for further details.
Long-term success The growth in the size of the Partnership including Partners and Advisers in the UK and Asia of more than 7%: The success of the Academy in attracting suitable candidates to the courses run in 2017 with more than 261 active students in the Academy programme.
96 students graduated from the Academy during the year: Continuing the integration of Rowan Dartington into the Group: Completing the roll out of the Retirement Account across the whole Partnership: Continuing to develop and grow our Asian operations: Delivering some significant actions in relation to our people strategy, including launching our senior leadership programme and additional training and development opportunities for the senior management team, the Partnership and the workforce generally: High levels of retention for both employees and members of the Partnership: Successful transition of the new CEO and CFO and recruitment of a new CRO and Internal Audit Director: and Continuing to maintain and reinforce the Groups distinctive culture.
Risk management Continuing positive and constructive engagement with the Groups regulators and responding effectively to key regulatory initiatives including MiFID II, PRIIPs and the Insurance Distribution Directive: and Completing various objectives designed to continue to enhance and strengthen the monitoring and mitigation of key regulatory risks impacting the Group particularly in relation to systems and processes.
Other objectives Continuing to support Partners in building sustainable businesses particularly in relation to IT and systems and significant progress made in relation to Partners achieving chartered status: Dealing effectively with the significant change agenda and the associated complexities: Evolution of the Groups range of funds, the range of fund managers available to clients and the effective operation of the Investment Committee: and The ongoing success of the Groups corporate responsibility objectives, including raising more than 16.8 million including double-matching for the Charitable Foundation and expanding the volunteering opportunities available to employees.
Taking all the above strategic objectives into account, the Committee awarded a bonus of 70% of salary 93.3% of the maximum under the team performance element of the annual bonus scheme, recognising that a high proportion of the strategic objectives were graded as outstanding or above stretch and that nearly all of the major business plan objectives had been satisfactorily completed.
1 The Committee has the discretion to scale back the annual bonus payable in respect of the strategic measures if it considers it inappropriate in the context of the overall financial results of the Group.
The Committee reviewed the Groups performance and agreed that no scale-back was appropriate.
2 The Committee retains the discretion to amend each element of the bonus, up or down, within the overall cap of 150% of salary, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared to competitor organisations or, for instance, an exceptional positive or negative event which impacts the Group.
The Committee reviewed the Groups performance as well as competitors and the external market at the end of the performance period and agreed that no adjustment was required.
3 Half of the bonus is paid in cash, with the remainder being invested in the Companys shares and deferred for three years, under the Groups deferred bonus plan.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 St. James's Place plc 103 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued Long-Term Incentive Awards Vesting of Performance Share Plan PSP awards audited On 31 December 2017, the awards made on 26 March 2015 under the PSP reached the end of their three-year performance period.
These will vest on 26 March 2018, being the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The performance conditions which applied to the 2015 PSP awards, and the actual performance achieved against these conditions, are set out in the tables below: Average annual adjusted EPS growth Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the unwind of the discount rate including the unwind of the discount rate 1 2 3 TSR relative to the FTSE 51 to 150 in excess of RPI in excess of RPI Performance % of one third of Performance % of one third of Performance % of one third of Performance level hurdle required award vesting required award vesting required award vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Upper Quartile or Stretch or above above 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% 32 out of 85 Actual achieved companies 63.82% 24.1% 100% 35.6% 100% 1 FTSE 51-150 index excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas and mining sectors.
2 The first EPS performance condition is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The effect of the adjustment to the consolidated after-tax figures will be to strip out the post-tax EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change in the final year of the performance period as these factors are not within the control of management and can produce wide variations to reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
However, this measure of EPS is still impacted by stock market movements in the prior year due to the impact of any such movements on the unwind of the discount rate in the current year.
3 The second EPS performance condition is calculated in a similar way to the first EPS condition, save that a further adjustment is made to strip out the impact of the unwind of the discount rate.
This adjustment eliminates any direct impact of stock market volatility and changes in the economic assumptions throughout the whole three-year period of the performance condition.
4 Straight line vesting occurs in between threshold and maximum vesting.
Therefore, the total percentage of the 2015 PSP awards vesting was 87.94%, which resulted in the following awards to the Executive Directors: Total number of Percentage of Number of Value of shares 1 Director shares granted awards vesting % shares vesting vesting 000 David Bellamy 100,280 87.94 88,185 1,032 Andrew Croft 68,932 87.94 60,618 709 Ian Gascoigne 68,932 87.94 60,618 709 David Lamb 68,932 87.94 60,618 709 1 As these awards will not actually vest until 26 March 2018, a deemed share price is used to calculate the value of shares vesting.
This is taken as the three-month average to 31 December 2017 being 11.71.
Granting of PSP Awards in 2017 Details of PSP awards at nil cost option granted to the Executive Directors in 2017 is set out in the table below.
Number of SJP % of face value Average share shares over that would vest price at date which award Face value of at threshold 1 Director Type of award Basis of award granted of grant was granted award 000 performance David Bellamy Nil cost option 200% of salary of 520,000 10.53 98,765 1,040 25% Andrew Croft Nil cost option 200% of salary of 376,000 10.53 71,405 752 25% Ian Gascoigne Nil cost option 200% of salary of 376,000 10.53 71,405 752 25% David Lamb Nil cost option 200% of salary of 376,000 10.53 71,405 752 25% 1 The number of shares awarded was calculated based on the average share price over a period of three days prior to the date of grant on 27 March 2017, being 10.53 per share.
The face value of the award figure is calculated by multiplying the number of shares awarded by the average share price figure of 10.53.
2 PSP awards are structured as nil cost options and there is therefore no exercise price payable on exercise.
Dividend equivalents accrue to the Executive Directors between the date of grant and exercise of the award up to a maximum of six years from date of grant, but are released only to the extent that awards vest.
Further details of the performance conditions which apply to the awards are set out in Notes 1, 2 and 3 to the table above and in the Policy.
These awards also have a post-vesting holding period of two years from the vesting date.
During this period, the vested shares cannot normally be sold, other than to the extent necessary to settle tax on vesting or exercise.

The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the Chief Executive over the last nine financial years.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and long-term incentive awards which vested based on performance in those years and ending in that year for PSP scheme awards.
Of this, 167,331 is due to increases in the SJP share price over the vesting period, being an increase of 19% the share price of the PSP award on the date of grant was 9.81 and the deemed share price on the date of vesting was 11.71 calculated as set out in Note 2 below.
2 As the actual vesting date for the PSP performance period ending 31 December 2017 is not until 26 March 2018, a deemed value has been listed.
This is the average of the Companys share price in the three-month period to 31 December 2017, being 11.71.
The 2016 figure for total remuneration has been updated by substituting the three-month average figure used to calculate the value of long-term incentive awards in last years report by a revised figure based on the Companys share price on the date of vesting on 27 March 2017, being 10.57.

Half of the annual bonus will be determined by EEV operating profit and half by key strategic targets.
50% of the annual bonus earned for performance in 2018 will be paid in cash and the remaining 50% will be deferred in the Companys shares for a three-year period and subject to continued service.
The EEV operating profit target set by the Committee is based on a sliding scale to progressively reward incremental performance.
The EEV result is calculated based on best estimate assumptions and any deviation or changes from these assumptions are reported as an experience variance or an operating assumption change.
In setting the operating profit target for the year it is assumed the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes will have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
In setting the 2018 EEV Operating Profit target, the Committee maintained the new business and expense growth objectives at the same level as in previous years.
The Board considers that the performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and is not disclosing them at this time.
The performance metrics and performance against them will be disclosed in the 2018 Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
The team element of the 2018 annual bonus will be assessed by reference to key strategic targets based around the 2018 business plan, including elements relating to clients, shareholders and other key stakeholders.
Specific objectives include: the delivery of good service to the Groups clients as measured by surveys and other client feedback: continuing to enhance the range of investment funds and maintaining strong investment performance: the successful recruitment and retention of high-quality Partners and Advisers: successfully implementing the next phase of the administration systems and transferring certain existing assets onto that system: successfully controlling and mitigating the material risks that could impact the Group: and maintaining the Groups good relations with its shareholders and regulators.
Performance Share Plan Awards for 2018 The Executive Directors will each receive a PSP award in 2018 of 200% of salary.
These awards will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition for one-third of the award and earnings per share growth targets for two-thirds of the award as follows: Average annual adjusted EPS growth Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the unwind of the discount rate excluding the unwind of the discount rate 1 2 3 TSR relative to the FTSE 51 to 150 in excess of RPI in excess of RPI Performance % of one third of Performance % of one third of Performance % of one third of Performance level hurdle required award vesting required award vesting required award vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Upper Quartile or Stretch or above above 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% 1 FTSE 51 to 150, excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas producers and mining sectors.
