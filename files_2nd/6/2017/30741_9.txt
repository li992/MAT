11% In addition, the Group separately reports fuel revenue from contracts in our Power Solutions Utility business in Brazil and Mozambique, where we manage fuel on a pass-through basis on behalf of our customers.
The reason for the separate reporting is that fuel revenue on these contracts is entirely dependent on fuel prices and the volume of fuel consumed, and these can be volatile and may distort the view of the performance of the underlying business.
In 2017, fuel revenue from these contracts was 139 million 2016: 60 million.
Reported Group revenue was up 14% on the prior year, with Rental Solutions up 15% and Power Solutions Industrial and Utility up 30% and 7% respectively.
