Strategic report Group Chief Financial Officers review The strong set of results continues to demonstrate our ability to grow earnings and increase dividends whilst reducing our leverage.
I am pleased to report that the Group has delivered another strong financial performance, with profit before tax from continuing operations 9.7% higher at 193.3m.
Excluding derivatives and the one-off impact of Ogden rate change, profit before tax increased by 5.6%.
Strong cash flows have enabled us to further deleverage to 1.9x from 2.3x at the start of the year, with net debt reducing from 547.7m to 464.8m.
Based onthese results and our positive expectations for the business, we are proposing to increase our final dividend to 5.8p, leading togrowth in the full year dividend of 18.1% to 8.5p per share.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 30 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Revenue from continuing operations decreased by 9.5% to 871.3m 2016: 963.2m, due to the accounting for the new fundswithheld quota share agreement in motor insurance.
Our total customer spend with Saga increased by 4.7% to 1,182m 2016: 1,129m, which includes gross written premiums and insurance premium tax for all insurance policies sold.
Trading EBITDA grew by 3.1% to 246.1m 2016: 238.8m, with the current period incurring a profit impact of approximately 5m from the scheduled Saga Sapphire maintenance.
Trading Profit increased by 0.9% to 213.0m 2016: 211.0m, with depreciation and amortisation increasing by 5.3m due to investment in the ongoing maintenance of both ships and in software.
Now that the impact of IPO expenses seen in previous years has diminished, and the amortisation of intangibles acquired with the Destinology and Bennetts businesses has reached a steady state, profit before tax has replaced Trading Profit as the Groups key performance measure.
Profit before tax, excluding derivatives and the Ogden rate change impact, increased by 5.6% to 187.4m 2016: 177.4m, benefiting from a decrease in finance costs of 6.8m as a result of high levels of cash generation enabling continued deleveraging and a reduction in LIBOR, coupled with a 1.4m reduction in non-trading costs.
Profit before tax from continuing operations for the year was 193.3m, an increase of 9.7%, which was further impacted by gains on derivative instruments that do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedges for accounting purposes, and a 4.0m profit impact from the change in the Ogden discount rate from 2.5% to -0.75% that was announced by the UK Government on 27 February 2017.
Net finance costs Finance costs in the year were 17.2m 2016: 24.0m, with the reduction due to lower interest costs on lower average borrowings, a lower charge associated with the pension scheme and the ending of the charge associated with the unwinding of the discount on the deferred consideration associated with Destinology.
Tax expense The Groups tax expense for the year was 36.0m 2016: 28.1m representing a tax effective rate of 18.6% 2016: 15.9%.
The current year benefited from a 2.7m one-off positive impact from the utilisation under group relief rules of tax losses brought forward from the Allied business that was disposed of on 1 December 2015.
The prior year benefited from a 7.6m one-off reduction in the tax expense due to the utilisation under group relief rules of tax losses from Acromas, which arose when Saga was a part of the Acromas Group.
Going forward the tax charge is likely to be more in line with the underlying corporation tax rate.
Earnings per share The Groups basic earnings per share were 14.1p 2016: 12.7p, with basic earnings per share from continuing operations for the same period of 14.1p 2016: 13.3p.
Dividends The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 5.8p per share, which, combined with the interim dividend of 2.7p per share, will deliver a total dividend for the financial year ending 31 January 2017 of 8.5p per share 2016: 7.2p.
This equates to a payout ratio 2 of 62% compared with the Groups basic earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding derivatives and the Ogden rate impact 2016: 57% excluding the one-off benefit of Acromas tax losses.
Saga offers a share alternative in the form of a dividend re-investment plan DRIP for those shareholders who wish to elect to use their dividend payments to purchase additional Shares in the Group, rather than receive a cash payment.
The last date for shareholders to elect to participate in the DRIP will be 5 June 2017.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 31 Strategic report Group Chief Financial Officers review continued Cash flow and liquidity The Group delivered an excellent cash flow performance in the year to 31 January 2017, achieving an available operating cash flow of 217.6m, 88.4% of Trading EBITDA.
This cash flow increased by 39.5m on the previous period, driven by a higher payout from AICL as a result of the historical, strong underlying solvency capital position and the initial impact of the quota share on solvency capital.
The working capital outflow in the current year included the payment to Acromas for tax losses recognised intheprior year.

As at 31 January 2017, net debt was 464.8m, comprising 380.0m of gross debt and 100.0m of drawn revolving credit facility, offset by 15.2m of available cash.
This compared with net debt as at 31 January 2016 of 547.7m, comprising 480.0m of gross debt and 75.0m of drawn revolving credit facility, offset by 7.3m of available cash.
It is the Group's intention to maintain a debt ratio of between 1.5 and 2.0 up to the delivery of the first ship expected in mid-2019.
The Group is on track to reduce its debt to the lower end of this range before any debt associated with the ship is drawn down.
Pensions Over the year, the valuation of the Groups pension scheme has strengthened on an IAS19R basis by 5.1m to a deficit of 13.7m January 2016: deficit 18.8m.
12m to 12m to Saga Scheme Jan 2017 Jan 2016 Fair value of scheme assets 276.8m 218.6m Present value of defined benefit obligation 290.5m 237.4m Defined benefit scheme liability 13.7m 18.8m The strengthening has been driven by a 58.2m increase in the fair value of the scheme assets to 276.8m January 2016: 218.6m.
This was offset by an increase in the scheme liabilities of 53.1m to 290.5m January 2016: 237.4m, driven by a fall in corporate bond yields over the period and an increase in the expectation of the future rate of inflation.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 32 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Net assets Since 31 January 2016, total assets and liabilities have reduced by 53.3m and 160.3m respectively, increasing overall net assets by 107.0m.
Total assets have reduced primarily as a result of a decrease in financial assets of 44.4m, which coincides with the release of surplus solvency capital from the Groups underwriting business.
The reduction in total liabilities reflects a 90.7m reduction in financial liabilities following the repayment of debt during the period, enabled through continued positive cash generation and the release of surplus solvency capital.
This was coupled with an associated 61.0m reduction in gross insurance contract liabilities in line with further positive claims experience throughout the year, and a reduction in trade and other payables of 9.1m reflecting a reduction in accruals for costs relating to the build of the new ship and non-trading costs that were paid during the year.

The net impact on profit of the quota share was a 1.6m cost.
Travelrevenue increased by 2.1% to432.0m, as the impact of the Saga Sapphire scheduled maintenance was more than offset by strong revenue growth in touroperations.
The retail broking insurance business increased profit before tax by 9.1%, with a particularly strong performance in motor broking.
Underwriting profit reduced by 7.0m, as a result of reducing reserve releases and the cost of quota share.
Travel increased profits by 10.4%, even after the effect of the Sapphire scheduled maintenance, which had a profit impact of around 5m.
Emerging businesses and central costs saw an 8.8% decrease in losses before tax reflecting the reduction in finance costs.
Overall profit before tax grew by 9.1% to 138.0m 2016: 126.5m.
Across each of our products, we have balanced volume and profit to deliver this strong result.
The results for motor broking reflect the benefit of the number of initiatives that have been implemented during 2015 and 2016, with growth in both revenue and profit before tax, which increased by 38.0m and 16.6m respectively.
The introduction of the motor panel in summer 2015 contributed 3m of additional profit in the year, with around 30% of net premium for renewal policies now being placed with third party underwriters by the end of the year.
Given the different risk profile of drivers underwritten by external underwriters, these policies had an average gross written premium significantly higher than those underwritten in-house, generating an additional net revenue and profit per policy.
The written to earned benefit associated withthe growth in the motor panel contributed an additional 4m of profit.
Improved yield management contributed additional profit of 4m, with modest growth in Saga core motor policies being achieved with a lower level of discounting.
The full year impact of Bennetts, acquired on 1 July 2015, contributed an additional 2m profit, coupled with 4m of further written to earned benefit largely driven by the introduction of the arrangement fee in November 2015.
In a home market with stable average customer premiums and modest claims inflation increasing net rates, we chose to maintain volumes at a similar level, leading to consistent revenues of 89.8m 2016: 90.0m, with a small reduction in profit to 61.2m 2016: 63.4m.
Revenue and profit before tax from other insurance lines was 80.4m and 31.6m respectively 2016: 82.4m and 34.5m, withhigher revenues from both private medical and travel insurance being offset by revenue in the prior year from the legal services product, which was discontinued at the end of 2015, and a decrease in credit hire and repair income.
Core policies decreased slightly to 381k 2016: 383k, which was mainly due to a reduction in pet insurance policies sold.
Profit was impactedby a more challenging travel market towards the end of the year, with net rate pressure becoming prevalent duetothedepreciation of sterling.

This was due to the introduction of the motor panel, which has resulted in the likelihood of higher-risk, higher-premium motor policies now being underwritten by third party underwriters, and which has led to a fall in both AICLs earned policy volumes and average earned premiums.
This in turn has resulted in lower claims costs, which, coupled with favourable claims experience, decreased by 11.2% to 195.9m 2016: 220.6m.
Favourable experience in small and large personal injury claims enabled the business to release 63.0m of reserves held in respect of previous accident years, 5.0m lower than the previous year.
When excluding the effect of the reserve releases and the impact of the quota share, the underwriting business delivered 1 a broadly stable pure combined operating ratio of 99.6%.
The reduced level of reserve releases, combined with the net cost of the new quota share agreement of 1.6m, for which there was no comparable cost in the prior year, has resulted in a decrease in the profit before tax from underwriting activity to77.1m 2016: 84.1m.
The Ogden rate change had an additional net profit impact of 4.0m, reducing the reported profit beforetax from underwriting to 73.1m.

This reflects a continued shift in product mix towards higher value, higher margin long-haul river cruise and third party cruise products.
Profit before tax from tour operations grew by 32.2% to 11.5m.
This was due to three factors.
Firstly, the increased revenue generated greater margin.
Secondly, a programme of back office redesign and cost control initiatives enabled the business to mitigate any cost inflation and hold its operating expenses flat.
Finally, the prior year included a trading loss associated with the Bel Jou hotel that was sold on 20 July 2016.
Overall profit margin improved to 3.3% 2016: 2.6%.
Saga Cruising delivered revenue of 81.9m 2016: 86.2m.
The Saga Sapphire was out of operation for scheduled maintenance for 63 days between April and June, which impacted revenue and profit by approximately 9m and 5m respectively.
Offsetting this was an improvement in yields, enabled through various value enhancements to the cruise product offering, including free wine with lunch and dinner, a newly established cruise services team and other enhancements to the customer experience.
Profit before tax from the cruising business was 3.4m 2016: 4.8m.

The overall loss before tax from this segment reduced by 8.8% to 42.6m 2016: 46.7m.
This was due to a reduction in finance costs due to lower levels of debt and a decrease in LIBOR, and a reduction in the non-trading items due to IPO expenses in the prior year, offset by an increase in operating expenses reflecting the increased level of investment in the healthcare, personal finance and retirement villages businesses.
Financial outlook and guidance During the year ending 31 January 2018, profits from insurance broking are expected to increase with improved yield management, operational and marketing efficiencies and the ongoing positive impact of the motor panel.
With the strong growth in revenue on forward travel reservations combined with the additional positive effects of the efficiency initiatives, profitability for the travel business is expected to step forward strongly year on year, primarily within the tour operating businesses.
The uplift in Cruise capacity and profit will be limited due to two dry docks taking place in the current year, leading to 41 days when the ships are out of service.
With average net debt expected to be significantly lower year on year, finance costs are expected to reduce again in the coming year.
Reserve releases are expected to reduce again this year and increased investments will be made in membership and our future insurance broking platform.
Subject to market conditions remaining materially consistent, the Group is aiming to deliver ongoing consistent profit growth thisyear.
While the Groups leverage reduced significantly in the year to 31 January 2017, this benefited from the one-off move towards a sustainable, longer term solvency ratio level and therefore the rate of leverage reduction will be lower in the coming year.
The Group is retaining the target debt range of 1.5 to 2.0 times Net Debt to Trading EBITDA, consistent with the dividend payout ratio of 50% to 70% of net earnings.
