Financial review We have achieved our fifth consecutive year of revenue growth at or above 5%, and delivered a good set of results in an investment year.
Group financial performance Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are presented on an adjusted basis for the year ended 30 June 2017.
For comparative amounts in the prior year down to operating profit, numbers are translated at a constant currency rate of 1.16:1 being the average exchange rate prevailing in the twelve months to 30 June 2017, while revenue also excludes the benefit from the 53rd week in the prior year.
Adjusted results exclude items which may distort comparability in order to provide a measure of underlying performance.
Such items arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the Group but which management believes should be separately identified to help explain underlying performance.
Further details of the adjusting items impacting the Group can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
A reconciliation of the Groups statutory and adjusted consolidated income statement can be found in the Non-GAAP measures section of the Andrew Griffith consolidated financial statements on page 141.
