Defined benefit pension scheme assets at 30th June 2017 increased to 170.7m from 149.2m at 30th June 2016, representing investment performance during the year.
Pension fund liabilities increased from 217.0m to 237.5m, reflecting changes in the underlying assumptions applied, in particular the reduction in the discount rate used for the UK pension scheme.
Under the 2015 recovery plan the liabilities are calculated on the basis of funding to selfsufficiency.
The recovery plan provides for charges over certain UK properties to the value of 66.6m and the escrow account.
For the UK defined benefit pension scheme, a guide to the sensitivity of the value of the respective liabilities is as follows: Valuation sensitivity Variation Approximate effect on liabilities UK discount rate Increase decrease by 0.5% -21.3m 24.8m UK future inflation Increase decrease by 0.5% 17.7m -18.3m UK mortality Increased life by one year 7.4m UK early retirement One year earlier than assumed 6.4m 48 Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Net cash B fd profit after tax Non cash items Tax paid Capital spend Disposal proceeds Capitalised R & D Transfer from escrow Dividends paid Cash C fd Strategic report Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Restatements and alternative performance measures Restatements to the 2016 results have arisen from the following items: the R&D tax credit previously reported in the tax charge has been reclassified and is now reported in cost of sales and credited against the groups R&D expenditure in line with international accounting standards: the allocation of profits between continuing and discontinued operations: and the impact of certain foreign currency forward contracts used as hedging instruments for future incoming currency cash flows that did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under IAS 39 which has resulted in the prior year profit before tax being reduced by 25.8m, with a corresponding credit in the other comprehensive income.
This year an 8m gain has been recorded in statutory profit before tax as a result of this accounting treatment.
There was no impact on the group net assets, cash balances or future cash flows.
The Board has introduced alternative performance measures adjusted profit before tax, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share to report the results on the basis that all forward contracts are accounted for as effective hedges.
These measures will be the basis by which the Board evaluates the Groups performance as they better represent the underlying trading of the Group.
The tables below show the effects of the restatements on the previous years results and the details of the adjustments between statutory profit before tax and adjusted profit before tax.

As an international group, the main exposure is in respect of foreign currency risk on the trading transactions undertaken by group companies and on the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The following information includes disclosures which are required by IFRS and are an integral part of the financial statements.
Weekly groupwide cash management reporting and forecasting is in place to facilitate management of this currency risk.
The operations of group treasury, which is situated at head office, are governed by Board-approved policies.
All Sterling and foreign currency balances not immediately required for group operations are placed on short-term deposit with leading international highly-rated financial institutions.
The Group uses a number of financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk, such as foreign currency borrowings to hedge the exposure on the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries and forward exchange contracts to hedge a significant proportion of anticipated foreign currency cash inflows.
There are forward contracts in place to hedge against the Groups Euro, US Dollar and Japanese Yen cash inflows.
The Group does not speculate with derivative financial instruments.
See note 20 for an analysis of cash balances and currency borrowings at the year end.
Investment for the future We will continually look to the long-term growth of the Group and to invest in the research and development of new products, improving manufacturing and production processes to provide capacity for the future, and expanding our marketing and support presence around the world.
