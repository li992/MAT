Financial Review THE FINANCIAL MODEL The Groups strategy is to attract and retain retail Funds under Management FUM on which we receive an annual management fee for as long as the clients remain invested.
This is the principal source of income for the Group out of which we meet the overheads of the business, invest in growing the Partnership and invest in acquiring new FUM.
The level of income is dependent on the level of client funds and the level of asset values.
In addition, since around half of our business does not generate net cash result in the first six years, the level of income will increase as a result of new business from six years ago becoming cash generative.
This deferral of cash generation means the business always has six years worth of funds in the gestation period.
More information about our fees on Funds under Management can be found in Section 1 on page 28.
Group expenditure is carefully managed with clear targets set for growth in Establishment expenses in the year.
Many other expenses increase with business levels and are met from margins in the products.
The Group also invests in ensuring the quality of our proposition for clients and Partners, through investment in new client services and existing IT systems.
Finally, we are also looking to the future, with investment in our back-office infrastructure programme and strategic initiatives, including the Academy, Asia and DFM.
More information about our expenses can be found in Section 2 on page 30.
A small proportion of Group expenditure is required to support management of existing funds, but the majority of expenditure is investment in growing the Partnership and acquiring new funds together with investment in future back-office and administrative capabilities.
Given the importance of FUM to profit generation by the business, we provide an analysis of the FUM make-up and development in Section 1.
Section 2 covers Expenses, which is the other significant driver of profits, with Sections 3-5 reporting on the performance of the business on the IFRS, Cash and EEV result bases, and providing commentary on solvency and liquidity.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT In line with statutory reporting requirements we report profits assessed on an International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis.
However, given the long-term nature of the business and the high level of investment in new business generation each year, we believe the IFRS result does not provide an easy guide to the cash likely to emerge in future years, nor does it reflect the total economic value of the business.
Therefore, consistent with last year, we complement IFRS reporting with additional disclosure on various alternative performance measures APMs.
APMs are not defined by the relevant financial reporting framework which for the Group is IFRS, but we use them to provide greater insight to the financial performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group and the way it is managed.
Summary information about the key APMs used in our Financial Review is provided in the following table, and we also provide a complete Glossary of Alternative Performance Measures on page 204, in which we define each APM and explain why it is used and, if applicable, how the measure can be reconciled to the IFRS financial statements.

As a result when policyholder tax increases, the charges also increase.
Given these offsetting items can be large, and typically dont perform in line with the business, it is beneficial to be able to identify the two elements separately.
We therefore refer to that part of the overall tax charge, which is deemed attributable to policyholders, as policyholder tax, and the rest as shareholder tax.

Due to the retail distribution review RDR regulation change in 2013, there was a step change in the progression of these items in our financial statements, which resulted in significant accounting presentation changes despite the fundamentals of our  business remaining unchanged.
We therefore believe it is useful to consider the IFRS result having removed the impact of movements in these intangibles as it better reflects the underlying performance of the business.

This is followed by information about the income the Group earns from managing these funds, together with the profile of these earnings, and finally a geographical and segmental analysis of the funds under management.
Movement in Funds Under Management During 2017 we have seen gross new funds of 14.60 billion 2016: 11.35 billion, growth of 29% and a net inflow of funds under management of 9.51 billion 2016: 6.78 billion, growth of 40%.
The investment return contributed 6.20 billion 2016: 8.71 billion to funds under management during the year reflecting growth in world stock markets.
Given the strong net inflow, and the positive investment performance, funds under management increased to 90.75 billion 2016: 75.31 billion.

The average net annual management fee retained by the Group net of investment advisory fees and Partner remuneration is c. 0.77% post tax.
However, due to our product structure, investment and pension business does not generate net cash result after the initial margin during the first six years.
Consequently, the level of cash result we are reflecting today is not fully representative of the expected earnings from the funds we are managing, and will increase as a result of the new business from six years ago becoming net cash result generative.
This deferral of cash result generation means there is always six years worth of business in the gestation period.
The table below provides an estimated current value, for illustrative purposes, of the funds under management in the gestation period.

If all the business reached the end of the gestation period, it would then contribute some 235.6 million to the annual post-tax cash result, calculated using the Groups average net annual management fee of 0.77% post tax.

This is likely to result in costs in 2018 for individuals starting their training to be productive.
In 2017, 124 being ahead of 2017. individuals graduated from the Academy and the Next Generation Academy, and we expect the 2018 equivalent to be 140.
By the end of 2018, we expect to have over 500 Academy and Next Generation Academy graduates active as advisers, and so, reflecting the fact that this has become core to our operations, from 2019 onwards we will include the cost of our Academy within our new business Operating cash result.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 St. James's Place plc 29 Financial Review continued SECTION 2: EXPENSES Management Expenses The table below provides a breakdown of the management expenditure before tax : Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December Note 2017 2016 Million Million Establishment costs 1 191.7 160.7 Other performance related costs 2 133.5 104.0 Operational development costs 3 19.3 17.0 Strategic development costs 4 6.7 6.6 Academy costs 5 8.2 7.2 Asia costs 6 15.6 13.8 DFM costs 7 18.7 12.9 Back-office infrastructure development 8 26.8 20.9 Regulatory fees 9 8.3 8.3 FSCS levy 9 21.2 17.2 450.0 368.6 Notes: 1.
Establishment costs are the running costs of the Groups infrastructure, which although relatively fixed in nature will inevitably increase with inflation, but also as the infrastructure expands to manage higher numbers of clients, growing numbers of advisers and increasing business volumes.
Establishment costs in 2017 have been higher than expected due to strong business growth.
Other performance related costs, for both Partners and employees, vary with the level of new business and operating profit performance of the business.
Operational development costs represent business as usual expenditure to support the business, such as the on-going development of our investment proposition and our technology, including focus on cyber security.
We expect costs in 2018 will grow in line with the business.
As a growth business we are constantly looking to new opportunities and expect to incur a small level of ongoing expense associated with pursuing other strategic developments.
We will continue to explore opportunities and undertake appropriate initiatives.
The Academy is an important strategic investment for the future and we are continuing to grow our investment in this programme.
Costs have increased in recent years as we have increased the number of students within the programme and launched more regional academies.
Our investment in the Academy will continue in 2018 with expected costs of some 10.0 million.
Our expansion into Asia through operations in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai is intended to provide diversification of our growth model through exporting our successful wealth management proposition to new markets, starting with the UK expat market.
Costs reflect both the ongoing operational costs, but also the development costs associated with growing these businesses to achieve sustainable scale.
Our investment will continue in 2018 and we expect expenses to increase by 2 to 3 million, but the level of investment reflected in the Cash result will be similar as a result of offsetting increases in Asia income.
Our DFM operation, which became part of the SJP proposition in March 2016 following the Rowan Dartington acquisition, continues to grow quickly.
Investment is required to support this growth, and we expect that expenses in 2018 will be some 6 to 7 million higher.
However, the level of investment reflected in the Cash result will be at a similar level as a result of offsetting increases in DFM income.
Our back-office infrastructure programme is a multi-year initiative to upgrade our administration so it can support our future business goals.
Having achieved the migration of our ISA and Unit Trust proposition to our new Bluedoor platform in 2015, the focus in 2016 and early 2017 has been the launch of a new Retirement Account with the intention of migrating pension and drawdown business onto the new system in 2018.
With the final key migrations being planned, we expect heightened activity levels through 2018 and into 2019 in order to complete the project.
This is likely to result in costs in 2018 being ahead of 2017.
The costs of operating in a regulated sector include fees charged by the regulators and our contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS.
Our position as a market-leading provider of advice, means we make a very substantial contribution to supporting the industry compensation scheme, the FSCS, thereby providing protection for clients of other sector businesses that fail.
Over the last few years, the levy has been at an elevated level and we remain hopeful that it will return to a more normalised level in future, albeit we now expect a fourth year of an elevated contribution in the 2018 19 funding year.
The FSCS levy is met by our various regulated companies and is split 18.9 million 2016: 16.5 million via the Distribution business and 2.3 million 2016: 0.7 million via the Life and Unit Trust regulated business.

These costs are met from corresponding margins and any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not directly impact the profitability of the Group.
Costs in 2017 reflect double matching of contributions for the year in recognition of the Groups 25th Anniversary.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 St. James's Place plc 31 Financial Review continued SECTION 3: INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS IFRS reporting is a statutory requirement and, although the level of non-cash accounting adjustments are such that it does not reflect the pattern of cash emergence in the Group, its statutory importance means that there are two key measures used that are based upon it.
These are: Profit before shareholder tax This is a profit measure based on IFRS which removes the impact of policyholder tax.
Underlying profit This is profit before shareholder tax adjusted to remove the impact of accounting for DAC, DIR and PVIF.
Of these two measures, Underlying profit is considered to be the most helpful for assessing operating performance given its greater similarity with the way in which cash emerges within the Group.
Further information on these IFRS-based alternative performance measures can be found on page 26.
IFRS Profit Before Tax The following table demonstrates the way in which profit before shareholder tax is presented in the IFRS consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 126: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Million Million IFRS profit before tax 342.1 486.3 Policyholder tax 156.0 345.7 Profit before shareholder tax 186.1 140.6 Policyholder tax is accounted for as part of the Groups own corporation tax arrangements.
The amount to be accounted for is a reflection of investment return in the underlying funds.
The significant reduction in policyholder tax in 2017 is matched by an equivalent reduction in policyholder fund tax deductions that are credited to fee and commission income within the IFRS statement of comprehensive income, and hence IFRS profit before policyholder tax.
These fund deductions are similarly unrelated to the performance of the business and for this reason profit after policyholder tax i. e. Profit before shareholder tax is the measure used.
IFRS Profit After Tax Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Million Million Profit before shareholder tax 186.1 140.6 Shareholder tax 40.3 28.9 IFRS profit after tax 145.8 111.7 Shareholder tax reflects the tax charge attributable to shareholders and is closely related to the performance of the business.

The key driver for this improvement in performance is the increase in fee income from higher funds under management during the year.
Distribution Business An analysis of the distribution result shown above is as follows: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Million Million Distribution gross profit 105.4 87.1 Administrative expenses 93.2 73.1 Investment in Partnership growth 11.3 10.2 FSCS levy 18.9 16.5 Distribution loss 18.0 12.7 Asia distribution loss 13.9 13.2 Total distribution loss 31.9 25.9 The result for the Distribution business reflects continued significant investment in future growth, investment in our new businesses in Asia, and the impact of the FSCS costs which continue to run at elevated rates.

Impact of RDR in 2013 One of the impacts of RDR in 2013 was that under IFRS, from that point on, fewer expenses would qualify for deferral.
This has resulted in a period of transition where the continued amortisation of expenses previously deferred will significantly outweigh new expenses deferred.
Although this position will eventually reverse, it results in a net negative impact on IFRS profits until the reversal takes place.
Impact of the 2016 Reassessment of the Investment Contract Liability The reassessment carried out in 2016 had, and will have, no impact on the IFRS profit and comprehensive income for the year.
This is because amounts that were recognised as an accelerated emergence of Cash result in 2016, together with the accelerated emergence of Cash result reflected in the New business margin for 2017, have been deferred over a six year period starting on the date the business was written.
This is the key driver behind both the increase in income deferred and also the amount of amortisation.
Impact of the Continued Growth in New Business Continued growth in new business has the effect of increasing the amount of income deferred in each accounting period and the corresponding DIR amortisation over the following six years.
With growth in new business comes an increase in costs required to be deferred.
These are then amortised over 14 years but as can be seen above, the amount of expense that qualifies for deferral is significantly exceeded by the amount of income required to be deferred.
This will result in a continued net deferral of emergence of IFRS profits, and the net amortisation impact will grow in line with the long-term business growth rate.

Further analysis on the Cash result basis is presented in the Supplementary Information on pages 190 to 198.
Solvency II Net Assets Balance Sheet The Groups consolidated IFRS balance sheet is largely dominated by a number of material balances that reflect policyholder interests in unit linked liabilities together with the underlying assets that are held to match them.
To determine the Solvency II net assets balance sheet, policyholder interests in unit-linked assets and liabilities, plus a number of other items including intangible assets and certain accounting balances such as DIR, DAC and associated deferred tax, are removed.
Given the relevance of the resulting Solvency II net assets balance sheet to shareholders, we believe it is helpful to show how it is calculated and how the cash result has contributed to its year on year movement.

The cash result is derived from the movement in the IFRS Balance Sheet and the Solvency II Net Assets balance sheet within it as shown above.
The following table shows an analysis of the Cash result using the following measures: Operating cash result This measure represents the regular emergence of cash from day-to-day business operations.
Underlying cash result This measure is the Operating cash result adjusted for the expense of a number of strategic investments which are being incurred and expensed in year but which are expected to create long-term benefit.
Cash result This measure is the Underlying cash result adjusted for certain one-off items together with the short-term costs associated with the back-office infrastructure project.

The net annual management fee is the manufacturing margin the Group retains from funds under management after payment of the associated costs for example, investment advisory fees and Partner remuneration.
Broadly speaking the Group receives an average net annual management fee of 0.77% post tax of funds under management 2016: 0.77% post tax.
As noted on page 28 however, our investment and pension business product structure means that these products do not generate net cash result after the initial margin during the first six years, which we call the gestation period.
This effect is reflected through the reduction in fees in gestation period line.
This deduction represents the offsetting of management fee income through the gestation period.
The reduction in fees line has been impacted in 2017 by the reassessment of investment contract liabilities that took place at the end of 2016.
The reassessment had the impact of bringing forward 267.0 million of cash emergence that would otherwise have emerged in the following six years within net income from funds under management.
Margin arising from new business: This is the cash impact of new business in the year, reflecting growth in new business, production related expenses and mix of new business.
As noted previously, the reassessment of the investment contract liability at 31 December 2016 resulted in an increase in the level of initial margin on investment and pension business.
This was the main driver for the increase between the two periods.
Expenses: These reflect the expenses of running the Group and more detail is provided in the table on page 30.
In line with the rest of the table they are presented after allowance for tax.
Shareholder interest: This is the income accruing on the investments and cash held for regulatory purposes together with the interest received on the surplus capital held by the Group.
Tax relief from capital losses: In recent years, a deferred tax asset has been established for historic capital losses which are now regarded as being capable of utilisation over the medium term.
Utilisation during the year of 12.1 million tax value 2016: 12.6 million was slightly ahead of our expected rate of c. 10 to 12 million benefit in a year.
Miscellaneous: This represents the cash flow of the business not covered in any of the other categories, including ongoing administration expenses and associated policy charges, together with utilisation of the deferred tax asset in respect of prior years unrelieved expenses due to structural timing differences in the life company tax computation.
Strategic investments, including back-office infrastructure: These reflect significant investments in developing our business for the future.
Further analysis of the expenses associated with these initiatives is presented in Section 2 on page 30 but all are expected to result in either additional funds Academy, Asia and DFM or expense savings Back-office infrastructure in the future.
Advice margin and fees generated in Asia, and all fees generated by DFM, are reflected in the relevant line.
Variance: This principally reflects the impact of double matching for the Charitable Foundation during the year and other 25th anniversary costs.
Costs arising from reviewing charges on legacy business were funded by one-off investment profits arising in the year.
The prior year also reflected costs associated with reviewing charges in legacy business cohorts 2016: 6.6 million.
Liquidity Included in the Solvency II net assets balance sheet are holdings in Fixed Interest Securities, Collective Investment Schemes and other cash and cash equivalents.
It is our policy to always hold such assets in high credit quality liquid assets.
An analysis of liquid asset holdings as at 31 December 2017 is provided below: 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Million Million Fixed interest securities: government bonds 46.1 47.7 Collective investment schemes: money market funds 1,416.8 867.4 Cash and cash equivalents 274.7 345.9 Total liquid asset holdings 1,737.6 1,261.0 The Groups holdings in money market funds and cash and cash equivalent are spread across a number of different AAA rated unitised money market funds and approved banking counterparties.
Diversification ensures that the Groups appetite for credit and liquidity risk are appropriately managed.
St. James's Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38 Strategic Report St. James's Place Charitable Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information In the normal course of business, the Group is expected to generate regular, positive cash flow from annual management income exceeding expenses.
As noted previously, future growth in cash flow is driven by new business, but in the short-term growth will reflect the transition as new business from six years ago becomes cash generative.
The key calls on liquidity are payments of Group dividends and investment to support the business.
As noted previously, our expected dividend policy is based on a pay-out ratio to Underlying cash of 80%.
We believe this will enable us to continue to invest in the business to support our growth aspirations.
Solvency St. Jamess Place has a business model and risk appetite that results in underlying assets being held that fully match with client investments.
Our clients can access their investments on-demand and because the encashment value is matched, movements in equity markets, currency markets, interest rates, mortality, mortality and longevity have very little impact on our ability to meet liabilities.
We also have a prudent approach to investing shareholder funds and surplus assets in cash, AAA-rated money market funds and highly rated government securities.
The overall effect of the business model and risk appetite is a resilient solvency position capable of enabling liabilities to be met even through adverse market conditions.
Our Life businesses are subject to the Solvency II Capital regime which applied for the first time in 2016.
Given the relative simplicity of our business compared to many, if not most, other organisations that fall within the scope of Solvency II, we have continued to manage the solvency of the business on the basis of holding assets to match client unit-linked liabilities plus a Management Solvency Buffer.
This has ensured that, not only can we meet client liabilities at all times beyond the Solvency II requirement of 1 in 200 years, but we also have a prudent level of protection against other risks to the business.
At the same time, we have ensured that the resulting capital held meets with the requirements of the Solvency II regime, to which we are ultimately accountable.
In the year ended 31 December 2016, we reassessed our approach to investment contract liabilities, and the revised approach of recording them at their encashment value resulted in a reduction in the liability of 267.0 million in the Life companies.
Although this exercise was completed at 31 December 2016, the need for further work on the MSB proxy in the second year of Solvency II was flagged and a decision was made to reallocate the 267.0 million to the MSB, temporarily, in order that we would continue to hold unchanged total capital while the review was ongoing.
However, at that point we explained that an assetliability matching exercise would likely result in a reduction in our corporate exposure to market risk, and would therefore likely result in a reduction in risk capital requirement.
During the second half of 2017 we have competed our review of the MSB.
The review was able to take into account stress and scenario testing completed as part of our 2017 ORSA process, together with our plans to continue investing in the business.
It has also taken account of a forward Capital Management approach within our largest insurance company, the UK Life company, that will require capital to be equal to 110% of the Solvency II standard formula requirement.
Given the risk profile of the business we consider this to be a prudent and sustainable policy.
Under normal circumstances we would expect the MSB to grow with the business, but as a result of this review we are able to reduce the MSB for the Life businesses this year from 437.0 million at 31 December 2016 to 355.0 million at 31 December 2017.
As previously noted, we plan to manage capital in the Life businesses in order to meet the MSB, and therefore at this valuation we will be releasing the excess assets including the reduction in MSB and reducing capital to be in line with the MSB.
The following table demonstrates the movement in the MSB for the Life business over the year: 2017 2016 Million Million Life MSB at 1 January 437.0 150.0 Reduction other increase in Life MSB 82.0 20.0 Increase in Life MSB due to investment contract liability reassessment 267.0 Life MSB at 31 December 355.0 437.0 The Groups overall Solvency II net assets position, MSB and management solvency ratios are as follows: Other 1 2 31 December 2017 Life Regulated Other Total 2016 Total Million Million Million Million Million Solvency II net assets 360.1 154.4 580.6 1,095.1 1,070.0 Management Solvency Buffer MSB 355.0 106.9 461.9 527.0 Management solvency ratio 101% 144% 1 After payment of year end intragroup dividend.

Solvency II net assets reflect the assets of the Group in excess of those matching the clients unit linked liabilities.
It includes a 144.1 million 2016: 157.7 million deferred tax asset which is not immediately fungible, although we expect it will be utilised over the next ten years.
The actual rate of utilisation will depend on business growth and external factors, particularly investment market conditions.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 St. James's Place plc 39 Financial Review continued Solvency II Balance Sheet Whilst we focus on Solvency II net assets and the MSB to manage solvency, we provide additional information about the Solvency II free asset position for information.
The presentation starts from the same Solvency II net assets, but includes recognition of an asset in respect of the expected Value of In-Force cash flows VIF and a Risk Margin RM reflecting the potential cost to secure the transfer of the business to a third party.
The Solvency II net assets, VIF and RM comprise the Own Funds, which is assessed against a Solvency Capital Requirement SCR, reflecting the capital required to protect against a range of 1 in 200 stresses.
The SCR is calculated on the Standard Formula approach.
No allowance has been made for Transitional Provisions in the calculation of Technical Provisions or SCR.
An analysis of the Solvency II position for our Group, split by regulated and non-regulated entities at the year end is presented in the table below: Other 1 2 31 December 2017 Life Regulated Other Total 2016 Total Million Million Million Million Million Solvency II net assets 360.1 154.4 580.6 1,095.1 1,070.0 Value of in-force VIF 3,244.3 3,244.3 2,707.9 Risk Margin 946.1 946.1 779.2 Own Funds A 2,658.3 154.4 580.6 3,393.3 2,998.7 Solvency capital requirement B 2,385.9 63.3 2,449.2 2,046.5 Solvency II free assets 272.4 91.1 580.6 944.1 952.2 Solvency ratio A B 111% 244% 139% 147% 1 After payment of year end intragroup dividend.
The solvency ratio after payment of the proposed Group final dividend is 133% at the year end 2016: 141%.
Solvency II Sensitivities The table below shows the estimated impact on the Solvency II Free Assets, the Solvency Capital Requirement and the Solvency Ratio from changes in various assumptions underlying the Solvency II calculations.
In each case, only the indicated item is varied relative to the restated values.
The solvency ratio is not very sensitive to changes in experience or assumptions, and can move counter-intuitively depending on circumstances, as demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis presented below: Solvency II Solvency II Capital Solvency Note Free Assets Requirement Ratio Million Million % Value at 31 December 2017 944.1 2,449.2 139% 100bp reduction in risk free rates, with corresponding change in fixed interest asset values 1 871.1 2,449.0 136% 10% increase in withdrawal rates 2 978.7 2,297.8 143% 10% reduction in market value of equity assets 3 892.2 2,197.3 141% 10% increase in expenses 4 903.5 2,447.6 137% 100bp reduction in assumed inflation 5 985.5 2,447.6 140% Notes: 1.
This is the key economic basis change sensitivity.
The business model is relatively insensitive to change in economic basis.
Note that the sensitivity assumes a corresponding change in all investment returns but no change in inflation.
The 10% increase is applied to the lapse rate.
For instance, if the lapse rate is 8% then a 10% sensitivity increase would reflect a change to 8.8%.
For the purposes of this sensitivity all unit linked funds are assumed to be invested in equities.
The actual mix of assets varies and in recent years the proportion invested directly in UK and overseas equities has exceeded 70%.
For the purposes of this all expenses are increased by 10%.
This reflects a 100bp reduction in the assumed RPI underlying the expense inflation calculation.
St. James's Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 Strategic Report St. James's Place Charitable Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information SECTION 5: EUROPEAN EMBEDDED VALUE EEV Wealth management differs from most other businesses, in that the expected shareholder income from the sale of a product emerges over a long period in the future.
We therefore complement the IFRS and cash results by providing additional disclosure on an EEV basis, which brings into account the net present value of the expected future cash flows.
We believe that a measure of total economic value of the Groups operating performance is useful to investors.
As in previous reporting, our EEV continues to be calculated on a basis determined in accordance with the EEV principles originally issued in May 2004 by the Chief Financial Officers Forum CFO Forum and supplemented in both October 2005 and, following the introduction of Solvency II, in April 2016.
Many of the principles and practices underlying EEV are similar to the requirements of Solvency II.
In 2017, we have made a number of small changes to our EEV methods and assumptions to align them as closely as possible.
For example, the value of the deferred tax assets arising from unrelieved expenses and historic capital losses has been set equal to the asset recognised on the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2017, where previously the EEV estimate had been based on a discounted cash flow approach.
These changes are reflected in the Economic assumption changes line.
The table below and accompanying notes summarise the profit before tax of the combined business: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Million Million Life business 647.2 501.4 Unit Trust and DFM business 397.2 266.8 Funds management business 1,044.4 768.2 Distribution business 31.9 25.9 Back-office infrastructure development 26.8 20.9 Other 67.2 47.8 EEV operating profit 918.5 673.6 Investment return variance 340.8 537.2 Economic assumption changes 29.8 12.4 EEV profit before tax 1,289.1 1,198.4 Tax 229.2 212.9 Corporation tax rate change 28.6 EEV profit after tax 1,059.9 1,014.1 Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Pence Pence EEV operating profit after tax basic earnings per share 143.9 105.9 EEV operating profit after tax diluted earnings per share 141.5 105.2 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 St. James's Place plc 41 Financial Review continued EEV Operating Profit Funds Management Business The funds management business operating profit has increased to 1,044.4 million 2016: 768.2 million and a full analysis of the result is shown below: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Million Million New business contribution 779.8 520.2 Profit from existing business unwind of the discount rate 209.5 199.6 experience variance 3.8 1.4 operating assumption change 44.0 18.6 Addition of Rowan Dartington 21.0 Investment income 7.3 7.4 Fund management business EEV operating profit 1,044.4 768.2 The new business contribution for the year at 779.8 million 2016: 520.2 million was some 50% higher than the prior year, reflecting both the increase in new business and operational economies of scale achieved as fixed expenses are spread across more new business.
The new business contribution has also benefitted from the assumption changes noted below, particularly from the persistency changes, and from the additional value associated with Retirement Account business compared to Retirement Plan business.
Further detail on the new business margin is provided on page 43.
The unwind of the discount rate for the year increased slightly to 209.5 million 2016: 199.6 million, reflecting the higher opening value of in-force business but offset by a lower discount rate of 4.5% 2016: 5.2%.
The experience variance during the year was small at 3.8 million 2016: 1.4 million, with positive retention experience offset by other negative variances.
The impact of operating assumption changes in the year was a positive 44.0 million 2016: 18.6 million as a result of higher retention assumptions reflecting positive experience for on-shore bond, ISA and Unit Trust business, and operational economies of scale noted above.
The investment income for the year was little changed at 7.3 million 2016: 7.4 million.
Distribution business, Back-office infrastructure development and Other The results for these items have already been commented on in the IFRS section on page 33.
Investment Return Variance The investment return variance reflects the capitalised impact on the future annual management fees resulting from the difference between the actual and assumed investment returns.
Given the size of our funds under management, a small difference can result in a large positive or negative variance.
The average investment return on our funds during the period was some 7% higher than the assumed investment return during the period, resulting in a positive investment return variance of 340.8 million 2016: 537.2 million.
Economic Assumption Changes The positive variance of 29.8 million arising in the year 2016: 12.4 million negative reflects the positive effect from the decrease in the long-term inflation rate which is offset by the expected impact from tax changes announced in the 2017 Budget.
In addition, there is a positive impact from aligning the EEV valuation approach with the Solvency II valuation with respect to economic assumptions and the valuation of deferred tax assets.
EEV Profit Before Tax The total EEV profit before tax for the year was 1,289.1 million 2016: 1,198.4 million.
The improvement is principally due to growth in the business between the two periods arising from both strong gross inflows and positive investment performance over the last twelve months.
Tax The tax charge at 229.2 million 2016: 212.9 million reflects the underlying result.
All future changes in corporation tax have been incorporated in the EEV calculation in previous reporting periods.
EEV Profit After Tax The EEV profit after tax was 1,059.9 million 2016: 1,014.1 million reflecting the movement in EEV profit before tax.
St. James's Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 Strategic Report St. James's Place Charitable Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information New Business Margin The largest single element of the EEV operating profit analysed in the previous section is the new business contribution.
The level of new business contribution generally moves in line with new business levels.
To demonstrate this link, and aid understanding of the results, we provide additional analysis of the new business margin margin.
This is calculated as the new business contribution divided by the gross inflows, and is expressed as a percentage.
The table below presents the margin before tax from our manufactured business: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Life business Investment New business contribution Million 130.2 108.3 Gross inflows Billion 2.49 2.28 Margin % 5.2 4.8 Pension New business contribution Million 363.5 207.9 Gross inflows Billion 7.26 5.12 Margin % 5.0 4.1 Unit Trust and DFM business New business contribution Million 286.1 204.0 Gross inflows Billion 4.85 3.95 Margin % 5.9 5.2 Total business New business contribution Million 779.8 520.2 Gross inflows Billion 14.60 11.35 Margin % 5.3 4.6 Post tax margin % 4.4 3.8 The overall margin for the year was higher at 5.3% 2016: 4.6% reflecting increases in margin across all categories of business.
Two particular drivers were key to the increases: Firstly, changes in retention assumptions to reflect positive experience for both insurance bond business, and unit trust ISA business resulted in projection of additional future profits.
Small improvements to pensions business also had a positive effect, as did recognition within the valuation of our new Retirement Account of the potential value of both the pre-retirement and post-retirement phases of this investment product.
Secondly, the margin was positively impacted by economies of scale as higher levels of business combined with the new administration tariff.
This new tariff better reflects the actual fixed and variable nature of the administration expenses than the previous tariff, and so, as the fixed proportion of the expenses are spread over a higher volume of business the value of the new business will grow.
Economic Assumptions The principal economic assumptions used within the cash flows at 31 December are set out below: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 % % Risk free rate 1.4 1.4 Inflation rate 3.2 3.4 Risk discount rate net of tax 4.5 4.5 Future investment returns: Gilts 1.4 1.4 Equities 4.4 4.4 Unit-linked funds 3.7 3.7 Expense inflation 3.6 3.8 The risk-free rate is set by reference to the yield on ten-year gilts.
Other investment returns are set by reference to the risk-free rate.
The inflation rate is derived from the implicit inflation in the valuation of ten-year index-linked gilts.
This rate is increased to reflect higher increases in earnings related expenses.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 St. James's Place plc 43 Financial Review continued EEV Sensitivities The table below shows the estimated impact on the combined life and unit trust reported value of new business and EEV to changes in various EEV calculated assumptions.
The sensitivities are specified by the EEV principles and reflect reasonably possible levels of change.
Change in European Change in new business Embedded contribution Value Note Pre-tax Post-tax Post-tax Million Million Million Value at 31 December 2017 779.8 642.0 5,647.7 100bp reduction in risk free rates, with corresponding change in fixed interest asset values 1 21.3 17.6 70.8 10% reduction in withdrawal rates 2 62.4 51.4 325.4 10% reduction in market value of equity assets 3 566.1 10% reduction in expenses 4 14.9 12.4 53.6 100bp increase in assumed inflation 5 23.7 19.6 88.1 Notes: 1.
The 10% reduction is applied to the lapse rate.
For instance, if the lapse rate is 8% then a 10% sensitivity reduction would reflect a change to 7.2%.
For the purposes of this sensitivity only non-fixed elements of the expenses are reduced by 10%.
This reflects a 100bp increase in the assumed RPI underlying the expense inflation calculation.
Change in European Change in new business Embedded contribution Value Pre-tax Post-tax Post-tax Million Million Million Value at 31 December 2017 100bp reduction in risk discount rate 92.8 76.4 430.0 Although not directly relevant under a market-consistent valuation, this sensitivity shows the level of adjustment which would be required to reflect differing investor views of risk.
Analysis of the EEV Result and Net Assets per Share The table below provides a summarised breakdown of the embedded value position at the reporting dates: 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Million Million Value of in-force Life 3,182.3 2,636.2 Unit Trust and DFM 1,370.3 1,044.9 Solvency II net assets 1,095.1 1,070.0 Total embedded value 5,647.7 4,751.1 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Pence Pence Net asset value per share 1,067.5 900.7 As noted above, the 2017 EEV result reflects the new terms and conditions of our Retirement Account product, which incorporates both pre-retirement and post-retirement phases of this investment in the same product.
The impact of reflecting both phases is a higher new business margin which has helped drive the overall increase in margin for pension business from 4.1% to 5.0%.
Our experience is that much of our Retirement Plan business converts into Drawdown business at retirement.
However, because of the way the legal terms of our existing Retirement Plan business are written, and in line with the EEV guidelines, we are required to defer recognition of the additional value from the Drawdown plan until it is crystallised.
If instead we were to assess the future value of Retirement Plan business beyond the immediate contract boundary in a more holistic fashion, in line with Retirement Account, this would result in an increase of approximately 400 million in Life EV.
