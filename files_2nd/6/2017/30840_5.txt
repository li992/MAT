Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Strategic Report PERFORMANCE REVIEW Key performance indicators KPIs The Group tracks its performance using two operating KPIs, three financial KPIs and one funding target that the Board believes are key indicators of its progress against its strategic and financial targets.
In addition the Group has a number of guidance measures at a Group, divisional and business level, details of which are set out in this section and in the financial performance section on pages 23 to 31.
These are non-GAAP measures, the derivation of which is shown in the notes to the financial statements referenced in the heading to each measure.
Where the Groups KPI is based on a non-GAAP measure, rather than its GAAP equivalent, this is because in the Directors view the non-GAAP measure provides them with a better indicator of the performance of the underlying business.

These improvements give the Group a Progressive dividend policy, underpinned by strong sustainable competitive advantage, however the Group must cashgeneration ensure an appropriate balance between managing the cost base of the business whilst maintaining the strong proposition that has been put in place.
Cost efficiency programmes have been put in place across the Group, particularly in the General Merchanting and Consumer divisions.
In Wickes, a significant cost management exercise was carried out in late 2017, to reset the cost base to an appropriate level for 2018.
Costs have already been reduced by 8m, which accounts for around half of the profit reduction in 2017.
A wider cost efficiency programme is extending into 2018 to reduce waste and cost in order to offset pressure from general cost inflation.
In General Merchanting, there has been significant operating cost investment in support of the capital investments made to develop the distribution centre network, particularly in extending the coverage of the heavyside range centre HRC network to all branches in England and Wales and in improving the customer proposition in branches and online.
Whilst the operating cost investments are well received by customers and are delivering a positive return on investment, other operating cost pressure from wages, rent, rates and depreciation is also increasing, and the lack of sales volume progression makes it difficult to absorb these extra costs in the short term.
Actions have been taken to improve productivity and efficiency across the business by reducing costs in support functions and creating flexibility in the cost base.
This will remain a focus area throughout 2018.
