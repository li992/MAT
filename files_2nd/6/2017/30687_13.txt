Net debt Net debt is a useful indicator of the Groups indebtedness, financial flexibility and capital structure because it indicates the level of cash borrowings after taking account of cash and cash equivalents within the Groups business that could be utilised to pay down the outstanding cash borrowings.
Net debt is defined as current and non-current borrowings plus unamortised arrangement fees and the equity component of any compound debt instrument less cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups definition of net debt does not include the Groups finance leases as the Groups focus is the management of cash borrowings and a finance lease is viewed as deferred capital investment.
The value of the Groups finance lease liabilities asat 31 December 2017 was $228.1 million current and $1,317.5 million non-current: it should be noted that these balances are recorded gross for operated assets and are therefore not representative of the Groups net exposure underthese contracts.
