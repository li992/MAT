Continued focus on cost control, as well as a more favourable hedged US Dollar to Sterling rate, have achieved a reduction in our fixed cash costs despite growth in the business.
Statutory profit before tax was $272 million, which has increased from the 2016 statutory loss before tax of $272 million largely as a result of the non-cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $379 million in 2016.
Statutory earnings per share were 15.3 cents 2016: loss of 15.8 cents per share.
Our adjusted profit before tax was $384 million, up from $205 million in the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share were 20.3 cents 2016: 10.4 cents.
The majority of this improvement was caused by the adjusted performance fee profit before tax increasing to $181 million, up from $27 million in 2016, which reflects solid performance across our strategies.
