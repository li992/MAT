14 MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL REVIEW UNDERLYING NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES The Group uses underlying income statement reporting as non-IFRS measures in evaluating performance and as a method to provide shareholders with clear and consistent reporting.
The underlying measures are intended to remove volatility associated with certain types of one-off income and charges from reported earnings.
Historically EBITDA and underlying EBITDA were disclosed as supplemental non-IFRS fi financial performance measures because they are regarded as useful metrics to analyse the performance of the business from period to period.
Measures like underlying EBITDA are used by analysts and investors in assessing performance.
The rationale for using non-IFRS measures: it tracks the underlying operational performance of the Group and its operating segments by separating out one-off and exceptional items: non-IFRS measures are used by management for budgeting, planning and monthly fi financial reporting: and non-IFRS measures are used by management in presentations and discussions with investment analysts.
The Groups policy is to adjust, inter alia, the following types of income and charges from the reported IFRS measures to present underlying results: restructuring costs: profi t loss on sale of signifi cant assets: past service cost charges credits in relation to pension fund conversion rate changes: signifi cant prior year tax and deferred tax adjustments: accelerated IFRS 2 charges: accelerated amortisation charges: mark-to-market fair value gains losses, relating to ineff ective interest rate swaps: signifi cant impairment charges: signifi cant insurance proceeds: and signifi cant transaction costs incurred during acquisitions.
EBITDA is defi ned as operating profi t before depreciation and amortisation, excluding other gains and losses.
Non-IFRS fi financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, fi financial information presented in compliance with IFRS.
The underlying measures used by the Group are not necessarily comparable with those used by other entities.
The Group has consistently applied this defi nition of underlying measures as it has reported on its fi financial performance in the past as the Directors believe this additional information is important to allow shareholders to better understand the Groups Jurgens Myburgh trading performance for the reporting period.
It is the Chief Financial O cer Groups intention to continue to consistently apply this defi nition in the future.
