Chief Financial Officers Review The Board currently anticipates, subject to trading performance, to make a further return of surplus cash to shareholders in line with our stated policy towards the end of the current financial year.
Darren Bryant Chief Financial Officer The FY17 accounting period refers to the year ended 31 January 2017 and the comparative period FY16 refers to the year ended 31 January 2016.
Revenue Total Group revenue during the year grew by 4.3% to 398.2m FY16: 381.6m, driven by growth in the Card Factory store network: FY17 FY16 Increase m m Decrease Card Factory 380.5 363.4 4.7% Getting Personal 17.7 18.2 -2.6% Group 398.2 381.6 4.3% The Groups established new store roll out programme continues to be an important driver of sales growth for the business.
In the year under review, 51 net new stores were opened FY16: 50, bringing the total estate to 865 stores at the year end.
Like-for-like LFL sales growth was broken down as follows by retail channels: FY17 FY16 Card Factory stores 0.4% 2.8% Card Factory online 49.4% 497.7% Card Factory combined 0.6% 3.0% Getting Personal -2.4% 17.5% Total online combined 0.5% 22.8% As expected, the ongoing improvements to the depth, quality and merchandising of our non-card product offering led to a continuation of the marginal mix shift to this category, a trend we have seen for a number of years.
The full year mix for FY17 was 55.3% single cards FY16: 56.4%, 42.3% non-card FY16: 41.3% and 2.4% Christmas Box Cards FY16: 2.3%.
We expect this trend to continue as we further improve our non-card offering.
Revenue from the Card Factory transactional website grew by approximately 50% to 1.6m following strong growth of approximately 500% in FY16.
As previously announced, following a period of sustained strong growth in both sales and profit in recent years, FY17 performance at Getting Personal was disappointing.
We continue to target double digit revenue growth at Getting Personal in the year ahead.

The overall ratio of cost of sales to revenue was broadly flat at 68.2% on an underlying basis FY16: 67.9% with the following movements in sub-categories: Cost of goods sold: principally comprises cost of raw materials, production costs, finished goods purchased from third party suppliers, import duty, freight costs, carriage costs and warehouse wages.
The reduction in this cost ratio, as also seen in the first half of the year, principally reflects the improvements in underlying product margins, lower average freight rates and the benefit from various business efficiency initiatives, in particular, Loss Prevention, better stock management and other supply chain efficiencies.
The lower sales contribution of Getting Personal, a lower margin business, also benefited the overall Group gross margin percentage.
As a result of our hedging policy, the weighted average rate expensed to the profit and loss account in FY17 was similar to that recognised in FY16.
As highlighted previously and discussed in more detail below, whilst our existing hedges provide a degree of protection, foreign exchange margin pressure remains an area of concern for FY18 given the depreciation of Sterling versus the US Dollar.
Store wages: includes wages and salaries including bonuses for store based staff, together with National Insurance, pension contributions, overtime, holiday and sick pay.
As reported with the interim results, this cost has increased as expected as new stores have been opened and pay increases have been awarded, including the impact of the new National Living Wage.
Store property costs: consists principally of store rents net of rental incentives, business rates and service charges.
This cost has increased in absolute terms as new stores have been opened.
As reported at the interim stage, the ratio of store property costs to revenue has also increased slightly, principally as a reflection of lower than anticipated LFL sales performance.
A number of the Groups existing stores remain on leases taken out before the recession when the property market was stronger and the Companys covenant was weaker and there remains an opportunity for further savings as these older leases come up for renewal over the coming years.
Following the recent business rates review, we expect our annual rates liability to reduce by c2m per annum with effect from April 2017.
Other direct expenses: includes store opening costs, store utility costs, waste disposal, store maintenance, point of sale costs and marketing costs.
This cost category is largely variable in respect of existing stores and increases with new store openings.
The ratio of other direct expenses to revenue has increased slightly from 4.3% to 4.5% with increased online marketing costs and other miscellaneous cost increases being offset by various business efficiency initiatives including our LED conversion programme.
Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation include items such as head office remuneration, costs relating to regional and area managers, design studio costs and insurance together with other central overheads and administration costs.
The Group has continued to invest in central infrastructure and people in recent years to support the ongoing planned growth: we expect this trend to continue.
Total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by 2.3% to 28.1m FY16: 27.4m, although reduced slightly as a percentage of revenue.
Depreciation and amortisation increased from 9.7m to 10.7m reflecting the continuing capital investment in the Group.

Basic and diluted underlying earnings per share for the year were 19.8p FY16: 19.1p, an increase of 3.8%.
After the non-underlying items described above, basic and diluted underlying earnings per share for the year were 19.3p FY16: 19.5p, a decrease of 1.1%.
For the year ended 31 January 2017, the Board is recommending an increase in the final ordinary dividend of 5.0% to 6.3p per share FY16: 6.0p, giving a total ordinary dividend for the year of 9.1p per share, an increase of 7.1% FY16: 8.5p and dividend cover of 2.18 times underlying earnings per share.
The final dividend will, subject to shareholders approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2017, be paid on 9 June to shareholders on the register on 5 May.
As previously announced, over the medium term the Board expects to maintain leverage broadly in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 times net debt to underlying historic LTM EBITDA.
Whilst this leverage ratio will typically vary during the financial year, the Boards current intention is to maintain average leverage around the mid point of this range.
To the extent there is surplus cash within the business, the Board expects to return this to shareholders.
The Board will consider the most appropriate method of returning such surplus cash from time to time, taking into account, amongst other things, views of shareholders and the liquidity of the shares.
In line with this strategy, a special dividend of 15.0 pence per share, equating to a return of 51.1m, was paid to shareholders in November.
The Board currently anticipates, subject to trading performance, to make a further return of surplus cash to shareholders in line with our stated policy towards the end of the current financial year.
