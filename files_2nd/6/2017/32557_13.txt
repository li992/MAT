We have now migrated all of our savings customers and ATMs onto the new, more Financial flexible banking platform.
This has given us the opportunity to launch into the mortgage market in April 2017.
Argos Financial Services AFS also transferred to the Bank in September, with its net 615 million customer loan book.
This has enabled the Group to refinance the intercompany funding Review for AFS through increased customer deposits and wholesale funding a significantly cheaper way to fund the Group than external debt.
As a result the Group repaid the draw-down on the Revolving Credit Facility used for the cash consideration of the HRG acquisition.
The HRG acquisition completed on 2 September 2016.
The economics of the deal were uniquely well set for Sainsburys, both in terms of the 160 million of EBITDA synergies we are now confident of achieving six months earlier than expected in 2018 19, and our ability to finance the deal through our refinancing of the AFS loan book.
Final consideration was just under 1.1 billion paid for in cash and shares.
The fair value of net assets acquired was just over 1.0 billion, resulting in goodwill of 58 million.
The fair value of net assets acquired included a net 615 million customer loan book and 322 million of net cash after the capital return to HRG shareholders.
The balance sheet remains strong with a significant reduction in net debt.
Net debt at 1,477 million 1,971 million treating the perpetual securities as debt has reduced 349 million since the 2015 16 year-end, mainly as a result of continued strong cash generation from our retail operations, the financing of the acquisition of HRG and further working capital improvements, offset by exceptional pension payments, capital expenditure and dividends paid.
The Group has facilities of 3.9 billion with only 2.7 billion drawn at the end of the Dear Shareholder, year.

This was partly offset by cost savings of 130 million and a contribution from Argos of 77 million.
Retail underlying operating margin declined 32 basis points to 2.42 per cent.
