A As sc ce en nti tia al p l pllc c A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt 2 t 201 017 7 FINANCIAL REVIEW 2017 was another year of good Organic growth in revenue and strong cash generation.
Mandy Gradden Chief Financial Officer Overview In addition to a strong growth performance, we have made good progress on executing our strategy with greater focus on higher growth brands through the acquisitions of MediaLink and Clavis as well as the successful disposal of the 13 Heritage Brands classified as held for sale at the end of last year.
The results for the year are set out in the consolidated profit and loss statement and show, for continuing operations, revenue of 375.8m 2016: 299.6m, an Organic growth of 6.4%, and reported operating profit of 44.5m 2016: 32.1m.
Adjusted EBITDA was 119.5m 2016: 95.9m an Organic growth of 3.4%.
We also delivered strong cash flow in 2017 with free cash flow after tax and capex of 102.2m 2016: 90.9m a conversion of 85% in line with last year.
A core KPI and strategic goal of the Company is Organic revenue growth as this is the most efficient method of growth, measures the underlying health of the business and is a key driver of shareholder value creation.
Organic revenue growth eliminates the distorting impact of acquisitions and disposals and that element of growth which is driven by changes in foreign exchange rates.
It is an alternative performance measure and is discussed in more detail on page 19.
Adjusted EBITDA is also an alternative performance measure and is used in the day-to-day management of the business to aid comparisons with peer group companies, manage banking covenants and provide a reference point for assessing our operational cash generation.
It eliminates items arising from portfolio investment and divestment decisions, and from changes to capital structure.
Such items arise from events which are non-recurring or intermittent, and while they may generate substantial income statement amounts, do not relate to the ongoing operational performance that underpins long-term value generation.

Following the acquisition of MediaLink and One Click Retail, the split of revenues between Exhibitions & Festivals 52% and Information Services 48% has become more balanced during the last 12 months.

Most of these revenue streams have recurring characteristics and benefit from our focus on customer retention.
Revenues from continuing operations in 2017 grew to 375.8m 2016: 299.6m, an increase of 76.2m or 25%.
Adjusting for currency impacts and recent acquisitions organic growth was 6.4% driven by double digit growth of Money20 20 19%, Groundsure 13%, One Click Retail 56% as well as Bett 11% followed by the high single digit growth of Cannes Lions 7% and WGSN 6%.
This was slightly offset by a 2% decline in Spring and Autumn Fair.
13 A As sc ce en nti tia al p l pllc c A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt 2 t 201 017 7 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased by 25% to 119.5m 2016: 95.9m representing a 3.4% Organic growth rate.
Adjusted EBITDA margin dropped slightly to 31.8% due to planned product investment in Information Services largely offset by favourable foreign exchange movements.
Reconciliation between Adjusted EBITDA and statutory operating profit Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to statutory operating profit as shown in the table below: m 2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA 119.5 95.9 Depreciation and software amortisation 11.1 12.9 Adjusted operating profit 108.4 83.0 Amortisation 25.5 28.8 Exceptional items 34.3 20.7 Share based payments 4.1 1.4 Statutory operating profit 44.5 32.1 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets The amortisation charge of 25.5m 2016: 28.8m on acquired intangible assets relates mainly to US acquired intangibles with the addition of MediaLink and a full year of One Click Retail offset by the impact of fully amortised assets.
The Company undertakes a periodic review of the carrying value of its intangible assets of 771.7m 2016: 651.6m which are supported by the value in use calculations and no impairment was identified in the current or prior year.
Exceptional items The charge for exceptional items included in continuing operations in 2017 totalled 34.3m 2016: 20.7m as set out in the table below and further explained in Note 5. m 2017 2016 Deferred consideration 27.7 15.3 Expenses related to acquisitions 4.6 1.7 Loss on disposal of RWM 1.8 IPO expenditure and other 0.2 3.7 Exceptional items relating to continuing operations 34.3 20.7 The charge for deferred consideration relates to acquisition-related contingent employment costs on the acquisition of Money20 20, One Click Retail and MediaLink which, absent the link to continued employment, would have been treated as consideration as well as, in 2016, adjustments to deferred consideration recognised in prior years on Money20 20.
Share-based payments The charge for share-based payments of 4.1m 2016: 1.4m incorporates the Share Incentive Plan, the SAYE and the Performance Share Plan.
Further details are set out in Note 7.
The charge in 2016 represented 9 months charge of the 36 month service period for the Companys inaugural grant of awards.
2017s charge includes both a 12 month charge for the 2016 award and a 10 month charge for the 2017 award.
The 2018 charge will include 12 month charge for the 2016 and 2017 awards as well as an expected 10 month charge for the grant in March 2018.
Finance costs The adjusted net finance costs for the year were 11.7m 2016: 17.8m as set out in the table below.
m 2017 2016 Interest payable on external debt 5.8 10.1 Interest receivable 0.2 0.1 Amortisation of loan arrangement fees 1.3 1.4 Other finance charges 4.3 2.9 Net loss on foreign exchange and derivatives 0.5 3.5 Adjusted net finance costs 11.7 17.8 The interest expense on the Companys borrowings was 5.8m 2015: 10.1m with the reduction driven by the reduction in leverage and the consequent reduced rate of interest payable.
Other finance charges represent the unwind of the discount on deferred consideration and increased during the year due to the acquisition of MediaLink at the start of the year.
14 14 A As sc ce en nti tia al p l pllc c A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt 2 t 201 017 7 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Taxation A tax charge of 23.2m 2016: 10.9m was incurred on adjusted profit before tax of 97.0m 2016: 65.1m resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate for the year of 24% 2016: 17%.
This tax charge arises on profits before adjusting items that total 63.9m 2016: 66.9m.
A tax credit of 12.2m arises on these adjusting items 2016: 24.3m.
This equates to a total tax charge of 11.0m 2016: credit of 13.4m and an effective tax rate of 33% on the continuing profit before tax of 33.1m.
Two major factors impacted the tax charge in 2017: The implementation of US tax reform in December 2017, and in particular the reduction in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.
This resulted in the downwards revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities on losses and intangibles resulting in a charge of 10.4m and 6.8m to the adjusted tax charge and adjusting items respectively.
The recognition of additional historic US net operating losses following a reassessment of the restriction on utilisation of the losses.
This was occasioned by the 2017 acquisition of MediaLink which gave further certainty on the sufficiency of future taxable US profits and by the receipt of a third party valuation of the US sub-group at the time of the post-IPO change of control.
The impact on the adjusted tax charge was a credit of 12.7m.
The ongoing adjusted effective tax rate of the Group is expected to be approximately 23-24% next year.
Cash tax paid was 7.9m 2016: 3.5m as the Group continued to benefit by 6.7m 2016: 8.1m from the utilisation of historic tax losses in the UK and US which are expected to benefit the Groups cash flow over the medium term.
The Group has a total recognised deferred tax asset of 47.1m 2016: 54.9m relating to UK and US losses, accelerated capital allowances and US acquired intangibles and deferred consideration.
The majority of this asset is expected to convert into cash savings over the next ten years.
The recognition of deferred tax assets on US losses in particular requires considerable judgements to be made including future trading performance of the US Group in the period up to the loss expiration, assessment of future earnouts payable for US acquisitions and the valuation of the US Group at the point of post-IPO change of control.
In total a net deferred tax asset of 13.8m 2016: 17.4m has been recognised in respect of US taxes leaving 127.1m of unrecognised US tax losses with a tax value of 26.7m.
Our deferred tax liability amounted to 31.3m 2016: 30.3m and related to non-deductible acquired intangibles and is not expected to convert into cash.
Discontinued operations Discontinued operations relate to the 13 Heritage Brands which were sold at various dates in 2017.
The overall result for discontinued operations is comprised as follows: m 2017 2016 Revenue 23.8 57.9 Adjusted EBITDA 1.1 11.6 Depreciation and amortisation 4.3 Exceptional item 1.2 1.9 Share based payments 0.3 0.1 Loss profit before tax 0.4 5.3 Taxation 3.7 1.3 Loss profit after tax 4.1 4.0 The exceptional item in discontinued operations includes a gain on disposal of 0.9m offset by 2.1m of costs separating the Heritage Brands including IT separation costs.
Foreign currency translation impact Ascential reports its results in pounds Sterling and following its acquisition strategy and the growth of Cannes Lions and Money20 20, reported performance is increasingly sensitive to movements in both the Euro and US Dollar against pounds Sterling.
For most of 2017, Sterling was in line with the 2016 US Dollar average exchange rates but strengthened against the US Dollar at the year end a trend that has continued in 2018 to date.
Sterling continued to weaken against the Euro in 2017, as can be seen in the table below: Weighted average Year end rate Currency 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Euro 1.14 1.25 8.8% 1.13 1.17 3.4% US Dollar 1.30 1.30 1.35 1.23 9.8% 15 A As sc ce en nti tia al p l pllc c A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt 2 t 201 017 7 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED When comparing 2017 and 2016, changes in currency exchange rates had a net favourable impact of 10.6m on revenue and 6.0m on Adjusted EBITDA.
On a segmental basis, the favourable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was as follows: Exhibitions & Festivals: 7.0m impact on revenue and 4.7m impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
Information Services: 3.6m impact on revenue and 1.2m impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
For illustrative purposes, the table below provides details of the impact on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA if the actual reported results were restated for Sterling weakening by 1% against the USD and Euro rates in isolation.
2017 2016 2017 Adjusted 2016 Adjusted m Revenue EBITDA Revenue EBITDA Increase in revenue Adjusted EBITDA if: Sterling weakens by 1% against USD in isolation 1.2 0.6 0.7 0.4 Sterling weakens by 1% against EUR in isolation 1.1 0.9 0.9 0.7 Furthermore, each 1% movement in the Euro to pounds Sterling exchange rate has a circa 1.5m impact on the carrying value of borrowings and each 1% movement in the US Dollar has a circa 1.0m impact.
Earnings per share Adjusted diluted Proforma earning per share of 18.6p per share is 20% ahead of the 15.5p per share recorded for 2016 and total diluted Proforma earnings per share of 4.4p per share is 13% ahead of the prior year figure of 3.9p.
Total diluted earnings per share were 4.4p 2016: 4.3p.
Acquisitions and disposals and capital expenditure We regularly assess opportunities to acquire high-growth products operating in sectors with the potential for scale and incurred initial cash consideration of 156.5m for two acquisitions of higher growth brands.
MediaLink In February 2017, we acquired US-based media advisory business MediaLink for initial cash consideration of 55.3m plus future earnouts expected to total between $42m and $62m payable in cash or, for certain elements, shares at Ascentials option.
A portion of the earnout payments is subject to founders remaining in employment with the company.
MediaLink is growing rapidly and delivered revenue of 47.4m and adjusted EBITDA of 12.0m in 2017 up from 39.4m and 10.4m respectively in the prior year.
Clavis In December 2017, we acquired the eCommerce analytics business Clavis for initial consideration of 88.9m plus future earnout expected to total between $25m and $50m payable in cash.
Clavis is growing rapidly and, in the 2017 year, generated unaudited revenue of 13.4m and an EBITDA loss of 4.2m, up from 9.9m and 6.0m respectively in the prior year.
Clavis is expected to break even in 2018.
Heritage Brands We disposed of the 13 Heritage Brands held for sale at December 2016 in three transactions in January, May and December 2017.
Total consideration received was 51.2m and the sale generated a gain on disposal of 0.9m.
Detailed information on all acquisitions can be found in Note 12 on pages 89 to 92.
The Group spent a further 11.8m of capital expenditure 2016: 13.1m.
This investment was primarily for new product development and enhancements to business applications to support future organic growth.

Capex was slightly behind 2016 at 11.8m 2016: 13.1m reflecting the prior years fit out of the Paddington office to accommodate the entire Exhibitions & Festivals business.
The Company generated free cash flow of 102.2m 2016: 90.9m, also an increase of 13%, which was used to fund interest payments, M&A and exceptional items.
A major feature of cash flow in 2016 was the IPO, which generated proceeds of 200.0m or 188.5m net of expenses, which was used to reduce indebtedness.
Returns to shareholders The Board targets a dividend payout ratio of 30% of Adjusted profit after tax.
Consequently, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.8p per share payable on 15 June 2018 to shareholders on the register on 18 May 2018 which, together with the Companys interim dividend of 1.8p paid in September 2017, makes a total dividend for the 2017 financial year of 5.6p.
17 A As sc ce en nti tia al p l pllc c A An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt 2 t 201 017 7 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Other financial matters Capital structure The Company sources of funding comprise operating cash flow and access to substantial committed bank facilities from a range of banks.
The Company maintains a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading over the medium term and aims to operate net debt of 1.5 to 2.0 times EBITDA to allow a healthy mix of dividends and cash for investment in bolt-on acquisitions.
Following the acquisition of Clavis at the end of the year, the consolidated leverage ratio as at 31 December 2017 is 2.3x 31 December 2016: 2.1x.
Liquidity On 12 February 2016 the Company entered into new term loan facilities of 66m, 171m and $96m as well as a revolving credit facility RCF of 95m.
All mature in February 2021 and are currently subject to interest at 1.5% over LIBOR on the term loans and LIBOR plus 1.25% on the RCF.
There is a leverage covenant limit of 4.0x which drops to 3.5x in 2019 which is measured semi-annually.
As at 31 December 2017, 320.7m of the facilities had been drawn 2016: 290.3m including 31.8m of the RCF 2016: nil.
Financial risk management The Group is exposed to risks arising from the international nature of its operations and the financial instruments which fund them.
These instruments include cash and borrowing and items such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from operations.
External borrowings are denominated 47% in Euros with the balance split between US Dollars 32% and pounds Sterling 21%.
The Company reviews and protects a proportion of its exposure to interest rate rises on the cost of borrowings through use of derivatives where appropriate.
Principal risks including strategic, operational, legal and other risks are shown on pages 24 to 27.
Going concern Ascentials business activities, performance and position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report.
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives.
The processes in place for assessment, management and monitoring of risks are described on page 22.
Details of the financial risk management objectives and policies are given on pages 102 to 110 in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Boards assessment of prospects and stress test scenarios, together with its review of principal risks and the effectiveness of risk management procedures, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors have assessed the Groups prospects and viability over a three-year period and the viability statement can be found on page 23.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements.
In forming their view, the Directors have considered the Groups prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date when the financial statements are approved.
