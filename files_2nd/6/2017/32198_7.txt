Financial review We have delivered on our guidance to reduce leverage, grow dividends and return excess cash to shareholders In 2017, we returned 128.7m in cash to shareholders, as well as reducing gross debt by 40m.
Sean Glithero Chief Financial Officer Revenue In 2017, we saw another year of strong revenue growth at 9%, reaching 311.4m 2016:281.6m.
Growth was achieved in all three revenue streams and in total at a rate similar to that attained in 2016.
Trade revenue was the largest contributor, with revenue rising by 9% to 262.1m 2016:236.4m.
Within Trade, Retailer revenue grew 10% to 250.1m 2016:224.5m.
Home Trader saw growth of 3% to 12.0m 2016: 11.5m, with a lower growth rate largely being attributable to limited pricing initiatives in the year.
Other revenue fell Change from 52-week to annual accounting period Due to the publishing heritage of the business, results have historically been reported on a 52 week i. e. 364 days basis with the accounting period ending on the closest Sunday to 31 March.
The Board made the decision to change the period end date to be 31 March every year, starting in financial year 2017, to better align with our customers needs, and to the products and services we offer.
As a consequence of this change, the 2017 financial year was five days longer than the previous year and whilst there was no impact on the first half results, the second half of the year was longer and hence revenues, costs and earnings were greater due to the extra trading days.
Year-on-year percentages for revenues, costs and profits have been adjusted to reflect like-for-like growth.
No other percentages have been adjusted.
