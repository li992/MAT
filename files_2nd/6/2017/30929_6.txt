Kingwood Stud is set to open the new Kurtsystems a 20m pre-training system designed to provide controlled and synchronised exercise for young racehorses, to develop stronger bones, cartilages, muscles and tendons before they enter a traditional training regime.
A Joseph Ash Galvanizing client has been one of the contractors on the project, and Joseph Ash Chesterfield galvanized approximately 411 tons of structural steel.
Horses are trained on an artificial surface training circuit, without jockeys, by being harnessed into specially designed cabins which travel along an overhead rail track at set speeds.
The speeds are managed by a computer controlled unit at the back of the cabins.
The horses carry specialist saddles to replicate the weight of a jockey.
It is a mile-long circuit which can train up to 12 horses at a time.
It can also be used to rehabilitate injured horses.
The galvanizing of the steel ensures the facilities longevity.
