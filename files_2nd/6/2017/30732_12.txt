FINANCIAL REVIEW Taking actions to preserve our balance sheet From a finance perspective our key focus was on cost discipline and managing the cash outflow resulting from the lack of concentrate sales in the year.
JACO MARITZ Revenue of US$751.5 million was US$302.0 million lower than 2016 driven by the 27% decrease CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER in sales volumes mainly as a result of our inability to sell gold copper concentrate which deferred approximately US$264.0 million in gross revenue and reduced production at Bulyanhulu due to the transition to reduced operations in Q4 2017.
This was partially offset by approximately US$11.3 million due to the higher gold price compared to 2016.
INTRODUCTION Cash costs decreased to US$587 per ounce sold in 2017 from US$640 per ounce sold in 2016 The impact of the gold copper despite the lower production base: lower cash costs were driven by lower G&A costs, lower concentrate export ban is consumable and maintenance costs, lower sales related costs, lower fuel costs, lower external services costs, higher realised gains on copper hedges and lower labour costs, partly offset by the evident in our financial lower production base, lower co-product revenue and lower capitalisation of development costs.

The current year opposite, and should be charge is driven by additional provisions raised for uncertain tax positions of US$172 million based on estimates of the impact of a comprehensive settlement reflecting the key terms of the framework read in conjunction with announcements by Barrick and the GoT, offset by the deferred tax impact relating to impairment the audited consolidated charges noted above of US$205.9 million.
As a result of the above, the net loss amounted to US$707.4 million, compared to net income in 2016 of US$94.4 million.
This amounted to a net loss per share of US172.5 cents.
Adjusted net earnings of US$146.2 million were US$14.8 million lower than 2016.
Adjusted earnings per share amounted to US35.7 cents, down from US39.2 cents in 2016.
Operational cash outflows of US$23.0 million compared to US$318.0 million of inflows in 2016, primarily as a result of lower revenue as discussed above, unfavourable working capital outflows due to a build-up of gold inventory and supplies, an increase in the indirect taxes receivable, and payments of US$37.9 million relating to provisional 2017 and final 2016 corporate tax.
