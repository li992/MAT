STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW During the 2017 financial year Wizz Air carried 23.8 million passengers, an 18.9 per cent.
increase compared to the previous year.
Revenue grew to 1,571.2 million, representing a 9.9 per cent.
Wizz Air recorded a balanced capacity growth measured in terms of available seat kilometres ASK of 19.7 per cent.
As indicated throughout the 2017 financial year, most airlines, including Wizz Air, added capacity in response to lower fuel prices.
During the 2017 financial year Wizz Air collected ca.
20% of its revenues in British Pounds, which leading up to the UK referendum to leave the European Union and right after the actual vote has devalued significantly against the Euro.
In addition the peculiarity of the 2017 financial year was that both Easter holidays of 2016 and 2017 calendar years fell outside of the 2017 financial year, resulting in related additional revenues materializing in the 2016 and 2018 financial years.
The combined effect of the above mentioned events resulted in revenue per ASK decreasing by 8.5 per cent.
in 2017 compared to the previous financial year.
Despite the UKs decision to leave the European Union Brexit, there are no signs of demand weakness on routes to from the UK.
The negative translation effect on British pound revenues due to Brexit in the 2017 financial year is estimated at 17 million, which was partially offset by the positive translation effect on British pound costs.
The Company continues to examine the terms on which Brexit might materialize, the potential implications of these to Wizz Airs business, and take actions that are considered necessary.
Unit costs further improved as lower fuel prices complemented by a healthy fuel hedging position resulted in fuel unit cost per ASK declining 21.9 per cent.
This, combined with another strong performance on non-fuel cost, which declined 0.6 per cent.
delivered a total unit cost decline of 7.8 per cent.
The profit for the year was 246.0 million and included a 20.7 million net gain from unrealised FX gains and exceptional items.
These comprised unrealised foreign exchange gains of 1.9 million and a gain from the change in the time value of hedge positions of 14.3 million, and a 4.5 million net gain on fuel caps sold before expiry.
The income tax expense for the year was 9.8 million 2016: 8.5 million giving an effective tax rate for the Group of 3.8 per cent.
The main components of this charge are local business tax and innovation tax paid in Hungary, and corporate income tax paid in Switzerland.
Underlying profit after tax increased by 0.6 per cent.

The proforma underlying earnings per share EPS is a fully diluted measure defined by the Company.
Its calculation differs from the IFRS diluted EPS measure in the following: for earnings the underlying profit for the year is used, as opposed to the statutory IFRS profit for the year: and for the fully diluted number of shares the year-end position was taken rather than the weighted average for the year.
1 Starting from the 2017 financial year the Company introduced separate reporting for its airline and tour operator business units.
Where a measure is reported for a business unit as opposed to the Group as a whole then this fact is explicitly stated.
All other measures and statements relate to the Group as a whole.

Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 19 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Return on capital employed and capital structure ROCE is a non-statutory performance measure commonly used to measure the financial returns that a business achieves on the capital it uses.
ROCE for the 2017 financial year was 17.6 per cent.
a decrease of 4.8 percentage points compared to the previous year driven by varying level of growth in earnings before interest and tax EBIT, shareholders equity, net cash position, and capitalised leases.
The Companys leverage, defined as net debt adjusted to include capitalised operating lease obligations divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft rentals EBITDAR, fell to a ratio of 1.7 from 1.4 at the end of the 2017 financial year.
The year-on-year comparisons of ROCE and leverage were negatively impacted by the translation effect of the stronger US Dollar compared to last year as capitalised US dollar aircraft leases are translated into a higher Euro value.
Liquidity, defined as cash and equivalents as a percentage of the last twelve months revenue, rose from 45.2 per cent.
at the end of the 2016 financial year to 49.3 per cent.

ROCE: underlying operating profit after tax average capital employed, where average capital employed is the sum of average equity excluding convertible debt and capitalised operating lease obligations, less average free cash.
Financial performance Starting from 2017, revenues and operating expenses are analysed by business segment, compared to the same measures for the 2016 financial year.
In the 2016 Annual Report these analyses were done for the Group as a whole.
Therefore revenues, certain expenses, and certain KPIs for 2016 for the Airline are different in this report from the corresponding numbers presented in the 2016 report for the Group.
The remaining measures financial income and expenses, taxation, other comprehensive income and expense are continued to be analysed for the Group, as the share of the tour operator business unit is immaterial or nil in these measures.
Airline revenue The following table sets out an overview of Wizz Airs revenue items for 2017 and 2016 and the percentage change in those items: 2017 2016 Total Percentage of Total Percentage of Percentage million total revenue million total revenue change Passenger ticket revenue 909.3 58.2% 893.5 62.6% 1.8% Ancillary revenue 652.7 41.8% 533.8 37.4% 22.3% Total revenue 1,562.0 100% 1,427.4 100% 9.4% The decline in RASK by 8.5 per cent.
was the main driver for passenger ticket revenue increasing by only 1.8 per cent.
to 909.3 million, while ancillary or non-ticket revenue increased by 22.3 per cent.
Average revenue per passenger decreased from 71.4 in 2016 to 65.7 in 2017, a decrease of 8.0 per cent which helped stimulate more passenger volumes.
Average passenger ticket revenue per passenger declined from 44.7 in 2016 to 38.3 -14.4 per cent.
while average ancillary revenue per passenger increased from 26.7 in 2016 to 27.5 in 2017, an increase of 0.8 per passenger or 2.8 per cent.
This slight decrease in average revenue per passenger was due to: a decrease in average passenger ticket revenue per passenger in 2017 compared to 2016, which was the result of lower input prices feeding into lower fares even though load factors increased by 1.9 percentage points to 90.1%: and the combined impact of the modification of certain products, the introduction of new services Go Fare, and the adaptation of customers to some of the longer standing products such as allocated seating and different checked-in luggage sizes.
Airline operating expenses Total airline operating expenses increased by 10.3 per cent.
Airline CASK declined by 7.8 per cent.
This reduction in CASK was principally driven by a reduction in the average fuel price and continued improvement of the airport mix.
CASK excluding fuel expenses decreased to 2.25 Euro cents in 2017 from 2.27 Euro cents in 2016 driven by the combined effect of further improvement of major cost items maintenance, airport, handling and en-route charges set off by increasing aircraft rentals.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 20 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Financial performance continued Airline operating expenses continued The following table sets out the airline operating expenses for 2017 and 2016 and the percentage changes in those items: 2017 2016 Percentage of Percentage of total total Total operating Total operating Percentage million expenses million expenses change Staff costs 112.6 8.6% 102.1 8.6% 10.3% Fuel costs 375.2 28.5% 401.5 33.7% 6.6 % 27.0 23.3 Distribution and marketing 2.1% 2.0% 16.0% Maintenance, materials and repairs 74.7 5.7% 77.5 6.5% 3.6 % Aircraft rentals 233.9 17.8% 176.2 14.8% 32.8% Airport, handling and en-route charges 390.0 29.7% 343.1 28.8% 13.7% 57.5 28.8 Depreciation and amortisation 4.4% 2.4% 99.9% Other expenses 43.6 3.3% 38.8 3.3% 12.3% Total operating expenses 1,314.5 100% 1,191.2 100% 10.3% Staff costs increased by 10.3 per cent.
The increase in overall staff costs reflected a 15.7 per cent.
rise in aircraft block hours and reduced bonus payments made compared to the previous year as certain profitability targets were not reached.
Fuel expenses decreased by 6.6 per cent.
Although there was an increase of 19.7 per cent.
growth in ASKs, and an 8.0 per cent.
appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro after hedging moving from an average 1.20 rate in 2016 to 1.10 in 2017, it has been offset by a 1.6 per cent.
reduction in fuel consumption per block hour and a 25.2 per cent.
decline in the average fuel price after hedging.
The average fuel price including hedging impact and into-plane premium paid by Wizz Air in 2017 was US$553 per ton, a decline of 25.2 per cent.
from the previous years figure of US$740 per ton.
Distribution and marketing costs rose 16.0 per cent.
This increase is modestly lower than the passenger growth of 18.9 per cent.
Maintenance, materials and repair costs decreased by 3.6 per cent.
This cost decrease was the combined result of several renegotiated maintenance contracts with third party providers and the timing of certain maintenance events.
Aircraft rental costs increased 32.8 per cent.
This increase was largely due to fleet growth equivalent aircraft expanded by 15.3 per cent.
an increasing average lease rate due to the A321 aircraft joining the fleet and the appreciation of the US Dollar to the Euro which was 8.0 per cent.
stronger than the previous year after hedging impact.
Airport, handling and en-route charges increased by 13.7 per cent.
This category comprised 224.2 million of airport and handling fees and 165.8 million of en-route and navigation charges in 2017 and 193.9 million of airport and handling fees and 149.3 million of en-route and navigation charges in 2016.
The cost increase was primarily due to a 12.9 per cent.
increase in the number of flights, and an 18.9 per cent.
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by 99.9 per cent.
to 57.5 million in 2017, up from 28.8 million in 2016 as the airline is preparing to return older leased aircraft back to lessors and engine maintenance programs are required.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for more details.
Other expenses increased by 12.3 per cent.
Other expenses include cancellation and delay related costs of 12.2 million, an increase of 92.5 per cent year-on-year.
The European airline industry is experiencing a significant increase in customer compensation costs to levels that the Company believes is disproportionate to the Companys very low fares, especially as the Company only cancelled 214 flights out of a total of 141,698 flights in the financial year.
With the exception of cancellation and delay related costs the Company delivered a strong cost performance on all other areas in this line item.
Airline operating profit As a result of the foregoing factors, the Airline made an operating profit in respect of its airlines operations of 247.4 million in 2017, a 4.8 per cent.
increase from the operating profit of 236.1 million made in 2016.
Wizz Tours Wizz Tours generates revenue by selling package holidays made up of flight tickets purchased from the airline and hotel accommodation purchased from wholesalers bedbanks.
in the 2017 financial year to 18.1 million from 3.9 million in 2016 financial year.
Operating costs in the same period increased from 4.5 million to 18.9 million.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 21 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Financial performance continued Net financing income and expense The Groups net financing income resulted in a net gain of 9.1 million in 2017 after an expense of 34.1 million in 2016.
This significant change was driven primarily by the change in the time value of hedges, with the net impact of all other items being limited, as shown in the table below: million 2017 2016 Change Net FX-related impacts including exceptional item in 2016 2.6 3.1 5.7 Change in time value of hedges exceptional 14.3 25.0 39.3 Fuel cap impacts including exceptional item in 2017 4.5 5.3 0.9 All other financial income and expenses, net recurring 3.3 0.7 2.7 Net financing income and expense 9.1 34.1 43.2 See also Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements.
Changes in the time value of hedges, as accounted for under IAS 39, resulted in significant gains and losses in the two years, respectively.
Such changes will stop impacting earnings from the 2018 financial year as the Group adopted IFRS 9 from 1 April 2017.
Fuel caps impacted the two years similarly, after taking into account for 2017 the one-off impacts of the closure of caps in September 2016.
By that date all caps expired or were sold, so there will be no further impacts from these instruments in future years.
The remaining recurring items had relatively limited impacts.
The 2.7 million higher net financial income and expenses in 2017 was caused by i the lower interest yield environment: ii some gains in 2016 coming from ineffective fuel hedges: and iii the net impact of discounting long-term financial assets.
Taxation The Group recorded an income tax expense of 9.8 million in 2017, slightly higher than the 8.5 million in 2016.
The effective tax rate for the Group was 3.8 per cent.
The reduction in the effective tax rate reflects the impact of Hungarian local taxes, the tax base of which is different from the corporate tax base particularly given that financial income and expenses are not in the scope of these taxes.
Profit for the year As a result of the foregoing factors, the Group generated an IFRS profit for 2017 of 246.0 million, a 27.5 per cent.
increase from the profit of 192.9 million in 2016.
Other comprehensive income and expense In 2017 the Group had other comprehensive income of 15.5 million compared to 33.2 million in 2016.
This change was driven by the movements in the balance of the cash flow hedging reserve in equity in the two years.
This situation arises when, based on the spot prices at year end there is an overall more favourable position on the Groups open hedge instruments than a year before.
Cash flows and financial position Summary statement of cash flows The following table sets out selected cash flow data and the Companys cash and cash equivalents for 2017 and 2016: million 2017 2016 Change Net cash generated by operating activities 310.9 288.9 22.0 Net cash used in investing activities 179.7 90.6 89.1 Net cash used in financing activities 1.8 1.7 0.1 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 1.0 0.5 1.5 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 774.0 645.6 128.5 Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 22 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Cash flows and financial position continued Cash flow from operating activities The vast majority of Wizz Airs cash inflows from operating activities are derived from passenger ticket sales.
Net cash flows from operating activities are also materially affected by movements in working capital items.
Operating cash flows improved from 288.9 million in 2016 to 310.9 million in 2017 primarily due to the following factors: Profit before tax and depreciation: Profit before tax in 2017 was 54.4 million higher than in 2016.
However, this increase in the profits was almost exclusively due to the impacts from financial income and expense items that are non-cash.
It is for similar reasons that on an underlying basis there was only a small increase in profits from 2016 to 2017, as shown earlier.
On the other hand, depreciation and amortisation expenses were 28.8 million higher in 2017 this almost alone explains the 29.0 million increase in operating cash flows before adjusting for changes in working capital.
Changes in working capital: The movements in working capital items helped the 2016 operating cash flows by 20.7 million, while the same impact was only 14.1 million for 2017.
This is a relatively small difference between the two years when compared to the absolute size of the respective asset and liability balances.
There are two differences between the two years that are worth noting as contributors: i the restricted cash balance increased by 20.8 million more during 2017 than in 2016: and ii the trade and other payables balance increased by 25.2 million less during 2017 than in 2016 primarily because the increase in 2016 was particularly high.
Cash flow from investing activities Net cash used in investing activities increased by 89.1 million from a net cash outflow of 90.6 million in 2016 to a net cash outflow of 179.7 million in 2017.
There are three contributors to the higher investments in 2017: Aircraft maintenance assets: There was 35.0 million more invested into aircraft maintenance assets in 2017 than in 2016, caused primarily by the increase in the number of engine LLP replacements performed in the year there was one such event in 2016 and nine in 2017.
Purchases of tangible assets: The Group invested 25.7 million more into tangible assets in 2017 than in 2016 due primarily to more spare engines being purchased.
Advances paid for aircraft pre delivery payments, PDP : The net PDP flows payments paid to Airbus less refunds received required 28.3 million more cash investment in 2017 than in 2016.
Cash flow from financing activities Net cash used in financing activities were immaterial and increased by only 0.1 million to a 1.8 million outflow in 2017 from a 1.7 million outflow in 2016.
Summary statement of balance sheet The following table sets out summary statements of financial position of the Group for 2017 and 2016: million 2017 2016 Change ASSETS Property, plant and equipment 505.7 353.6 152.1 Restricted cash 155.8 101.6 54.2 Derivative financial instruments 10.1 1.7 8.4 Trade and other receivables 208.7 197.7 11.0 Cash and cash equivalents 774.0 645.6 128.4 Other assets 42.1 31.7 10.4 Total assets 1,696.3 1,331.8 364.5 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Equity Equity 952.5 688.8 263.7 Liabilities Trade and other payables 197.7 177.3 20.4 Convertible debt and other borrowings 33.0 33.6 0.6 Deferred income 388.8 321.6 67.2 Derivative financial instruments 1.8 17.6 15.8 Provisions 113.7 84.9 28.8 Other liabilities 8.9 8.1 0.8 Total liabilities 743.8 643.1 100.7 Total equity and liabilities 1,696.3 1,331.8 364.5 Including both current and non-current asset and liability balances, respectively.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 23 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Summary statement of balance sheet continued Property, plant and equipment increased by 152.1 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 13 to the financial statements.
This was driven by investments in all the important fixed asset categories, as follows: i the gross book value of aircraft maintenance assets including advances paid for these assets increased by 87.7 million, mainly due to more engines being out of condition under the respective lease contract at the end of 2017 than a year before: ii PDPs increased by 64.0 million due to the growing number of aircraft deliveries and their respective payments as well as the relatively higher PDP of the A321ceo compared to the A320ceo: and iii investment into aircraft parts in the amount of 37.3 million, with most of this related to the delivery of several spare engines during the year.
Restricted cash current and non-current increased by 54.2 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016.
This was driven by the growth in the amount of lease-related letters of credit, particularly as security in relation to future maintenance obligations.
Derivative financial instruments current and non-current increased by 8.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
The receivable from open hedge instruments at the end of 2016 was close to nil rather there were payable positions, see below, but at the end of 2017 there were few million Euro receivables both on the open foreign exchange and fuel hedges.. Trade and other receivables current and non-current increased by 11.0 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 18 to the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by 128.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016.
This change is explained in detail in the cash flow analysis above.
Trade and other payables increased by 20.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016.
This rate of increase is broadly consistent with rate of increase for the Groups business during the year.
Deferred income current and non-current increased by 67.2 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 26 to the financial statements.
This was driven primarily by the increase in unflown revenues 52.3 million, itself primarily due to the increase in offered seat capacity, and to a smaller extent by the concessions received from aircraft and component manufacturers during the year.
Derivative financial liabilities current and non-current decreased by 15.8 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
At the end of 2016 the Group had primarily payable positions and only very small receivables in relation to its open foreign exchange and fuel hedge instruments, but this situation reversed by the end of 2017 having primarily receivables on both foreign exchange and fuel, with only very small fuel-related payables.
Provisions current and non-current increased by 28.8 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 see Note 29 to the financial statements.
The increase relates primarily to new provisions made for future heavy maintenance events, particularly engine LLP replacements.
