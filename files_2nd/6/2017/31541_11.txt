For the coming year, we expect finance costs to reduce as a result of lower net debt, a lower cost of debt due to the recent refinancing and the reduction in finance lease interest from the Swansea sale.

Overall, the see-through effective Equity attributable rate of tax for the year was below the prior year at 10.3% 2016: to owners of the 11.8%, resulting from a blend of a lower Group tax charge of 12.9% Company 880.7 119.6 1,000.3 955.2 2016: 14.0% due to the reduction in the deferred tax rate, and a NAV per share pence 450.9 431.0 higher JV tax credit in the period.

2 Our definition of total accounting return was revised in the year so that it now represents dividends paid in the year plus the movement in NAV per share in the year, rather than the movement in EPRA NAV per share.
This change reflects that our strategy includes the repositioning and recycling of our portfolio towards sectors with strong structural growth, whereas the EPRA model assumes that properties are retained.
Using the revised definition results in a total accounting return of 6.0% 2016: 5.6% as noted above.
Under the previous definition, total accounting return would have been 3.6% 2016: 4.5%.

Hedging and cost of debt We aim to have predictable costs attached to our borrowing and therefore hedge a significant portion of our interest rate risk.
At the year end, 82.8% 2016: 50.0% of our borrowings were fixed or hedged.
Our ongoing interest rate risk will be managed via a combination of caps and hedges to maintain compliance with this policy.
Our spot year-end weighted average cost of borrowing increased to 4.4% 2016: 3.8% as a result of lower borrowings at the lower marginal rates on our banking facilities.
The refinancing actions above shortly after the year end reduce this to 3.7%, despite the lower borrowings.
