Financial review FINANCIAL REVIEW Situl Jobanputra, Chief Financial Officer Our capital structure positions the Group to withstand FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS prevailing market conditions, take advantage of EPRA NAV of 334 pence per share, a 1.7% decrease opportunities as they arise, and deliver long-term returns Total return of -1.3% to shareholders by driving value creation across our assets.

Group share Capco further strengthened its financial position during 2017 reducing loan to value to 21 per cent and increasing available liquidity to 691 million.
This has been achieved by the realisation of value through the disposal of the Venues business and further enhancing the unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden by raising a further 225 million in the private placement market and extending the 705 million revolving credit facility to 2022.
There was additional investment in Covent Garden of 177 million through developments, predominantly Floral Court, and 99 million of acquisitions which have served to increase the Groups weighting in Covent Garden to 72 per cent.
The value of the Covent Garden estate increased by 4.3 per cent like-for-like due to the rental growth achieved during the year, with ERV up by 4.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
Uncertainties in the broader political and economic environment continue to impact London residential property.
As a result the market value of Earls Court Properties, which represents the Groups interests at Earls Court, has decreased by 11.8 per cent like-for-like.
Overall, the Group share of the total property value has decreased by 0.9 per cent like-for-like.
EPRA net asset value per share decreased by 1.7 per cent during the year, from 339.6 pence at 31 December 2016 to 333.8 pence.
This 5.8 pence decline together with the 1.5 pence dividend paid to shareholders resulted in a total return of -1.3 per cent.
Underlying earnings from continuing activities increased to 7.3 million due to higher net rental income and reduced administration expenses.
Basis of preparation In line with the requirements of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, the Group is required to present its joint ventures under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements.
Under the equity method, the Groups interest in joint ventures is disclosed as a single line item in both the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement rather than proportionally consolidating the Groups share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Alternative Performance Measures APMs, being financial measures which are not specified under IFRS, are used by the Group to monitor the performance of the business.
These include a number of the Financial Highlights shown on page 3.
Many of the APMs included are based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations reporting framework which aims to improve the transparency, comparability and relevance of published results of public real estate companies in Europe.
Further details on APMs are set out on page 141.
38 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Internally, the Board focuses on and reviews information and reports prepared on a Group share basis, which includes the Groups share of joint ventures but excludes the non-controlling interest share of our subsidiaries.
Therefore, to align with the way the Group is managed, this financial review presents the financial position, performance and cash flow analysis on a Group share basis.
Discontinued operation On 7 April 2017 the Venues business was sold.
As Venues has previously represented a separate major line of business, its results and cash flows have been reported for the period 1 January 2017 to 7 April 2017 as having arisen from a discontinued operation.
This extends to the prior period comparative which has been re-presented to reflect the disposal.
Further information on the disposal of the Venues business is set out in note 12 Discontinued Operation.

Non-controlling interest represents TfLs 37 per cent share of ECPL.
IFRS includes amounts receivable from joint ventures which eliminate on a Group share basis.
Adjusted, diluted number of shares in issue at 31 December 2017 was 850.6 million 2016: 847.6 million.
com 39 Financial review continued Investment, development and trading property The revaluation loss on the Groups property portfolio was 37.6 million for the year, representing a 0.9 per cent decrease in value on a like-for-like basis compared with the IPD Capital Return for the equivalent period of 5.4 per cent.
The Group revaluation loss consists of a 93.4 million gain at Covent Garden and a 131.0 million loss at Earls Court.
Total property return for the year was 1.0 per cent.
The IPD Total Return index recorded a 11.2 per cent return for the corresponding period.
The total revaluation loss of 37.6 million consists of a 27.9 million loss on investment property and a 9.7 million loss on trading property.
On an IFRS basis, which includes ECPL at 100 per cent and does not include Lillie Square on a line by line basis, loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property was 90.9 million.
Trading property is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value, therefore valuation surpluses on trading property are not recorded.
Any unrecognised surplus is however reflected within the EPRA net asset value measure.
During the year 6.6 million of the unrealised trading property surplus has been realised.
At 31 December 2017, the unrecognised surplus on trading property was 31.8 million 31 December 2016: 48.1 million which now arises solely on the Groups share of trading property at Lillie Square.
Debt and gearing During the year the Groups share of total facilities increased by 24.5 million.
During the first half of the year the Group terminated the 100 million Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited facility of which 50 million was drawn prior to termination, the 85.5 million loan on the Empress State Building and 30 million 15 million Group share of the Lillie Square LP facility.
In June, the Group signed an agreement with eight institutional investors for a private placement of 225 million with a range of maturities from 7 to 20 year senior unsecured notes, further enhancing the unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden.
Closing occurred in August 2017 and proceeds were used to repay bank debt.
In November 2017, the Group exercised the option under the 705 million Covent Garden debt facility to extend the full loan amount to 2022.
The Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2017 were 690.8 million 31 December 2016: 556.3 million.
A reconciliation between IFRS and Group share is shown below: 2017 2016 Joint Group Joint Group 1 2 1 2 IFRS ventures NCI share IFRS ventures NCI share m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 28.6 25.7 2.0 52.3 30.9 37.4 3.5 64.8 Undrawn committed facilities 637.9 33.1 32.5 638.5 532.7 2.4 43.6 491.5 Cash and undrawn committed facilities 666.5 58.8 34.5 690.8 563.6 39.8 47.1 556.3 1.
Net debt decreased by 114 million to 734 million, principally as a result of the disposal of the Venues business partly offset by further investment into our assets and the acquisitions at Covent Garden.
As set out in the summary adjusted balance sheet, net debt on an IFRS basis was 748 million.
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan to value LTV.
LTV is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by the carrying value of the Groups property portfolio.
The Group focuses most on an LTV measure that includes the notional share of joint venture interests but excludes the share of the non-controlling interest.
The LTV of 21.3 per cent remains comfortably within the Groups limit of no more than 40 per cent.
2017 2016 Loan to value 21.3% 23.4% Interest cover 170% 173% Weighted average debt maturity 6.9 years 5.9 years Weighted average cost of debt 2.8% 2.7% Gross debt with interest rate protection 91% 86% The Groups policy is to eliminate substantially the medium and long-term risk arising from interest rate volatility.
The Groups banking facilities are arranged on a floating rate basis but are generally swapped to fixed rate or capped using derivative contracts.
At 31 December 2017 the proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection was 91 per cent 31 December 2016: 86 per cent.
The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants, details of which are set out on page 140, and has substantial levels of headroom against its covenants across all of its debt facilities.
40 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements At 31 December 2017 the Group had capital commitments of 61.3 million 156.6 million at 31 December 2016 of which Covent Garden represents 19.5 million and Earls Court Properties 41.8 million including the 30.0 million of CLSA instalments and 7.0 million in relation to Lillie Square.

Conditional Land Sale Agreement CLSA In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, which it entered into with LBHF, for the purchase of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates the Estates.
The overall consideration payable is expected to be 105 million cash plus the planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA remains unrecognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as its main underlying asset the land relating to the Estates does not currently meet the recognition criteria under IFRS required for investment and development property.
Annual payments of 15 million commenced in December 2015 and will run through to December 2019.
Where amounts are paid prior to the transfer of property, they will be carried on the Groups balance sheet as prepayments against future land draw down.
Of the 75 million paid to date, 15 million relates to the acquisition of two properties, held as investment and development property, and 60 million relates to options over the Estates which is held as a prepayment within other receivables.
The remaining future payments totalling 30 million are disclosed as a capital commitment as referred to above.
The prepayment balance will be transferred to investment and development property once the recognition criteria of investment and development property have been met.
Once this occurs, in line with the Groups accounting policy, the land will become subject to bi-annual valuation with any changes reflected in the Groups reported net asset measure.
CASH FLOW A summary of the Groups cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2017 is presented below: Summary cash flow 1 2017 Re-presented 2016 Joint Group Joint Group 2 3 2 3 IFRS ventures NCI share IFRS ventures NCI share m m m m m m m m Operating cash flows after interest and tax from continuing activities 13.2 10.2 0.6 24.0 41.3 1.4 2.5 42.4 Purchase and development of property, plant and equipment 211.2 27.0 12.6 225.6 214.2 41.4 16.8 238.8 Transactions with joint venture partners and non-controlling interests 13.3 5.6 0.1 7.8 12.3 6.4 3.9 2.0 Net sales proceeds from discontinued operation 226.0 226.0 Net sales proceeds from property and investments 12.6 92.0 104.6 19.4 1.3 20.7 Net cash flow before financing from continuing activities 27.5 49.2 12.1 88.8 248.4 32.3 18.2 262.5 Issue of shares 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.1 Financing 18.8 46.3 10.6 75.7 160.1 31.6 11.4 180.3 Dividends paid 6.7 6.7 7.5 7.5 Transfers with discontinued operation 5.4 5.4 57.1 57.1 Other 3.8 3.8 4 Net cash flow from continuing activities 3.9 2.9 1.5 8.3 38.6 0.7 6.8 32.5 Net cash flow from discontinued operation 0.2 0.2 2.6 2.6 Net cash flow 3.7 2.9 1.5 8.1 36.0 0.7 6.8 29.9 1.
The 2016 summary cash flow has been re-presented to reflect the cash flows from continuing operations and therefore it excludes the discontinued operation of the Venues business.
Net cash flows are presented on unrestricted cash on a Group share basis.
Net cash flow is based on unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and therefore does not include the movement in Lillie Square deposits on a Group share basis of 3.7 million.
com 41 Financial review continued Operating cash outflows of 24.0 million, of which 15.0 million relates to the CLSA annual payment, have decreased from 42.4 million for the year to 31 December 2016 as a result of changes in net working capital requirements.
During the year, 170.2 million was invested at Covent Garden for the purchase of three properties and subsequent expenditure for the development of property predominantly at Floral Court.
At Earls Court, total expenditure of 55.4 million comprises enablement works on ECPL land, construction of Lillie Square Phase 1, the acquisition of two properties and other subsequent expenditure.
The disposal of the Venues business resulted in a net inflow of 226 million after repayment of the 50 million drawn debt on the 100 million Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited loan facility, working capital adjustments and transaction related costs.
The proceeds were used to reduce the Groups net debt position and will be deployed in Capcos core central London estates.
Net sales proceeds from trading property comprise of 95.9 million, Group share, for the disposal of 177 units at Lillie Square 92.0 million and for the sale of the final two residential units at The Beecham, Covent Garden 3.9 million.
Disposal of investment property net of payments in relation to investments resulted in proceeds of 8.7 million being received during the year.
Net borrowings repaid during the period were 75.7 million.
Dividends paid of 6.7 million reflect the final dividend payment made in respect of the 2016 financial year and the interim dividend paid in September 2017.
This was lower than the previous year due to a higher take up of the scrip dividend alternative, 47 per cent versus 41 per cent in 2016.

The 31 December 2016 summary income statement has been re-presented to reflect the Venues business as a discontinued operation.
Lillie Square and Innova Investments.
Income Net rental income has increased by 8.3 million 14.4 per cent during the year mainly as a result of the positive performance at Covent Garden up 11.3 per cent like-for-like.
Of the increase, 5.4 million has been achieved on the like-for-like portfolio as the Group continues to convert the reversionary potential into contracted rents.
A further 2.9 million has been added through prior and current year acquisitions with the remaining increase resulting from the net effect of disposals and properties classified as development.
At Covent Garden gross income has increased by 15.4 per cent from 52.1 million in 2016 to 60.1 million whilst ERV has increased by 9.2 per cent from 96.0 million in 2016 to 104.8 million.
Loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property The loss on revaluation and sale of the Groups investment and development property was 28.0 million.
Covent Garden recorded a gain on revaluation of 93.4 million as a result of rental growth.
The loss on revaluation at Earls Court of 121.4 million was driven by changes in valuers assumptions and is reflective of recent evidence.
Administration expenses Administration expenses have decreased by 3.2 million on a headline basis.
The prior year included a 2.0 million credit for performance related employment costs and an assumed allocation of 4.0 million of head office costs to the Venues business.
Allowing for these items, like-for-like administration expenses of 38.7 million compared with 47.9 million in 2016, a decrease of 19.2 per cent.
Net finance costs Net finance costs have increased marginally to 19.8 million due to the higher level of average borrowings during the year.
com 43 Financial review continued Taxation The total tax charge for the year, made up of both underlying tax and non-underlying tax, is 6.7 million.
Tax on underlying profits of the Group was 2.7 million, which reflects a rate in line with the current rate of UK corporation tax.
The main rate of corporation tax reduced from 20 per cent to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017.
The corporation tax rate will further reduce to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020.
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on a theoretical disposal of all investment property held by the Group, was nil 31 December 2016: nil.
A disposal of the Groups trading properties at their market value net of available losses would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 1.6 million 19.25 per cent of 8.3 million.
The provisions of IAS 12 provide for the recognition of a deferred tax asset where it is probable there will be future taxable profit against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
As a result of the application of this provision, the Group has not recognised the deferred tax asset on decreases to the carrying value of investment property and certain losses carried forward.
The Groups tax policy, which has been approved by the Board and is available on the Group website, is aligned with the business strategy.
The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by structuring operations in a tax efficient manner, with external advice as appropriate, which complies with all relevant tax law and regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as a responsible taxpayer.
As a Group, we are committed to acting in an open and transparent manner.
Consistent with the Groups policy of complying with relevant tax legislation and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the Group maintains a constructive and open working relationship with HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment may be uncertain.
Dividends The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be paid on 23 May 2018 to shareholders on the register at 20 April 2018.
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
Going concern At 31 December 2017 the Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities were 690.8 million and its capital commitments were 61.3 million.
With a weighted average debt maturity of 6.9 years, loan to value of 21.3 per cent and sufficient headroom against all financial covenants, there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to meet both ongoing and future commitments for at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 2017 Annual Report & Accounts.
