Dear shareholder, This report focuses on how the Board has carried out its functions, its oversight of strategy and management activity, how it has applied good governance practices and how QinetiQ has complied with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and related regulations.
During the year under review, QinetiQ has progressed with delivery against the targets of its vision and strategy, which it developed and rolled out in 2015 and 2016, under the guidance of the Executive Committee which was set up at the end of the last financial year.
As part of this process, QinetiQ has sought to change its internal operating model, to provide greater efficiency in its offering to key customers and to expand internationally.
Against this backdrop of change, it is therefore critical that the Board of Directors provides leadership, guidance and oversight, to ensure that QinetiQ operates a sound system of corporate governance and internal control through effective stewardship and risk management.
Mark Elliott On the strategic and commercial front, during the Non-executive Chairman year, the Board of Directors was involved in decisions concerning critical strategic campaign activity, including the efficiencies provided to its key customer, the UK Ministry of Defence, under the amendment to the Long Term Partnering Agreement, the Strategic Enterprise contract, the Naval Combat Systems Integration Support Services contract, the acquisition of the Target Systems business in the UK and Canada, and the acquisition of RubiKon in Australia.

Further details of the audit tender process can provides leadership, be found on page 63 in the Audit Committee report.
In terms of leadership, as noted on page 4, the Chief guidance and oversight.
Financial Officer, David Mellors, resigned in December 2016 and was replaced by David Smith in March 2017.
There has been no change in Non-executive Directors during the year.
The Nominations Committee has reviewed the skills required in the current and future Non-executive Directors and, during the coming year, the composition of the Board and diversity will remain areas of focus.
During the current year, the Non-executive Directors have met with the wider leadership community at quarterly events, to increase their knowledge and understanding of the Companys businesses and how they operate.
The Non-executive Directors continue to bring independent judgement on key issues affecting the Group, and the Board intends to continue to provide a solid foundation of robust corporate governance to underpin the work of the executive management team as QinetiQ proceeds with its strategic campaigns.
