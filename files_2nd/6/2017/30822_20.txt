Presentation of information We account for our interests in joint ventures using the equity method as required by IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
This means that the income statement and the balance sheet include single lines for the Groups total share of post-tax profit and the net investment in joint ventures respectively.
Management review and monitor performance as well as determine the strategy of the business primarily on a proportionately consolidated basis.
This includes the Groups share of joint ventures on an individual line-by-line basis rather than a post-tax profit or net investment basis.
The gures and commentary presented are consistent with our management approach as we believe this provides a more meaningful analysis of the Groups performance.
The other information section provides reconciliations of the income statement and balance sheet between the two bases.
Alternative performance measures are also used to assess the Groups performance.
The significant measures are summarised as follows: Alternative performance Rationale measure used Like-for-like amounts Like-for-like amounts are presented as they indicate operating performance as distinct from the impact of acquisitions or disposals.
In respect of property, the like-for-like measure relates to property which has been owned throughout both periods without significant capital expenditure in either period, so that income can be compared on a like-for-like basis.
For the purposes of comparison of capital values, this will also include assets owned at the previous reporting period end but not throughout the prior period.
Further analysis is presented in the other information section and in the operating review.
Net asset value NAV NAV diluted, adjusted is presented as it is considered to be a key measure of the Groups performance.
The key difference from EPRA diluted, adjusted NAV, an industry standard comparable measure, is the exclusion of interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt as, in our view, this better allows management to review and monitor the Groups performance.
A reconciliation of NAV diluted, adjusted to NAV attributable to owners of intu properties plc is provided in note 13 a as well as on page 51 and to EPRA NAV within the other information section.
Underlying earnings Underlying earnings is presented as it is considered to be a key measure of the Groups recurring income performance and an indication of the extent to which dividend payments are supported by underlying operations see underlying profit statement in the other information section.
It excludes property and derivative valuation movements, exceptional items and related tax.
The key difference from EPRA earnings, an industry standard comparable measure, relates to adjustments in respect of exceptional items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made.
A reconciliation of underlying earnings to profit for the year attributable to owners of intu properties plc is provided in note 12 c as well as on page 49 and to EPRA earnings within the other information section.
