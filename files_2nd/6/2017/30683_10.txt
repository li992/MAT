We can directly image individual molecules, using a focused electron beam and, from the 2D projections obtained, build a 3D object so that we know what the molecule looks like and can understand how it functions.
This is revolutionising structural biology, allowing us to resolve the structures of complex macromolecular machines for the first time, investigate the biological mechanisms underlying disease states and design potential new drugs based on this knowledge.
For example, in collaboration with the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, we have applied this technology to define the worlds first protein structures for human ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM.
