In addition to these TFS joint venture performance In October 2016, SSP announced the agreement to create a joint venture with K Hospitality Group, whereby SSP would own a 49% share in Travel Food Services Private Limited TFS, a leading operator of food and beverage concessions in travel locations in India, through a two stage completion.
The Group owns a 33% share in TFS following the completion of the first stage of the acquisition acquired for net consideration of 35m.
The Group will acquire a further 16% share by the end of the 2018 calendar year for an estimated consideration of 21m.
SSP has management and operational control of the business and hence it is consolidated into SSPs financial results.
In the first ten months of ownership, revenue was 65.2m, with operating profit of 12.9m see table below.
The strong performance was driven by good sales growth and strong profit conversion, in part helped by the relatively lower labour costs in India, but also the delay in opening new units secured at Delhi airport, which will now open next year.

Share of profit of associates The Groups share of profit from associates was 3.4m 2016: 1.3m.
During the year we disposed of our investment in Avecra, which contributed approximately 1m to the associate income in the year.
Net finance costs Underlying net finance costs increased year-on-year to 17.6m, primarily due to movements in foreign exchange rates and higher interest rate swap costs.
Reported net finance costs were 19.6m, the additional 2.0m being the revaluation of the financial liability to acquire a further 16% interest in TFS.
Taxation The Groups underlying tax charge for the year was 33.8m 2016: 24.2m, equivalent to an effective tax rate of 22.7% 2016: 22.5% of the underlying profit before tax.
On a reported basis the tax charge for the year was 33.6m 2016: 23.8m.
11 STRATEGIC REPORT SSP GROUP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Non-controlling interests The non-controlling interests increased year-on-year by 8.6m to 18.4m.
The increase largely reflects the first time inclusion of TFS 6.8m and the growth in our joint venture businesses, most of which are in North America and the Rest of the World.
Earnings per share Underlying earnings per share, which excludes exceptional items, was 20.3 pence per share 2016: 15.5 pence per share.
Reported earnings per share was 19.5 pence per share 2016: 15.2 pence per share.
Dividends In line with the Groups stated priorities for the uses of cash and after careful review of the capital expenditure requirements for the coming years, the Board is proposing to increase the dividend payout ratio for this year to 40%, the top end of the range stated in the IPO prospectus.
This will equate to a final dividend of 4.9 pence per share 2016: 2.9 pence per share, which is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
If approved, this will result in a total dividend per share for the year of 8.1 pence 2016: 5.4 pence.
In addition to this, the Board proposes a special dividend in the region of 100m.
The Company is also proposing to undertake a share consolidation on the record date of the special dividend.
Both of these will contribute to maintaining balance sheet efficiency and reflect our confidence in the business.
The final dividend will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 29 March 2018 to shareholders on the register on 16 March 2018.
The exdividend date will be 15 March 2018.
The special dividend is expected to be paid in April 2018.
The special dividend and share consolidation will be subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in February 2018.
Further details of the special dividend and share consolidation including the final amount to be paid, the record date and proposed payment date for the special dividend will be set out in the notice of Annual General Meeting that will be sent to shareholders in January 2018.
Post balance sheet events On 17 October 2017, the Group successfully agreed an amend and extend of its existing debt facilities, securing an extension of the term by two years to July 2022, a slight reduction in the margin payable on the debt and an increase in its Revolving Credit Facility by 100m to150m.
Balance sheet and net debt The Groups balance sheet strengthened in the year, with year end net debt reducing to 262.2m 2016: 317.4m and net assets increasing to 465.0m 2016: 382.7m.
The table below explains the reduction in net debt during the year: m Opening net debt 1 October 2016 317.4 Net cash flow 67.5 Impact of foreign exchange rates 3.4 Acquisition of loans and other financial assets arising on business combination 7.5 Other 1.4 Closing net debt 30 September 2017 262.2 The reduction in net debt of 55.2m was driven by the net cash flow generation of 67.5m offset by a foreign exchange translation impact of 3.4m arising from the weakening of Sterling during the year and the acquisition of loans and other financial assets relating to TFS.
Leverage reduced during the year, leaving net debt:EBITDA at the year end at 1.0 times, compared with 1.6 times at the end of the prior year.

3 Comprises consideration of 42.7m adjusted for cash and cash equivalents acquired 15.2m, other financial assets acquired 0.8m and long and short-term borrowings acquired 8.3m, refer to note 9.
The Group generated net cash flow from operating activities of 255.3m 2016: 188.5m and underlying free cash flow of 89.0m, anincrease of 24.0m compared to 2016, driven by the growth in operating profit, and after increased investment in the business.
Capital expenditure increased by 19.1m to 115.0m, reflecting the increased contract wins in 2017.
The payment for the acquisition of the Groups current 33% investment in the TFS joint venture in India, after adjusting for net debt acquired, was 35.0m.
Working capital generated 18.3m of cash flow during the year.
The increase of 14.5m compared to last year reflected the strong sales growth and the fact that some payments at year end fell into October rather than September.
Net finance costs paid of 17.1m were higher than in 2016, primarily due to movements in foreign exchange rates and higher interest rate swap costs.
The dividend paid of 29.0m reflected the cost of the 2016 final dividend of 2.9 pence per share and the 2017 interim dividend of 3.2 pence per share.
Overall, the Group generated net cash flow of 60.0m during the year.
Summary Our overall financial performance has been strong, with good progress on underlying operating margin, up 80 bps on a constant currency basis, and healthy cash generation, despite increasing investment in the business.
We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, providing capacity for further growth.
