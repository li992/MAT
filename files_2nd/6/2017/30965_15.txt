THIS FINANCIAL REVIEW IS INTENDED TO CONVEY THE MAIN FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE AND TO PROVIDE A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF THE GROUPS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
ALL COMPARISONS REFER TO 2017 FIGURES COMPARED TO 2016, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.
THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND YEAR-ON-YEAR VARIATIONS ARE PRESENTED IN US DOLLARS, EXCEPT WHERE INDICATED.
THE FULL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THEIR ACCOMPANYING NOTES CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 186-243.
By following strict controls on cash, costs and expenses and while adhering to our capex budgets, we have maintained a 1 healthy cash and other liquid funds position and a low leverage ratio.
This has enabled us to invest in profitable growth and deliver solid returns to shareholders.
The following report presents how we have managed our Financial Capital.
COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE This has been another year of progress for Fresnillo, as we continued our long-established reputation for creating value through growth and returns.
Gross profit and EBITDA increased during the year by 4.9% and 2.7%, respectively.
We also 1 maintained a solid financial position, with US$896.0 million in cash and other liquid funds as of 31 December 2017 despite paying dividends of US$236.6 million in accordance with our policy and investing capex of US$604.8 million to underpin our future growth.
A number of factors contributed to the increase in gross profit and EBITDA, including the increased contribution of San Julin to silver and zinc sales, together with higher gold and base metals prices, which increased Adjusted revenue.
These factors were partly offset by cost pressures, higher depreciation charges and exploration expenses and, these together with the sale of a non-strategic exploration project and the effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar spot exchange rate on deferred taxes, resulted in an increase of 32.0% in net profit for the year.

FRESNILL FRESNILLO O STRA STRATEGIC TEGIC CORPORA CORPORATE TE FINANCIAL FINANCIAL T TO OD DAY AY REPORT REPORT GO GOVERNANCE VERNANCE ST STA ATEMENTS TEMENTS 105 105 FRESNILL FRESNILLO PL O PLC C ANNUAL REPORT AND A ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CCOUNTS 2017 The Groups financial performance is largely determined by the quality of our assets, the skills of our personnel and the execution capabilities of management to achieve our strategic goals.
However, there are a number of macroeconomic variables that lie beyond our control and which affect financial results.
These include: PRECIOUS METAL PRICES In 2017, the average realised gold and silver prices remained broadly stable at US$1,267.4 per ounce 2016: US$1,246.5 and US$17.0 per ounce 2016: US$17.2, respectively.
However, the average realised lead and zinc prices increased 24.9% and 34.9% year-on-year, to US$1.06 and US$1.36 per pound, respectively.
We hedged a portion of our by-product lead and zinc production but, contrary to previous years, this did not have an effect on revenue.
MX$ US$ EXCHANGE RATE The Mexican peso US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2017 was $19.74 per US dollar, compared to $20.66 per US dollar at 31 December 2016.
The 4.5% spot revaluation had a favourable effect, primarily on deferred income taxes.
This positively compared versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016, which resulted in a significant adverse effect on deferred income taxes.
The average spot Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate devalued by 1.5%, from $18.66 per US dollar in 2016 to $18.94 per US dollar in 2017.
This resulted in a favourable effect estimated at US$4.7 million on the Groups production costs, as costs denominated in Mexican pesos approximately 45% of total costs were lower when converted to US dollars.
COST INFLATION In 2017, there was a net increase in the weighted average input cost over the year, of 6.4%.
This inflation included the positive effect of the 1.5% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar.
LABOUR Unionised employees received on average a 5.8% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, and administrative employees at the mines received a 4.5% increase: when converted to US dollars, the weighted average labour inflation was 3.3%.
ENERGY ELECTRICITY The Groups weighted average cost of electricity increased by 28.9% from US$5.9 cents per kW in 2016 to US$7.6 cent per kW in 2017.
This increase was mainly explained by the higher average generating cost of the Comisin Federal fide Electricidad CFE, the national utility, following the increase in the prices of natural gas and fuel and, to a lesser extent, of imported coal.
DIESEL The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 22.2% to US$76.5 cents per litre in 2017, compared to US$62.6 cents per litre in 2016, reflecting the price liberalisation of fuels.
OPERATING MATERIALS Year over year change in unit price % Other reagents 31.1 Steel balls for milling 3.0 Lubricants 1.0 Tyres 5.2 Explosives 6.4 Sodium cyanide 17.3 Weighted average of all operating materials 1.1 Unit prices of the majority of certain operating materials decreased in US dollar terms.
However, this was mostly offset by the increase in the unit price of other reagents, particularly those linked to the price of copper and zinc, reflecting the higher metals prices.
As a result, the weighted average unit prices of all operating materials decreased by 1.1% over the year.
There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the devaluation of the MXN peso US dollar exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollar-denominated.
CONTRACTORS Agreements are signed individually with each contractor company, and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others.
Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs.
In 2017, increases granted to contractors, whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulting in a weighted average increase of 4.9% in US dollars.
MAINTENANCE Unit prices of spare parts for maintenance remained unchanged on average in US dollar terms 0.4% increase.

The remaining components had an average inflation of 0.8% in US dollars over 2016.
The effects of the above external factors, combined with the Groups internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.

This was explained by the 9.2% increase in Adjusted revenue as a result of the increase in volumes of silver and zinc sold and higher realised metal prices, except for silver.

The remaining 39.0%, or US$73.4 million, was explained by the benefit of higher gold, lead and zinc prices.
As expected, the contribution of San Julin changed the relative proportion of Adjusted revenue, with silver revenue representing 38% of total Adjusted revenue in 2017 compared to 35% in 2016.
Gold contribution to Adjusted revenue decreased from 55% in 2016 to 50% in 2017 as a result of the expected decrease in volumes of gold sold.
The contribution of by-product lead and zinc to the Groups Adjusted revenue increased from 9% in 2016 to 12% in 2017, due to higher lead and zinc prices and the increased volumes of zinc sold, primarily from the San Julin and Fresnillo mines.
Herradura remained the main contributor to Adjusted revenue, reflecting a further decrease in gold inventories during the year.
Saucito continued to be the second largest contributor, although its contribution declined from 26% in 2016 to 23% in 2017, in line with a 4.5% decrease in Adjusted revenue.
Fresnillos contribution remained stable at 19%, notwithstanding the 10.0% increase in total Group Adjusted revenue.
San Julin phase I and phase II contributed 13% to the Groups Adjusted revenue.
The relative contribution to silver Adjusted revenue changed over the year with San Julin phase I and II representing 18.6%, while the contributions of Saucito, Fresnillo and Cinega decreased as expected, reflecting an expanded silver asset base.
Similarly, contribution to gold revenue was modified with the San Julin mine representing 9.3% of total Adjusted gold revenue.

These contracts will start to mature in 2018.
As no hedging structures expired in 2017, there was no effect on revenue.

In the second half of 2014, Fresnillo plc initiated a one-off hedging programme to protect the value of the investment made in the Penmont acquisition.
The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 1,559,689 oz of gold with monthly maturities until December 2019.
The table below illustrates the expired structures and the outstanding hedged position as of 31 December 2017.
Fresnillo plcs hedging policy remained unchanged for the remainder of the portfolio, providing shareholders with full exposure to gold and silver prices.
TREATMENT AND REFINING CHARGES 3 Treatment and refining charges are reviewed annually using international benchmarks.
Treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 18.8% and 17.8%, respectively, compared to 2016.
However, this was partly offset by the 2.0% increase in silver refining charges and the increase in volumes of zinc concentrates with high silver contents shipped from Fresnillo and San Julin phase II to Met-Mex, as well as the increased volumes of precipitates sold from San Julin phase I.
As a result, treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement decreased by only 0.8% over 2016.

The US$144.5 million increase is explained by the following combination of factors: An increase in Adjusted production costs US$150.3 million.
This was primarily due to: i additional Adjusted production costs associated with the increased production US$94.7 million : ii cost inflation US$40.2 million : iii increases in the use of consumables, services, maintenance and others US$17.9 million : and iv the lower volume of ore processed from development works at Saucito US$12.7 million.
The increase was partly offset by the decrease in development works charged to production costs US$10.5 million and the positive effect of the 1.5% devaluation of the average Mexican peso US dollar spot exchange rate US$4.7 million.
This is due to the additional asset base at San Julin, mitigated by lower depreciation at the other operating mines.
Reversal of inventories write-down in 2016 and others US$17.5 million.
Profit sharing increased slightly by US$1.8 million.
These negative effects were partly offset by: Variation in change in work in progressUS$43.3 million.
This reflected the further decrease in inventories on the leaching pads at Herradura, albeit not of the same magnitude as the decrease in 2016.
Mexican peso US dollar hedgingUS$2.8 million.
With the Mexican peso exchange rate hedging programme suspended, there was no effect in the income statement in 2017, compared to the US$2.8 million loss recorded in 2016.
COST PER TONNE, CASH COST PER OUNCE AND ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST AISC Cost per tonne is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine.
This indicator is calculated as total production costs, plus ordinary mining rights, less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects, divided by total tonnage processed.
We have included cost per tonne hauled moved as we believe it is a useful indicator to thoroughly analyse cost performance for the open pit mines.

110 110 FRESNILL FRESNILLO PL O PLC C ANNUAL REPORT AND A ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED The particular variations in cash cost for each mine are explained as follows: FRESNILLO: US$0.71 OZ 2017 VERSUS US$2.09 OZ 2016, -66.2% The decrease in cash cost per ounce is mainly explained by: the higher by-product credits per silver ounce, due to the increase in zinc volumes sold, and higher lead and zinc pricesUS$1.60 oz : lower treatment and refining chargesUS$0.26 oz : and increase in ore gradeUS$0.07 oz.
This was partly offset by higher cost per tonne US$0.54 oz see page 55.
SAUCITO: US$1.50 OZ 2017 VERSUS US$0.39 OZ 2016, N A The increase was driven by: the higher cost per tonne US$1.69 oz see page 56 : the expected lower silver grade US$0.53 oz : and lower by-product credits per ounce of silver resulting from the decrease in volume of gold sold US$0.08 oz.
These adverse effects were partly offset by lower treatment and refining chargesUS$0.39 oz and lower profit sharingUS$0.03 oz.
CINEGA: -US$163.74 OZ 2017 VERSUS US$217.19 OZ 2016, N A The increase in cash cost was primarily due to: the higher cost per tonne US$225.41 oz see page 58 : and the expected decrease in gold grade US$23.81 oz.
These unfavourable factors were partly offset by higher by-product credits per ounce of gold, due to the increased volumes of silver and lead sold, and higher lead and zinc pricesUS$179.45 oz : lower treatment and refining chargesUS$13.40 oz : and lower profit sharingUS$2.92 oz.
HERRADURA: US$492.86 OZ 2017 VERSUS US$470.72 OZ 2016, 4.7% The increase in cash cost resulted from: the higher cost per tonne US$29.81 oz see page 60 : the lower gold grade US$25.95 oz : higher profit sharing US$0.66 oz : and lower by-product credits per gold ounce, due to the decreased volume of silver sold at a lower price US$0.61 oz.
These adverse effects were offset by: a favourable inventory valuation effect, as ounces with a higher cost of production in the current period are mixed with the initial lower cost of inventory affecting cost of salesUS$34.76 oz : and lower treatment and refining chargesUS$0.13 oz.
NOCHE BUENA: US$793.48 OZ 2017 VERSUS US$765.90 OZ 2016, 3.6% The increase in cash cost per ounce was mainly due to: the favourable effect of the reversal of the write-down of gold inventories on the leaching pads in 2016, which did not occur in 2017 US$37.59 oz : and lower by-product credits US$2.22 oz.
This was partly offset by the higher ore gradeUS$6.07 oz see page 62 and othersUS$6.17 oz.
SAN JULIN PHASE I: As operations commenced in August 2016, AISC for 2016 is not considered representative as it corresponds to the start-up period, when a significant volume of ore from the stock pile was processed.
SAN JULIN PHASE II: As operations commenced in July 2017, there are no comparable year-on-year figures.
In addition to the traditional cash cost described above, the Group is reporting all-in sustaining costs AISC, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the World Gold Council.
This cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs, community costs related to current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses.
We consider all-in sustaining costs to be a reasonable indicator of a mines ability to generate free cash flow when compared with the corresponding metal price.
We also believe it is a means to monitor not only current production costs, but also sustaining costs as it includes mine development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, as well as sustaining capex.

Saucito: Higher, as a result of the higher cash cost, an increase in sustaining capex and higher capitalised mine development.
Cinega: Higher, primarily explained by the higher cash cost, an increase in sustaining capex and higher capitalised mine development.
Herradura: Higher, mainly due to an increase in capitalised stripping costs: and to a lesser extent, the higher cash cost detailed above, partially offset by lower sustaining capex.
Noche Buena: Higher, driven by the higher cash cost detailed above.

San Julin phase II : As operations commenced in July 2017, there are no comparable year-on-year figures.
GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses, is a key financial indicator of profitability at each business unit and the Fresnillo Group as a whole.
The US$43.3 million increase in gross profit was mainly explained by: i the higher profits associated with increased production of US$142.9 million: ii the US$72.3 million estimated benefit of the increase in metal prices: and iii the US$4.7 million favourable effect of the Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate devaluation.
These factors were partly offset by: i the lower ore grades mainly at Saucito and Herradura, which had an estimated adverse impact of US$88.1 million: ii cost inflation estimated at US$40.2 million and others of US$48.3 million.
Herradura and Saucito remained the largest contributors to the Groups consolidated gross profit, albeit with a decrease in their gross profit when compared to 2016.
Gross profit at the Fresnillo mine increased by 20.8% over 2016, while the mines contribution to the Groups total gross profit increased to 20.9%.
San Julin was the fourth largest contributor, providing 10.1% of total gross profit, while Noche Buena and Cinegas share of the Groups total gross profit remained broadly unchanged.
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Administrative expenses increased 22.9% from US$59.1 million to US$72.7 million, due mainly to additional administrative personnel hired to service a larger number of mines and projects and an increase in services provided by third parties advisors, consultants and service providers.
Furthermore, increased administrative services provided by Servicios Industriales Peoles, S. A.
B fide C. V. in relation to San Julin phase I and phase II also contributed to the increase in administrative expenses during the year.

An additional US$4.2 million was capitalised, mainly relating to exploration expenses at the Juanicipio project, and to a lesser extent at Guanajuato.
As a result, risk capital invested in exploration totalled US$145.3 million in 2017, a 5.4% increase over 2016.
In 2018, total invested in exploration is expected to be approximately US$200 million, of which US$8 million is estimated to be capitalised.

It is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation, less administrative, selling and exploration expenses.
In 2017, EBITDA increased 2.7% to US$1,060.1 million mainly due to the higher revenue.
This was partly offset by the higher adjusted production costs, exploration and administrative expenses.
However, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased, from 54.2% in 2016 to 50.6% in 2017.
OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES In 2017, other income and expenses of US$16.8 million was recognised in the income statement, mainly resulting from the sale of non-strategic mining claims to Argonaut Gold Inc around its Castillo mine.
This compares favourably against the US$9.0 million expense recorded in 2016, which included disposals of fixed assets, remediation works and costs incurred in the maintenance of closed mines.
SILVERSTREAM EFFECTS The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value.
The revaluation of the Silverstream contract generated a US$70.3 million non-cash gain mainly as a result of converting resources into reserves at Sabinas and the higher forward price of silver.
In addition, a US$43.3 million non-cash gain was generated by: the unwinding of the discounted values: and the difference between payments volume and price actually received and accrued in 2017 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2016.

The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract.
Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section on page 115 and in notes 14 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
FINANCE COSTS AND INCOME Finance costs and income in 2017 rose by 3.6%, from US$32.2 million to US$34.0 million, mainly due to the decrease in borrowing costs capitalised in 2017 compared to 2016.
In addition, a US$41.1 million non-cash finance loss was generated by the mark-to-market time value of the outstanding gold hedging programme which was put in place to protect the investment made in the acquisition of the 44% stake of Newmont in Penmont in 2014.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE A foreign exchange loss of US$6.4 million was recorded as a result of the realised transactions in the year and the positive effect of the 4.5% spot revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar on the value of peso-denominated net monetary assets.
This compared favourably against the US$18.4 million foreign exchange loss recognised in 2016.
We also enter into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in euro EUR, Swedish krona SEK and Canadian dollar CAD.
At the end of the year, the total EUR, SEK and CAD outstanding net forward position was EUR 8.79 million, CAD 0.76 million and SEK 32.06 million with maturity dates from March through September 2018.
The volume that expired in 2017 was EUR 9.23 million with a weighted average strike of 1.1368 US$ EUR, and SEK 15.31 million with a weighted average strike of 8.43 SEK US$, which has generated a gain of US$6,532 and US$55,119 respectively, both being recorded in the income statement.
TAXATION Corporate income tax expense decreased from US$260.0 million in 2016 to US$153.5 million in 2017, despite the 3.2% increase in profit before income tax.
This decrease resulted mainly from the effect of the 4.5% revaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar spot exchange rate in 2017 versus the 20.1% devaluation in 2016 on the tax value of assets and liabilities: together with the impact of the higher inflation rate 6.7% in 2017 versus 3.4% in 2016 on the inflationary uplift of the tax base of assets and liabilities.
The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 20.7%, which was below the 30% statutory tax rate.
This was mainly due to the tax credit related to the special tax on diesel, the inflationary uplift of the assets, liabilities and tax losses, and the revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, which impacted the carrying amount of assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars and their tax bases denominated in Mexican pesos see note 10 to the financial statements.
Including the effect of the special mining rights, the effective tax rate was 24.4% in 2017.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR Profit for the year increased from US$425 million to US$560.8 million, while profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group increased to US$560.6 million, up from US$427.0 million in 2016.
Excluding the effects of the Silverstream Contract, profit for the year increased from US$331.5 million to US$481.2 million.
Similarly, profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group, excluding the Silverstream effects, increased to US$481.0 million, up from US$333.5 million.

114 114 FRESNILL FRESNILLO PL O PLC C ANNUAL REPORT AND A ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CCOUNTS 2017 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital increased by 4.9% to US$1,073.7 million, mainly as a result of the higher profits generated in the year.
Working capital increased US$2.9 million mainly due to an increase in trade and other receivables resulting from the higher volumes sold and the higher gold, lead and zinc prices US$44.4 million : and an increase in prepayments and other assets US$0.7 million.
This increase in working capital was partly offset by a decrease in inventories US$5.7 million and an increase in trade and other payables US$36.4 million.
Taxes and employee profit sharing paid increased 169.4% over 2016 to US$309.3 million.
As a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities decreased 15.2% from US$898.0 million in 2016 to US$761.5 million in 2017.
Other sources of cash were the proceeds of the Silverstream Contract of US$43.3 million, proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets of US$26.1 million and capital contributions from minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$18.9 million.
The above funds were mainly used to purchase property, plant and equipment for a total of US$604.8 million, a 39.3% increase over 2016.
Capital expenditures for 2017 are further described below: PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2017 US$ million Mine development and purchase of in-mine equipment and installation of a new zinc thickener and vertical Fresnillo mine 111.7 conveyor band Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, construction of the Pyrites plant and deepening of the Saucito mine 133.7 Jarillas shaft Stripping activities, sustaining capex and construction Herradura mine 153.2 of second line of DLP San Julin 79.1 Completion of San Julin phase II Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, Cinega mine 46.5 construction of tailings dam and purchase of land Noche Buena 18.7 Mining works and sustaining capex Juanicipio project 34.1 Exploration expenditure and construction of ramps Other 27.7 Total purchase of property, plant and equipment 604.8 Dividends paid to shareholders of the Group in 2017 totalled US$236.6 million, a 168.2% increase from 2016, in line with our dividend policy that includes a consideration of profits generated in the period.
The 2017 payment included the final 2016 dividend of US$158.4 million and the 2017 interim dividend paid in September of US$78.2 million.
Net interest of US$21.0 million was paid, mainly reflecting the interest paid in relation with the issuance of the US$800 million principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a decrease in net cash of US$16.0 million net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, which combined with the US$912.0 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$896.0 million at the end of 2017.

This represented a 1.7% decrease versus December 2016, as explained on the previous page.
Inventories decreased 2.1% to US$271.1 million mainly as a result of the further decrease in inventories of gold deposited on the leaching pads at Herradura.
Trade and other receivables increased 40.3% to US$402.1 million as a result of the increase in income tax recoverable, higher metal volumes sold which increased receivables and an increase in value added tax receivable.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$467.5 million at the beginning of the year to US$538.9 million as of 31 December 2017 reflects proceeds of US$42.3 million corresponding to 2017 US$37.4 million in cash and US$4.9 million in receivables and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US$113.7 million.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,448.6 million at year end, representing a 12.3% increase over 2016.
The US$268.4 million increase was mainly due to: the larger asset base following the commissioning of San Julin: capitalised development works: construction of the Pyrites plant and the second DLP line: purchase of additional in-mine equipment: and the construction of leaching pads at Herradura and Noche Buena.
The Groups total equity was US$3,066.6 million as of 31 December 2017, a 12.9% increase over 2016.
This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2016 profit, lower dividends paid during the year and the net unrealised gains on cash flow hedges.
DIVIDENDS Based on the Groups 2017 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of US$29.8 cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 4 June 2018 to shareholders on the register on 27 April 2018.
The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars.
This is in addition to the interim dividend of US$10.6 cents per share totalling US$78.1 million.
