STRATEGIC REPORT Chief Financial Officers review Introduction In this section I cover all the financial aspects of the business looking not only at performance but also at other significant value drivers such as capital allocation and structure, and return on capital employed.
2017 has witnessed a material evolution in our capital strategy which I cover in some detail below.
In any analysis of our performance, it is important to understand the difference between system sales and statutory revenue, and why we as a business focus more on the former as a driver of performance rather than statutory revenue.
System sales are the total sales to BALANCING GROWTH, endcustomers through our network ofstores.
For stores owned and operated SUSTAINABILITY AND by franchisees, these are not in our statutory revenue but do drive revenue through foodsales to franchisees and royalty fees.
For stores which we own and operate ourselves which we call corporate stores, these do appear in our statutory revenue.
The vast majority of our store network is RE TURNS franchisee operated.
Statutory revenue consists of food and non-food sales to franchisees, royalties paid by franchisees, rental income and Statutory revenue of 474.6m, up 29.3% end-customer sales in our corporate stores see above.
on a 52 week basis Statutory revenue is a more volatile indicator Underlying PBT is 96.2m, on a 52week of our performance for two reasons.
First, basis growth is 10.2% food wholesale prices are much more volatile than menu prices: this means that the unit price of goods we sell to franchisees Underlying basic EPS of 16.0p, up 13.9% fluctuates more than the prices paid by on a 52 week basis customers.
As a result, system sales give a useful alternative reading over time of the Total investments in capex and M&A health and growth of the business.
Second, revenue contains items such as rental of91.1m income which are only accounted forbecause we hold the head leases for Total cash returned to shareholders ourfranchisees stores and then sub-let of77.0m tothem: these are not a driver of value.
From a performance perspective, we New five-year credit facility of 350m arealso much more focused on operating margin as measured against system sales Target capital structure of 1.75-2.5x than against statutory revenue.
The volatility netdebt EBITDA reflects strong cash of dairy prices means that we target a cash generation of the business gross profit per unit from cheese, rather than a percentage gross margin.
When prices are falling, our statutory margin percentage rises, and vice versa.
However, this has little bearing on the system sales operating margin, which tends to iron out food price volatility.
