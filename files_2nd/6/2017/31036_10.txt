Growing revenue In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2016 volume rate Out-patient Other 2017 Growth Underlying revenue 872.1 9.8 19.1 0.7 0.4 881.1 1.0% Non underlying revenue 54.3 1.1 0.9 0.8 2.5 50.6 Total revenue 926.4 931.7 0.6% Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 increased by 5.3 million, or 0.6%, to 931.7 million 2016: 926.4 million.
Underlying revenue grew by 9.0 million, or 1.0%, to 881.1 million 2016: 872.1 million.
Of the underlying revenue growth of 1.0%: a decrease of 1.8% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.1% decline in revenue in the year, with Self-pay admissions growth compensating for volume declines in both NHS and PMI business: the Group reported a 1.6% increase in rate for in-patient and daycase admissions average revenue per case equivalent to an increase to total revenue of 2.2%.
This was the result of modest increases in case mix complexity and PMI contractual price increases, which delivered growth in average revenue per case across all payor groups, most particularly in PMI and Self-pay activity in the year notwithstanding reductions to applicable NHS tariffs of 3.9% from April 2017 : and a decline in out-patient revenues, which was directly linked to in-patient and daycase surgical volumes.
The impact of reduced NHS volumes was felt less than private activity as it carries less out-patient revenues and as a consequence the decline in out-patient revenues accounted for only a 0.1% decline in underlying revenues overall.
The reduction in non underlying revenues includes the impacts of the closure of Lifescan in 2016 and the closure of operations in Manchester during January 2017 whilst activity was transferred between the old and new sites.

Underlying revenue declined by 6.2 million, or 1.5%, to 394.9 million 2016: 401.1 million.
Of the underlying decline in PMI revenue of 1.5%: a decrease of 4.6% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 3.0% reduction in PMI revenue in the year: the Group reported a 3.0% increase in rate for in-patient and daycase admissions average revenue per case, equivalent to an increase to PMI revenues overall of 1.6%.
This rate increase was a combination of contractual increases to prices and a modest increase in the complexity of work undertaken in the year: and out-patient revenues contributed 0.2% to the overall decline in PMI revenues, performing significantly better than the volume led decline in in-patient and daycase admissions in the year.
NHS In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2016 volume rate Out-patient 2017 Growth Underlying NHS revenue 282.6 4.1 2.8 0.1 281.2 0.5% Non underlying revenue 10.8 1.9 2.3 6.6 Total NHS revenue 293.4 287.8 1.9% NHS revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 decreased by 5.6 million, or 1.9%, to 287.8 million 2016: 293.4 million.
Underlying NHS revenue declined by 1.4 million, or 0.5%, to 281.2 million 2016: 282.6 million.
Of the underlying decline in NHS revenue of 0.5%: a decrease of 1.8% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.5% decrease in NHS revenue in the year, skewed heavily to NHS local contract work see below : against the backdrop of a weighted decrease to NHS tariff for the Group of 2.8% for the financial year, the average revenue per case for NHS admissions increased by 1.3% over 2016.
Growth in in-patient and daycase rate average revenue per case contributed 1.0% to underlying NHS revenue growth in the year.
This was the result of a further concentration of case mix to higher yielding procedures notably in orthopaedics offsetting the impact of NHS tariff decline from April 2017: and out-patient revenue was stable during the year as a consequence of the bias in performance towards NHS e-Referrals relative to NHS local contract work which often carries little or no out-patient element.
The underlying revenue decline in NHS revenue of 0.5% is split as follows: NHS e-Referral previously NHS Choose and Book revenue grew by 5.5% in the year ended 31 December 2017: NHS local revenue declined by 26.2% in the same period.
Management had expected NHS local contract revenue to decline in 2017 due to removal of fines linked to referral to treatment time key performance indicators.
This reduced the appetite of NHS trusts to outsource work: and NHS e-Referrals revenue account for 86.0% of underlying NHS revenue in the year ended 31 December 2017, up from 81.2% in the prior year.
Self-pay In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2016 volume rate Out-patient 2017 Growth Underlying Self-pay revenue 156.6 7.6 8.5 2.7 175.4 12.0% Non underlying revenue 13.8 0.3 0.1 2.7 11.5 Total Self-pay revenue 170.4 186.9 9.7% Self-pay revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 increased by 16.5 million, or 9.7%, to 186.9 million 2016: 170.4 million.
Underlying revenue grew by 18.8 million, or 12.0%, to 175.4 million 2016: 156.6 million.
Of the underlying growth in Self-pay revenue of 12.0%: an increase of 6.5% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 4.4% increase in Self-pay revenue in the year: the average revenue per case for Self-pay in-patient and daycase admissions grew by 7.9% over the prior year, contributing 5.7% to the increase in Self-pay revenue in the year.
Price increases in 2017 were largely inflationary, with the balance of the increase in average rate per case arising from improved case mix complexity: and out-patient activities in 2017 grew 0.2% as price increases were tempered in order to drive in-patient and daycase demand.
Overall the increase in Self-pay out-patient revenue drove 0.1% of the increase in underlying Self-pay revenue for the year.
35 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial review Continued Other revenue Other revenue, which includes fees paid to the Group by consultants e. g. for the use of Group facilities and services and third-party revenue e. g. pathology services to third-parties, decreased by 2.3 million, or 6.9%, in the year, to 31.0 million 2016: 33.3 million.
Of the 2.3 million decrease in revenue, 1.8 million relates to pathology revenue which has reduced as a result of a refocusing of the Spire pathology service to support the hospital network rather than third-party external contracts.
Cost of sales and gross profit Cost of sales increased in the year by 6.3 million, or 1.3%, to 492.2 million 2016: 485.9 million on revenues that increased 0.6% in the year.
Underlying cost of sales increased in the year by 7.5 million, or 1.7%, on underlying revenues that increased by 1.0% in the year.
Underlying gross margin for the year of 2017 was 48.2%, compared with 48.5% in 2016.
Cost of sales as a percentage of relevant revenue are as follows: Group Underlying Year ended 31 December Year ended 31 December 2017 2016 2017 2016 Clinical staff 19.6% 18.9% 18.8% 18.1% Direct costs 22.1% 22.2% 21.9% 21.7% Medical fees and other 11.1% 11.3% 11.1% 11.7% Cost of sales 52.8% 52.4% 51.8% 51.5% Gross margin 47.2% 47.6% 48.2% 48.5% Overall, the Group has substantially mitigated the impact on gross margin arising from the effective 2.8% reduction in NHS Tariff effectiveApril2017 3.8%.
Management actions alongside case mix changes have generated medical fee savings in the year.
Procurement initiatives have ,  arising from NHS tariff.
Supply-side constraints to nursing resource continue to exist: clinical staff costs as a percentage of revenues have increased in 2017 compared to the prior year.
Management is focused on continuous improvement of recruitment and training and development processes in the business as well as rostering and productivity improvements designed to limit use of agency staff.
Other operating costs Other operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2017 increased by 49.1 million, or 14.1%, to 396.6 million 2016: 347.5 million.
Excluding exceptional and other items, other operating costs for the year increased by 15.1 million, or 4.5%, to 347.4 million.
Underlying other operating costs increased in the year by 45.4 million, or 13.7%, to 375.9 million 2016: 330.5 million.
Excluding exceptional and other items, underlying other operating costs for the year increased by 11.4 million, or 3.6%, to 326.7 million.

Underlying EBITDA decreased by 7.5 million, or 4.7%, from 159.7 million to 152.2 million.
The Group EBITDA margin of 16.1% compares to 17.5% in 2016 and was impacted by the start-up nature of new hospitals opening.
The Group underlying EBITDA margin of 17.3% compares to 18.3% in 2016 and the movement is the result of hospital and central overhead and rent increases explained below.
Hospital and central overhead costs have increased as a consequence of the opening of new hospitals in Manchester and Nottingham and the annualised impact of the expansion of Spire St Anthonys Hospital.
In addition investments have been made in central overheads to support additional training and development of our people, clinical and non-clinical assurance functions and sales and marketing to support Self-pay growth.
36 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial statements Other information On an underlying basis, the increase in hospital and central overhead costs is substantially linked to those central investment initiatives referred to opposite.
Underlying depreciation charged in the year increased by 5.3 million, or 10.9%, to 54.0 million 2016: 48.7 million as the Group continues to invest in capacity and capability across the existing network of hospitals.
Total depreciation charged in the year of 57.4 million includes that arising on the new hospital in Nottingham and higher charges on Spire Manchester and Spire St Anthonys hospitals as a consequence of the investment in new and extended facilities in these sites respectively.
Rent of land and buildings for the year increased by 1.2 million, or 1.9%, to 63.9 million 2016: 62.7 million.
The increase is mainly due to inflationary uplifts in relation to annual rent indexation in line with RPI.
Share based payments During the year, grants were made to Executive Directors and members of the senior leadership team under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the charge to the income statement was 1.0 million 2016: 0.4 million, or 1.1 million inclusive of National Insurance 2016: 0.6 million.

In 2016 the costs primarily relate to National Insurance on Directors Share Bonus Award granted at the time of the IPO.
Following the completion of the criminal proceedings against Ian Paterson a consultant who previously had practicing privileges at Spire Healthcare earlier in 2017, Spire Healthcare settled all current and known claims against Spire relating to his practice at Spire Healthcare.
Accordingly, Spire Healthcare has provided 28.7 million in relation to this settlement, plus related costs, of which 26.1 million has been paid.
Spire Healthcare is currently pursuing legal action against its insurers to seek recoveries against this settlement and related costs, which may give rise to future exceptional income being recognised in the income statement.
No account has been taken of these further recoveries in the results for the year ended 31 December 2017.
In the final quarter of 2017, management undertook a strategic review of its current portfolio of sites and the future development options for the Group.
As part of the process, the decision was taken to cease the provision of radiotherapy services at the Spire Cancer Care Centre in Baddow Essex as a consequence of poor commercial performance.
The charge for the year includes 10.3 million for the write-off of fixed assets, net of recoverable value, and a provision for site closure costs.
Additionally, certain well progressed capital projects, notably the development of a hospital in Central London, have been aborted and the costs associated with these projects have been charged as exceptional items in the year due to the fundamental change in development strategy.
Hospital set-up and closure costs include the pre-opening expenses for the two new hospitals opened during 2017 Spire Manchester and Spire Nottingham hospitals, plus the decommissioning costs of the former Manchester hospital site.
An Executive Director had a period of illness during 2017.
Costs associated with his remuneration during his medical leave were duplicative to the business.
After sadly passing away in July 2017, Spire Healthcare made a death in service payment which has also been included in exceptional items.
In the year ended 31 December 2016, business reorganisation mainly comprised staff restructuring costs and the closure costs relating to an onerous contract.
In the year, the Groups goodwill in relation to the Lifescan business was written-off following a strategic review and the closure of this operation.
Hospital set-up costs refer to pre-opening costs for the new Spire Manchester and Spire Nottingham hospitals.
The reversal of the impairment is the result of the reassessment of the lives of medical and other equipment following the relocation of the assets from the previous Spire Manchester Hospital to the new hospital facility and other Group hospitals following its closure.
Hospital closure costs relate to the decommissioning of the assets related to the previous 37 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 Group financial review Continued Spire Manchester Hospital.
Corporate restructuring related to an internal Group reorganisation and transaction costs relating to the Asset Swap Transaction as described below.
Except for the corporate restructuring costs, which were capital in nature, and write-off of intangible assets, all other exceptional costs are expected to be tax deductible.
On 31 August 2016, as a result of the development of a new hospital facility in Manchester and the closure of the previous Spire Manchester Hospital previously held under an operating lease, the freehold interest in Spire Wirral Hospital with a net book value of 11.7 million was disposed of, and leased back in a sale and leaseback transaction.
The consideration for the sale was realised in the form of a non-cash asset, being the freehold of the previous Spire Manchester Hospital, which was simultaneously acquired by the Group the Asset Swap Transaction.
The overall loss on these transactions was 7.7 million before sale costs of 1.2 million.
For 2017, 4.0 million 2016: 3.7 million in respect of wages, salaries and social security costs note 8 on page 123 is included in write-off and aborted project costs, executive medical leave and death in service, business reorganisations, hospital set-up costs, hospital closure, other and corporate restructuring costs.

Full details of exceptional items are disclosed in note 9 on page 124.
Net finance costs Net finance costs increased by 2.0% to 20.2 million 2016: 19.8 million as a result of incremental increase in finance lease costs.
Taxation The taxation charge for the year is impacted by exceptional and other items in both 2017 and 2016.
The table below provides a reconciliation of the total taxation charge for the year to the adjusted tax charge for the year, before exceptional and other items.

This change has resulted in a deferred tax credit in 2017 of 0.5 million arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax liabilities to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those liabilities are expected to reverse in the future.
For the year ended 31 December 2016 the effective tax rate of 13.3% is reduced relative to the 20.0% prevailing UK corporation tax rate by prior year adjustments to deferred taxation 2.4 million credit and the impact on deferred tax net liabilities of previous changes to the future rate of UK corporation tax 5.2 million credit.
