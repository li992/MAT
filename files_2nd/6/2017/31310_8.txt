Non-operating Foreign Exchange Gains Losses Non-operating foreign exchange gains losses are mainly due to the conversion of loans in currencies different to the functional currency of certain subsidiaries of the Group, and are the net effect from a lower devaluation of the Hryvnia to the US Dollar in 2017 compared to 2016 and a significantly stronger appreciation of the Euro to the US Dollar.
The Euro appreciated from 0.956 per US Dollar to 0.838 per US Dollar in 2017.

The Hryvnia was relatively stable against the US Dollar, depreciating by 3%, and it did not impact costs of production materially.
Approximately half of the Groups cost of sales is incurred in Hryvnia, with electricity costs the largest component.
However, the electricity cost also has exposure to the US Dollar as approximately 35% of electricity generation in Ukraine comes from thermal coal which is priced in US Dollars.
In terms of logistics costs incurred within Ukraine, approximately 90% are in Hryvnia.
