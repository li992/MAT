Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 37 Chief Financial Officers review continued Basis of preparation The following discussion and analysis on pages 38 to 50 is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, that form part of this annual report.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU as explained on page 136. Business Performance statutory results 2017 2016 Statutory results at actual exchange rates m m YoY Revenue 7,828 7,590 3.1% Adjusted profit before interest, tax and amortisation Adjusted PBITA 491 461 6.5% Specific items net 34 13 Restructuring costs 20 12 Profit on disposal closure of subsidiaries businesses 74 7 Goodwill impairment 9 Acquisition-related amortisation 10 32 Operating profit 501 402 24.6% Interest costs net 115 106 8.5% Profit before tax 386 296 30.4% Tax 128 76 68.4% Profit after tax 258 220 17.3% Loss from discontinued operations 6 3 100.0% Profit for the year 252 217 16.1% Non-controlling interests 16 19 15.8% Earnings profit attributable to equity holders of the parent 236 198 19.2% EPS 15.2p 12.8p 18.8% Operating cash flow 488 615 20.7% Revenue Revenue increased by 3.1% compared with the prior year statutory reported results presented at historical exchange rates.
On a constant-currency basis, revenue decreased by 1.2%, reflecting a reduction in revenue from businesses identified for sale or closure of 335m primarily due to businesses disposals in the current and prior years including the Groups US Youth Services business and its business in Israel see page 39 and note 17 in 2017.
Revenue from onerous contracts was slightly higher than the prior year at 119m 2016: 115m.
Excluding revenue from onerous contracts and from businesses identified for sale or closure, revenue grew by 3.2% at constant exchange rates.
Business performance is discussed in more detail by region on page 51.
Adjusted PBITA Adjusted PBITA of 491m 2016: 461m was up 6.5% including the benefits of exchange rate movements in the year.
On a constantcurrency basis, Adjusted PBITA increased 1.9% reflecting the strong performance of the Group in developed markets, improved product mix and the results of our on-going productivity programmes, partially offset by the weakness in the Middle East & India and a reduction in Adjusted PBITA from businesses held for sale or closure of 11m primarily due to business disposals in the current and prior years see page 44.
Excluding Adjusted PBITA from onerous contracts and businesses identified for sale or closure, Adjusted PBITA increased by 4.2% at constant exchange rates.
38 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Net specific items Specific items resulted in a net charge of 34m 2016: 13m, of which 19m 2016: 4m primarily relates to the anticipated total losses over the next 15 to 20 years in respect of certain UK contracts.
The net specific item charge also includes 6m relating to the estimated cost of settlement of subcontractor claims from commercial disputes in respect of prior years, and 9m relating mainly to the settlement of labour-related disputes in respect of prior years, in North America and Latin America.
Specific items in 2016 included a 10m charge due to the revision of estimates relating to legacy acquisitions and labour claims in Latin America, 7m relating to commercial restructuring in Middle East & India, and a net 4m supplementary onerous contract provision primarily in respect of the Compass asylum seekers contract, all offset by an 8m credit relating mainly to the recovery of a legal claim in Europe and of certain disputed debtor balances in the UK.
Restructuring costs The Group invested 20m 2016: 12m in restructuring programmes during the year, mainly in the UK & Ireland and Europe regions as part of the multi-year strategic productivity programme being implemented across the Group, which is now drawing to a close.
In addition, the Group incurred non-strategic severance costs of 10m 2016: 9m which are included within Adjusted PBITA.
Going forwards the Group has announced a three-year plan to 2020 to implement efficient organisational design and leaner processes, which is likely to require further restructuring investment.
Profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries and goodwill impairment As part of the portfolio programme, the Group realised a net profit of 74m 2016: 7m relating to the disposal of a number of its operations including the businesses in Israel and Bulgaria, the US Youth Services business, the UK childrens homes business and the Groups cash businesses in Peru and Paraguay.
In 2016, the Group recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 9m in relation to businesses identified for sale or closure.
Acquisitionrelated amortisation Acquisition-related amortisation of 10m 2016: 32m is lower than the prior year as certain intangible assets recognised on a number of legacy acquisitions became fully amortised in 2016.
Net interest costs Net interest payable on net debt was 92m 2016: 90m.
The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a temporary increase in gross borrowings matched by an increase in cash balances following the issuance of a 500m Public Bond in November 2016 and a 500m Public Bond in June 2017 that were used mainly to re-finance the March and May 2017 debt maturities in addition to drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Net other finance costs of 12m 2016: 6m increased compared with the prior year due to an additional 2m relating to discount unwound on provisions, a 2m charge in relation to overseas tax settlements, and a 2m indebtedness-related foreign exchange gain recognised in 2016.
The pension interest charge, related to the unwinding of discount in relation to long-term pension liabilities, was 11m 2016: 10m, resulting in a total net interest cost of 115m 2016: 106m.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 39 Chief Financial Officers review continued Tax The statutory tax charge of 128m 2016: 76m for 2017 includes a tax charge of 92m 2016: 85m on the adjusted profits of core businesses, as explained on page 46, a tax credit on onerous contracts of 4m 2016: nil, a tax charge of 7m 2016: 2m in respect of portfolio businesses, a net tax charge of 18m 2016: tax credit of 9m in respect of acquisition-related amortisation and other separately disclosed items, and a tax charge of 19m 2016: nil in respect of the tax impact of the US tax reform see page 49.
The Groups statutory tax charge represents an effective rate of 33% 2016: 26% on profit before tax of 386m 2016: 296m.
The effective tax rate is a function of a variety of factors, with the most predominant being the geographic mix of the Groups taxable profits and the respective country tax rates, profits arising on the disposal of certain subsidiaries being taxed at a higher rate, the recognition of, and changes in the value of, deferred tax assets and liabilities, permanent differences such as expenses disallowable for tax purposes, and irrecoverable withholding taxes.
The higher effective tax rate compared with the prior year is primarily driven by a one-off charge relating to the re-measurement and impairment of US deferred tax assets arising as a result of US tax reform as explained on page 49, together with profits arising on the disposal of certain subsidiaries being taxed at a higher tax rate.
The effective tax rate on the Groups statutory profits was also significantly higher than the effective tax rate on the adjusted profits of core businesses explained on page 46, primarily due to two non-core factors.
Firstly, the impact of US tax reform, which is excluded from the tax charge on adjusted profits from core businesses, and secondly, as a result of profits arising on the disposal of certain subsidiaries being taxed at a higher rate.
Noncontrolling interests Profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 16m in 2017, a decrease from 19m for 2016.
The decrease compared with the prior year reflects the non-controlling partners share in the lower level of profitability of certain businesses in the Middle East & India region.
Profit for the year The Group reported profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent statutory earnings of 236m 2016: 198m, an increase of 19.2% compared with the prior year including the benefits of improved Adjusted PBITA, the profit on disposal of subsidiaries and the impact of foreign exchange movements.
On a constant-currency basis, earnings increased by 14.0%.
Earnings per share Statutory earnings per share increased to 15.2p 2016: 12.8p, based on the weighted average of 1,548m 2016: 1,546m shares in issue.
A reconciliation of the Groups statutory profit for the year to EPS is provided below: Earnings per share Statutory Statutory 2016 Adjusted Statutory 2016 at 2017 at actual exchange rates constant exchange rates m m m Profit for the year 252 217 227 Non-controlling interests 16 19 20 Profit attributable to equity holders of the parent earnings 236 198 207 Average number of shares m 1,548 1,546 1,546 Statutory earnings per share 15.2p 12.8p 13.4p Review of the Groups consolidated statement of financial position Significant movements in the consolidated statement of financial position Non-current loan notes were 1,486m 2016: 1,715m, reflecting the re-classification of certain US Private Placement notes repayable in July 2018 and the 500m Public Bond repayable in December 2018 as current liabilities, offset by the addition of the new 500m Public Bond issued in June 2017 and repayable in 2024.
The following movements in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position are set out elsewhere in this report, as follows: cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts are explained on page 41: net debt is analysed on page 50: provisions are analysed in note 33 on page 179: and retirement benefit obligations are explained on page 43.
40 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Total equity Total equity at 31 December 2017 was 854m 2016: 863m.
The main movements during the year were: profit for the year of 252m 2016: 217m, other comprehensive losses of 47m 2016: income of 109m which included a re-measurement gain on deferred retirement benefit schemes of 26m 2016: loss of 169m as explained on page 43, an exchange loss on translation of foreign operations of 125m 2016: gain of 429m and a gain from changes in the fair value of cash flow hedging financial instruments of 56m 2016: loss of 197m and dividends paid in the year of 179m 2016: 162m.
The significant foreign currency gain of 228m net of changes in fair value of cash flow hedging financial instruments recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the prior year was mainly as a result of the weakening of Sterling compared with the US dollar and Euro following the UK referendum result in June 2016.
In 2017, Sterling strengthened compared with the US dollar, partially offset by a further weakening against the Euro, resulting in a net foreign exchange loss of 69m recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year.
Review of the Groups cash flow and financing Consolidated statement of cash flow Net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations was 488m 2016: 615m, a decrease compared with the prior year as the Group reverted to a more customary level of operating cash generation following the particularly strong performance in the prior year, net cash inflow from total operating activities was 402m 2016: 522m, net cash generated by investing activities was 81m 2016: net cash outflow of 18m, including 156m 2016: 82m of net business disposal proceeds and net cash outflow from financing activities was 570m 2016: 307m.
Cash, cash equivalents and overdrafts at 31 December 2017 were 571m 2016: 672m, a net decrease including the impact of exchange rate movements of 101m 2016: net increase of 284m.
The Groups statutory cash flow is presented in full on page 135.
Net debt The Groups net debt as at 31 December 2017 was 1,487m December 2016: 1,670m.
The Groups net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to 2.4x 2016: 2.8x.
A detailed reconciliation of movements in net debt is provided on page 50.
Net debt maturity In May 2017, the Groups credit rating was affirmed by Standard & Poors as BBBnegative.
As of 31 December 2017 the Group had liquidity of 1,571m 2016: 1,692m comprising cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts of 571m 2016: 672m and unutilised but committed facilities of 1bn 2016: 1bn.
The Group issued a 500m Public Bond in June 2017 which matures in June 2024 and pays an annual coupon of 1.5%.
The next debt maturities are 44m and $224m US Private Placement notes due in July 2018 and a 500m Public Bond due in December 2018.
The Group has good access to capital markets and a diverse range of finance providers.
Borrowings are principally in Sterling, US dollars and Euros, reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets and profits.
Translated at exchange rates prevailing at 31 December 2017, or hedged exchange rates where applicable.
c. 964m of the original 1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility matures in January 2022, with the remainder maturing in January 2021.
As at 31 December 2017 there were no drawings from the facility.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 41 Chief Financial Officers review continued The Groups average cost of gross borrowings in 2017, net of interest hedging, was 4.1% 2016: 4.1%.
Financing and treasury activities The Groups treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance and for managing the Groups financial risk arising from currency and interest rate volatility and counterparty credit.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and is not permitted to speculate in financial instruments.
The treasury departments policies are set by the board.
Treasury is subject to the controls appropriate to the risks it manages, which are discussed in note 31 on pages 168 to 172.
To assist the efficient management of the Groups interest costs, the Group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an A-rated bank.
The Group presents pooled cash and overdrafts gross in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Other information Significant exchange rates applicable to the Group The Group derives a significant portion of its revenue and profits in the currencies shown below, with their respective closing and average rates: As at At 2017 As at At 2016 31 December 2017 average rates 31 December 2016 average rates US$ 1.3524 1.2964 1.2345 1.3558 1.1250 1.1453 1.1705 1.2265 South Africa Rand 16.7557 17.3187 16.9500 19.8742 India Rupee 86.3531 84.3570 83.8670 91.0371 Israel Shekel 4.6951 4.6484 4.7483 5.1912 Brazil Real 4.4794 4.1506 4.0165 4.7252 Applying December 2017 closing rates to the Groups statutory results for the year to 31 December 2017 would result in a decrease in revenue of 1.9% to 7,680m for the year ended 31 December 2016: increase of 2.5% to 7,782m and a decrease in Adjusted PBITA of 1.9% to 482m for the year ended 31 December 2016: increase by 2.5% to 473m.
The weakening of average Sterling exchange rates compared with the prior year led to an increase in revenue of 4.5% and an increase in Adjusted PBITA of 4.7% as explained above.
The impact of exchange rate movements reduced the Groups net debt by 21m compared with the prior year.
Dividend In assessing the dividend, the board considers: future investment requirements: the Groups pension obligations: net debt to Adjusted EBITDA: the availability of distributable reserves in the parent company: and reward to shareholders.
Following the achievement of the Groups leverage-reduction target, the directors propose a 5% increase in the final dividend to 6.11p DKK 0.5097 per share 2016: 5.82p per share: DKK 0.5029 reflecting the boards confidence in the Groups performance and prospects.
Our dividend policy is to increase the dividend in line with the long-term growth in earnings.
The interim dividend was 3.59p DKK 0.2948 per share and the total dividend, if approved, will be 9.70p DKK 0.8045 per share, an increase of 3.1% compared with 2016 for the year ended 31 December 2016, the interim dividend was 3.59p: DKK 0.3143 and the total dividend was 9.41p: DKK 0.8172.
The proposed dividend cover is 1.8x 2016: 1.8x on adjusted earnings from core businesses.
42 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Pensions As at 31 December 2017 the net defined benefit pension obligation in the Consolidated statement of financial position was 381m 2016: 437m of which 283m 2016: 341m related to material funded defined benefit schemes.
Net of related deferred tax balances, the Groups net pension obligation was 318m 2016: 368m.
The most significant of the Groups pension schemes is in the UK and accounts for over 88% 2016: 94% of the Groups total material scheme obligations.
The scheme has approximately 30,000 members and further details of the make-up of the scheme are given in note 32 on page 174.
2017 2016 m m Scheme assets 2,345 2,339 Obligations 2,595 2,659 Net UK obligations 250 320 The reduction in the UK scheme net obligations reflected a decrease in the scheme obligations of 64m partially offset by an increase of 6m in the value of scheme assets.
The decrease in the obligations is a result of the discount rate used for valuation purposes increasing to 2.55% 2016: 2.50%, the projected pension inflation rates decreasing to 3.2% 2016: 3.3%, and the payment of scheduled deficit repair contributions of 40m 2016: 39m during the year.
The Group will pay pension deficit repair contributions of 41m in 2018 in line with the agreed contribution schedule.
The next funding valuation is due in 2018, following which future contributions will be subject to review and potential renegotiation.
Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps The Groups investments and borrowings at 31 December 2017 were a mix of fixed rates of interest and floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The March 2007 and July 2008 private placement notes and the May 2009, December 2012, November 2016 and June 2017 public notes were all issued at fixed rates, whilst the Groups investments and bank borrowings were all at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The Groups interest-risk policy requires Treasury to fix a proportion of its interest exposure on a sliding scale in US dollars, Sterling and Euro, using the natural mix of fixed and floating interest rates emanating from the bond and bank markets and by utilising interest-rate and cross-currency swaps.
Part of the proceeds of the private placement and public notes have been swapped to floating interest rates, and accounted for as fair-value hedges, with a net gain in the hedges at 31 December 2017 of 14m 2016: net gain 27m.
The market value of the pay-fixed receive-variable swaps and the pay-fixed receive-fixed cross-currency swaps outstanding at 31 December 2017, accounted for as cash-flow hedges and net-investment hedges, was a net asset of 59m 2016: net asset of 31m.
Foreign currency The Group has many overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, denominated in various different currencies.
Treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt Adjusted EBITDA ratio by holding foreigncurrency denominated loans, cross-currency swaps and to a lesser extent forward-currency contracts.
At 31 December 2017, the Groups US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 91% and 90% respectively, hedged by foreign currency debt.
As at 31 December 2017, net debt held in US dollars and Euros, and in those currencies officially pegged to these two currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.3x Adjusted EBITDA generated from these currencies 2016: 2.2x Adjusted EBITDA.

Operating cash flow for 2016 is shown at actual 2016 exchange rates.
Revenue At 2.7bn, emerging markets' revenues increased 1.5% on the prior year, with growth in all regions except for Middle East & India, and represented 37% of Group revenue 2016: 37%.
Developed markets revenues were 4.3% higher than the prior year with 6.0% growth in North America, 3.9% in Europe and 2.1% in UK & Ireland.
Revenue from Cash Solutions was up 2.3% on 2016 and from Secure Solutions was up 3.4% on 2016.
Adjusted PBITA Adjusted PBITA of core businesses of 496m 2016: 476m was up 4.2%.
This growth reflects the strong performance of the Group in developed markets, improved product mix and the results of our on-going productivity programmes, partially offset by the weaker trading in the Middle East & India.
Overall, the Adjusted PBITA margin increased to 6.7% 2016: 6.6% with improvements delivered in six out of the seven regions.
Interest Net interest payable on net debt from core businesses was 90m 2016: 85m.
The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a temporary increase in gross borrowings matched by an increase in cash balances following the issuance of a 500m Public Bond in November 2016 and a 500m Public Bond in June 2017 that were used mainly to re-finance the March and May 2017 debt maturities in addition to drawings on the Revolving Credit Facility.
Net other finance costs of 12m 2016: 6m increased compared with the prior year due to an additional 2m relating to discount unwound on provisions, a 2m charge in respect of overseas tax settlements, and a 2m indebtedness-related foreign exchange gain recognised in 2016.
The pension interest charge, related to the unwinding of the discount in relation to long-term pension liabilities, was 11m 2016: 10m, resulting in a total net interest cost of 113m 2016: 101m.
Tax A tax charge of 92m 2016: 90m was incurred on the adjusted profits of core businesses of 383m 2016: 375m which represents an effective tax rate of 24% 2016: 24%.
The effective tax rate is a function of a variety of factors, with the most predominant being the geographic mix of the Groups taxable profits and the respective country tax rates, the recognition of, and changes in the value of, deferred tax assets and liabilities, permanent differences such as expenses disallowable for tax purposes, and irrecoverable withholding taxes.
At any point in time, the Group is typically subject to tax audits in a number of different countries.
In situations where a difference of opinion arises between the Group and a local tax authority in respect of its tax filings, the Group will debate the contentious areas and, where necessary, resolve them through negotiation or litigation.
The Group relies upon advice and opinions from the Group tax department, local finance teams and external advisors, to ensure that the appropriate judgments are arrived at in establishing appropriate accounting provisions in relation to such disputes.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2017 G4S plc 45 Chief Financial Officers review continued Noncontrolling interests Profit from core businesses attributable to non-controlling interests was 14m in 2017, a decrease from 23m for 2016, reflecting the non-controlling partners share of the lower level of profitability of certain businesses in the Middle East & India region.
Adjusted profit for the year adjusted earnings core businesses The Group generated adjusted profit from core businesses attributable to equity holders adjusted earnings of 277m 2016: 262m, an increase of 5.7% for the year ended 31 December 2017.

The Group recognised additional provisions of 19m 2016: 4m, classified as specific items, primarily related to the anticipated total losses over the next 15 to 20 years in respect of certain UK contracts.
It is expected that around 60% of the Groups total provision for onerous customer contracts of 62m will be utilised by the end of 2020.
Portfolio operations The Group made further progress with its portfolio management programme in the year.
This programme has greatly improved the Groups strategic focus and has also generated approximately 510m in disposal proceeds in relation to the 38 businesses sold up to 31 December 2017.
Disposals in the year include the Groups businesses in Israel and Bulgaria, its cash businesses in Peru and Paraguay, the US Youth Services business and the UK childrens homes business, generating total gross proceeds of 166m.
Since the year end, and up to the date of this report, a further three businesses have been sold, generating additional gross proceeds of 9m.
The portfolio programme is considered to be substantially complete at 31 December 2017.
Since 30 June 2017 there have been no changes to the portfolio businesses other than the completion of some minor disposals.
Going forwards no further transfers into or out of the portfolio businesses will occur.

Specific items in 2016 included an 11m charge due to the revision of estimates relating to legacy acquisitions and labour claims in Latin America, 7m relating to commercial restructuring in Middle East & India, and a net 4m supplementary onerous contract provision primarily in respect of the Compass asylum seekers contract, all offset by an 8m credit relating mainly to the recovery of a legal claim in Europe and of certain disputed debtor balances in the UK.
Profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries businesses and goodwill impairment As part of the portfolio programme, the Group realised a net profit of 74m 2016: 5m relating to the disposal of a number of the Groups operations including the Groups businesses in Israel and Bulgaria, the US Youth Services business, the UK childrens homes business and the Groups cash businesses in Peru and Paraguay.
The Group recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the prior year of 9m in relation to businesses to be sold or closed.
Acquisitionrelated amortisation Acquisition-related amortisation of 10m 2016: 34m is lower than the prior year as certain intangible assets recognised on a number of legacy acquisitions became fully amortised in 2016.
Tax charges arising on acquisitionrelated amortisation, specific and other separately disclosed items Tax charges arising on acquisition-related amortisation, specific and other separately disclosed items of 18m 2016: tax credit of 9m relate primarily to the disposal of subsidiaries in the United States, Peru and Paraguay.
Tax impact of US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act US tax reform On 22 December 2017, the US tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by the US President and introduced significant changes in US tax laws with effect from 1 January 2018.
As this legislation is considered to be substantively enacted as at 31 December 2017, any tax effects of the legislation arising in 2017 have been taken into account.
For 2017, the changes in legislation resulted in a separately disclosed one-off charge to the income statement of 19m arising from the re-measurement and impairment of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the US Federal tax rate, and from the impairment of foreign tax credits which are no longer expected to be recovered in future periods against foreign source income.
On the basis of information currently available and from analysis completed since the legislation was enacted, the above are likely to be the most significant impacts for the Group.
However, as more detailed analysis and future legislative guidance become available, it is possible that the Group may be further impacted in the current and subsequent years by the legislative changes.
