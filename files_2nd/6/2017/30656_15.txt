Underlying sales growth was 3.1% 2016: 3.7%, with a positive contribution from all categories.
Underlying volume growth was 0.8% 2016: 0.9% and underlying price growth was 2.3% 2016: 2.8%.
Acquisitions and disposals had a favourable contribution of 0.9% 2016: 0.6% reflecting recent acquisitions including Blueair, Living Proof and Carver Korea.
Emerging markets contributed 58% of total turnover 2016: 57% with underlying sales growth of 5.9% 2016: 6.5% coming from price growth of 4.2% and volume growth of 1.6%.
Developed markets underlying sales declined by 0.6% evenly balanced between price and volume.
Underlying operating margin improved by 1.1 percentage points to 17.5%.
Gross margin improved by 0.4 percentage points driven by positive mix and the roll-out of the 5-S savings programme that more than offset increases in commodity costs.
The absolute level of brand and marketing investment was flat in local currencies versus the prior year, as savings from advertising production were re-invested in increased media spend.
As a percentage of turnover, brand and marketing investment was down by 0.6 percentage points.
Overheads reduced by 0.1 percentage points, driven by a further reduction in the cost base partially offset by investment in capabilities including new business models and e-commerce.
Operating profit was up 13.5% to 8.9 billion 2016: 7.8 billion including 543 million of non-underlying items.
Non-underlying items within operating profit are 638 million restructuring costs, acquisition and disposal-related costs of 159 million and one-off costs of 80 million partly offset by gain on disposal of group companies of 334 million.
Highlights for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016 % change Turnover million 53,715 52,713 2 Operating profit million 8,857 7,801 14 Underlying operating profit million 9,400 8,624 9 Profit before tax million 8,153 7,469 9 Net profit million 6,486 5,547 17 Diluted earnings per share 2.15 1.82 18 Underlying earnings per share 2.24 2.03 11 Net finance costs increased by 314 million to 877 million 2016: 563 million as they included a one-off finance charge of 382 million relating to the book premium paid on the buyback of preference shares in Unilever N. V. The net cost of financing borrowings was 399 million, 70 million lower than prior year.
The decrease was due to a lower average interest rate of 2.7% compared to 3.5% in 2016, and to lower other interest costs from one-off credits in Brazil.
Pension financing was a charge of 96 million compared to 94 million in the prior year.
The effective tax rate was 20.8% versus 26.2% in the prior year.
The change was mainly due to the impact of US tax reform that led to a one-off tax benefit coming from restating deferred tax balances at the new lower federal tax rate, partially offset by the tax impact of the AdeS business disposal.
Net profit from joint ventures and associates was up 22% at 155 million, an increase coming from growth in profits from the Pepsi Lipton joint venture and profit from disposal of an investment in a joint venture in India.
Other income from non-current investments was 18 million compared to 104 million in the prior year which included a gain of 107 million from the sale of financial assets.
Diluted earnings per share increased by 18.4% to 2.15 reflecting improved operating margins, 578 million US tax reform and a 309 million gain on disposal of the AdeS business.
Underlying earnings per share increased by 10.7% to 2.24.

It does not represent residual cash flows entirely available non-underlying items before tax and share of net profit loss of joint for discretionary purposes: for example, the repayment of principal ventures and associates.
