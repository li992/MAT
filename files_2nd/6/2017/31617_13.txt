Sustainable customer growth 2017 has been a year of strong business growth against of a highly competitive backdrop and uncertain economic conditions.
In targeting sustainable growth in our customer balances we enhanced our product offerings to attract the right mix of customer profile to deliver longer-term value.
In doing so we have delivered growth while maintaining asset quality, adhering to our underwriting standards and controlled risk appetite leading to a well-balanced and diverse portfolio.
The asset quality of the Groups credit exposures remains stable relative to the growth in portfolio size, evidenced by the reduction in the level of impaired assets to 179m 2016: 233m and a modest increase in 90 days past due DPD to 161m 2016: 150m.
In aggregate, impaired assets and 90 DPD represent 1.06% of gross loans 2016: 1.27%.
We have managed our deposits base throughout the year growing balances, improving the mix and reducing funding costs.

Mortgages The mortgage book remains the Groups largest asset portfolio and has a significant impact on our overall financial performance.
This year we delivered record levels of new mortgage business, which supported net 3 growth of 7.5% in the year, higher than system growth of 2.9%, and saw our market share increase from 1.67% to 1.73%.
In line with our competitors, we continued to see a growing number of customers favour fixed rate mortgage products, as they sought to further capitalise on the prevailing low interest rate environment.
As a result, the fixed rate book grew to 73% of mortgage balances 2016: 68% and accounted for 95% of mortgages drawn in the year 2016: 93%.
The split of our mortgage book between BTL and owner occupied properties remained broadly stable, although owner occupied accounted for 70% of drawdowns in the year 2016: 59% as we focused on our strategy to support the residential market and manage within our risk appetite limits.
The average LTV of new lending was 71% and, as a consequence, the average LTV of the mortgage book increased from 55.8% to 57.5%.
Our proportion of residential mortgages 90 days in arrears has remained stable at 0.52% September 2016: 0.51%.

The main drivers for the increase were improved origination flows, coupled with lower attrition in the second half of the year as we implemented a number of new propositions and developed new capabilities to better support the funding needs of our SME customers.
These included a new proposition for the financial services sector, and the establishment of an agency capability.
Growth finance and cash flow finance also performed well.
We maintained a robust approach to credit decisions on new lending in the year, reflective of the continued reduction in the impaired asset portfolio to 126m 2016: 146m.
Notwithstanding an increase in specific provisions on a small number of exposures, the underlying credit quality of the portfolio has remained stable.
In line with our strategy we continued to run off our non-core portfolio, which reduced from 720m to 504m.
Unsecured personal lending Following a brief period of contraction in our unsecured personal lending book, which comprises credit cards, personal loans and overdrafts, the second half of the year saw modest growth of 9m year on year.
Within this, the fixed rate personal loan book was the largest contributor, showing growth of 33m 5% from 625m at 30 September 2016 to 658m at 30 September 2017.
This growth was driven in the main by the launch of an improved personal loan proposition with competitive pricing in the third quarter, supported by enhanced scorecards and a simplified online application process.
The uptake in this new offering contributed to higher loan origination in the second half of the year.
Credit card balances were broadly flat at 396m 2016: 400m.
The smallest element of our unsecured lending portfolio is comprised of variable rate personal loans and overdrafts, which fell by 20m in the year from 131m to 111m.
Variable rate loans continue to reduce as although these products remain on sale, they are not actively promoted or targeted.
Current accounts Funding provided by current accounts increased by 0.7bn 5.3% since September 2016, due principally to continued growth in business current account balances up 387m driven by the 25-month fee free offer we launched in December 2016, and system growth.
Personal current account balances also continued to grow, with the B current account up 200m attracting both existing and new to bank customers throughout the year as we delivered further enhancements in product functionality.
Our Current Account Plus product also contributed growth of 140m with the average case size offsetting a declining stock balance.
While stock levels across the book fell overall, new account openings were in line with our strategy to grow sustainably in a way that recruits the right profile of customer with whom we have an opportunity to build a long-term relationship.

This partially offset attrition of 1.2bn following the product rationalisation and repricing of our ISA portfolio.
In addition we saw attrition of 0.2bn across other savings products as, in line with market trends, we saw a shift in consumer behaviour towards easier access accounts such as instant access and current accounts.
Fixed rate term deposits Our fixed rate term deposit book increased by 483m 8.8% as a result of actions taken in the second half of the year, including the repricing of maturing term deposits and competitive retail product launches in the digital bond space and fixed rate cash ISAs, along with the launch of new notice accounts for SME depositors.
Funding and liquidity The Group continues to maintain its strong funding and liquidity position and seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between profitability, liquidity risk and capital optimisation.
Our focus on delivering customer growth, together with a managed reduction in volumes of variable rate savings accounts, and drawdown of 1.9bn of lower cost funding from the Bank of Englands Term Funding Scheme, has resulted in an increase in LDR from 112% to 115%, well within our guidance for the year of 120%.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR was higher at 164% at 30 September 2017 2016: 140% due to the pre-funding of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS callable in November 2017.
Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR was 118% at 30 September 2017 2016: 124%.
The Group has evolved its approach to managing the liquid asset buffer LAB to more efficiently utilise cash to reduce the cost of the LAB while still holding high quality, low risk liquid assets, by broadening the composition of the portfolio.
The Group has diversified by investing in a broader range of supranational and covered bond issuances.
Previously, liquidity was mainly held in BoE accounts, earning base rate, alongside holdings of UK Sovereign bonds Gilts.
The issue of 300m of senior debt in June provided further funding to the Group and marked an important first step in our journey towards meeting the BoEs Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities MREL by 2022.

The growth in our customer lending in the year has tempered the impacts of base rate cuts and, together with lower funding costs driven by active management of rates across the savings portfolio, has contributed to an increase in net interest income of 38m 4.7%.
As average interest-bearing assets saw a similar increase, Group NIM similarly increased by 1bps to 2.27% 2016: 2.26%.
This was achieved in spite of rate pressures across the board, as a consequence of the base rate reduction in August 2016 and a corresponding fall in LIBOR rates, which together impacted 45% of the Groups customer lending portfolio which is on a variable rate.
The effects of these rate reductions combined with competition in the market continued to exert downward pricing pressure on the Groups lending portfolio, with average yields reducing by 19bps to 2.85%.
Conversely, average rates on interest-bearing liabilities reduced by 25bps to 0.75% as a result of the rate cuts, a shift in mix in the deposits portfolio and lower wholesale funding costs.
Non-interest income Non-interest income reduced by 11m 6.0%, largely driven by a reduction in fees and commission income, principally in relation to insurance revenues from off-sale products which have continued to unwind, lower account fees on the Signature current account and lower home insurance profit share due to a higher level of claims, 44 44 C CY YB BG P G PL LC A C An nn nu ua al R l Re ep po or rt a t an nd A d Ac cco cou un nt ts 2 s 20 01 17 7 St Str ra at te eg giic c r rep epor ort t F Fiin nanc anciial al re res sul ult ts s G Go ov ver ern na an nc ce e R Riis sk k r rep epor ort t Fi Fin na an nc ciia all s st ta at tem emen ent ts s A Ad dd diit tiion ona all i in nf for orma mat tiion on Impairment losses on credit exposures The increase in impairment charge, from 39m to 48m, reflects a modest increase in charges taken on our unsecured Retail portfolios together with impairment of a small number of individual SME exposures.

We continued to improve our operational efficiency during the year through the restructuring and streamlining of our business.
As our strategic initiatives gathered pace, the costs required to deliver the programme amounted to 67m in the year.
These largely comprised property closure, redundancy and consultancy costs and arose in the main as we implemented our branch closure and voluntary severance programmes.
We started to reap the benefits of these actions as the year progressed, and saw our full year underlying costs reduce by 54m 7% from 729m to 675m, exceeding our FY2017 cost guidance of 690m700m.
As a result, and combined with the increase in net interest income, our underlying cost to income ratio improved from 74% to 67% for the full year 61% for the second half.
During the year we implemented a new reward programme for colleagues across the business, including a revised pensions proposition.
As part of these reforms, the Group closed the defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual on 1 August 2017, for the majority of current employees, with affected employees future benefits being provided through an enhanced defined contribution scheme.
The closure of the Scheme resulted in the recognition of a past service credit of 88m.
On an underlying basis, personnel expenses reduced by 32m in line with headcount, which reduced from 1 6,718 to 6,040.
Other operating and administrative expenses fell by 21m due to the impact of branch closures and tighter cost control across the board.

During the year we invested heavily in significantly transforming the personal customer experience, through increasing online account opening capability, enhancing service functionality and releasing new applications across all brands.
In addition, we continued to invest to ensure we remain compliant with our regulatory obligations, and in enhanced security, to maintain and strengthen the resilience of our operations.
During the year the Group continued to make progress on removing its reliance on National Australia Bank NAB for certain processes and systems.
Spend in the year in relation to separation costs was 8m 2016: 11m and the Group is on track to exit all NAB services provided under Transitional Services Agreements by December 2018.

Underlying capital generation by the core business post AT1 distribution was 13bps, largely driven by strong underlying profits offset by growth in mortgages and SME lending and investment spend, with RWAs increasing by 649m.
After absorbing the net impact of AT1 distributions, pension movements, and exceptional charges such as restructuring charges, separation costs and the Groups proportion of conduct provision charges, the Group's CET1 ratio was 20bps lower at 12.4%.
During the year the Group reassessed the level of provision that was considered appropriate to meet current and future expectations in relation to the mis-selling of PPI policies and concluded that a further charge of 494m was required, incorporating the Groups estimate of the impact of the Regulators policy statement issued on 2 March 2017 relating to a proposed time bar for complaints in August 2019.
It also incorporated a reassessment of the costs of processing cases and the impact of experience adjustments.
The Group also raised further provisions of 98m for other non-PPI conduct related matters.
In aggregate, only 9.7% of the charge, or 58m, impacts the income statement as a result of the Capped Indemnity, and has absorbed 27bps of capital in the year.
Strengthening our capital base The Group continually considers opportunities to further strengthen its capital base.
The closure of the Scheme to future accrual for the majority of employees, coupled with the impact of the Schemes triennial valuation, resulted in a reduction in the Scheme deficit on a trustee funding basis from 450m to 290m.
In addition, the submission of our waiver application to the PRA requesting permission to apply IRB modelling in the calculation of credit risk RWAs marked a key milestone in our path to IRB accreditation.

The BoE will advise the Group on its ultimate MREL requirement in 2020.
