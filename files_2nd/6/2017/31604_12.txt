The decrease in ROCE was due tothedecrease in headline profit for the year and a 11.1% increase in the average adjusted capital employed including lease adjustments, primarily due to the acquisition of 23 aircraft during the year.
The ROCE calculation excludes borrowings, cash andmoney market deposits and includes an adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements.
The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven.

The decrease is a consequence of the persisting low fuel price environment, resulting in high levels of capacity growth and a competitive pricing environment which saw yields fall by 7.3% at constant currency.
Partially offsetting these impacts was growth in ancillary revenue which grew by 8.6% to 11.38 per seat, as initiatives and high load factors offset ticket pricing pressures.
Average load factor for the year increased by one percentage point to 92.6%.
Revenue per ASK decreased by 1.0%, or by 5.1% at constant currency, impacted by a 0.4% decrease in revenue per seat, and a 0.6% increase in the average sector length.
easyJet currently categorises total revenue earned on the face of the income statement between seat and non-seat revenue.
From 1 October 2017, total revenue will be categorised between passenger and ancillary revenue.
This change provides greater transparency of the ancillary element of revenue and brings easyJet in line with other airlines.
Under the new presentation, total revenue would have been categorised as follows: 2017 2016 pence per pence per million per seat ASK million per seat ASK Passenger revenue 4,061 46.85 4.24 3,832 47.98 4.37 Ancillary revenue 986 11.38 1.03 837 10.48 0.95 Total revenue 5,047 58.23 5.27 4,669 58.46 5.32 HEADLINE COSTS EXCLUDING FUEL Headline cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 7.7% to 41.27 and increased by 0.9% at constant currency.
Savings obtained from airport lean initiatives have offset regulatory airport uplifts.
Headline crew cost per seat increased by 9.7% to 7.44, and by 4.2% at constant currency.
This reflects pay increases, increased disruption and additional investment into operational resilience over the summer peak period, given the level of airport and airspace congestion.
However, these were largely offset by efficiencies obtained from the up-gauging of our fleet and savings from lean initiatives.
Headline navigation cost per seat increased by 4.4% to 4.40 but decreased by 4.0% at constant currency driven by the annualisation of reduced charges, primarily in France and Germany.
Headline maintenance cost per seat increased by 0.7% to 3.09, but decreased by 7.2% at constant currency.
This was driven by engineering and maintenance savings, such as the component supply contract, and the up-gauging of fleet as easyJet continues to move from A319s to A320s.
28 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Headline other operating costs per seat increased by 16.1% to 4.28 per seat, and by 12.2% at constant currency.
This was mainly driven by an increase in disruption costs due to a greater level of EU 261 compensation claims and an increase in welfare costs driven by significant industrial strike action and adverse weather conditions.
This was combined with an increase in wet lease charges due to three aircraft being wet leased over the summer to aid operational resilience.
Headline aircraft dry leasing cost per seat increased by 11.2% to 1.27 but decreased by 0.8% at constant currency.
The favourable variance was driven by the return of four leased aircraft last year and one aircraft this year.
These more than offset the increase from the rent associated with the 10 aircraft sale and leasebacks that occurred earlier in the year.
The average number of leased aircraft increased by 9.6% to 70.
Depreciation costs have increased by 5.8% on a per seat basis driven by the acquisition of 20 new aircraft last year and 23 aircraft this year, which more than offset the decrease from the 10 aircraft sale and leasebacks and the impact of increased capacity.
The average number of owned aircraft increased by 6.9% to 197.
An increase in headline net interest costs of 0.11 per seat is attributable to the financing costs of the two bonds, as we invest in the long-term growth of the airline.

During the period the average market jet fuel price increased by 20.7% to $501 per tonne from $415 per tonne in the previous year.
