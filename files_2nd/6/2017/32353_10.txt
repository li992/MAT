Finance review Laying the foundation complex and technical accounting analysis.
The fieldwork concluded in May 2017 and its findings have since been approved by the Audit Committee.
The Accounting Review identified a number of prior year errors that, due to their materiality, required the restatement of results for periods before 31 March 2017.
The nature of these errors is outlined in Note 1 and led to an error of 60.5m, of which 26.0m is a restatement of goodwill impairment in FY16, 20.9m relates to other adjustments in FY16 and 13.6m relates to earlier years.
As a consequence, the net impact of prior year adjustments in FY16 is 20.9m before other items.
Throughout this report, the FY16 comparatives are described as Restated which means they are stated after adjustment for these errors.
It has been a challenging year for Mitie, with a reported operating loss and reduced adjusted trading In response to the Accounting Review, the Group has performance.
We faced a balance sheet that was included additional material balance sheet write-downs of less prudent than ideal, and have seen instances of 44.9m and has created new provisions and accruals of accounting error requiring adjustments to prior year 14.8m resulting in a pre-tax adjustment to net assets of accounts.
As a result, the Group has taken decisive 59.7m.
These are additional to the 14.0m of one-off action to correct the accounting errors and bring its charges identified in the January 2017 trading update.

Our A key finding of the Accounting Review was that the Groups approach has been designed to restore confidence accounting was less conservative than its peers.
In response, in the Groups financial reporting.
This lays the 39.7m of additional asset write-downs were recognised foundation of a more stable financial position, which were more judgemental in nature, and would result in paving the way for the Group to implement its no future cash outflow.
Management considers that the Accounting Review and resulting write-down of the balance sheet at 31 March 2017 Reported financial performance reflects a fair and balanced assessment process.
An analysis of the year-on-year movement in reported revenue and operating profit before other items from Alternative Performance Measures continuing operations is as follows: The results of the Accounting Review, which led to both prior year adjustments as well as asset write-downs of a 2017 2016 restated non-recurring nature, make it difficult to assess underlying m m operating performance, which is a key focus for both Revenue 2,126.3 2,146.9 investors and others seeking to assess the Groups Operating loss profit performance.

Review, offset by favourable currency movements.
As a consequence of the Accounting Review, prior year errors, goodwill impairments and costs of change, the operating loss was 42.9 m 2016: profit 107.6m.
Altogether this constitutes a disappointing year for the Group.

Retirement benefit schemes The net deficit on our defined benefit pension schemes was 74.2m 2016: 35.5m.
The increase has been principally driven by a 95 basis point reduction in the discount rate used by the Group to determine its pension obligations, arising from a reduction in corporate bond yields.
The accounting deficit on Mities principal defined benefit scheme at 31 March 2017 was 70.7m 2016: 34.4m.
Whilst this deficit has fallen since the half year by 10.5m, Mitie intends to develop a deficit reduction plan in the autumn of 2017, once the actuarial triennial valuation at 31 March 2017 is completed.
