FINANCIAL REVIEW OVERVIEW OF RESULTS 1 Continuing operations ADJUSTED STATUTORY 2017 2016 CHANGE 2017 2016 CHANGE Revenue 740.3m 744.7m 0.6 % 740.3m 744.7m 0.6 % Profit before tax 53.3m 48.8m 9.1% 40.9m 35.1m 16.5% Basic EPS 53.3p 49.7p 7.2% 38.0p 32.8p 15.9% Dividend per share 48.0p 46.0p 4.3% 48.0p 46.0p 4.3% 1 As a result of the relative size and historical volatility of share incentive scheme charges 1.2m, these are excluded from adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic EPS.
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, the amortisation of the intangible asset 11.2m arising on entering into the energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013 has also been excluded from adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic EPS.
For ease of comparability, following the sale of the Groups 20% shareholding in Opus Energy Group Limited Opus in February 2017 resulting in Opus becoming a discontinued operation, the contribution from Opus across all years and the profit from its sale in 2017 have been excluded in the above table.
SUMMARY The small decrease in revenue during the year has been driven mainly by lower average energy prices as a result of retail gas price reductions in the Spring of 2016, and reduced average energy usage due to the continuing impact of energy efficiency measures across the industry combined with a steadily increasing number of LED light bulbs installed in our Members homes following the progressive successful implementation of Project Daffodil the provision of free LED light bulbs to multi-service Members.
These negative factors were partly offset by an increase in telephony revenues, resulting from an increasing penetration of fibre broadband and some higher fixed monthly charges, and the overall increase in the number of services provided to Members.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits continuing operations of 9.1% mainly reflects the continuing modest organic growth over the last two years in the number of services we are providing to our Members, an increased proportion of revenues from higher margin telephony services relative to energy services, and a one-off recovery of 4.2m of costs incurred in prior years relating to the smart meter roll-out programme under our energy supply agreement of which 70% was credited to cost of sales with the remaining 30% credited to administrative expenses.
These are counterbalanced by recurring higher customer acquisition costs, increased investment in staff headcount and higher IT related charges.
We also generated an exceptional profit of 62.3m during the year from the sale of our 20% shareholding in Opus see below, taking our total statutory post-tax profit to 95.0m 2016: 31.8m.
Within our Customer Acquisition operating segment, losses increased to 18.3m 2016: 14.6m primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of costs from Project Daffodil and an increase in the proportion of new Members switching all their services to us.
Distribution expenses reduced slightly to 21.1m 2016: 21.4m, mainly reflecting lower energy commissions following the reduction in energy revenues previously highlighted, partly offset by increased commissions paid to Partners on the larger number of services being taken by our growing membership base.
20 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Administrative expenses increased during the year by 2.8m to 55.2m 2016: 52.4m mainly as a result of continued investment in growing staff headcount to sustain our current high standards of customer service as the business grows, and higher IT related charges.
Adjusted earnings per share continuing operations increased by 7.2% to 53.3p 2016: 49.7p, statutory EPS continuing operations 38.0p 2016: 32.8p.
In accordance with previous guidance and our strong cash position, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 25p 2016: 24p per share, making a total dividend of 48p 2016: 46p per share for the year.
MARGINS Our overall gross margin for the year was 17.6% 2016: 16.6% reflecting the shifting mix from energy towards higher margin telephony services, and the recovery of previously incurred smart meter rollout costs mentioned above.
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT We have continued to achieve steady growth in the number of services we are supplying, with an increase of over 107,000 services during the course of the year.
This takes the total number of services provided within our Discount Club to almost 2.3 million an increase of 4.9% compared with the previous year.
We continue to focus on making it easier for Partners to gather new Members by simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our prices more competitive, and improving the quality of service and support we provide to our membership base.
As a result, all our core services have continued to see organic growth in a challenging competitive environment.
Revenues decreased slightly overall due to reduced gas pricing and lower average consumption across both types of energy service, with growing revenues in all other service areas following increases in the number of services being provided: m 2017 2016 Electricity 310.4 313.7 Gas 265.8 273.9 Landline and Broadband 106.7 102.1 Mobile 27.5 24.4 Other 12.4 13.8 TOTAL 722.8 727.9 CUSTOMER ACQUISITION Our Customer Acquisition operating segment loss increased during the year to 18.3m 2016: 14.6m, mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of costs relating to Project Daffodil, our free LED replacement light bulb offer to multi-service Members, where the mass-rollout started in January 2016.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 21 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution expenses include the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Partners, together with other direct costs associated with gathering new Members which are included as part of the Customer Acquisition Segment result for the year.
These reduced slightly to 21.1m 2016: 21.4m, mainly reflecting lower energy commissions following the industry wide gas price reductions at the start of the financial year, partly offset by increased commissions paid to Partners from the increase in new Members and services.
Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year fell slightly to 1.1% of revenues 2016: 1.2%, falling in absolute terms to 7.8m 2016: 8.4m.
The number of prepayment meters we installed during the year, many of which were provided at the Members own request, fell to 5,357 2016: 6,775, partly due to delays in fitting prepayment meters following service level issues with one of our meter operators MOPs in the second half of the year: a new MOP has recently been appointed to take on this work.
At the end of the year we had an installed base of 69,828 2016: 71,026 prepayment meters, representing approximately 7.0% of the energy services we supply: this remains significantly below the average level of prepayment meters within the industry of around 16% source: CMA.
DELINQUENT MEMBERS Delinquency the proportion of Members who have at least two energy bills outstanding has been on a steady downward trajectory over the last few years, although in the last year it has increased slightly to 1.15% 2016: 1.09%.
This increase is primarily due to a delay in fitting prepayment meters during the second half of the year, which resulted from operational challenges with one of our MOPs: this issue should be resolved over the coming months following the recent appointment of a new MOP.

This reflects our commitment to continue delivering the best possible experience to our Members increasing numbers of which are taking multiple services from us, the additional services we are now supporting such as Insurance, Daffodil and the smart meter roll-out and a significant ongoing investment in strengthening both our IT resources and our management team.
Personnel expenses excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive schemes increased by 14.5% during the year to 35.3m 2016: 30.8m.
Overall, administrative expenses increased during the year by 2.8m to 55.2m 2016: 52.4m mainly as a result of higher staff costs and increased investment in IT, partly offset by the recovery of previously incurred smart meter rollout costs mentioned above.
OPUS Our 20% stake in Opus Energy Group Limited Opus was sold in February 2017, resulting in Opus becoming a discontinued operation.
The sale resulted in the receipt of 71.1m of cash and an exceptional profit from the sale of 62.3m.
As explained in the Chairmans Statement above, we intend to undertake a tender offer this summer, through which we will be seeking to return up to 25m of these proceeds to shareholders: full details will be sent to shareholders alongside the forthcoming AGM documents.
CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL During the year we received an exceptional cash inflow of 71.1m following the sale of our shareholding in Opus, paid the 21.5m deferred consideration to Npower, and fully repaid our revolving borrowing facilities pending the announced tender offer.
We ended the period with no debt and a cash balance of 18.7m 2016: cash before borrowings of 35.3m.
As expected, our net working capital position showed a year on year cash outflow of 9.2m primarily due to timing differences related to our energy purchasing arrangements with Npower.
Under the terms of our energy supply arrangements, Npower remains responsible for funding the working capital requirements associated with providing energy to Members who have chosen to pay on a Budget Plan.
BORROWINGS Our balance sheet at the year-end shows a net cash position of 18.7m with zero debt drawn down from our revolving borrowing facilities 2016: net debt of 56.3m, following receipt of the 71.1m proceeds from the sale of our shareholding in Opus.
Following the return of cash to shareholders under the impending share tender offer, the Groups Net Debt EBITDA ratio would still remain below 1.0x.
DIVIDEND The final dividend of 25p per share 2016: 24p will be paid on 28 July 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 7 July 2017 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting which will be held on 20 July 2017.
This makes a total dividend payable for the year of 48p 2016: 46p, an increase of 4.3% compared with the previous year.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 23 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED We believe our strong underlying cash flow, rising adjusted earnings and strong credit profile will enable us to refinance any remaining borrowings as they fall due, whilst maintaining a progressive dividend policy.
In the light of the steadily improving quality of our membership base and the good visibility it provides over future revenues and margins, we expect to increase our dividend to 50p per share for the current year.
Our intention going forward is to bring our dividend pay-out ratio back to around 85% of adjusted EPS over the medium term, whilst maintaining our current progressive dividend policy.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of 1.2m 2016: 2.5m.
These relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2.
As a result of the relative size of share incentive scheme charges as a proportion of our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits and earnings so that the underlying performance of the business can be clearly identified.
Our current adjusted earnings per share have also therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
The tax charge for the year is 10.4m 2016: 8.9m.
The effective tax rate for the year was 9.9% 2016: 21.9%, due to the sale of our 20% shareholding in Opus on which no tax will be paid as it is eligible for the substantial shareholding exemption.
Excluding the sale of Opus and the share of profit from Opus in both years, the effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 would be 25.5% and 25.4% respectively.
