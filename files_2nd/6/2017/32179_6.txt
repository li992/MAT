CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED our new Home Insurance service, which we anticipate will be accompanied by a range of other insurance products in due course: in the medium term we look forward to supplying water: and in the longer term, other potential new services might include television and home emergency cover including boiler cover, and combining the national rollout of smart meters with other connected home products and services to leverage our position as the only fully integrated multi-utility supplier in the country.

Our focus will therefore remain on the domestic market, until market conditions become more favourable.
Within the residential Club, there is a significant difference in average expected customer lifetimes between Members and therefore in the revenues and profits they will generate, depending on whether they are an owner-occupier, and on the number of services we are providing to them.
The most attractive category are owner-occupiers taking our Double Gold bundle.
