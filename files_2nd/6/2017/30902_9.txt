The underlying net finance income of 3m comprises the 3m non-cash income on the Retirement Benefit Asset.
An analysis of the net finance expense is shown in the table below.
Net Finance expense 2016 Reported m 2017 TP plc only Receivable on cash balances 3 2 Payable on Sterling Notes June 2019 4 4 Payable on Sterling Notes January 2024 24 Payable on Sterling Notes June 2016 5 Interest payable on bank facilities 1 2 Commitment fee payable on bank facilities 3 2 Amortisation of debt issue and arrangement fees 3 1 Other interest 1 1 33 13 Net finance income 3 3 30 10 Tax The effective rate of tax on underlying profit before tax is 26% 2016: 23% pro forma and 18% as reported.
The rate is higher than the underlying 18% reported in 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of the ICAP business in the current year results, which has driven an increase inthe mix of taxable profits in the period in tax jurisdictions with higher statutory rates of tax, principally the US.
The rate is higher than the 2016 pro forma rate of 23% reflecting a change in the mix of taxable profits and an increase in non-deductible expenditure.
The effective rate of tax on statutory profit before tax is a 4% credit to income rather than a tax charge.
This reflects the increase in the tax credit included in acquisition, disposal and integration costs due to a 24m decrease in deferred tax liabilities that arises from the reduction in the US federal rate of tax see Notes 10 and 20.
The effective tax rate on underlying profit before tax is expected to remain in line with the 2017 rate of 26% despite the recent change in theheadline rate of corporation tax in the US from 35% to 21%.
This is due to other aspects of the tax legislation, which have the effect of broadening the US tax base.
Basic EPS The average number of shares used for the basic EPS calculation of 551.8m reflects the 554.1m shares in issue less the 1.9m held by the Employee Benefit Trust EBT at the beginning of the year, less the time apportioned element of the 0.7m shares acquired by the EBT to satisfy deferred share awards made to senior management.

TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 33 Initial contract payments ICPs increased in 2017 as the business looked to lock in brokers on long-term contracts that reflects increased market competition for their services.
ICPs are amortised over the life of the contract, typically three years, so this increased expenditure willimpact the reported level of broker compensation in future years.
The other working capital outflow in 2017 primarily reflects an increase in trade receivables as some customers have experienced delays in their payment cycles and bonus payments in respect of the strong performance in the final quarter of 2016.
The 32m cash outflow for the 2017 cost improvement programme reflects the charge in the income statement.
ICAP integration expenditure of 73m is lower than the 79m charged in the income statement.
The income statement charge also includes the write off of intangible assets and the share based payment charge relating to the transformational LTIP.
The Group paid 4m to purchase its own shares in order to satisfy deferred share awards made to senior management during the year.
Included within 2017 was also a 7m cash outflow for stamp duty paid on the shares acquired as part of the ICAP transaction and charged toequity in 2016.
Interest payments in 2017 reflect the underlying income statement charge for net cash finance expenses excluding the charge for the amortisation of debt issue costs.
Tax payments in 2017 of 27m are higher than in the prior year reflecting the inclusion of payments of the acquired ICAP companies.
The 6m of acquisition consideration and investments cash outflow in 2017 is deferred consideration in relation to the MOAB and Creditex acquisitions an initial upfront payment for COEX Partners Limited, and investments in Glia Ecosystems and LiquidityChain.

The Group has a 250m Revolving Credit Facility maturing in April 2019.
The facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2017.
Exchange and hedging The income statements and balance sheets of the Groups businesses whose functional currency is not GBP are translated into sterling at average and period end exchange rates respectively.
The most significant exchange rates for the Group are the US dollar and the Euro.
TheGroups current policy is not to hedge income statement or balance sheet translation exposure.
Average and period end exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements are shown below.
The scheme is closed to new members and future accrual.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 30 April 2016 was concluded in April 2017.
The actuarial funding surplus of the scheme at that date was 61m and under the agreed schedule of contributions the Company will continue not to make any payments into the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 19.
The fair value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2017 was 260m 31 December 2016: 317m.
The decrease reflects the investment return on the assets less amounts paid as benefits and transfers and the effect of the bulk annuity transaction explained below.
The value of the schemes liabilities atthe end of December 2017, calculated in accordance with IAS 19, was 203m 31 December 2016: 217m.
The valuation of the schemes liabilities at the end of the period reflects the demographic assumptions adopted for the most recent triennial actuarial valuation and a discount rate of 2.4% 31 December 2016: 2.5%.
Under IAS 19, the scheme shows a surplus, before the related deferred tax liability, of 57m at31 December 2017 31 December 2016: 100m.
On 11 May 2017 the Group announced that the Trustees had insured the defined benefit liabilities of the scheme through a bulk purchase annuity transaction with Rothesay Life for the payment of a premium of 270m to insure all scheme liabilities, which had an accounting value of 214m at that time.
The policy is in the name of the scheme and is a scheme asset.
The purchase of the policy represents a bulk annuity buy-in and has been accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Under IAS 19, the accounting value of the purchased policy is set to be equal to the value of the liabilities covered, calculated using the current IAS 19 actuarial assumptions for the defined benefit obligation.
As the actual purchase price of the policy was higher than the accounting value of the policy, a reduction of 56m in the Schemes assets was recorded.
This reduction is included within the Return on Scheme assets excluding deemed interest and reported as part of the Groups re-measurement of defined benefit pension schemes included within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 35 Regulatory capital The Groups lead regulator is the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
The Group has a waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy requirements under CRD IV.
The Groups current waiver took effect on 30December 2016, following the acquisition of ICAP, and will expire on 30 December 2026.
Under the terms of the waiver, each investment firm within the Group must be either a limited activity or a limited licence firm and must comply with its individual regulatory capital resources requirements.
TP ICAP, as the parent company, must continue to maintain capital resources in excess of the sum of the solo notional capital resources requirements for each relevant firm within the Group, the Financial Holding Company test.
The terms of the waiver require the Group to eliminate the excess of its consolidated own funds requirements compared with its consolidated own funds Excess Goodwill over the ten-year period to 30 December 2026.
The amount of the excess goodwill must not exceed the amount determined as at the date the waiver took effect and must be reduced in line with a schedule over the ten-years, with the first reduction of 25% required to be achieved by June 2019.
The Group expects to achieve this reduction within its current business plan.
The waiver also sets out conditions with respect to the maintenance of financial ratios relating to leverage, debt service and debt maturity profile.
The Groups regulatory capital headroom under the Financial Holding Company test calculated in accordance with Pillar 1 was 1,702m 2016:1,922m.
Many of the Groups broking entities are regulated on a solo basis, and are obliged to meet the regulatory capital requirements imposed by the local regulator of the jurisdiction in which they operate.
The Group maintains an appropriate excess of financialresources in such entities.
Information disclosure under Pillar 3 is available on the Groups website: www.
Going concern The Group has considerable financial resources both in the regions and at the corporate centre comfortably to meet the Groups ongoing obligations.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Annual Report and Financial Statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.
Viability Statement The Directors have assessed the prospects for, and viability of, the Group over a three year period to the end of December 2020.
We believe that a three year time horizon remains the most appropriate timeframe over which the Directors should assess the long-term viability of the Group.
This is on the basis that it has a sufficient degree of certainty in the context of the current position of the Group and the assessment of its principal risks, and it matches the business planning cycle with particular regard to the integration of the ICAP business and the delivery of synergies.
The assessment has been made taking into account the following: the current liquidity position of the Group including its base case and stressed case cash flow forecasts: the liquidity stress testing and reverse stress testing undertaken by the Group: the ICAAPs undertaken by the Groups FCA regulated entities: the assessment of the Groups principal risks, including those that would threaten the Groups business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity.
These risks are discussed in the risk management report on pages 36 to 41: and the effectiveness of the Groups risk management and internal control systems.
The Directors consider that they have undertaken a robust assessment of the prospects of the Group and its principal risks over the three year period, and, on the basis of that assessment, have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over at least the period of assessment.
In arriving at this conclusion, the Directors have made the following assumptions: the Group maintains access to liquidity through the Groups 250m revolving credit facility Note 23 on page 132 : the Group reduces its excess goodwill in accordance with the terms agreed with the FCA in the Groups waiver from consolidated capital adequacy requirements under CRD IV: the Group does not lose its waiver from consolidated capital adequacy requirements under CRD IV due to changes in the regulatory rules: the Group successfully refinances the 80m Notes that mature in June 2019 Note 23 on page 132 : the Group achieves the successful integration of the ICAP business and delivery of the expected synergies: and the Group takes appropriate action to mitigate potential adverse effects arising from Brexit.
