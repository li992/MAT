Without the Bank Republic estimated contribution effect, the interest income increased by GEL 142.0 million, or 19.5% YoY, mainly driven by a higher interest income from loans to customers by GEL 114.3 million, or 17.5%.
This is primarily related to the 26.2% gross loan portfolio increase.
A rise in interest income from investment securities comprising both investment securities available for sale and bonds carried at amortised cost of GEL 13.5 million, or 25.1%, also contributed to the overall increase in loan portfolio.
That in turn was driven by the significant rise in the respective portfolio.
In addition, net interest income from due from other banks grew by GEL 7.7 million, which was also determined by the large increase in respective portfolio.
In FY 2017 the Bank Republic effect mainly contributed GEL 152.0 million, or 16.5% to the interest income from loans and advances to customers, which totalled GEL 919.8 million, and GEL 8.7 million, or 11.5%, to interest income from investment securities, which amounted to GEL 76.1 million.
As a result, the overall Bank Republic estimated contribution effect was GEL 163.3 million, or 15.8%, to the interest income.
Loan yields declined over the same period from 13.4% to 12.1%.
The drop was driven by a decrease in rates on foreign currency-denominated loans, from 10.4% to 9.1%, as well as by decline in GEL-denominated loan rates from 19.0% to 16.9% broadly in line with the overall market trend.
The decline of yields on investment securities, from 8.6% to 7.8%, over the same period is related to a lower average refinance rate in the country in FY 2017 compared to FY 2016.
As a result, the yields on average interest earning assets dropped from 12.2% in FY 2016 to 11.1% in FY 2017.
In the reporting period, without the Bank Republic estimated contribution effect, interest expense increased by GEL 115.3 million, or 44.0% YoY.
The rise was mainly due to a higher interest expense on customer accounts of GEL 61.2 million, or 41.6%, and due to credit institutions of GEL 54.9 million or 69.8%.
The growth in interest expense on both customer accounts and on due to credit institutions was driven by the large increase in respective portfolios related to the overall business growth.
The Bank Republic estimated contribution effect added GEL 25.4 million, or 10.9%, to the interest expense on customer accounts, which amounted to GEL 233.9 million in FY 2017, and GEL 23.5 million or 15.0% to interest expense due to credit institutions, which amounted to GEL 157.1 million.
As a result, the overall Bank Republic contribution effect was a GEL 52.5 million, or 12.2%, to the interest expense.
The cost of deposits increased slightly by 0.1pp to 3.4% in FY 2017 and in the same period the cost of borrowing dropped to 6.5%, from 7.0% in FY 2016.
This was mainly due to the 1.2 pp decrease in rates on GEL-denominated borrowings and the 0.2 pp decrease in rates on FCdenominated borrowings.
As a result, the cost of funding ratio remained flat at 4.5%.
Consequently, NIM was 6.5% in FY 2017, compared to underlying NIM of 7.6% in FY 2016 or reported NIM of 7.8% 84 TBC Bank Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Overview Strategy & Performance Fee and commission income In thousands of GEL 2017 2016 Change YoY Card Operations 82,525 61,115 35.0% Settlement Transactions 59,739 43,434 37.5% Guarantees Issued 15,121 11,699 29.3% Letters of Credit 5,735 6,215 -7.7% Cash Transactions 17,424 13,013 33.9% Foreign Exchange Operations 1,339 1,277 4.9% Other 12,061 6,047 99.5% Fee and commission income 193,944 142,800 35.8% Card Operations 46,360 34,906 32.8% Settlement Transactions 7,421 5,795 28.1% Guarantees Issued 1,801 796 126.3% Letters of Credit 1,072 1,624 -34.0% Cash Transactions 4,393 2,633 66.8% Foreign Exchange Operations 94 190 -50.5% Other 6,842 6,588 3.9% Fee and commission expense 67,983 52,532 29.4% Card Operations 36,165 26,209 38.0% Settlement Transactions 52,318 37,639 39.0% Guarantees 13,320 10,903 22.2% Letters of Credit 4,663 4,591 1.6% Cash Transactions 13,031 10,380 25.5% Foreign Exchange Operations 1,245 1,087 14.5% Other 5,219 -541 NMF Net fee and commission income 125,961 90,268 39.5% NMF no meaningful figures In FY 2017, net fee and commission income totalled GEL 126.0 million, marking an increase of GEL 35.7 million, or 39.5%, compared to FY 2016.
The rise resulted mainly from a GEL 14.7 million, or 39.0%, gain in net fee and commission income from settlement transactions: a GEL 10.0 million, or 38.0%, increase in net card operations: a GEL 2.7 million, or 25.5%, rise in net cash transactions, and a GEL 2.4 million, or 22.2%, increase in net guarantees.
The Bank Republic estimated contribution was GEL 6.9 million, or 5.5%, in the net fee and commission income.
Net fee and commission income from card operations expanded due to an increase in the number of active cards by 35.6% YoY, as well as a rise in number of POS terminals by 12.1% YoY.
Net Fee and commission income from settlement transactions increased mainly due to increased commission income from money transfers by 40% and an increased volume of settlement transactions by 44% for one of the subsidiaries, TBC Pay.

This increase was mainly driven by a GEL 23.7 million or 35.0% rise in net gains less losses from trading in foreign currencies and foreign exchange translations mainly driven by increased trade volume and Bank Republic contribution.
Another large contributor to the increase in other operating non-interest income and gross insurance profit is a GEL 6.5 million increase in gross insurance profit from our subsidiary - TBC Insurance, which was acquired in October 2016.
As a result, the Groups consolidated figures include contribution from TBC Insurance only in the 4Q 2016, while it has been consolidated on a full year basis in 2017.
During 2017, we have significantly increased the number of customers to around 277,000 from only 3,000, which in turn led to high increase in gross written premium which amounted to GEL12.2 million in 2017 on a stand-alone basis.
As a result, market share increased to 13.3% from 1 3.5% establishing TBC Insurance as the third-largest player on market.
The growth is also due to a GEL 1.7 million increase in gain from the sale of investment properties as well as GEL 5.2 gain in the other subsection of other operating income.
The latter is mainly attributable to GEL 2.6 million reimbursed taxes: a GEL 2.9 million related to fair value adjustment of previously acquired portfolio due to a better than expected performance, and a GEL 2.1 million related to a expense-sharing programme by our partner payment technology companies.
The rise across these items was largely offset by a GEL 8.8 million drop in net gains less losses from disposal of investment securities available for sale due to a one-off gain from the sale of investment security in Q2 2016.
The Bank Republics estimated contribution in total other operating non-interest income was GEL 22.8 million or 17.4%, out of which GEL 14.1 million was related to gains less losses from trading in foreign currencies and foreign exchange translations.

In FY 2016, the one-off costs related to the Premium Listing and the Bank Republic integration amounted to GEL 16.2 million and GEL 12.2 million respectively.
In FY 2017, one-off costs were related to the Bank Republic integration and totalled GEL 10.9 million.

Total operating expenses including one-offs and the Bank Republic estimated contribution effect amounted to GEL 359.4 million.
Annualised cost synergies are expected to be GEL 24 million.

Bank Republic contribution assumptions: To make the YoY analyses more comparable, the Bank has segregated the Bank Republic contribution after the merger on 8 May 2017, which is based on direct income and cost attribution calculation and, where not applicable, based on established allocation rules, appropriate management assumptions, and estimates.
The management has estimated the Bank Republic contribution effect within the Group's financial results based on the following rationale: Loan and deposit portfolio as well as the interest income and expense from these portfolios have been calculated for all Bank Republics existing clients with outstanding exposure for the reporting period, as well as for all new clients attracted through the former branches of Bank Republic.
For the remaining items of B S and P&L where the direct attribution is not practical, the management has used the allocation based on Bank Republic loan and deposit books contribution to each operating segment.
