Financial review, Risk and Corporate responsibility Financial review Strong financial performance FY2017 was another year of strong financial performance.
It was also the year in which we sold our Debt Management business to Investcorp.
The sale of Debt Management completed on 3 March 2017 and the business we sold to Investcorp is classied as discontinued operations throughout this report.
We retained the CLO investments not required for regulatory or contractual purposes, as well as investments in the Global Income Fund and Senior Loan Fund.
These investments are classied within Other in the Financial review and our segmental reporting.
We generated an excellent gross investment return from Private Equity, Infrastructure and the retained Debt Management investments of 1,755 million 2016: 1,051 million and an operating profit before carried interest of 1,675 million 2016: 911 million.
This was driven by the strong unrealised value growth from our investments, together with the positive impact of foreign exchange translation.
Total return was 1,592 million, or a profit on opening shareholders funds of 36% 2016: 824 million or 22% and, as a result, the diluted NAV per share at 31 March 2017 increased by 30% to 604 pence 31 March 2016: 463 pence.

Alternative performance measures APMs In October 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA published guidelines about the use of APMs.
These are financial measures such as KPIs that are not dened under IFRS.
In our Strategic report we describe our financial performance under our Investment basis, which is itself an APM, and use a number of other measures which, on account of being derived from the Investment basis, are also APMs.
Further information about our use of APMs, including the applicable reconciliations to the IFRS equivalent where appropriate, is provided in page 43, and should be read alongside our Investment basis to IFRS reconciliation.
Our APMs are gross investment return as a percentage of the opening investment portfolio value, cash realisations, cash investment, operating cash profit, net cash debt and gearing.
