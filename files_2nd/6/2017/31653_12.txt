Financial Review Good growth in our core services from strong funds inflows Results The Groups financial performance for the year to 30 September 2017 was strong.
Statutory profit before tax from continuing operations was 15.0% higher than last year at 57.6 million 2016: 50.1 million, or 20.6% higher if the results of the acquisition in May 2017 are excluded.
Adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations adjusted PBT was 14.8% higher at 70.0 million 2016: 61.0 million, or 12.1% higher if the acquisition in the year is excluded.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS was 19.6p per share 2016: 16.8p, an increase of 16.7%.
The 14.8% increase in adjusted PBT was driven by the growth in total income of 7.8% to 304.5 million 2016: 282.4 million and together with improving operational efficiency.
Fixed operating costs grew by 5.2%, leading to an increase in adjusted PBT margin to 23.0% 2016: 21.6%.
Statutory PBT margin for the period increased to 18.9% 2016: 17.7% in line with adjusted PBT margin.

Brewin Dolphin 30 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Explanation of adjusted performance measures We use adjusted PBT, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted PBT margin adjusted measures to measure and report on the underlying financial performance of the Group, aiding comparability between reporting periods.
The adjusted measures are used by the Board and management for planning and reporting.
They are also useful measures for investors and analysts.
Additionally, we use some of the adjusted performance measures as Key Performance Indicators KPIs, as well as for performance measures for various incentive schemes, including the annual bonuses of Executive Directors and long-term incentive plans.
These adjusted profit measures are calculated based on statutory profit before tax adjusted to exclude various items of income or expense.
Such adjusted items are typically infrequent or unusual items which the Directors consider to be outside the ordinary course of business.
They can include non-recurring one-off items of either income or expenses.
Income or expenditure adjusted for historically has included items such as material gains on available-for-sale assets.
One-off expenses can be items such as acquisition costs incurred in the year and migration costs incurred during 2016.
Other adjusted-for-items of income or expense may, like the redundancy costs and onerous contract charges, recur from one period to the next.
Although these may recur over one or more periods, they are the result of events or decisions which the Directors consider to be outside the ordinary course of business, such as material restructuring decisions to reduce the ongoing cost base of the Group that do not represent long-term expenses of the business.
Incentivisation awards costs in relation to the acquisition in the current year, payable for a predetermined period of time, are adjusted for on this basis.
Additionally, the amortisation expense of acquired client relationships is an expense which investors and analysts typically add back when considering profit before tax or earnings per share ratios.

After associated staff costs of 0.6 million and administrative, overhead and variable costs of 0.3 million for the period this resulted in a post-acquisition contribution to adjusted profit before tax of 1.6 million to the Group, equivalent to incremental adjusted diluted earnings per share of 0.5p.
The integration of DLAM was completed successfully and the achievement of operational cost synergies has exceeded those originally expected by 0.3 million, on a full year run rate basis.
Additional exceptional costs of 3.0 million resulting from the acquisition were incurred, included within the adjusted items below and impacting statutory profit but not adjusted profit.
These comprise: the upfront acquisition costs of 1.7 million covering principally advisory fees and integration expenses: 1.3 million for additional awards to DLAM staff to incentivise the successful transfer and integration of the business: and an incremental charge for the amortisation of the 25.5 million of client relationships acquired see note 14 to the Financial Statements of 1.4 million within the 6.7 million total amortisation charge for the Group.
Net of these incremental costs the impact of the acquisition on 2017 statutory profit before tax was a loss of 2.8 million, or a reduction of 1.0 p to statutory diluted earnings per share.
Further exceptional staff incentivisation expense will be incurred over the next five financial years dependent on performance targets being achieved in May next year.

Core funds grew by 15.4% 2016: 13.7% or 13.3% excluding acquired funds, due to continuing strong growth in the intermediaries and MPS channels which represented 91.3% 2.1 billion of net discretionary funds inflows during the year.
The acquisition of DLAM increased core funds by 0.7 billion and included 0.6 billion of discretionary funds.
Total discretionary funds grew 17.4% 15.3% excluding acquired funds to 33.8 billion 2016: 28.8 billion driven by record gross funds inflows of 3.4 billion 2016: 2.4 billion and lower gross outflows of 1.2 billion 2016: 1.5 billion.
Discretionary net funds inflows of 2.3 billion 2016: 1.1 billion represents a record annualised growth from discretionary funds of 8.0% 2016: 4.4%, well above our 5% target.
Total direct discretionary growth was maintained with gross organic inflows of 1.0 billion 2016: 1.0 billion.
Total direct discretionary funds are now 23.4 billion including 0.6 billion of acquired assets 2016: 21.1 billion.
Charities and corporates represent 19.2% of our total direct client funds 2016: 19.9%.
Direct discretionary private client funds grew to 18.9 billion 2016: 16.9 billion with inflows increasing to 0.9 billion 2016: 0.8 billion in the year.
Of particular note was the growth of the wealth management service, which represented over one third of total direct inflows in the year, with 15% 2016: 13% of our direct private client funds now in this service.
As anticipated direct discretionary private client outflows declined from previously elevated levels to 0.7 billion 2016: 1.1 billion.
Total net flows for direct discretionary private clients were 0.2 billion, the same as the prior year.
Net funds inflows into charities and corporates were flat for the year 2016: 0.2 billion, as we saw slightly higher outflows of 0.2 billion 2016: 0.1 billion due to the loss of one large client in the early part of the year.
Gross inflows from our intermediaries channel of 1.5 billion 2016: 0.9 billion were a record high and we saw continuing strong funds inflows from MPS of 0.9 billion 2016: 0.5 billion.
The strength of our intermediaries proposition meant we added over 100 new relationships in the year, taking our total number of relationships to over 1,600.
We now have 28 intermediary relationships with funds of over 50 million, with the top 200 relationships accounting for 70% of our intermediaries funds.
Execution only funds, whilst flat at 3.5 billion, saw the loss of certain larger accounts in the first quarter of the year but with very low associated fee income loss.
Advisory funds were 2.7 billion 2016: 3.0 billion.
The rate of advisory funds net outflows has declined in the year to an annualised rate of 16.7% 2016: 25.7%, of which 0.4 billion was retained and transferred into other service categories.
Brewin Dolphin 32 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Income Total income increased by 7.8% to 304.5 million 2016: 282.4 million and is analysed as follows: 2017 2016 m m Change Private clients 176.4 165.9 6.3% Charities & corporates 21.8 19.7 10.7% Direct discretionary 198.2 185.6 6.8% Intermediaries 55.3 46.0 20.2% MPS 5.3 2.9 82.8% Indirect discretionary 60.6 48.9 23.9% Total discretionary 258.8 234.5 10.4% Financial planning 20.8 17.5 18.9% BPS 1.0 0.9 11.1% Execution only 10.4 10.4 -% Core income 291.0 263.3 10.5% Advisory 12.9 15.7 -17.8% Other income 0.6 3.4 -82.4% Total other income 13.5 19.1 -29.3% Total income 304.5 282.4 7.8% Core income growth of 10.5% to 291.0 million 2016: 263.3 million was driven by discretionary funds growth of 17.4% 2016: 16.5% and overall core funds growth of 15.4% 2016: 13.7%.
With the Groups continued focus on discretionary funds, core income now represents 95.6% 2016: 93.2% of total income.
Income from direct discretionary private clients grew 6.3% as we continued to attract new funds and transfer existing clients into this service.
Charities and corporates income grew in line with funds growth.
Income from our indirect discretionary business grew by 23.9% as a result of continued strong net funds inflows.
MPS income grew strongly in the year to 5.3 million 2016: 2.9 million as the business benefited from high levels of asset retention and record inflows.
Financial planning income increased by 18.9% to 20.8 million 2016: 17.5 million reflecting the increased take up of our wealth management service.
Total other income reduced by 5.6 million to 13.5 million 2016: 19.1 million impacted by slowing but continued outflows from our advisory business, the loss of trail income and the continued low interest rate environment.
Fees and commissions Core fee income grew by 15.7% to 207.9 million 2016: 179.7 million in line with the growth in core funds.
Core commission income declined by 3.8 million to 62.3 million 2016: 66.1 million as a result of a marked decline in market volatility during the year compared to the second half of 2016.
Core fee income now represents over 71% of core income and has increased steadily from 48% in 2010 and 62% in 2013.

The overall blended yield across all our discretionary services declined to 81bps 2016: 88bps.
This was a result of an increasing proportion of funds growth through our intermediaries channel and higher market levels moving direct discretionary private clients into lower priced fee bands.
Reduced portfolio turnover rates lowered commission income and consequently the commission yield.
This reflects more benign markets decreasing the need for portfolio rebalancing and a general increase in the use of collectives in client portfolios.
On a discrete basis, the yield from our direct discretionary private client channel reduced to 97bps 2016: 104bps primarily due to lower commission income.
Charities and corporates income yield remained consistent with 2016 at 50bps.
Intermediaries yield fell to 74bps 2016: 78bps as many intermediary relationships grew and became more material in the year.
Our intermediaries clients benefited from lower priced volume based fee tiers.
As a significant proportion of our intermediaries relationships are now on the most cost effective volume based tariff, we expect the overall yield from this business to remain broadly stable based on the current sources of inflows.
The MPS income yield was 28bps 2016: 30bps as a result of the introduction of lower priced passive products into the range.
The yield on our execution only business increased to 30bps 2016: 29bps, this was primarily due to increased trading activity by our clients.
The yield on our advisory business declined to 46bps 2016: 49bps, this was primarily due to a reduction in transactional commission income.
Adjusted PBT margin The increase in the adjusted PBT margin to 23.0% in the year 2016: 21.6% was driven by the growth in total income coupled with the ability of the Group to utilise existing capacity which delivered operational scale benefits.
Further, the efficient use of existing capacity together with rising income levels resulted in our target of 75 million of discretionary funds per CF30 being achieved in the final quarter of 2017 see page 25.
The fourth quarter adjusted PBT margin was 25%, in line with our target set in 2013.
Costs Total fixed operating costs increased by 5.2% to 182.0 million in the year 2016: 173.0 million with staff costs accounting for approximately 75% of the increase.
Fixed staff costs Fixed staff costs increased by 6.7 million to 110.2 million 2016: 103.5 million as a result of inflationary pay rises and higher cost of sales from the substantial increase in intermediary inflows compared to prior years.
Headcount grew by a net 31 over the course of the year to 1,614 from 1,583 at the end of last year.
Other operating costs Overall other operating cost increases were limited to 3.3%, increasing to 71.8 million 2016: 69.5 million.
This was largely as a result of increases in premises costs following rent reviews and higher technology spend ensuring our systems and processes are ready for the adoption of MiFiD II.
These increases were partially offset by further operational efficiencies and lower depreciation charges.
Brewin Dolphin 34 Annual Report 2017 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information Variable staff costs Variable staff costs in the form of profit share increased by 7.8% to 52.5 million 2016: 48.7 million, in line with business performance.
Profit share as a percentage of pre-profit share profit fell from 44.5% in 2016 to 42.8% in 2017 as a result of higher levels of deferrals and operational efficiency improvements.
Exceptional items Net exceptional costs of 5.7 million 2016: 4.6 million were primarily due to the acquisition of DLAM which resulted in 3.0 million of transaction related and staff incentivisation costs.
Redundancy costs, as a result of restructuring, declined materially from 2.7 million in 2016 to 0.7 million, as the period of major business rationalisation was largely concluded in the year.
The onerous contract charge for the year was 2.0 million 2016: 0.3 million, of which 1.3 million related to the identification of onerous space available for subletting in our Newcastle office, following a review of space utilisation and subsequent reorganisation see note 23 to the Financial Statements for further information.
Furthermore, a subdued property market for prime office space in Edinburgh resulted in the previously identified onerous space not being sublet in line with our expectations: the onerous provision has been revised to reflect this.
Amortisation of client relationships Amortisation of client relationships increased to 6.7 million 2016: 6.3 million, including 1.4 million for 4 months amortisation of the client relationships acquired in the year, offset by a reduction in the amortisation of other previously acquired client relationships which have now reached the end of their amortisation periods.
Defined benefit pension scheme The final salary pension scheme moved from a deficit of 7.0 million to a surplus of 4.5 million in the year resulting in an actuarial gain of 8.6 million being recognised 2016: 7.0 million loss.
Under IAS 19, large annual fluctuations can occur.
The swing to a surplus has largely been driven by an increase in the discount rate, reflecting a rebound in the level of corporate bond yields from their near low point at the end of September 2016.
This served to decrease the present value of liabilities that were significantly higher at 30 September 2016 than in the recent past: this was partially offset by an increase in the inflation assumption from 3.1% to 3.3% per annum.
Changes to post retirement mortality assumptions, members transferring the value of their benefits out of the scheme and cash contributions to the scheme have also contributed to the movement.
The Group continues to make contributions of 3.0 million per annum, as part of the funding plan agreed with the trustees of the Groups Defined Benefit Pension Scheme see note 18 to the Financial Statements.
Dividend The Groups dividend policy is set out in the Chairmans Statement, see page 15.
In determining the level of dividend in any year, the Board considers a number of factors including: the level of distributable reserves: the future cash commitments and investment needs to sustain the long-term growth of the Group: the level of dividend cover: and anticipated regulatory capital requirements.
The Company is the parent company of the Group and is a non-trading investment holding company.
It derives its distributable reserves from dividends received from its subsidiaries, of which Brewin Dolphin Limited is the principal operating subsidiary.
Before any interim or final dividends are proposed by the Board it satisfies itself that there will be sufficient distributable reserves in the Company at the respective payment dates.
The distributable reserves of the Company, comprise 38.4 million of the merger reserve see note 26 to the Financial Statements and the majority of the balance on the profit and loss reserve.
The Group is well positioned to continue funding dividend payments in accordance with its policy.
The ability of the Board to maintain future dividends will be influenced by a number of the principal risks identified on pages 28 to 29 that could adversely impact the performance of the Group.
Furthermore, with the current cash resources available to the Group we continue to be well positioned to support our strategy.
Further details of the Groups cash flow can be found below: details of its continuing viability and going concern are both on page 37.
The majority of the cash resources are held by the principal operating subsidiary Brewin Dolphin Limited.
co. uk Financial Review continued Capital resources and regulatory capital The Groups financial position remains strong with net assets increasing to 262.6 million at 30 September 2017 2016: 242.8 million, primarily as a result of good profit retention and the actuarial gain on the defined benefit pension scheme.
Tangible net assets net assets excluding intangibles are 166.8 million 2016: 161.8 million.
At 30 September 2017, the Group had regulatory capital resources of 165.2 million 2016: 164.0 million, see note 28 to the Financial Statements.
The Groups primary regulator is the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
The FCA rules determine the calculation of the Groups regulatory capital resources and regulatory capital requirements.
As required under FCA rules, we perform an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP which includes performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital that the Group needs to hold.
The Groups Pillar III disclosures are published annually on our website and provide further details about regulatory capital resources and requirements.
Cash flow and capital expenditure The Group had a small cash outflow for the period of 0.9 million 2016: 20.5 million inflow after paying 25.5 million for the DLAM acquisition, financed entirely from its cash reserves.
This resulted in total net cash balances of 170.0 million as at 30 September 2017 2016: 170.8 million.
Adjusted EBITDA see table below was 85.2 million 2016: 75.6 million, 12.7% higher, the increase being in line with adjusted PBT growth for the year.
3.0 million was contributed to the defined benefit pension scheme 2016: 3.0 million.
Capital expenditure of 2.0 million was significantly lower than previous periods 2016: 6.4 million, resulting from lower capitalisation of software due to the nature of IT developments.
Cash outflow for own share matching purchases in the period comprised 5.6 million 2016: 6.7 million for the Deferred Profit Share Plan and Equity Award Plan, to match the awards made in 2016.
All past awards are fully matched.
0.2 million 2016: 0.2 million of shares were purchased for the Share Incentive Plan see note 29 to the Financial Statements.
0.5 million was received from shares issued in the period in relation to Approved Share Options 2016: 0.4 million.
Dividends paid in the period increased by 11.6% to 36.6 million 2016: 32.8 million.

The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 28 to the Financial Statements.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of possible adverse changes in trading performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the Financial Statements.
In forming their view, the Directors have considered the Groups prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date the Financial Statements are approved.
Viability Statement The Directors have assessed the outlook of the Company over a longer period than the 12 months required by the going concern statement in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The assessment is based on the Groups Medium Term Plan MTP, the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP and the evaluation of the Groups principal risks and uncertainties see page 28, including those risks that could threaten its business model, future performance or solvency.
The Group maintains a five-year MTP as part of its corporate planning process, which is a financial articulation of the Groups strategy.
The financial forecasting model is predicated on a detailed year-one budget and higher level forecasts for years two to five.
As a matter of good practice and as part of the ICAAP required by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA, the firm performs a range of stress tests including reverse stress tests.
These assess the Groups ability to withstand a market-wide stress, a Groupspecific idiosyncratic stress and a combined stress taking into account both market-wide and Group-specific events.
The stress tests are derived through discussions with senior management, after considering the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, and the scenarios involved are refreshed on a regular basis to ensure they remain current.
The stress tests enable the Group to model the impact of a variety of external and internal events on the MTP: to identify the potential impact of stress events on the Groups income, costs, cash flow and capital: and the Board to assess the effectiveness of any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the impact of the stress events.
The reverse stress tests allow the Board to assess scenarios and circumstances that would render its business model unviable.
This enables the identification of potential business vulnerabilities and the development of potentially mitigating actions.
During the year the Group has continued to evaluate the potential risks and opportunities of the UK leaving the European Union.
Although there remains limited clarity on the final outcome of the negotiations, a range of potential scenarios have been considered and the potential impacts on our clients, the Group and the wider industry have been assessed.
This analysis does not present any reason to believe the Group will not remain viable over the long-term.
The Group will continue to engage with industry bodies, regulators and clients to further understand these impacts and manage the associated risks.
Following the assessment of the above, the Board concluded that the Viability Statement should cover a period of five years.
While the Directors have no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable over a longer period, this period has been chosen to be consistent with the MTP used as part of the Groups corporate planning process.
Taking account of the Groups current position and principal risks and the Boards assessment of the Companys prospects, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a period of at least five years.
