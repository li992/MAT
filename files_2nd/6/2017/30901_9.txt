Strategic Report Finance Review Underlying Trading Profit of 69.8m was at the top end of our guidance given at the start of the year: it was 12m lower than 2016, driven by the first half of 2016 benefiting from non-recurring trading items, and by net contract attrition.
Revenue from continuing and discontinued operations was 94m lower at 2,954m.
Closing Net Debt of 141m was better than expected and represents a year-on-year increase of 32m, driven by the outflows related to loss-making contracts.

The Group is incurring costs in relation to restructuring programmes resulting from the Strategy Review.
These costs include redundancy payments, provisions, external advisory fees and other incremental costs, including in 2017 2.8m of intangible asset impairment 2016: nil.
Due to the nature and scale of the impact of the transformation phase of the Strategy Review, the incremental costs associated with this programme are considered to be exceptional.
Costs associated with the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review must meet the following criteria: that they are directly linked to the implementation of the Strategy Review: they are incremental costs as a result of the activity: and they are non-business as usual costs.
In 2017, a charge of 28.6m 2016: 17.2m arose in relation to the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review.
The Strategy Review is discussed in more detail in the Strategic Report on page 11.
Non-exceptional restructuring charges are incurred by the business as part of normal operational activity, which in the year totalled 11.1m 2016: 6.7m and were included within operating profit before exceptional items.
We expect restructuring costs of approximately 35m to be incurred in 2018 which will be treated as exceptional.
There were exceptional costs totalling 0.4m 2016: 0.1m associated with the UK Government reviews and the programme of Corporate Renewal.
These costs have historically been treated as exceptional and consistent treatment is applied in 2017.
