FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Simon Boddie Financial summary Chief Financial Officer Adjusted earnings per share EPS for the year increased 30% to 6.4 cents 2016: 4.9 cents.
This growth was driven by higher adjusted operating profits 11% CER growth, a reduction in effective tax rate 4% reduction in underlying rate, including a $3 million deferred tax credit resulting from the recent US tax reforms, a $4 million reduction in the IAS19 pension finance charge albeit offset to some extent by the related decrease in interest Highlights for 2017: income on reduced parent group cash, and foreign exchange gains of $2 million 2016: Successful completion of $4 million losses primarily relating to mark-to-market MTM adjustments.
Excluding the year- $225m debut issue in US on-year impact of the foreign exchange gains losses net of tax, and the deferred tax credit placement as a result of the recently announced US tax reforms, adjusted EPS growth would have been Settlement concluded with all 17%.
The Company generated a reported attributable profit from continuing operations of three UK pension schemes $81 million compared to $64 million in 2016, primarily due to the reasons set out above.
Improvement in cash generation Adjusted free cash flow was $87 million in 2017, a 12% increase on 2016 $78 million, driven by increased profitability, driven by improved profitability, which was partially offset by the anticipated increase in capital effectively controlled net expenditure to $50 million 2016: $40 million : the increase in which was predominantly in working capital and lower the second half.
The reduction in net cash from $78 million at the end of 2016 to a net debt effective tax rate position at 31 December 2017 of $241 million primarily reflects the upfront deficit recovery payments made into the three UK defined benefit pension schemes in the first half of the year following settlement with the Trustees of those schemes see later for further details.
An important metric for the operating business is the leverage ratio of net debt excluding Priorities for 2018 parent group cash to adjusted EBITDA, which further improved to 1.1x adjusted EBITDA Implementing Connecting at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: 1.3x.
for Growth programme Return on capital employed remained in line with 2016 at 35%, as higher adjusted Continuing integration operating profits and controlled working capital were offset by the anticipated increase in of recent acquisition capital expenditure.
Delivery of sales, earnings and cash growth Connecting for Growth programme Connecting for Growth is a two year transformation programme to drive agility across the organisation, enabling the next phase of growth at Coats, and accelerating our transition from the industrial age to the digital age.
We are building on our current strong position in order to respond to the constantly changing market demands and adding value to our customers by being agile partners with an increased emphasis on speed, quality, value, innovation and corporate responsibility.
This programme will focus on simplification across many aspects of the organisation, connecting the business end to end, and releasing funds for reinvestment in our customer-focussed initiatives and our people.
Examples of reinvestment will include further building our innovation capabilities, digital tools e. g. further connecting our global manufacturing assets, and developing our people e. g. skills upgrades relevant to a digital world, all of which are key to delivering our wider Group strategy.
We have identified potential gross annualised operating cost savings of $25 million by 2020.
After reinvestments of c. $10 million per annum, we expect the programme to deliver net annualised operating cost savings of $15 million by 2020.
The total reorganisation cost to achieve these operating cost savings is estimated to be $30 million, with the majority of these reorganisation costs incurred in 2018 as these costs are not expected to form part of the ongoing cost base, these will be excluded from adjusted operating profit.
In 2018, we anticipate there to be net operating cost savings, after reinvestments, of $5 million reflected within adjusted operating profit.
We expect that the majority of savings will be achieved from reducing complexity in the existing Group.
For example, transitioning from market-focussed support functions e. g. Finance, HR, Technology to realigned globally integrated support functions, redesigning the way we service a number of our peripheral markets, and moving from a business which is currently operated by individual local management teams into 10 scalable clusters.
The programme extends beyond productivity improvements to delivering process excellence, improving customer satisfaction, and creating a wider pool of world class talent, all of which underpin our growth strategy and increase shareholder value.
Financial review Alternative Performance Adjusted EPS for the year increased 30% to 6.4 cents 2016: 4.9 cents.
This was driven by the higher operating profit, improvements in the underlying tax rate, the deferred tax credit as Measures see note 37 on page 143 a result of the recently announced US tax reforms, a lower pension finance charge offset to some extent by decrease in interest income on reduced parent group cash, and MTM foreign 31 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED exchange gains 2016: foreign exchange losses.
Excluding the year-on-year impact of the MTM foreign exchange gains losses net of tax, and the one-off impact of the US tax reforms on deferred tax balances, adjusted EPS growth would have been 17%.
Reported EPS of 5.8 cents compares to 4.3 cents in 2016 with the increase predominantly due to the above factors.
Non-operating results Net finance costs in the period were $23.0 million, significantly down from $31.6 million in 2016.
The key drivers of the reduction in net finance costs in the period were $2 million foreign exchange gains mainly in relation to MTM adjustments for the year ended 31 December 2017 2016: $4 million losses, and a $4 million reduction in the IAS19 pension finance charge to $9.4 million 2016: $13.6 million.
The latter was following the injection of parent group cash into the three UK defined benefit schemes which reduced the net IAS19 liabilities accordingly, although the reduced pension finance charge was offset to some extent by reduced interest income on the lower parent group cash balance.
Interest on borrowings was broadly flat year-on-year at $14.5 million 2016 $14.4 million : underlying interest was lower partly due to fixed interest rate swaps coming to an end, as well as lower net debt levels during the year.
However, this was offset by a $2 million charge in relation to accelerated amortisation of capitalised facility fees in relation to the previous 2015 refinancing following the USPP issue and refinancing of existing bank debt in December 2017.
The taxation charge for 2017 was $47.8 million 2016: $46.8 million resulting in a reported tax rate of 33% 2016: 38%.
Excluding exceptional and acquisition related items and the impact of IAS19 finance charges, the underlying effective rate on pre-tax profits reduced by 400bps to 30% 2016: 34%.
This reduction includes a non-cash tax credit of $3.0 million 200 bps as a result of the revaluation of the net US deferred tax liabilities following the tax reform measures introduced by the US Government in the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.
The Groups underlying effective tax rate excluding this one-off impact is 32%, a reduction of 200bps from 2016 which was driven by a reduction in unrelieved losses, together with a change in profit mix for the period.
We have reviewed the available detail of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act but do not expect the changes to have a significant impact on the Groups future underlying effective tax rate despite the reduction in the headline US Corporate Income Tax rate from 35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018.
The benefit of the rate reduction is offset by provisions to limit net interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income and the loss of the domestic production activities deduction, which our US operations have historically benefitted from.
Further detail and guidance is expected to be released in the coming months and we will continue to monitor this.
Profit attributable to minority interests was $14.3 million 2016: $11.9 million and was predominantly related to Coats operations in Vietnam and Bangladesh in which it has controlling interests.
Exceptional and acquisition related items Net exceptional and acquisition related items before taxation were $9.1 million in 2017.
These are related to the amortisation of intangible assets acquired in the recent acquisitions $2.1 million, contingent consideration in relation to these acquisitions $4.0 million, acquisition transaction costs $0.4 million, and the closure costs of a joint venture entity $2.6 million.
In 2016 net exceptional and acquisition related items before taxation totalled $4.6 million.
Lower Passaic River LPR In 2010, the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA notified Coats & Clark, Inc. CC, a subsidiary within the Coats Group, that it was a potentially responsible party under the US Superfund law for investigation and remediation costs at the 17 mile Lower Passaic River Study Area LPR in New Jersey in respect of alleged operations of a predecessors former facilities in that area prior to 1950.
CC has concluded that it was not responsible for the contaminants and environmental damage that are the primary focus of the EPA process.
In 2015, a provision of $15.8 million was recorded for remediation costs and associated legal and professional costs based on CCs estimated share of fide minimis costs for appropriate remedies, net of insurance reimbursements.
Alternative Performance In September 2017, in response to comments from various parties that all parties should be Measures see note 37 included in the same allocation process, EPA expanded the process to include private parties on page 143 that are alleged to have discharged the relevant contaminants, and asked the allocator to 32 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED make a determination about the respective shares of all parties.
CC has previously indicated to EPA that it is not responsible for the primary risk drivers.
The duration and scope of the allocation process have yet to be determined.
No additional provision has been recorded during 2017.
See note 28 for further details.
Investment Capital expenditure in the year, in addition to ongoing maintenance requirements, related to new product development, process improvements, capacity expansion, health and safety, and environmental spend.
The latter, include projects such as effluent treatment plants which enable a thread plant to recycle more process water, or even to operate with zero discharges.
These help to ensure that Coats maintains its strong corporate responsibility credentials and ethical reputation in the industry as well as benefitting the local communities that we do business in.
Total capital spend for the year amounted to $50 million 1.2x depreciation and amortisation, in line with the previously flagged increase on the 2016 capital spend of $40 million 1.0x depreciation and amortisation.
In order to continue to support our growth strategy and reinforce our strong environmental compliance credentials we anticipate capital spend to remain in the $50-60 million range for 2018.
Cash flow Adjusted free cash flow was $87 million in 2017, which was a 12% increase on 2016 $78 million.
This was due to increased profitability, effectively controlled net working capital and lower effective tax rates, which more than offset the anticipated second half increase in capital expenditure $8 million increase vs H2 2016.
This is a key metric for the Group in relation to underlying cash flow generation and is before annual pension recovery payments, acquisitions and dividends, and excludes exceptional items.
Adjusted EBITDA was $216 million 2016: $199 million.
Net working capital has been effectively controlled at 10% of Group sales 2016: 10%, driven by an improvement in days payable outstanding which was offset by an increase in stocks to support service delivery, along with a marginal improvement in days sales outstanding.
Interest paid was $14 million, which was in line with 2016.
Tax paid was $61 million, a $3 million increase on 2016, where higher profitability in 2017 was offset by the overall reduction in the Groups underlying effective tax rate driven by favourable profit mix.
On a non-adjusted basis, free cash outflow was $330 million, compared to $84 million outflow in 2016.
The increase was primarily related to $373 million of payments into the three UK defined benefit pension schemes 2016: $99 million following settlement with their respective trustees including $348 million of upfront settlement payments out of parent group cash made in the first half, shareholder dividends of $18 million 2016: nil, offset by a lower spend on acquisitions in 2017 of $20 million 2016: $36 million.
Adjusted free cash flow 2017 $m Alternative Performance Measures see note 37 on page 143 33 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Balance sheet The Group had a net debt position of $241 million at 31 December 2017 31 December 2016: net cash $78 million.
At 31 December 2016 the net cash position of $78 million included parent group cash of $343 million and operating business net debt of $265 million.
Following the settlement of the three UK defined benefit pension schemes in the first half of 2017 the parent group cash has now reduced to $0.5 million, with $348 million 270 million up-front settlement payments into those three schemes.
The Coats operating business had a net debt position of $242 million at the end 2017.
This was below 31 December 2016 $265 million primarily due to the adjusted free cash flow in the last year $87 million, offset by on-going pension deficit recovery payments including administrative expenses now paid out of the operating business net debt following settlement $25 million, shareholder dividends $18 million and the acquisition of Patrick Yarn Mill $20 million.
An important metric for the operating business is the leverage ratio of net debt excluding parent group cash to adjusted EBITDA.
Net debt at 31 December 2017 improved to 1.1x adjusted EBITDA of the last twelve months 1.3x at 31 December 2016.
Following the binding settlement agreements agreed with the trustees of the three UK pension schemes see further details below it was determined that the functional currency of Coats Group plc had changed from Great Britain pounds sterling to the United States dollars, effective 1 March 2017.
This change has been accounted for prospectively in line with accounting standards and generated exchange differences in the year that reduced share capital by $40 million, reduced the capital reduction reserve by $25 million, and reduced the share premium account by $11 million.
Equivalent gains were booked in the translation reserve and as a result distributable reserves have not been impacted by this change.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The net obligation for the Groups retirement and other post-employment defined benefit liabilities, on an IAS19 financial reporting basis, was $163 million as at 31 December 2017, down from $627 million at 31 December 2016.
The deficits in the Groups UK defined benefit schemes, namely the UK Coats Plan, and Brunel and Staveley schemes, decreased to $106 million 79 million from the position at 31 December 2016 $576 million, 467 million.
The decrease in liabilities in the period of $470 million primarily consisted of deficit repair payments of $373 million which included agreed upfront settlement payments of 270 million $348 million made in the first half, actuarial gains of $141 million mainly related to asset outperformance offset by the impact of foreign exchange on Sterling liabilities of $31 million.

The settlements with the three schemes were completed in the first half of 2017, and as a result the UK Pension Regulator confirmed that its regulatory action has ceased in relation to the warning notices issued to the Company in 2013 and 2014.
Alternative Performance Measures see note 37 on page 143 34 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED The principal commercial terms of the combined three settlements are: Financial support on the basis of a combined technical provisions deficit as at April 2015 of 582 million $786 million to be repaired by: a upfront payments totalling 329.5 million $447 million from the Company's parent group cash paid directly into the schemes inclusive of the agreed Recovery Plan contributions paid to the Brunel and Staveley schemes since 1 January 2016 : and b annual deficit contributions totalling 17.5 million $24 million, including estimated administration expenses and levies of 5 million p. a. to be paid until 2028.
Access to sponsor support from Coats for future funding needs together with a Company guarantee.
As a result of the settlements reached with the three schemes, the total cash Recovery Plan contributions in 2017, including estimated administration expenses and levies, were 290 million $373 million.
This comprised 270 million upfront settlement payments which were paid in H1, and 20 million annual deficit contributions, including estimated administration expenses and levies.
These cash payments continue to be excluded from the Group's adjusted Free Cash Flow.
Triennial funding valuations The next triennial funding valuations for the Coats UK, Brunel and Staveley schemes have an effective date of 31 March 2018.
Although there is a relatively small IAS19 accounting deficit as at 31 December 2017 in comparison to the defined benefit obligations, the pension trustees are required to calculate the funding position on the more prudent technical provisions basis.
In addition, real UK interest rates have reduced since the first quarter of 2015 and in aggregate the UK schemes now hedge c. 70% of interest rate and inflation linked liabilities.
These triennial valuations will determine the Groups agreed future contribution requirements and the process is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.
Refinancing As previously reported, in December, the Group completed a $225 million issue of US Private Placement USPP notes.
The notes, which represent our debut issue in the USPP market, have a maturity of seven and ten years and have been issued on investment grade terms.
Simultaneously, Coats agreed a new $350 million five-year bank facility with a syndicate mainly comprising its existing lenders.
The USPP notes and new bank facility replace Coats' $680 million bank facility that was due to mature in March 2020.
This refinancing has achieved the Group's aims of diversifying the sources of debt financing and extending their maturity out to 2027. Dividend Coats has a track record of delivering good levels of free cash through profitable sales growth, delivering self-help initiatives and investing in organic growth opportunities.
The Board aims to use this free cash flow to fund its pension schemes, self-finance bolt-on acquisitions, and make returns to shareholders.
Over time, and as underlying earnings and cash flows increase, the Board intends to pursue a progressive dividend policy.
As a result of this established policy, and reflecting the financial performance in 2017, the Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.00c per share which, combined with the interim divided of 0.44c per share, gives a total dividend for the year of 1.44c pro-forma 2016 full year dividend: 1.25c per share, which represents a 15% increase on the previous year.
Subject to approval at the forthcoming AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 29 May 2018 to ordinary shareholders on the register at 4 May 2018, with an ex-dividend date of 3 May 2018.
35 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Outlook We enter 2018 in a strong position, with continued momentum in our Apparel and Footwear and hi-tech Performance Materials businesses.
Whilst market conditions in our North American Crafts business are expected to remain challenging, our new management team has commenced implementation of a refocused strategy.
We expect 2018 adjusted operating profits to benefit from the incremental full year contribution from the Patrick Yarn Mill acquisition, and the anticipated first year benefits from the Connecting for Growth programme.
As such, 2018 adjusted operating profits are expected to be slightly ahead of previous management expectations.
We will also continue to focus on cash flow generation in order to allow us to continue to reinvest in both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
