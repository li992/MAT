Financial review Results of operations The following table sets forth the Groups revenue and expense items for each of the last two years: 2017 2016 $m $m Revenue 1,764.6 1,688.3 Cost of goods sold 838.3 821.0 Gross profit 926.3 867.3 Selling and distribution expenses 377.5 357.0 General and administrative expenses 259.8 318.2 Research and development expenses 41.2 38.1 Operating profit 247.8 154.0 Finance costs 62.1 271.4 Other expense, net 21.7 8.4 Profit loss before income taxes 164.0 125.8 Income tax expense 5.6 77.0 Net profit loss 158.4 202.8 The discussion below mentions revenue and certain costs and expenses on a constant exchange rate basis.
Constant currency information is calculated by applying the applicable prior period average exchange rates to the Groups actual performance in the respective period.
Revenue and costs and expenses on a constant exchange rate basis are non-IFRS financial measures and should not be viewed as a replacement of IFRS results.
Such measures are presented because the Group believes they enable it to focus on the actual performance related changes in the results of operations from year to year without the effects of changes in exchange rates.
Revenue On a reported basis revenue increased 4.5% to $1,764.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 from $1,688.3 million in the prior 3 year.
On a constant exchange rate basis revenue increased 4.1% for the year ended 31 December 2017, including a $30.2 million contribution from the acquisitions of EuroTec and Woodbury.
Organic revenue growth for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 2 2.3%.
Reported revenue was primarily impacted by favourable foreign exchange movement in the Euro, compared to the US dollar, partially offset by unfavourable GBP US dollar movements.
Revenue by franchise The following table sets forth the Groups revenue by franchise for each of the last two years and the percentage change on a reported and constant exchange rate basis: 2017 2016 Growth Growth 1 2 $m $m Reported Organic Revenue by franchise Advanced Wound Care 577.8 559.5 3.3% 2.6% Ostomy Care 528.9 512.1 3.3% 0.8% Continence and Critical Care 382.9 356.5 7.4% 1.7% Infusion Devices 275.0 260.2 5.7% 5.2% Total 1,764.6 1,688.3 4.5% 2.3% Advanced Wound Care 2 Our AWC franchise delivered organic revenue growth of 2.6% in 2017.
Reported revenue of $577.8 million in 2017 grew 3.3% compared to 2016.
We continued to see strong demand for our AQUACEL product lines, with foam, silver and surgical cover dressing the main drivers of growth, although we did underperform in the US in the post-acute channel.
Following the relocation of surgical cover dressing and DuoDerm production lines from the US to Haina in the Dominican Republic, the delays in certification by our European Notified Body and longer than anticipated time to ramp-up to full production volumes led to a build-up of backorders and consequent loss of some orders.
The impact of the supply constraints reduced organic revenue growth by c. 1 percentage point.
In addition, changes to reimbursement rates in France at the start of 2017 reduced organic revenue growth by a further c. 1 percentage point.
ConvaTec Group Plc 50 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview01 Strategic report04 Governance60 Financial statements102 Other information168 Ostomy Care The execution of our strategy to return the Ostomy Care franchise to consistent growth continued to gain momentum and the franchise delivered an improved performance in the first half of 2017.
During that period we saw good momentum in the US, Latin America, Japan and China, supported by our me direct-to-consumer programme in the US, and the global launches of the Esteem Flex Convex one-piece system and Natura Convex Accordion Flange.
However, in the third quarter, following the transfer of the final manufacturing lines from Greensboro in the US to our Haina facility, we experienced the impact of delays in making those lines fully operational.
As a result production of Convex and Moldable products ran below full capacity.
This led to supply constraints and, once safety stock had been depleted, a build-up of backorders and 2 3 consequent loss of some orders.
Organic revenue growth for the full year was 0.8% or 3.0% at constant exchange rates, with supply constraints reducing growth by c. 2 percentage points.
Renewal of Group Purchasing Organisation GPO contracts in the US impacted growth by a further c. 0.5 percentage points over the year as a whole.
Reported revenue of $528.9 million grew 3.3% compared to 2016, and included a $11.3 million contribution from EuroTec, which we acquired at the beginning of the year.
Continence & Critical Care CCC 2 3 We made good progress in our CCC franchise.
Organic revenue growth of 1.7% or 7.0% at CER reflected good growth in our Home Distribution Group HDG business and our GentleCath portfolio, offset by planned product rationalisation as part of our MIP, which reduced revenue growth by $13 million 3.5 percentage points.
On a reported basis revenue increased 7.4% to $382.9 million, and included an $18.9 million contribution from Woodbury.
Infusion Devices In our Infusion Devices franchise, we launched our new infusion set neria guard for non-insulin therapies in June, and for diabetes use, MiniMed Mio Advance, with our partner Medtronic in selected markets.
This infusion set is the first of its kind to help eliminate the risk of needle-stick injuries with its fully automated insertion function and has applications beyond insulin therapy.
2 Infusion Devices revenue grew by 5.2% on an organic basis in 2017, with our partners seeing continued growth for diabetes insulin pumps and new product launches.
On a reported basis revenue of $275.0 million grew 5.7% year on year.
Cost of goods sold Adjusted gross profit margin for the year ended 31 December 2017, excluding impacts from amortisation of certain intangible assets and certain non-recurring costs, was 61.0% compared with 60.9% for the prior year.
The 10 bps improvement in the Groups adjusted gross margin percentage reflected a performance benefit to adjusted gross margin from MIP which was more than offset by headwinds and cost increases.
Including pricing and product mix effects, overall there was a negative impact on adjusted gross margin of 70 basis points, offset by an 80 bps foreign exchange benefit.
Refer to Non-IFRS Financial Information for further information.
Adjusted cost of goods sold of $688.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 increased 4.3% or $28.1 million on the prior year, driven by headwinds and cost increases outlined above, and increased volume of goods sold, offset by favourable foreign exchange.
Reported cost of goods sold increased 2.1% or $17.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, from $821.0 million in the prior year, with the increases above offset by a decrease in accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and asset write offs.
Refer to page 55 for further information.
As a percentage of revenue, cost of goods sold decreased to 47.5% for the year ended 31 December 2017 from 48.6% in the prior year.
On a reported basis, gross profit revenue less cost of goods sold increased $59.0 million or 6.8% and gross profit margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 52.5% and 51.4% for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively.

2 Represents the percentage of revenue.
Selling and distribution expenses Adjusted selling and distribution expenses increased $22.0 million or 6.2% for the year ended 31 December 2017 to $377.2 million.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted selling and distribution expenses were 21.4% and 21.0% for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively.
This increase was driven by investments in growth in HDG, EMEA, the Americas and China, as well as the inclusion of EuroTec and Woodbury.
On a constant exchange rate basis, adjusted selling and distribution expenses increased 3 $20.6 million or 5.8%.
Reported selling and distribution expenses increased $20.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 to $377.5 million, due to the increases described above.
General and administrative expenses Adjusted general and administrative expenses increased $37.6 million or 22.9% for the year ended 31 December 2017 to $202.0 million.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted general and administrative expenses were 11.4% and 9.7% for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 respectively.
This increase was driven by investments to support growth and productivity, the inclusion for a full year of $14.9 million Plc costs along with the cost base of Woodbury and EuroTec.
On a constant exchange rate basis, 3 adjusted general and administrative expenses increased $38.7 million or 23.6%.
Reported general and administrative expenses decreased $58.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 due to a reduction in share-based compensation expense and IPO related costs in the prior year, offset by the increases noted above.
Research and development expenses R&D Adjusted R&D expenses increased $4.0 million or 11.0% for the year ended 31 December 2017 to $40.3 million, to support new product development.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted R&D expenses were 2.3% and 2.2% for the years ended 31 December 3 2017 and 2016 respectively.
On a constant exchange rate basis, adjusted R&D expenses increased $4.9 million or 13.4%.

ConvaTec Group Plc 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview01 Strategic report04 Governance60 Financial statements102 Other information168 Operating profit Adjusted operating profit decreased $15.4 million or 3.3% to $456.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 due to increases in the Groups operating costs and expenses as outlined above, offset by higher revenue and an increase in gross margin.
Adjusted operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales was 35.1% for the year ended 31 December 2017, an increase of 220 bps on the prior year reflecting the increased costs outlined above.
Adjusted operating profit margin for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 25.9% decreased 210 bps from the prior year.
On a constant exchange rate basis, adjusted operating profit decreased $35.7 million or 7.6% for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Reported operating profit increased $93.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2017 to $247.8 million primarily due to an increase in revenue and gross margin and lower operating costs and expenses as outlined above.
Other costs and net expenses Finance costs Finance costs consist of interest costs, standby fees, interest cost on derivative financial instruments, and any loss related to debt extinguishment.
Finance costs decreased $209.3 million, or 77.1%, to $62.1 million in 2017 from $271.4 million in 2016, primarily reflecting the following: i a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of $179.0 million, ii the 2016 loss on extinguishment of debt of $21.9 million, iii the 2016 write off of deferred financing fees of $7.3 million, in the aggregate, related to the Groups revolving credit facility financing in October 2016 and the commitment letter entered into in connection with the financing of the Groups credit facilities refer to Note 19 Borrowings for further information, and iv a decrease in the non-cash amortisation of debt discounts and deferred financing fees of $4.1 million.
The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by i the October 2016 redemption of the Payment-in-Kind notes PIK Notes due 15 January 2019, the 10.5% senior notes due 2018 US Dollar Senior Notes and the 10.875% senior notes due 2018 Euro Senior Notes and collectively with the US Dollar Senior Notes, the Senior Notes and ii a lower interest rate on the Groups credit facilities as a result of the October 2016 financing.
Adjusted finance costs decreased $180.1 million to $62.1 million in 2017 from $242.2 million in 2016, primarily reflecting the following: i a decrease in interest expense on borrowings of $179.0 million and ii a decrease in the non-cash amortisation of debt discounts and deferred financing fees of $4.1 million.
The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by i the October 2016 redemption of the PIK Notes and the Senior Notes and ii a lower interest rate on the Groups credit facilities as a result of the October 2016 financing.
Other expense, net Other expense, net primarily consists of net gains and losses resulting from i the re-measurement or settlement of transactions that are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of a transacting subsidiary and ii derivative financial instruments.
Other expense increased $13.3 million to $21.7 million in 2017 from $8.4 million in 2016, primarily due to i the foreign exchange net losses related to intercompany transactions, including loans transacted in non-functional currencies and ii foreign currency impact on re-measurement of the Groups borrowings denominated in non-functional currency in 2016.
These increases were partially offset by i the 2016 reclassification of foreign exchange accumulated losses of $36.4 million from other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as a result of restructuring of certain foreign subsidiaries as part of the IPO process, ii the 2016 loss of $17.8 million related to the settlement of a foreign currency forward exchange contract, and iii a gain on the sale of certain assets in Malaysia.
Refer to Note 9 Other Expense, Net for further information.
Income tax expense On a reported basis, income tax decreased by $71.4 million to $5.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2017, compared to a tax expense of $77.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2016.
The decrease was mainly driven by a change in deferred tax, from an expense of $37.2 million in 2016 to a benefit of $32.5 million in 2017.
This change was mainly driven by 2017 impacts of: US tax reform, M&A activity, normalisation of taxes on unremitted earnings in the Dominican Republic, lower non-deductible costs incurred in 2017, including share-based compensation, and 2016 related IPO and reorganisation costs, and prior year effect on deferred tax.
US tax reform led to a reduction in the headline US federal tax rate from 35% to 21% which enabled the Group to recognise a non-cash benefit of $21.1 million on deferred tax liabilities as of 1 January 2017.
This also generated a non-cash benefit of $3.0 million on 2017 changes in deferred tax liabilities.
Also, US tax reform implemented the so-called participation exemption for dividends and the Group recognised a non-cash benefit of $4.0 million from taxes on unremitted earnings.
This reform element is coupled with a one-time 2017 transition tax on implementing participation exemption.
This transition tax is insignificant to the Groups 2017 income tax charge.
Other significant factors impacting on the tax expense include a non-cash benefit of $9.9 million related to M&A accounting for Woodbury, non-cash benefit of $18.4 million on taxes on unremitted earnings primarily in the Dominican Republic, and 2016 non-cash benefit of $10.8 million from the prior year effect on deferred tax.
After adjusting for certain financial measures which the Group believes are useful supplemental indicators of future operating performance, the adjusted tax rate was 14.7% for the year ended 31 December 2017.
See Note 10 Income Taxes, for further details.
ConvaTec Group Plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial review continued Net profit loss As a result of all of the above, net profit was $158.4 million in 2017, compared to a net loss of $202.8 million in 2016, reflecting a change of $361.2 million.
Adjusted net profit increased $137.2 million, to $316.0 million in 2017 from $178.8 million in 2016.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted net profit was 17.9% and 10.6% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The increase was primarily driven by i a decrease in finance costs as described above, offset by ii lower operating profit, driven by overall increases in the Groups operating expenses discussed above, partially offset by strong gross margin.
Exchange rates The table set out below summarises the exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into USD that have the most significant impact on the Group results: Average rate Currency Closing rate 2017 2016 EUR USD Average 1.13 1.11 Closing 1.20 1.05 GBP USD Average 1.29 1.36 Closing 1.35 1.23 DKK USD Average 0.15 0.15 Closing 0.16 0.14 Non-IFRS financial information This Annual Report contains certain financial measures that are not defined or recognised under IFRS.
These measures are referred to as Adjusted measures and include: Adjusted Cost of goods sold, Adjusted Gross margin, Adjusted Selling and distribution expenses, Adjusted General and administrative expenses, Adjusted Research and development expenses, Adjusted Operating profit Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Profit before tax, Adjusted Finance costs, Adjusted Other expense net, Adjusted Net income: Adjusted Earnings per share shown collectively in the reconciliation to adjusted earnings, below, Adjusted EBITDA defined below, and Cash conversion defined below which exclude the effect of certain cash and non-cash items that Group management believes are not related to the underlying performance of the Group.
These non-IFRS financial measures are also used by management to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal comparison of performance to historical results on a consolidated Group basis.
These measures are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not replace measures of liquidity or financial performance that are derived in accordance with IFRS.
The Group believes these measures are useful supplemental indicators that may be used to assist in evaluating the Groups financial performance on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which the Groups management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items that management does not otherwise believe are indicative of the underlying performance of the consolidated Group may not be excluded when preparing financial measures under IFRS.
Items adjusted for 2017 and 2016 include acquisition-related amortisation, share-based compensation expense arising from pre-IPO employee equity grants and restructuring and other costs primarily related to the Margin Improvement Programme MIP Programme.
In addition, items adjusted in 2016 included costs incurred in connection with the Groups refinancing and initial public offering.
In 2017 the Board approved amendments to its non-IFRS financial measures policy to provide better guidance on which items should be considered.
This follows the conclusion of certain activities in 2017 which related to the IPO and refinancing, or items which are due to finalise in the coming financial year, the latter principally relating to pre-IPO share-based compensation and pre-IPO MIP Programme costs.
This process follows the Groups first full year as a listed company and reflects further consideration of the Groups activities and strategy.
In determining whether an item should be presented as allowable adjustment to IFRS measures, the Group considers items which are significant either because of their size or their nature, and which are non-recurring.
For an item to be considered as allowable adjustment to IFRS measures, it must initially meet at least one of the following criteria: it is a one-off significant item: it has been directly incurred as a result of either an acquisition, divestiture, or arises from termination benefits without condition of continuing employment: or it is unusual in nature e. g. outside the normal course of business.
If an item meets at least one of the criteria, the Group then exercises judgement as to whether the item should be classified as an allowable adjustment to IFRS measures.

Cash conversion The Group believes that cash conversion is a useful supplemental metric that provides a measure of efficiency by which the Group is able to turn profit from operations into cash flow to service the requirements of debt and equity investors, as well as paying for the Groups tax obligations, re-investing in the business for growth and enhancing dividend capacity.
Cash conversion is computed as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA less change in working capital and capital expenditure to Adjusted EBITDA.
The computation of cash conversion for 2017 and 2016 is as follows: 2017 2016 $m $m Adjusted EBITDA 505.0 507.6 Working capital increase 31.9 37.0 PP&E purchases 82.7 66.5 390.4 404.1 Cash conversion 77.3% 79.6% Cash conversion is also computed as the ratio of net cash generated from operating activities adjusted for i cash interest payments, ii cash tax payments, iii payments related to cash-settled AEP and MIP awards, and iv other payments within operating activities, less capital expenditure to Adjusted EBITDA.
The resulting cash conversion figures are the same under either definition.

Additionally, at 31 December 2017, the Group had $192.9 million of availability under the revolving credit facility.
Restricted cash was $5.7 million at 31 December 2017 refer to Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
The Groups primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations.
Historically, the non-elective nature of the Groups product offerings has resulted in significant recurring cash inflows.
In 2017, the Group generated $306.6 million of cash from operating activities.
Significant cash uses in 2017 included i $105.5 million paid in connection with the Woodbury and EuroTec acquisitions, ii capital expenditures of $82.7 million, iii interest payments of $66.5 million, iv income tax payments of $46.9 million, v scheduled 2017 loan amortisation payments of $39.6 million, vi $31.3 million repayment of borrowings assumed in connection with the Woodbury acquisition, vii $10.5 million of accrued costs paid in connection with issue of share capital in October 2016, and viii $9.6 million to fund the Employee Benefit Trust to purchase shares in the Company.
The Groups business may not continue to generate cash flow at current levels and, if it is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its debt, the Group may be required to reduce costs and expenses, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of existing debt or obtain additional financing.
The Group may not be able to complete these initiatives on a timely basis, on satisfactory terms, or at all.
The Groups ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or to refinance its indebtedness depends on the Groups future performance and financial results which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the healthcare industry and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond the Groups control.
The Group believes that the business has characteristics of strong cash flow generation.
The Groups strengths include the recurring, non-discretionary nature of its products, its diverse product offering and geographic footprint, and the strong market position of the Groups leading brands.
The Group believes that its existing cash on hand, combined with the Groups operating cash flow and available borrowings under the credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity to fund current obligations, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as future investment opportunities.

ConvaTec Group Plc 58 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Overview01 Strategic report04 Governance60 Financial statements102 Other information168 Cash interest payments decreased $204.1 million, to $66.5 million in 2017, from $270.6 million in 2016, primarily due to i the redemption in October 2016 of the PIK Notes and the Senior Notes, ii lower interest rates on the Groups credit facilities a result of the October 2016 financing, and iii the payment of commitment fees in 2016.
These decreases were partially offset by incremental interest payments related to the Groups credit facilities, as the first interest payment subsequent to the October 2016 financing was made on 31 March 2017.
The other payments decreased $2.8 million, to $53.1 million in 2017, from $55.9 million in 2016, primarily driven by costs related to our 2016 initial public offering, partially offset by an increase in payments related to service fees associated with MIP-related activities.
The working capital increase of $31.9 million in 2017 was primarily related to the timing of receipts, purchases, and payments in the ordinary course of business.
The working capital increase of $37.0 million in 2016 was primarily related to i an increase in inventory to support franchises through the MIP consolidation of manufacturing facilities and ii timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.
Cash flows from investing activities Net cash used in investing activities increased $118.9 million, to $182.6 million in 2017, from $63.7 million in 2016.
The increase was primarily due to i $105.5 million, in the aggregate, related to the Woodbury and EuroTec acquisitions in 2017 and ii an increase in capital expenditures of $16.2 million mostly related to the additional capacity for the Infusion Device product portfolio and continued investment in the MIP.
These increases were partially offset by $5.7 million received in 2017 from the sale of the Groups former corporate facility located in Skillman, New Jersey.
Cash flows from financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $119.3 million in 2017, compared with net cash generated from financing activities of $4.5 million in 2016, reflecting a decrease of $123.8 million, primarily due to i net proceeds from the issue of share capital of $1,764.3 million in 2016 that did not similarly occur in 2017, ii $31.3 million repayment of borrowings assumed in connection with the Woodbury acquisition, iii $26.3 million of dividend paid, iv $10.5 million of accrued costs paid in connection with issue of share capital in October 2016, and v $9.6 million to fund the Employee Benefit Trust to purchase shares in the Company.
These decreases were partially offset by i $1,699.4 million of net repayments, primarily driven by the redemption in October 2016 of the PIK Notes and the Senior Notes, and the October 2016 financing related to the Groups credit facilities and ii $19.0 million related to the lower deferred financing fees paid in 2017.
