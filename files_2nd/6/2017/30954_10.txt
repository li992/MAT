Just group PLC Annual Report and accounts 2017 24 Financial Review STRONG performance Strong performance reflecting the Groups continued focus on margin and the benefits of synergies achieved post-merger The Financial Review presents the results of the Group on both statutory and pro forma reporting bases.
Just Retirement merged with Partnership to form Just Group at the beginning of April 2016, and the accounting reference date was subsequently changed from 30 June to 31 December.
On a statutory basis, the prior period comparative results are therefore the 18 month period ended 31 December 2016, and include the results of Partnership Assurance Group plc Partnership only for the nine months following the merger.
In order to present information that enables a clearer comparison of results for 2017, the Group has chosen to present additional pro forma financial information for the 12 months ended 31 December 2016 prepared on the basis that the merger between Just Retirement and Partnership had already taken place as at 1 January 2016.
Pro forma information is unaudited.
A reconciliation of pro forma financial information to financial information for the 18 months to 31 December 2016 is given at the end of this section.
Within the Financial Review, the Group has presented a number of alternative performance measures APMs, used in addition to IFRS statutory performance measures.
The Board believes that the use of APMs gives a more representative view of the underlying performance of the Group.
The APMs used by the Group are: Adjusted operating profit new business operating profit, in-force operating profit, underlying before tax operating profit, adjusted operating profit, new business sales, adjusted earnings per share, Group European embedded value and economic capital coverage ratio.
Further information on APMs can be found in the glossary on page 134 together with a reference to where 221m the APM has been reconciled to the nearest statutory equivalent.
2016: pro forma 164m, up 35% Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit is presented in the table opposite with comparative information on a pro forma basis representing the operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2016 for both Just Retirement and Partnership as if they had been merged throughout that period.
The underlying assumptions have been aligned to be consistent across both Group companies.
Adjusted operating profit before tax The increase in adjusted operating profit before tax of 35%, from 163.7m on a pro forma basis for the year ended 31 December 2016, to 220.6m for the year to 31 December 2017, is mainly a reflection of the Groups continued focus on margin over volume, as well as the benefits of the merger synergies.
There has also been a net positive contribution in the current year from the review of the assumptions underlying the calculation of the Groups insurance liabilities.
These have partly been offset by a small increase to the losses and expenses incurred by the Groups non-insurance entities and holding companies, and increased reinsurance and finance costs.
