William Hill PLC 28 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial review This is your first set of results as CFO.
What Q& A are the headlines for you?
Its great to see the business deliver a strong set of results were more confident, more w ith Ruth Prior focused and building momentum again.
Weve worked very hard to return Online Chief Financial Officer to growth and to strengthen our long-term competitiveness.
Theres more were doing but weve made massive strides.
As the market-leading brand in a declining market, to deliver a consistent result is a good outcome.
The US continues to do well and were addressing Australias challenges.
Were much stronger than we were a year ago and looking ahead towards our next opportunities.
Whats behind the difference between your reported and adjusted numbers?
There are some meaty exceptional items that fall into two main areas: addressing historical issues and building the future ofour business.
The first area includes, for instance, impairing the value of our Australia business, which has both underperformed and been meaningfully impacted by regulatory change.
The second includes the transformation programme, referred to as restructuring costs in note 3 to the financial statements, which is underpinning both revenue growth and cost savings that are being reinvested in the business.
What savings has the transformation programme delivered?
We expect to save in excess of 40m a year, which were reinvesting, and the operating cost of the programme will be two times that amount.
But the programme has delivered so many improvements in the business that its benefits are as much about growth and our long-term competitiveness as they are cost savings.
What do you expect from the strategic review ofAustralia?
Were looking at organic opportunities both inside and outside Australia and were considering the potential to merge or sell the business.
With tax headwinds likely in 2019, this business needs more scale, one way or another.

I like to join organisations that have headwinds, but with high quality underlying assets and brands that enable them to regain momentum.
When I joined WilliamHill I was very pleased to see the transformation programme was not the usual cost-cutting exercise, but had focused attention on revenue generation, particularly in the online space.
I also found a team who understood the need for change and the desire to carry it out.
The results of this are beginning to come through.
