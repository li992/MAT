43 PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Principal risks and uncertainties We provide business-critical services to our clients, often in highly regulated environments.
As we grow, our business and our risk environment also become more complex.
It is therefore vital that we effectively identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate the risks we face, and that we continue to evolve our approach to risk management.
We recognise that a number of our principal risks, such as increasing regulation, also create opportunities for us, as we can develop products and services that help our clients to manage their own regulatory burdens.
Information about our risk management framework, including that for our regulated entities, can be found in the Report of the Risk Committee on pages 92 to 97.
