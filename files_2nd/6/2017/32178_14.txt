The hurdles confirmed by the Board in 2015 are for the Group to exceed 20% RONOA and 8% ROS.
The increase in return on sales resulted from improved profitability in the pre-acquisition group, offset by the dilution of lower margin acquisitions.
ROCE at 15.1% remains at a robust level, ahead of RPCs weighted average cost of capital.
Free cash flow is higher than last year mainly as a result of increased adjusted operating profit.
