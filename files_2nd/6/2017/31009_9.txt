"Financial review In a year of challenge and change, the Group delivered its first improvement in underlying operating profit in three years, including the benefit of property profits. """

We see considerable potential for a significant improvement in operational and financial performance and are working hard to ensure effective delivery.

These policies are reviewed and approved by the Board ona regular basis.
It is Group policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
FUNDING OF OPERATIONS SIG finances its operations through a mixture of Shareholders equity, bank funding, private placement and other borrowings.
A small proportion of SIGs assets are funded using fixed rate finance lease contracts.
The Groups net debt is made up of the followingcategories: 2016 2017 Restated m m Obligations under finance lease contracts 9.9 11.2 Bank overdrafts 29.6 22.7 Bank loans 84.2 171.9 Private placement notes 204.2 200.7 Loan notes and deferred consideration 17.0 2.7 Derivative financial instruments liabilities 3.5 3.8 Total 348.4 413.0 Derivative financial instruments assets 1.3 4.5 Gross debt after derivative financial assets 347.1 408.5 Cash on deposit restated 121.8 127.0 Other financial assets 1.1 Deferred consideration 1.5 0.7 Net debt 223.8 279.7 This reconciles to net debt used for covenant calculations as follows: 2017 2016 'm 'm Net debt 223.8 279.7 Other covenant financial indebtedness 11.8 3.5 Foreign exchange adjustment 1.5 6.4 Covenant net debt 234.1 276.8 The Groups gross financial liabilities can be further analysed as follows: 2017 2017 2016 2016 m % m % Gross financial liabilities with a maturity profile of greater than five years 141.7 40.8% 136.3 33.4% Gross financial liabilities held on an unsecured basis 336.8 97.0% 396.6 97.1% Details of derivative financial instruments are shown in Note 19 of the Financial Statements on pages 140 to 143.
36 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25690-AR2017 15-03-18 Proof Six MANAGEMENT OF TREASURY RISKS Treasury risk management incorporates liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk, counterparty credit risk and the risk of breaching debt covenants.
These specific risks, and the Groups management of them, are detailed below.
LIQUIDITY RISK AND DEBT FACILITIES Liquidity risk is the risk that SIG is unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
In order to mitigate the risk of not being able to meet its financial obligations, SIGseeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure, using a mixture of sources of funding in order to prevent over-reliance on any single provider.
The key sources of finance are private placement note investors, being mainly US-based pension funds, and principal bank debt.
In addition the Group commenced non-recourse factoring during the year.
The maturity profile of the Groups debt facilities at 31 December 2017 is as follows: Facility Amount Amount amount drawn undrawn m m m Date of expiry Bank debt 350.0 78.0 272.0 May 2021 Private placement loan notes 20.0 20.0 November 2018 Private placement loan notes 26.7 26.7 October 2020 Private placement loan notes 17.8 17.8 October 2021 Private placement loan notes 44.4 44.4 October 2023 Private placement loan notes 94.2 94.2 August 2026 553.1 281.1 272.0 SIG has no immediate refinancing requirements, and can repay the 20.0m of Private Placement loan notes maturing in November 2018 through existing resources.
SIG has sufficient funding headroom with existing facilities to support its medium term plans.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Groups interest costs in respect of its borrowings will increase in the event of rising interest rates.
To reduce this risk the Group monitors its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and enters into derivative financial instruments to manage this mix where appropriate.
SIG has a policy of aiming to fix between 50% and 75% of its average net debt over the medium term.
The percentage of net debt on an average basis at fixed rates of interest at 31 December 2017 is 81% 2016: 73% and on a gross debt basis is 75% 2016: 60%, which is within the Groups targeted medium term range.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK INCOME STATEMENT SIG has a number of overseas businesses whose revenues and costs are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
57% of SIGs 2017 underlying revenues 2016: 54% were in foreign currencies, being primarily Euros and Polish Zloty.
Less than 3% of SIGs sales and purchases are cross-currency.
When cross-currency transactions occur, it is SIGs policy to eliminate currency exposure at that time through forward currency contracts, if the exposure is considered to be material.
SIG faces a translation risk in respect of the local currencies of its primary foreign operations, principally being Euro and Polish Zloty revenues and profits.
SIG does not hedge the income statement translational risk arising from these income streams.
SIG also faces a translation risk from the US Dollar in respect of interest on its private placement borrowings.
This risk has been eliminated through the use of cross-currency swaps, which swap the US Dollar private placement debt into Euros.
com Stock code: SHI 25690-AR2017 15-03-18 Proof Six STRATEGIC REPORT Financial review Treasury risk management BALANCE SHEET The Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Group is inherently at risk from movements in the Sterling value of its net investments in foreign businesses and the Sterling value of its foreign currency net debt.
For currencies where the Group has significant balance sheet translational risk, SIG seeks to mitigate this risk by holding financial liabilities and derivatives in the same currency to partially hedge the net investment values.
The Groups policy is that for currencies where a material balance sheet translational exposure exists, the Group will hold financial liabilities in that particular currency in proportion to the overall Group ratio of net debt to capital employed.
SIG had the following net debt denominated in foreign currencies, held partially to hedge the assets of overseas businesses including cash and cash equivalents : 2017 2017 2016 Local Sterling Sterling currency net equivalent equivalent borrowings borrowings borrowings cash cash cash LCm m m Euro 163.9 145.6 152.7 PLN 81.8 17.4 14.6 Other currencies multiple 1.5 8.2 Total 129.7 146.3 % of net debt 58% 52% Euro net debt at 31 December 2017 represented 65.1% of Group net debt 2016: 54.6%.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS IN 2017 The overall impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the Groups Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet is disclosed on page 35 ofthis Strategic Report.
COMMODITY RISK The nature of the Groups operations creates an ongoing demand for fuel and therefore the Group is exposed to movements in market fuel prices.
The Group enters into commodity derivative instruments to hedge such exposure where it makes commercial and economic sense to do so.
In 2015 the Group entered into four commodity derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the UK, Polish and French fuel requirements for 2015 and 2016.
At 31 December 2016 these commodity derivative instruments had matured, and the Group has not entered into any further commodity derivative instruments.
COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK SIG holds significant investment assets, being principally cash deposits andderivative assets.
Strict policies are in place in order to minimise counterparty credit risk associated with these assets.
A list of approved deposit counterparties is maintained.
Counterparty credit limits, based on published credit ratings and CDS spreads, are in place.
These limits, and the position against these limits, are reviewed and reported on a monthly basis.
Sovereign credit ratings are also monitored, and country limits for investment assets are in place.
If necessary, funds are repatriated to the UK.
38 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 25690-AR2017 15-03-18 Proof Six DEBT COVENANTS The Companys debt facilities in place at 31 December 2017 contained a number of covenants to which the Group must adhere.
The Groups debt covenants are tested at 30 June and 31 December each year, with the key financial covenants being leverage and interest cover.
The ratio for each of the debt covenants is set out below: Year Year ended ended 31 December 31 December 2016 Requirement 2017 Restated 1 Consolidated net worth 400m 476.8m 538.5m 2 Interest cover ratio 3.0x 5.0x 6.2x 3 Leverage ratio 3.0x 1.9x 2.4x 1.
The consolidated net worth covenant is applicable to the private placement debt only.
Covenant interest cover is the ratio of the previous 12 months underlying operating profit including thetrading losses and profits associated with divested businesses to net financing costs excluding pension scheme finance income and finance costs.
Covenant leverage is the ratio of closing net debt at average exchange rates to the underlying operating profit before depreciation, adjusted if applicable for the impact of acquisitions and disposals during the previous 12 months EBITDA.
Detailed calculations of the interest cover ratio and leverage can be found in Note 32 of the Financial Statements on pages 158 to 164.
As can be seen in the table above, the Group is in compliance with its financial covenants and has a reasonable level of headroom.
The 2017 year end headline financial leverage has decreased as a result of short term prioritised actions undertaken by the Company, but is still above the Groups medium term target of below 1.0x.
Going forward, the Group will continue to prioritise leverage reduction by more tightly focusing on its cash generation, moderating capital expenditure and suspending its infill acquisition programme.
The Group is expecting leverage to increase at 30 June 2018 over the 1.9x reported at 31 December 2017 due to normal seasonal working capital patterns.
VIABILITY STATEMENT In accordance with the requirements of the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code the Code, the Directors confirm that they have performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Details of the risk identification and management process and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are included in this Strategic Report on pages 42 to 45.
As such, the key factors affecting the Groups prospects are: Market positions: SIG retains top three positions in its core business, which will continue to offer sustainable positions over the medium term.
Specialist business model: SIG is focused on specialist distribution and merchanting of specialist products for our business customers.
A defined product focus means SIG occupies a key supply niche, partnering both suppliers and customers to add value.
Sales mix: A diversified portfolio of products, market sectors and geographies means SIG has a resilient underlying portfolio of customers, and as a result, competitors, diversifying the risk around sales for the Group.
The Board has determined that a three-year period to 31 December 2020 is the most appropriate time period for its viability review.
This period has been selected since it gives the Board sufficient visibility into the future, due to industry characteristics, business cycle and the tenor of existing financing, to make a realistic viability assessment.
This aligns with the turnaround plans for the business.
