Both periods were constrained somewhat by the corporate risk management decision in Q2 2016 to economically hedge a portion of future coal sales, effectively locking in H1 2016 pricing, resulting in an opportunity cost of $380 million 2016: $980 million realised in 2017.

The resulting joint venture has been presented on a proportionate consolidation basis in this analysis, hence the apparent year over year reductions reflecting the changed ownership interest.
Underlying performance was within expectations in a difficult trading environment, characterised by relatively low prices and volatility, which limited arbitrage opportunities.
Portfolio changes reflected the addition of a sugarcane mill in Brazil, adding 50% to crushed volumes, and the sale of our farming assets in Ukraine.
