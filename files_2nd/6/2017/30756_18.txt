ITP Aero Underlying revenue 2017 IFRS 15: 13,682m 2017: 273m 2017 IFRS 15: 827m 2018 outlook: Mid single-digit growth 2018 outlook: 450m - 100m 2018 outlook: Double-digit growth Underlying operating profit Underlying operating profit 2017 IFRS 15: 321m 2017 IFRS 15: 75m 2018 outlook: 400m 100m 2018 outlook: Modest decline 2018 outlook Double-digit revenue growth driven We are confident 2018 will be a year of good progress.
Organic revenue should grow mid-single digit, with underlying operating profit of around 400m excluding ITP Aero by strong increase in delivery volumes around 450m including ITP Aero.
Free cash flow should improve to around 450m on civil programmes excluding ITP Aero, around 400m including ITP Aero.
We are making solid progress Margin contraction driven by mix with longer-term solutions for Trent 1000 and Trent 900 in-service issues, largely through change.
Lower volumes of higher re-designing affected parts, and we expect these to be fully embodied on the Trent 1000 margin defence engines with strong fleet by 2022.
On the Trent 900, an extended life turbine blade is already being rolled-out growth in less profitable civil engines with further re-designs available from 2020.
Based on our current estimates, in 2018 the Cash outflow 70m-80m as a result anticipated annual cash impact is expected to broadly double and reach a peak.
It is then of investments and contributions to expected to fall by around 100m in 2019.
The majority of this work will be undertaken in third party programmes.
Cash flow 2018 and 2019 and is not expected to complete until 2022.
All of these costs are included expected to move closer to breakeven in our cash flow guidance for 2018 and beyond.
in 2019 Group figures are after inclusion of commercial marine and other eliminations 2017: revenue 779m and loss 119m.
