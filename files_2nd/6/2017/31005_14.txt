Chief Financial Officers review A solid and sustainable performance, built on a strong and flexible balance sheet Stephen Bennett Strategic highlights Chief Financial Officer Solid and sustainable profits growth driven by acquisitions, unit margins and fx Consistently strong operating cash flows Record investment in growth capex Strong and flexible balance sheet, allowing us to invest in organic and inorganic growth Overview 2017 has been another progressive year for the Group with solid growth and the successful integrations of PAC Dispersions acquired in 2016 and Speciality Additives acquired in 2017.
The key drivers behind the improvement in overall performance were: ENA saw good Underlying profit growth as volumes and unit margins increased.
ARW performed in line with expectations, with stable Nitrile latex margins relative to the final quarter of 2016.
Speciality Additives, a 66.1m bolt-on acquisition, completed and was integrated into the Group.
The integration of PAC Dispersions was substantially completed and on target to deliver the $12m run rate synergies by end of 2018 with a further incremental $2m run rate synergies to be delivered by the end of 2019.
The disposal of our Leuna Germany site and the announcement of the restructuring of our Ribcourt France site were the last significant steps in the integration.
The continuing weakness of Sterling has resulted in a positive impact on the Groups reported results, albeit this mainly related to H1.
Alternative performance measures The Group has consistently used two significant Alternative Performance Measures APMs since its adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in 2005: Underlying performance, which excludes Special Items from IFRS profit measures EBITDA, which excludes Special Items, amortisation and depreciation from IFRS operating profit Strategic report The Boards view is that Underlying performance provides additional clarity for the Groups investors and so it is the primary focus of the Groups narrative reporting.
Further information and the reconciliation to the IFRS measures are included in notes 2, 5 and 6.
Income statement Operating profit The table below bridges the 2016 and 2017 IFRS operating profit, showing the improvement in the existing businesses, the impact of the 2017 acquisition of Speciality Additives, the impact of the weakness of Sterling on translation, and the effect of the Special Items.

ARW Nitrile latex volumes were in line with the prior year and margins were robust and broadly in line with Q4 2016.
Further operational investment in the PAC Chonburi Thailand site has been made in 2017, impacting Underlying operating profit.
Underlying unallocated corporate costs increased by 1.4m reflecting the increase in the cost of share-based payments due to the rise in share price during 2017 and the crystallisation of the outcome of strategic targets, and further strengthening of the management team in the London Head Office.
The continuing weakness of Sterling during the year resulted in an increase in the Groups reported profit in Sterling.
For the European businesses, the rate used for translating profit moved from 1:1.2180 in 2016 to 1:1.1430 in 2017, with a resulting uplift in the 2017 ENA profit of 4.1m.

A further 1.6m related to the cost of an onerous lease on a site closed during 2017, while 0.8m comprised costs for the post-acquisition integration of Speciality Additives.
The profit on sale of business relates to the disposal of our South African business in 2016.
The profit on sale of land in 2017 related to a disposal of land in Hapton, UK.
The profit on sale of land in 2016 related to the disposal of tranches of Malaysian land.
The gain of 13.1m in 2016 resulted from foreign exchange contracts taken out as a hedge against the US dollar purchase consideration of the PAC Dispersions acquisition.
Acquisition costs were incurred in relation to Speciality Additives 2016: PAC Dispersions and for other potential acquisitions which will not occur or had not occurred before the balance sheet date.
The amortisation of intangibles increased during 2017 due to a full year of amortisation for the 2016 PAC Dispersions acquisition, the intangibles acquired with Speciality Additives and due to foreign currency exchange rate movements.

It is therefore helpful to consider the underlying and Special Items separately: The effective tax rate on Underlying performance has reduced slightly in the year due to prior year adjustments and changes in overseas tax rates.
The effective tax rate for Special Items is principally driven by the deferred tax credit on the amortisation of acquired intangibles.

This company and its subsidiaries is now a relatively minor part of the Group and hence the non-controlling interests impact on the Underlying performance is not significant.
The Special Item in 2016 reflects the non-controlling interests share 30% in the land sale referred to in the Special Items section above.
The land was owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, a 100% subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd.

The changes in Underlying and IFRS earnings per share shown in the table is therefore driven predominantly by the same factors that influence the change in profit before taxation and taxation described above.
Cash performance The consolidated cash flow statement shows a modest increase in cash generated from operations, from 157.0m in 2016 to 162.6m in 2017.
After other operating, investing and financing cash flows, cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts increased by 10.7m 2016: 43.9m.
The Groups primary focus is on managing net borrowings rather than on cash.
The following summarises the movement in net borrowings and is in the format used by management: 2017 2016 m m Underlying operating profit before joint ventures 138.0 128.2 Movement in working capital 9.5 10.2 Depreciation and amortisation underlying 37.2 29.9 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 60.3 45.6 Business cash flow 124.4 122.7 Interest paid net 4.8 3.3 Tax paid 26.1 17.1 IAS 19 Interest charge 4.3 4.5 Pension funding in excess of IAS 19 charge 12.5 12.4 Share based payments variance to IFRS2 charge 0.3 1.6 Non-controlling interest and joint venture dividends 1.5 1.1 Underlying operating cash flow 77.9 85.9 Cash impact of restructuring 6.0 5.5 Sale of property, plant and equipment 2.2 34.4 Purchase of business 66.2 156.7 Sale of business 7.6 12.8 Dividends paid 39.1 30.3 Foreign exchange and other movements 6.6 13.5 Movement in net borrowings 30.2 72.9 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 41 Chief Financial Officers review continued Due to the continued strong cash performance of the Group, the Business cash flow at 124.4m 2016: 122.7m has remained stable, despite a 14.7m increase in expenditure on property, plant and equipment.
Further commentary on the other significant cash flows is provided below.
Working capital control remained a key focus of Group management, demonstrated by achieving a cash inflow in a year of organic growth and rising raw material prices.
The increase in capital expenditure, which is largely being invested in our plants, reflects the cash spend on the previously announced Nitrile latex capacity increase in Pasir Gudang Malaysia 15m, and the made-to-order speciality acrylic lines in Worms Germany of 8m.
The rise in cash tax payments of 9m primarily reflects payments in respect of acquisitions in 2016 and 2017 of 4m and higher payments on account, principally in Italy and Germany of 6m.
The amount shown as pension funding in excess of IAS19 charge mainly reflects the UK defined benefit deficit recovery funding of 14.7m 2016: 14.5m.
The outflow for purchase of business of 66.2m primarily relates to the acquisition of Speciality Additives.
The prior year outflow of 156.7m mainly relates to the purchase of PAC Dispersions.
The business sale proceeds of 7.6m is the amount received ahead of the year end on the disposal of Synthomer Leuna GmbH, as disclosed in note 37.
The prior year proceeds of 12.8m related to the net cash consideration received on the disposal of our South African business.
Substantial amounts of the Groups borrowings have been maintained in Euros and US dollars as a natural hedge against the net asset base in these two currencies.
With the devaluation of Sterling referred to above, the translation at the year end rates has resulted in an exchange loss and therefore a higher borrowings amount offset by a corresponding increase in the net asset base in these currencies.
Financing and liquidity The Group retains the use of a committed revolving credit facility of 370m, sourced from five banks.
This facility provided the necessary funds to complete the acquisition of Speciality Additives, while maintaining substantial headroom.
An additional committed short term bank loan facility of 55m 48.9m was entered into in November 2017, to provide extra liquidity in anticipation of the BASF Pischelsdorf SBR business acquisition on 31 January 2018, for an enterprise value of 30m.
2017 2016 m m Committed facilities 418.9 370.0 Drawn at 31 December 246.7 203.9 Headroom 172.2 166.1 In addition to the facility headroom identified above, the Group had cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2017 of 89.6m 2016: 117.4m offset by overdrafts of 24.2m 2016: 65.4m.
The principal financial covenant in the revolving credit facility remains that net borrowings must be less than 3.0 times EBITDA at 31 December 2017.
2017 2016 m m Net borrowings 180.5 150.3 EBITDA 176.2 160.1 Net borrowings EBITDA 1.0 0.9 The significant facility and covenant headroom demonstrates the continued financial strength of the Group, which is well positioned to fund future organic growth and take advantage of further bolt-on acquisitions.

The following should be noted: The overseas pension cost has increased due to the PAC Dispersions and Speciality Additives acquisitions.
The UK pension cost has increased, mainly due to an increase in net interest expense in the defined benefit scheme.
The reduction in UK defined benefit pension liabilities of 34.2m primarily relates to an improvement in mortality actuarial assumptions 18.5m, pension scheme deficit recovery payment of 14.7m, offset by a reduction in the discount rate from 2.7% to 2.5% 11.4m.
Acquisition and disposal accounting The accounting for the acquisition of Speciality Additives and the disposal of Synthomer Leuna GmbH are shown in the notes 31 and 37 respectively.
For the acquisition, the assets and liabilities have been included at fair value with the balance of consideration shown as goodwill.
KPMG LLP were engaged to advise on the fair value of the Property, Plant and Equipment PPE.
Overall their conclusion was that the total fair value of the PPE should be increased by 4.8m.
KPMG LLP also performed a valuation of the intangibles, which mainly comprised customer relationships.
Accordingly, on acquisition the Group recognised goodwill and acquired intangibles of 24.1m and 41.4m respectively and the valuation is now final.
These intangibles are being amortised over periods of 5 to 14 years.
Post balance sheet events On 1 January 2018, the Group sold Synthomer Leuna GmbH, comprising the assets of a plant in Germany for a profit of 1.5m.
On 31 January 2018, the Group completed the purchase of the BASF Pischelsdorf SBR business and assets, for 29.3m.
The purchase consideration was funded from the Groups existing financial resources.
