FinAnCiAl reVieW overview This year we have delivered a set of results which demonstrate the underlying robustness of our business.
Revenue is lower than last year despite flat volumes reflecting the deflationary environment that existed for much of the last two years.
However, milk and butter input costs rose significantly as the year progressed.
Despite this highly volatile background we improved profit margins.
Continuing operations revenue We continue to provide product group analysis consistent with prior years to assist the users of the financial statements although the Group operated as one segment throughout 2017.

Despite sales volumes across our four key brands remaining broadly flat, the Group faced price deflation in the first half which only partially reversed in the second half of the year.
Cheese and whey revenue fell by 8.9 million 3.4% with decreased sales volumes and prices.
Revenue in butters, spreads and oils fell by 1.9 million 1.2% as price deflation across spreads and butter in the first half of the year more than offset the second half recovery and the strong value and volume growth in Frylight.
Other revenue comprised warehousing and distribution services provided to third parties.

This valuation will determine future cash contributions and will replace the existing funding plan which has cash contributions for 2017 18 of 17.2 million.

Cash flow The business generates strong operating cash flows.
However, the year saw a number of one-off items in the form of final payments associated with the sale of the Dairies business and high levels of exceptional commissioning costs at Davidstow.
In the year ended 31 March 2017 cash generated from operations was 32.8 million 2016: 31.3 million.
Operating cash flow was impacted by a 6.1 million increase in working capital 2016: 14.0 million reduction.
This reflected higher stocks of demineralised whey and lower levels of creditors.
Exceptional cash costs of 25.6 million 2016: 17.6 million relate principally to the commissioning of the demineralised whey and GOS plants at Davidstow.
This commissioning is now substantially complete.

This reflects the completion of the projects at Davidstow.
Capital expenditure next year is expected to be similar to this year.
Proceeds from depot disposals were 4.5 million 2016: 5.4 million.
In addition the Group received 37.9 million from the sale of some of the assets at Davidstow relating to GOS and demineralised whey, which were subsequently leased back on operating lease terms.
