Pepsi, led by no-sugar MAX, was the main driver of growth and increased its market volume and value share in a competitive cola category.
R Whites launched a premium range in 2017, leveraging its heritage credentials and a new formulation, and delivered revenue growth of over 12%.
ARP increased, in part due to the implementation of new promotional price points in the off-trade.
In addition, a 10% increase in revenue from on-the-go consumption packs had a positive impact on price mix.
Margins were impacted by increased A&P investment, cost and foreign exchange pressures as well as increased sourcing of product from Ireland as we managed through our line changes in the supply chain.
The second half of the year benefited from the changes we made to our price and promotions framework in the first half.

This occurs as we operate a 52-week accounting calendar rather than a 365-day calendar, resulting in an additional week in 2016.
As a result, this financial year is a 52-week period ending on 1 October 2017.
To ensure consistent and comparable reporting the additional week has been excluded from the last year segmental analysis included within this report.
com Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information GB stills revenue declined in the year, primarily due to price deflation in Robinsons in a competitive squash category.
Robinsons volume was marginally down in the year, reflecting a weaker final quarter against a strong comparative last year.
J20 also declined in the year as it transitioned to new promotional price points in the off-trade.
Whilst the Fruit Shoot brand was flat, the focus on the Hydro variant resulted in further growth as it captured an increased share of the flavoured water category.
The recently launched Robinsons Refreshd generated 4m retail sales value in its first 19 weeks, broadening the penetration of the brand into on-the-go consumption occasions.

The continued focus on the branded portfolio generated a 5% increase in branded revenue, partly offset by a decline in private label.
The consolidation of buying groups has continued to create challenges, particularly in syrups category pricing, although pricing improvements were realised in juice in order to protect profitability.
Pressade and Fruit Shoot continued to deliver growth, more than offsetting the decline in private label and the subdued syrups performance.
However, the weaker performance in the last quarter combined with increased A&P investment and cost pressures, resulted in a reduction in brand contribution on a constant currency basis, with the growth in juice further impacting margins.

Owned brand growth was led by the stills portfolio and the range of low and no-sugar products we offer.
Counterpoint benefited from an improved offering across its alcohol and snacks range, as well as a benefit from the acquisition of East Coast earlier in the year.
The margin decrease is a result of the substantial growth in the sale of third party brands in the wholesale business which only generate a distribution margin.

The underlying organic, constant currency performance was impacted by the well-publicised macro-economic challenges in the country.
Despite these challenges, brand contribution increased and performance towards the end of the financial year was more encouraging.
But the environment remains difficult and the short-term outlook uncertain.
The brand contribution increase resulted from our focus on protecting margins in the short-term through price realisation to offset cost inflation despite increased investment in the long-term growth drivers of the business.

Chief Executive Officer Risk management process 28 November 2017 As with any business we face risks and uncertainties.
We believe that effective risk management supports the successful delivery of our strategic objectives.
The management of these risks is based on a balance of risk and reward determined through assessment of the likelihood and impact as well as the companys risk appetite.
The Executive team performs a formal robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company annually, which is reviewed by the Board.
Similarly, all business units and functions perform formal annual risk assessments that consider the companys principal risks and specific local risks relevant to the market in which they operate.
Risks are monitored throughout the year with consideration to internal and external factors, the companys risk appetite and updates to risks and mitigation plans are made as required.
The principal risks that could potentially have a significant impact on our business in the future are set out on pages 29 to 32.
