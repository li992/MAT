The financial information prepared for, and reviewed by, management and the Board is on a non IFRS basis and therefore differs from the IFRS financial statements on pages 114 to 162.
The Groups profit before tax on an IFRS basis was above last year at 252.4m 2016: 158.8m, driven by a high level of capital gains increasing IC profits.

The adjustments can be summarised as follows: CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES IFRS deems the Group to control funds where it can make significant decisions that can substantially affect the variable returns of investors.
There are 12 credit funds and CLOs required to be consolidated under this definition of control.
This has the impact of including the assets and liabilities of these funds in the consolidated statement of financial position and to recognise interest income and gains or losses on investments in the consolidated income statement.
The Group is not exposed to the liabilities and cannot access the assets of these entities except for the investment made by the Group into these structured funds.
Financial information prepared for internal reporting purposes includes the fair value of the balance sheet investment in the statement of financial position, and includes the management fee and dividend income received from these entities in the income statement.
This is consistent with the treatment of the CLOs for regulatory reporting purposes.
OTHER ENTITIES There are two entities, Nomura ICG KK and Questus Energy Pty Limited, where the presentation in the IFRS financial statements is different to the internal reporting.
The Groups 50% share of the revenue and costs from Nomura ICG KK are included on a line by line basis in the income statement for internal reporting purposes.
These items are collapsed into a single line in the IFRS financial statements to reflect its status as a jointly controlled entity.
For Questus Energy Pty Limited, the costs are included on a line by line basis in the income statement for internal reporting purposes whereas in the IFRS financial statements these are collapsed into a single line, administrative expenses, to reflect its status as a non-controlled entity.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 21 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RECLASSIFICATION OF INCOME The Group invests in its European mezzanine, Asia Pacific mezzanine and North American Private Debt strategies either through a fund structure or directly into the underlying assets, depending on the fund.
This impacts the presentation of the income statement for investments in debt instruments under IFRS.
For those investments made directly, the Group generates interest income and is subject to impairment risk, whereas for the investments made through a fund structure the income is recognised as a net gain on investment.
Regardless of the investment mechanics the performance of the investment is reviewed and managed at an asset level.
As such internal financial information is presented on an asset by asset basis for all European mezzanine, Asia Pacific mezzanine and North American Private Debt strategies.
This is presentational only and has no impact on the profit of the Group.
OTHER The Group excludes the fair value movement on derivatives from its internally reported numbers until such time as the derivative settles and is matched in the income statement against the item that was hedged.
In the prior year, the increase in deferred consideration relating to the purchase of ICG Longbow and the impact of the Employee Benefit Trust EBT were excluded for internal reporting purposes.
The Board believes that presenting the financial information in this review on a non GAAP basis assists shareholders in assessing the delivery of the Groups strategy through its financial performance, consistent with the approach taken by management and the Board.
Non GAAP measures are denoted by throughout this review.
The definition, and where appropriate, reconciliation to a GAAP measure is included in the Glossary on page 163.
OVERVIEW The Groups adjusted profit before tax, when excluding the impact of the fair value charge on derivatives, was above last year at 237.5m 2016: 175.6m.
This was driven by a high level of capital gains increasing IC profits.
We continue to make strong operational progress in developing our fund management franchise, with higher management fee income from new and existing strategies contributing to higher FMC profits in the year.

Throughout this review all numbers are presented excluding this adjusting item, unless otherwise stated.
The effective tax rate for the period at 15% 2016: 11% is higher than the prior year due principally to the mix of jurisdictions in which capital gains were generated.
The tax rate is lower than the standard corporation tax rate of 20%.
This is principally due to the impact of differences in overseas tax rates where we invest directly into funds which are based offshore.
Based on the adjusted profit above, the Group generated an ROE of 18.2% 2016: 12.9%, an increase on prior year reflecting lower shareholder funds following the 200m special dividend paid in August and strong capital gains.
Capital gains of 201.4m 2016: 128.6m have, as expected, benefited from the one-off recycling of previously unrealised gains of 54.4m from reserves, primarily on the disposal of the remainder of AAS Link, and a robust level of unrealised capital gains arising from the year end mark to market review.
The recycling of realised gains from reserves is an accounting requirement for pre 2011 equity assets.
Excluding the recycled capital gains, the ROE for the financial year was 13.3% which is more indicative of the performance for the new financial year and longer term trend.
Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 69.3p 2016: 48.1p.
The Group had net current assets of 594.1m 2016: 229.8m at the end of the year.
The increase in net current assets is principally driven by the realisation of balance sheet assets increasing the year end cash balance.
Fund Management Company In this review we have aligned the presentation of financial information with the four strategic asset classes in which we operate corporate investments, capital market investments, real asset investments and secondary investments to simplify and enhance the understanding of our financial performance.
The principal difference between this classification and that previously adopted is that the Senior Debt Partners strategy falls within the corporate investments asset class whereas all other funds previously reported as credit funds fall within the capital market investments asset class.
22 ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 BUSINESS MARKETPLACE GROUP GROUP RESOURCES & MODEL & STRATEGY PERFORMANCE RISKS RELATIONSHIPS FINANCE AND OPERATING CONTINUED Assets under management A key measure of the success of our strategy to generate value from our fund management business is our ability to grow assets under management.
New AUM inflows is our best lead indicator to sustainable future fee streams and therefore increasing sustainable profits.
In the year to 31 March 2017, the net impact of fundraising and realisations saw third party AUM increased 13% to 21.8bn.
AUM by strategic asset class is detailed below, where all figures are quoted in m.

In the year we closed our third Asia Pacific fund at 614m, including a $200m commitment from the balance sheet and 189m of third party money raised during the financial year.
This was below its target size as the slowdown in growth in China had an impact on the region.
During the year Recovery Fund 2008 sold its remaining assets to a new secondary fund which is managed by the Group.
The new fund raised commitments totalling 638m in the year.
Additionally, we raised 351m from segregated mandates into our Senior Debt Partners strategy and 283m for our Australian Senior Loans Fund, the first third party money raised for this strategy.
Capital Market Investments Capital Market Investments third party funds under management have increased 33% to 6.2bn, with new third party AUM of 1,635m raised in the year, primarily from our CLO programme.
During the year we completed four CLOs, two in Europe and two in the US, raising a total 1,567m, including 85m committed from the balance sheet to meet regulatory requirements, thereby further increasing the operating leverage of this strategy.
We raised 153m across our other capital market investments strategies, including alternative credit and total credit.
Real Asset Investments Real Asset Investments third party funds under management have remained at 3.3bn, with new AUM of 345m raised in the year for our UK real estate fund, ICG Longbow Fund IV.
The additional money raised in the current year has contributed to the fund reaching its maximum size of 1.0bn, including a 50m co-investment from the IC, and making it our second successive UK real estate fund to reach that milestone.
Secondary Investments Secondary Investments third party funds under management have increased 65% to 1.6bn, with new AUM of 571m raised in the period for our Strategic Secondaries strategy.
A final close is expected shortly which would take the fund above its target size of $1bn, including a $200m commitment from the balance sheet.
Fee earning AUM The investment rate for our Senior Debt Partners strategy, Real Estate funds and North American Private Debt Fund has a direct impact on FMC income as fees are charged on an invested capital basis.
The total amount of third party capital deployed on behalf of the direct investment funds was 3.1bn in the year compared to 2.4bn in the last financial year.

Performance fees are an integral recurring part of the fee income profile and profitability stream of the Group.
Third party fees are 78% denominated in Euros or US dollars.
The Groups policy is to hedge non Sterling fee income, to the extent that it is not matched by costs and is predictable.
Therefore the impact of the devaluation of Sterling will be partially felt in both the 2017 and 2018 financial years.
Total fee income included an 8.1m FX benefit in the year.
The weighted average fee rate, excluding performance fees, across our fee earning AUM is 0.91% 2016: 0.88%.
This slight increase is due to fund mix and reflects the impact of raising the higher fee earning Asia Pacific mezzanine and Strategic Secondaries funds during the year.
Dividend income Dividend receipts of 23.2m 2016: 19.3m are higher than prior year due to the increased number and improved performance of CLOs.
Operating expenses Operating expenses of the FMC were 105.7m 2016: 85.0m, including salaries and incentive scheme costs.
The devaluation of Sterling has had a more immediate impact on the cost base where 15% of costs are Euro denominated and 16% US dollar denominated.
Costs are 4.7m higher in the year due to FX.
Salaries were 39.0m 2016: 30.4m as average headcount increased 11% from 215 to 238.
This increase is directly related to investing in our capital market investments strategies, the ICG Enterprise Trust team and our operations infrastructure.
Incentive scheme costs of 33.8m 2016: 24.5m are higher as a consequence of strong performance.
Other administrative costs have increased to 32.9m 2016: 30.1m as a result of increased occupancy and IT costs in the current year and the full year impact of ICG Enterprise Trusts administrator costs.

In the period 276.0m was invested alongside our corporate investments strategies for new and follow on investments.
Of the remaining 90.0m, 67.9m was invested in CLOs in accordance with regulatory requirements and 20.6m in our Strategic Secondaries strategy.
The Sterling value of the portfolio increased by 146.4m due to FX movements.
The portfolio is 43% Euro denominated and 32% US dollar denominated.
Sterling denominated assets account only for 15% of the portfolio.
The Group minimises the FX impact of non-Sterling assets through asset liability management and derivative transactions.
The balance sheet investment portfolio is weighted towards the higher returning asset classes as detailed below: As at As at 31 March 2017 31 March 2016 Return profile m % of total m % of total Corporate Investments 15-20% 1,120 66% 1,305 72% Capital Market Investments 5-10% 333 19% 264 15% Real Asset Investments c10% 107 6% 125 7% Secondary Investments 15-20% 152 9% 104 6% Total balance sheet portfolio 1,712 100% 1,798 100% In addition, 89.7m 2016: 182.6m of current assets are held on the balance sheet with the intention of being transferred to third party funds once their fundraising is complete.
The use of the balance sheet in this way enables our investment teams to continue to source attractive deals whilst a fund is being raised, and in turn facilitates the fundraising as potential investors can see the types of assets they will be investing in.
At 31 March 2017, 86% of these assets related to our real estate and alternative credit strategies.
