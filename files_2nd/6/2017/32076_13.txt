Non-GAAP performance measures In response to the issuance of the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures APMs issued by the European Securities and Markets Authorities ESMA in June 2015, the Group has sought to explain further the non-GAAP measures used by the Group to measure and communicate performance in the 2016 17 Annual Report.
The Group uses certain key non-GAAP measures in order to provide an additional view of the Groups overall performance and position, eliminating significant unusual or non-operational items that may obscure understanding of the key trends and position.
These measures are used internally to evaluate business performance, as a key constituent of the Groups planning process, as well as comprising targets against which compensation is determined.
Reporting of non-GAAP measures alongside reported measures is considered useful to enable investors to understand how management evaluates performance and value creation internally, enabling them to track the Groups adjusted performance and the key business drivers which underpin it.
Note 32 to the consolidated financial statements further explains the use of non-GAAP performance measures.
