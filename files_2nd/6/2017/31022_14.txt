FINANCIAL REVIEW Delivering consistent financial results Comparative financial information The comparison of the financial results for the twelve-months Summary ended 31 December 2017 with those of the previously reported period is distorted by a number of factors: the Skyepharma merger Reported revenue of 148.0m, in line which took place part-way through 2016: the subsequent change withexpectations: underlying revenues of the accounting reference date which had the effect of shortening grew 4.0% driven by the Groups key the prior period to nine-months: and, as expected, significantly lower revenues from non-recurring sources milestones, development inhaled products.

Accordingly, to assist full understanding of the Groups 2017 results, this review includes financial information taken directly from the Adjusted EBITDA of 25.8m underpinned audited financial statements, prepared in accordance with International by key products flutiform, Ultibro and Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the Groups accounting Seebri Breezhaler, which together delivered policies, as well as financial information presented on an underlying gross margin of 41.1m, 18.8%.
The Directors believe that this additional information is important to fully assess the financial performance of the Group on a comparable year-on-year basis.

measures have been prepared on a proforma full year calendar basis for Vectura and Skyepharma.
This information has been extracted from the Groups management accounts for the twelve-months ended 31 December 2016 and is prepared in accordance with Vecturas relevant accounting policies.
This proforma financial information presents performance for the business for the twelve-months ended 31 December 2016 as though Vectura and Skyepharma had always been merged, excluding the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustments required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
A reconciliation of 2016 reported results for the nine-month period to 2016 proforma results is included in an appendix to this report.
However, comparison of the 2017 reported results to the 2016 proforma twelve-month financial information is also impacted by significantly lower revenues from non-recurring sources, largely relating to: licensing milestones, which, by their nature, can vary materially year to year: R&D development services revenues: and lower royalties in 2017 due to the expiry of the ADVATE patent in2016 and GSKs decision to cease paying royalties in respect of the Ellipta products under a legacy Vectura agreement with effect from August 2016, which is now subject to a legal dispute process.
The impact of these items can distort comparison of financial results from period to period and therefore can obscure trends in the underlying, recurring base of the business.
Accordingly, certain underlying financial information is included in this report.
Underlying financial information is calculated using the 2017 reported results and proforma 2016 twelve-month financial information, excluding certain non-underlying items: i revenue from non-recurring sources comprising royalties and share of sales which have discontinued in either period for example, due to patent expiry or legal dispute, milestones and development services STRATEGIC REPORT Financial highlights 2016 2017 Adjusting 2017 proforma % reported items underlying underlying movement Revenue 148.0m 16.6m 131.4m 126.3m 4.0% Cost of sales 57.2m 0.8m 56.4m 55.1m 2.4% Gross margin 90.8m 15.8m 75.0m 71.2m 5.3% R&D expenditure 60.3m 60.3m 65.1m 7.4% Other operating expenditure and income 12.5m 2.1m 10.4m 12.9m 19.4% Amortisation of intangible assets 109.7m 109.7m Exceptional items 4.5m 4.5m Operating loss profit 96.2m 100.5m 4.3m 6.8m 100.0% Adjusted EBITDA 25.8m 15.8m 10.0m 2.6m 100.0% Underlying revenues by revenue stream Revenue from 2016 2017 non-recurring 2017 proforma % reported sources underlying underlying movement Royalties 52.6m 2.5m 50.1m 47.9m 4.6% Product supply and device sales 74.7m 74.7m 72.6m 2.9% Signing and milestone payments 5.1m 5.1m Development services 9.0m 9.0m Other revenue 6.6m 6.6m 5.8m 13.8% Revenue 148.0m 16.6m 131.4m 126.3m 4.0% revenue: ii non-cash share-based payment and amortisation of Revenue intangible assets charges: and iii exceptional items.

Thisexcludes acquisition accounting adjustments required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Adjustment 2: In the December 2015 management accounts, certain royalties were over accrued by 2.1m with no implication on the twelve-month March 2016 reported IFRS results.
The adjusting entry has been posted in Q1 calendar year 2016 reducing royalty revenues accordingly.
2016 reported proforma revenues are therefore adjusted to exclude this understatement.
Adjustment 3: Adjustment to remove non-recurring royalties from ADVATE and GSK Ellipta from proforma underlying revenues which materially ceased in 2016.
Adjustment 4: Adjustment to remove milestone payments, development services revenues and non-recurring other revenues from proforma underlying revenues.

The table above reconciles recurring revenues disclosed in 2016 to underlying revenues disclosed in the current year financial review.
Underlying revenues exclude material royalties received in 2016 from ADVATE and the Ellipta portfolio that did not recur to a material extent in 2017.
The impact of these items distorts comparison of financial results from period to period and therefore can obscure trends in the underlying, recurring base of the business.
The Directors consider that reporting performance on an underlying basis provides a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing business in both periods and is consistent with how management reviews the business for the purpose of making long-term operating decisions.
