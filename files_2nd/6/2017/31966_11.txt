Underlying results reflect the Groups trading performance excluding non-underlying items, as defined above.
A reconciliation of underlying results to reported results in the year to 30 June 2017 is provided in the table below.
In the commentary which follows, all references will be to CER unless otherwise stated.

This included 269.6 million from its existing business, an increase of 6.5%, and a 89.7 million contribution from acquisition business.
Consolidated underlying operating profit of 81.3 million, represents a 36.9% increase on the prior year.
This included 64.0 million from Dechras existing business, an increase of 11.8%, and a 17.3 million contribution from acquisition business.
Underlying EBIT margin increased by 140bps to 22.6%, with the dilution from the lower gross margin revenues acquired being offset significantly by the operating leverage from revenue growth.
Underlying EPS grew by 35.1% to 64.33p reflecting the growth from the existing and acquired businesses, increased finance charges from the increase in debt to fund the acquisitions, and the change in mix of the applicable tax rates.
indd 22 04 09 2017 13:58:56 Strategic Report Reported Segmental Performance Reported segmental performance is presented in note 2 on pages 128 and 129.
The effect of acquisitions made in the year and prior year was significant, as was the effect of foreign exchange movements.
The reported segmental performance is analysed between existing and acquisition businesses, and at AER and CER in the table below.
The acquisition elements capture both the additional base business coming into the Group, the growth we generated in them in the year, as well as the synergies we have realised for the Group.
This analysis becomes less definitive the further in time from the completion of the acquisition, as the acquisition business is integrated with the existing business.
The existing business grew by 3.6%: excluding third party contract manufacturing, which is being reduced in line with our strategy and replaced with own product manufacturing, revenues increased by 5.3%.
This growth was driven mainly by the strong contribution from market penetration and new product launches in the core CAP business, and the sustained growth of FAP despite the ongoing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescriptions.
The acquisitions of Genera acquired in October 2015 and Apex Dechra Veterinary Products International business reported within European Pharmaceuticals, acquired in October 2016 contributed a combined 26.6 million to revenue.
EBIT from existing business grew 5.0%, with operating margin expanding to 28.0% and consolidated operating margin increasing slightly to 26.8% as a result of operating leverage.
indd 23 04 09 2017 13:58:57 Financial Review continued North American Pharmaceuticals Revenue from North American Pharmaceuticals grew by 55.0 million or 93.7%.
The existing business grew by 16.5% to 69.3 million from market penetration from existing CAP and Equine products.
The acquisitions of Brovel acquired January 2016 and Putney acquired April 2016 contributed 63.1 million, almost doubling the size of North American Pharmaceuticals.
Putney delivered a particularly strong performance, benefiting from the sales and marketing efforts of the enlarged Dechra team.
Brovel in Mexico also delivered good growth.
EBIT from the existing business grew by 31.4% with strong operating leverage from the additional volume, moving the EBIT margin on existing business to 35.4%.
Including the acquisitions, EBIT increased from 17.5 million to 43.2 million, with EBIT margin expanding from 29.8% to 32.6%, with the operating leverage more than offsetting the dilutive gross margin from Putney sales.

Overall R&D expenses as a percentage of sales were unchanged at 4.2%: it is the Groups strategy to grow its investment in R&D both organically and by acquisition: the Board expects R&D expenses as a percentage of sales to grow in the coming years as it expands the product pipeline.
