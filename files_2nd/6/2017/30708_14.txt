The key financial metrics forour premium outlets are: income growth: earnings contribution: property valuations and returns: and capital growth.

COM 53 Financial review continued Profit for the year The Groups IFRS profit for the year, attributable to equity shareholders, was 388.4 million, 71.1 million higher than for the prior year.
This was principally due to higher revaluation gains on the Groups premium outlets portfolio which generated a net revaluation gain of 225.2 million in 2017 compared with 138.4 million in 2016.
Management principally reviews the Groups profit on an adjusted basis to monitor the Groups underlying earnings as it excludes capital and non-recurring items such as valuation movements, gains or losses on the disposal of properties and other one-off exceptional items.
This approach is consistent with other property companies and we follow EPRA guidance to calculate adjusted figures.
A reconciliation of IFRS profit to adjusted profit for the year is shown in Table 33.

In 2017, net rental income NRI increased by 23.9 million to 370.4 million, or by 16.4 million at constant exchange rates.
The like-for-like portfolio produced additional income of 2.7 million, with the most significant contributions from The Oracle, Silverburn, Les Terrasses du Port and Les 3 Fontaines.
UK retail parks suffered a 1.6 million, or 2.5%, like-for-like NRI reduction associated with 3.2 million of surrender premiums received in 2016.
Like-for-like growth on the Reported Group properties was 0.9%, whilst for properties held by the Groups proportionally consolidated joint ventures and associates, growth was 1.1%.
In 2017 the Groups growth in like-for-like NRI KPI on page 18 of 1.7% includes the performance of our Irish shopping centres where the underlying net rental income received in 2016 prior to the conversion to property ownership of the secured loans was treated as finance income.
The like-for-like NRI performance by sector is further explained in the Business Review on pages 28 to 40.
Acquisitions generated 22.6 million of additional income which relates to the conversion of the Irish loan portfolio to real estate in 2016 and 2017.
Disposals reduced income in 2017 by 15.3 million, reflecting the sales in 2016 of 50% of Grand Central, Birmingham: Villebon 2, Paris and a number of UK retail parks Manor Walks and Westmorland, Cramlington: Thurrock Shopping Park, Essex and Westwood and Westwood Gateway Retail Parks in July 2017.
Developments increased net rental income by 6.4 million following the completion of Victoria Gate, Leeds and the leisure extension at Westquay South, Southampton towards the end of 2016.
Further analysis of net rental income is provided in Tables 93 and 96 of the Additional Disclosures on pages 178 and 179 respectively.
Administration expenses Table 36 Administration expenses analysis Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2017 2016 Proportionally consolidated, excluding premium outlets m m Employee and corporate costs 61.0 54.6 Management fees receivable 12.1 8.5 Net administration expenses 48.9 46.1 In 2017, 0.5 million 2016: 0.4 million of the Groups proportionally consolidated administration expenses related to the Groups Share of Property interests.
At 48.9 million, net administration expenses increased by 2.8 million, or 2.0 million at constant exchange rates.
This resulted from higher staff costs to support our new Irish operations and the delivery of the major developments in London and Paris.
Whilst headcount numbers were broadly unchanged during 2017, average staff costs increased as head office recruitment was offset by the transfer, to a third party operator, of a team of operational staff at Dundrum Town Centre in the first half of 2017.
The increase in employee and corporate costs of 6.4 million was partly offset by 3.6 million higher management fee income, principally from our Irish and UK shopping centre joint ventures.
Our accounting policy is to capitalise the cost of staff working directly on on-site development projects.
In 2017 only 0.1 million of staff costs were capitalised on the Groups on-site retail park development schemes, compared with 1.6 million in 2016 when both Victoria Gate, Leeds and Westquay South, Southampton were completed.
Cost ratio The EPRA cost ratio for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 21.6%, 100 basis points lower than 2016.
Compared with the prior year ratio, the administration expenses element of the ratio remained unchanged at 11.9%, whilst the property costs element has fallen from 10.7% to 9.7%.
The reduction in the property costs ratio is associated with lower vacancy and bad debt costs in 2017.
The downward trend in the ratio reflects managements continued focus on delivering operating efficiencies across the Group.
The calculation of the cost ratio is included as Table 98 of the Additional Disclosures on page 180.
COM 55 Financial review continued Loss on sale of properties and recycling of net exchange gains During 2017, we sold five properties raising proceeds, after deducting selling costs, of 399 million, and 74% of the proceeds related to the sales of Place des Halles, Strasbourg and Saint Sbastien, Nancy.
Compared to their valuations at 31 December 2016, these five disposals resulted in a loss of 15.5 million, or 3.7%.
The losses principally related to Westwood and Westwood Gateway Retail Parks, Thanet and Saint Sbastien, Nancy.
Following the sale of Place des Halles, Strasbourg and Saint Sbastien, Nancy in late 2017, 27.8 million of net exchange gains previously recognised in equity have been recycled in the income statement.
The majority of this figure related to the sale of Place des Halles, Strasbourg where there was a 35.5% non-controlling interest.
After taking account of the non-controlling interest, the recycled net exchange gains attributable to equity shareholders was 8.2 million and this has been excluded from the Groups adjusted earnings.
Potential business acquisition costs The Group recognised 6.5 million of costs in relation to professional advisor fees to support the acquisition of intu properties plc which was announced on 6 December 2017.
These costs have been excluded from the Groups adjusted earnings and further details of this major acquisition are provided in the Chief Executives Review on page 12.
Share of results of joint ventures and associates, including investments in premium outlets The Group has interests in 15 joint ventures and the share of the results of joint ventures under IFRS for the year ended 31 December 2017 was 180.5 million 2016: 169.2 million.
Further details are provided in note 12 to the financial statements.
As explained at the beginning of the Financial Review on page 53, for management reporting purposes we review the Groups property portfolio on a proportionally consolidated basis, to reflect the Groups different ownership shares.
We do not proportionally consolidate the Groups premium outlet investments in Value Retail VR and VIA Outlets VIA.
These are externally managed by experienced outlet operators, independently financed and have operating metrics which differ from the Groups other properties.
Due to the differing nature of the Groups control, VIA is accounted for as a joint venture and VR is accounted for as an associate.
Table 37 below shows the contribution to the Groups adjusted profit from joint ventures and associates, split between the proportionally consolidated properties and the investments in premium outlets.

Adjusted earnings from premium outlets of 37.8 million were 8.0 million higher than in 2016, or 7.6 million at constant exchange rates.
The Groups share of VIA earnings increased by 7.0 million due principally to acquisitions including Zweibrcken Fashion Outlet and Vila do Conde Porto Fashion Outlet in the first half of 2017 and the Wroclaw, Seville and Mallorca Fashion Outlets in the second half of 2016.
VRs earnings increased by 1.0 million as strong net rental income growth was partly offset by higher finance and administration costs, the latter associated with the enhanced management structure implemented in 2016.
Further details of the Groups joint ventures and associates are shown in notes 12 and 13 to the financial statements respectively.
The operating performance of our premium outlets is described in the Business Review on pages 38 to 40 and the combined profit contribution is in Table 103 of the Additional Disclosures on page 183.
56 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW Finance costs Net finance costs, calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis, as shown in note 2 to the financial statements, totalled 170.4 million in 2017, compared with 96.6 million in 2016.
The increase is principally due to the exceptional cost of 41.1 million to redeem the 250 million 2020 6.875% bonds in October 2017 which is included in the Debt and loan facility cancellation costs of 41.5 million 2016: 0.4 million.
Adjusted finance costs, which excludes items such as the change in fair value of derivatives and debt cancellation costs, totalled 107.6 million in 2017, an increase of 14.1 million, or 10.9 million at constant exchange rates.
The increase principally arose from reduced finance income following the conversion of the Irish loans to property in 2016 and 2017 and the reduction in loans to Value Retail in the second half of 2016.
Interest capitalised on a number of retail park development schemes totalled 0.8 million in 2017, which was 4.3 million lower than in 2016 when both Victoria Gate, Leeds and Westquay South, Southampton were completed.
The supporting calculation for adjusted finance costs is shown in Table 106 of the Additional Disclosures on page 185.
Tax The Group has tax exempt status in the UK, France and Ireland and is exempt from corporation tax on rental income and gains arising on property sales.
The current tax charge in 2017 was 1.8 million, 0.9 million lower than 2016, as the prior year included a number of one-off charges.
We publish guidance explaining the Groups tax strategy and have updated this for 2018 and Hammersons Approach to Tax for the year ending 31 December 2018 is on the Groups website www.
Dividends The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 14.8 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 10.7 pence, the total for 2017 is 25.5pence, representing an increase of 6.25% compared with the prior year.
The final dividend is payable on 26 April 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 16 March 2018.
7.4 pence will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the balance of 7.4pence paid as a normal dividend.
The Company will not be offering a scrip dividend alternative, but for shareholders who wish to receive their dividend in the form of shares, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP will be available.
Net assets During 2017, equity shareholders funds increased by 248 million, or 4.3%, to 6,024 million at 31 December 2017.
Net assets, calculated on an EPRA basis, were 6,164 million and on a per share basis increased by 37 pence to 7.76.
The movement during the year is shown in Table 38.

Adjustments in accordance with EPRA best practice shown in note 10D to the financial statements on page 147.
The increase in EPRA net assets was principally due to property revaluation gains of 246 million, mainly in the UK shopping centres, Developments and Premium outlets portfolios as explained in the Property Portfolio Review on page 51.
Adjusted profit also increased net assets by 246 million, although this was offset by dividends of 194 million.
Foreign exchange and other movements totalled 59 million, mainly reflecting the weakening of sterling against the euro over the course of 2017.
COM 57 Financial review continued Investment and development properties The valuation of investment and development properties in the Reported Group at 31 December 2017 was 4,686 million, 78 million lower than the prior year.
The movement in investment and development properties is shown in note 11 to the financial statements.

This was partly offset by property revaluation gains of 19 million and profits retained by the joint ventures.
The Groups total adjusted investment in premium outlets increased by 287 million in 2017 to 1,575 million.
Property revaluation gains contributed 225 million to the uplift with further capital advances of 130 million to VIA Outlets to fund the three outlet acquisitions completed during 2017.
These were partly offset by 130 million of cash distributions received from VR associated with earnings and surplus cash generated from the refinancing of Bicester Village in December 2017.
An analysis of the Groups combined investment in premium outlets is shown in Table 104 in the Additional Disclosures on page 183. Financing and cash flow Our financing strategy is to generally borrow on an unsecured basis on the strength of the Groups covenant to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged tomaintain short term liquidity and toensure an appropriate maturity profile.
Acquisitions may initially be financed using short term funds before being refinanced with longer term funding when market conditions are appropriate.
Short term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships.
Long term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds, private placements and secured bank borrowing within certain joint ventures.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The Board regularly reviews the Groups financing strategy and plans and approves financing guidelines against which it monitors the Groups financial structure.
These guidelines, together with the relevant metrics, are summarised in Table 40 which illustrates the Groups robust financial position.

Net debt position On a proportionally consolidated basis, net debt at 31 December 2017 was 3,501 million, an increase of 88 million during the year.
This comprises loans and other borrowings of 3,676 million, the fair value of currency swaps of 90 million less cash and deposits of 266 million.
Cash and deposits were 135 million higher than at 31 December 2016 due to the receipt of the sale proceeds from Place des Halles, Strasbourg at the end of the year which were used to repay floating rate debt facilities in January 2018.
The movement in proportionally consolidated net debt is analysed in Table 41.

2017 has been another active year from a financing perspective and the following activities were completed: in January, funds were received from our 400 million private placement signed in November 2016.
The fixed rate notes were denominated, post swaps, in sterling 50 million and euro 387 million, had maturities of seven, nine, 11 and 14 years and a weighted average coupon of 1.7%.
in April, a new 360 million unsecured revolving credit facility was signed with a syndicate of 14 banks at an initial margin of 90 basis points.
The facility has a maturity of five years and may be extended by a further two years.
This refinanced an existing 175 million facility which was due to mature in April 2018 and had an initial margin of 150 basis points.
the two other revolving credit facilities of 415 million and 420 million were extended by one year and now mature in April 2022 and we repaid and cancelled the 1.5 billion short term facility used to fund acquisitions in Ireland and Birmingham.
in September, together with our 50% joint venture partner, Allianz, we arranged a 625 million seven-year loan secured on Dundrum Town Centre, Dublin.
At the date of the borrowing, the loan to value was below 40% and the all-in interest cost was fixed at 1.9%.
in October, we redeemed the Groups 250 million 6.875% unsecured 20-year bonds which were due to mature in 2020.
We incurred a one-off redemption premium of 41 million which has been treated as an exceptional financing cost.
The redemption was funded using liquidity from recent refinancing activity and contributed to the reduced weighted average cost of debt.
COM 59 Financial review continued Following this refinancing activity the Groups liquidity at 31 December 2017, comprising cash and undrawn committed facilities, was 958 million, 366 million higher than at the beginning of the year.
Also, the Groups weighted average maturity of debt was maintained at 5.6years 2016: 5.5 years.
We manage exposure to foreign exchange translation differences on euro-denominated assets through a combination of euro borrowings and derivatives.
At 31 December 2017, the value of euro-denominated liabilities as a proportion of the value of euro-denominated assets was 78%, compared with 79% at the beginning of the year.
Interest on euro debt also acts as a hedge against exchange differences arising on net income from our overseas businesses.
The 4% strengthening of the euro against sterling during 2017 has resulted in modest gains to net asset value andearnings.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities and the private placement senior notes contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing should not exceed 150% and that interest cover should be not less than 1.25 times.
Two of our unsecured bonds contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 150%, whilst the covenant on the remaining bonds is that gearing should not exceed 175%.
The bonds have no covenant for interest cover.
The Groups financial ratios are comfortably within these covenants.
Fitch and Moodys rate Hammersons unsecured credit as A and Baa1 respectively.
In May, Moodys changed its outlook from negative to stable, citing the Groups financial discipline and stable operating performance since the UKs EU referendum decision in June 2016 and also reaffirmed the Groups rating in December following the announcement of the all-share offer to acquire intu properties plc.
Fitch reaffirmed the Groups long-term rating in November, and following the intu acquisition announcement in December placed the rating on rating watch negative RWN.
This indicates that the rating could stay at its present level or potentially be downgraded as a result of the transaction.
Fitch expect to resolve the RWN once the transaction has closed or upon confirmation of the new capital structure.
At 31 December 2017, the Groups loan to value was 36% and gearing was 58%, compared with 36% and 59% respectively at the beginning of the year.
Supporting calculations are in Table 108 in the Additional Disclosures on page 185.
At 31 December 2017, the Groups share of net debt in VR and VIA totalled 686 million 2016: 468 million.
On a proforma basis, proportionally consolidating this net debt with the Groups share of property values held by VR and VIA, the Groups gearing would be 69% and loan to value would be 40%.
