CFO Review After returning 1.5 billion to shareholders in the year, the balance sheet and prospects for the Company remain strong.
We have a focused portfolio, no gearing, a low level of liabilities and further realised reserves after the dividend paid on 1st December 2017.
With the resources we require in place and a much reduced cost base, this puts us on a stable footing to push forward with our recently announced strategy.
Total Shareholder Return and Analysis of Movement in Net Asset Value per share TSR for the year was 21%, representing a significant out-performance of the FTSE 250 TSR of 14%.
NAV per share total return was 9% for the year to 30th September 2017 2016: 35%.
The Consolidated Income Statement on page 25 of the Report shows the total return for the year and, together with dividends of 3,636p per ordinary share paid during the year, and a share buyback of 94 million, explains the movement in NAV per share for the year to 30th September 2017.
The notable change in the investment portfolio this year is the high level of realisations which generated a significant gain and contributed 629p per share, 12% of the opening NAV per share.
Deducted from this, as shown below, were exceptional costs including termination payments relating to the change in strategy and manager of 19p per share, operating costs and tax, which together totalled 45p per share: the priority profit share paid to Epiris for managing the portfolio amounted to 60p per share: and the charge for incentive schemes amounted to 69p per share see further detail below.
Dividends of 3,636p per share were paid in the year.
This resulted in a net decrease in net assets of 3,168p per share and a total return adding back the dividends paid of 9% for the year.

In addition, the provision remaining on termination of the Epiris contract on 31st May 2017 was contractually reduced by 20% for all post 2006 asset Pools.
Following the termination of the Epiris contract, there are no new carried interest schemes in operation.
The impact of the Long Term Incentive Plan approved at the March Annual General Meeting and described in the Remuneration Report is reflected in the Statement of Changes in Equity on pages 26 and 27 and is charged through the Income Statement in accordance with IFRS 2.
Net Liquid Resources The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 30 analyses the movement in the Groups cash for the year.
Cash on the Balance Sheet has decreased by 605 million to 54 million, reflecting our revised strategy regarding surplus cash.
Where we have no near-term requirement for funds, our variable capital model sees us returning cash to shareholders 1.4 billion in dividends and 94 million as a share buyback in the year and for other cash balances, we have invested in money market funds in the last four months of the year to mitigate the cash drag effect.
Cash inflows were mainly related to sales of investments and investment income, which yielded approximately 1,976 million in cash.
After distributions, the next largest constituent of the cash outflow related to cash paid for investments of 774 million, of which 730 million was investing in money market funds.
In addition, there were incentive scheme costs of 248 million and operating and tax costs of approximately 68 million in the year.
Post year end, Electra has committed to pay a third Special Dividend of 914p per ordinary share 350 million, as declared by the Board, and significant cash inflows were expected relating to the proceeds net of carried interests from sales of non-core assets either agreed but not completed or in a sales process.
Gearing At 30th September 2017, Electra was ungeared at the Group level.
Certain companies of the portfolio are funded in part by third party debt.
In line with our strategy to focus on long-term shareholder value, where we see a benefit from reducing third party debt and we have the capital, we will invest further in debt instruments in the portfolio companies.
Foreign Exchange At 30th September 2017, the estimated foreign currency exposure in the balance sheet was 52 million and $27 million based on the currency of underlying securities in the investment portfolio.
The Euro has strengthened against Sterling by 2% while the US Dollar has weakened by 3% during the year, resulting in a small gain in respect of the investment portfolio.
The geographical locations of revenue within the portfolio companies as at 30th September is reflected in the chart on page 12.
