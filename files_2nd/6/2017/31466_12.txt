32 Finance Directors review The statutory IFRS results, which are shown unadjusted on the face of the Income Statement, are presented below.
The underlying results, which are used as an Alternative Performance Measure APM as described by the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA, are shown below the unadjusted statutory results and are described in more detail in the glossary to this Annual Report on pages 152 to 155.
Lastly, to improve year-on-year comparability, a proforma measure is calculated, which presents the prior year, on a constant currency basis, as if Nortek had been owned for the full year.
All three of these measures are discussed in this review and their definitions are explained in the glossary to this Annual Report.
Melrose Group segmental split The Melrose Group at 31 December 2017 consisted of four divisions, the Energy division, along with three divisions within Nortek, namely: the Air Management division, which contains both the Air Quality & Home Solutions AQH business and the Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning HVAC business: the Security & Smart Technology SST division: and the Ergonomics division.

The year ended 31 December 2017 was a year of significant transformation for Melrose, being the first full year of Nortek ownership and with Brush Turbogenerators experiencing structural changes in its end markets.
Consequently these statutory results include significant amounts of items which are non-trading in nature, significant in size, volatile or are non-recurring.
These are defined as non-underlying items.
It is Melrose accounting policy to exclude these items from underlying results and the specific amounts that fall within these categories in the year are detailed as follows.
