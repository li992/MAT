Over the last five years, our total radio revenues have shown an improving trend in comparison to the radio industry as a whole.
Over the last 12 months our advertising revenues have moved in line with the radio industry, which was also down 2% for the year to September.
Revenue held up despite second year of advertising recession Underlying Group profit before tax was 27.8 million, a decrease of 8%.
The tax charge on our underlying profitability for the year was 30.4% 2001: 28.5% and our underlying earnings per share was 23.5p, 10% less than last year.
Revenue from our established stations was 101 million, down 5%, which resulted in the operating profit from our established stations being 33.9 million, compared to 39.6 million in 2001.
During the year, we continued to manage the cost base rigorously, which enabled us to limit the decline in the operating margin for our established stations.
Operating margin in 2002 was 34% compared to 37% in 2001.
Our development stations Xfm, Century FM Network and Beat 106 achieved strong like for like revenue growth of 19% increasing to 18.2 million, and benefited from being represented by our Group Commercial operation.
The Century FM Network stations moved into profit, Beat 106 broke even and Xfm reduced its losses.
Total operating losses for these stations were 0.5 million compared to 3 million in the previous financial year.
Radio turnover 2001 2002 Like for m m like change Established brands 106.1 101.0 5% Development brands 15.3 18.2 19% 121.4 119.2 2% We incurred 3.6 million of exceptional costs in relation to the reorganisation of the business along brand lines.
These were largely cash costs related to redundancies and consultant fees.
The reorganisation will directly generate ongoing savings of approximately 2 million per annum, which we have chosen to reinvest behind the brands.
com We invested 3.3 million 2001: 3 million in our digital radio operations predominantly transmission costs as more of our digital licences started broadcasting.
Our interactive business incurred an operating loss of 2.1 million 2001: 3.6 million.
Both were in line with our previously stated expectations.
During the new financial year we have planned the following investment in these areas: 2002 2003 m m Digital radio 3.3 4.0 Interactive 2.1 1.0 5.4 5.0 Our associated companies, principally Wildstar and IRN, contributed 1.1 million 2001: 2.6 million to the Groups profitability.
Wildstars core artist is Craig David, who sold over six million copies of his first album worldwide.
This benefited the associated companies profitability in 2001.
His second album was released globally on 11 November 2002, and we hope that it will repeat this success.
We have continued to be highly cash generative with the conversion of more than 100% of our operating profit into cash.
The net cash inflow from operating activities was 30.1 million.
After dividend payments of 15.2 million, tax payments of 6.1 million and net cash outflows of 4.8 million relating to investment activity, our net debt was reduced by 3.9 million to 29 million.
With interest cover on our continuing radio business of 19x, we are well placed financially to take advantage of any appropriate investment opportunities.

The Directors are therefore recommending a final dividend of 12.5p per share to be paid on 28 January 2003 to shareholders on the register on 29 November 2002 ex dividend date 27 November 2002.
Including the interim dividend of 6p, our total dividend for 2002 is unchanged year on year at 18.5p per share.
com Current trading and future prospects The early months of the new financial year continue to reflect the tough advertising market.
Trading is still very short term and therefore we remain cautious on the outlook for advertising for the financial year.
We will continue to manage the business on the basis that there is no material improvement in trading conditions.
Nevertheless, we are confident that sustained growth will return to the market over time.
There are clear factors favouring the long-term growth of radio as an advertising medium and, as the leading commercial radio group in the UK, Capital is well placed to benefit.
We have market-leading brands and an experienced management team with a strategy focused on radio.
Our national position is significant and our core 15-44 year old audience is very attractive to advertisers.
In addition, we have the financial capacity to continue investing in our business and the changes contemplated by the Communications Bill will give rise to even greater opportunities.
