Financial Review The year to 30 September 2002 was a difficult year for the Group against the backdrop of the continued weakness in world stock markets.
The impact of this downturn on the results of the Group has been offset by the inclusion of a full years results from the property asset management activities acquired during the course of 2001.
Assets under management bn Total assets at 30 September 2001 34.7 Less: Scottish Provident assets transferred 8.9 Pro forma assets under management 30 September 2001 25.8 Net new business generated in year 0.9 Debt repayments by split capital closed end funds 0.8 Effect of market movements and performance 2.2 Assets under management at 30 September 2002 23.7 The Scottish Provident assets were withdrawn during the second half of 2002 following Scottish Providents acquisition by Abbey National.
Turnover Total turnover increased from 182.1 million in 2001 to 192.1 million in 2002.
Turnover from investment management activities fell from 163.1 million in 2001 to 141.5 million in 2002, as a result of the continued fall in world stock markets and the consequent effect of lower asset values on fees earned by the Group.
The fall in investment management revenue was offset by the growth in the property asset management division as a result of including a full years income from acquisitions made in 2001.
Property revenue for 2002 was 50.6 million compared to 19.0 million in 2001.
This included, for the first time, income from fixed margin property management contracts in Scandinavia.
Revenue from these contracts has been separately identified, as the margin earned on these contracts is significantly lower than the remainder of the property business.
Operating costs excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional costs Total operating costs for the Group in the year to 30 September 2002 were 134.8 million compared to 123.2 million in 2001.
Total operating costs for the year, excluding expenses directly related to fixed property management contracts, were 123.8 million compared to 123.2 million in 2001.
Operating costs within investment management activities were reduced by 13.2 million to 94.3 million for the year and these costs will reduce further in 2003, resulting in total cost reductions on an annualised basis of around 30 million.
Operating costs within the property division increased by 24.8 million in 2002, reflecting a full years costs arising from when the various property businesses were acquired during 2001.
Exceptional items During the year, the Group undertook a review of its operating cost base following the loss of the Scottish Provident contract and the continued weakness in world stock markets.
As a result of this review, staff numbers were reduced and one-off costs of 5.6 million, associated with redundancy, office closure and other cost reduction measures, were incurred.
These costs have been treated as exceptional costs within administrative expenses.
During the year impairment provisions of 2.6 million were made against fixed asset and current asset investments exposed to the split capital sector.
Other operating income of 4.4 million arises from compensation received on the termination of the Scottish Provident investment management contract.
This income has been treated as exceptional.
Amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill amortisation costs increased in 2002 to 19.6 million from 12.6 million the previous year.
5.8 million of this increase arises from recording a full years charge in respect of acquisitions made during 2001.
Intangible assets amortisation of 1.6 million arises on the amortisation of the present value in force of the Isle of Man life business acquired in January 2002.
An additional charge of 1.2 million was made in respect of certain closed end fund contracts following the annual impairment review.
Operating profit Operating profit for the year was 33.8 million compared to 35.3 million in 2001, a reduction of 4%.
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items has been maintained at 57.3 million in 2002 compared with 58.9 22 Aberdeen Asset Management million last year.
Further analysis reveals a 8.4 million fall in operating profit, before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, from the investment management division offset by an increase of 6.7 million from the property division.
Cost reductions undertaken during the year have enabled the investment management division to maintain its operating margin at 33.3%.
The Group operating margin before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items for 2002 was 29.8% compared to 32.3% in 2001.
However, the property division accounts for a larger proportion of the Groups activities this year and operates on a lower margin of around 20.0% 2001 17.8%.
Net interest payable and similar charges Net interest payable and similar charges for the year were 15.5 million, up from 10.7 million in 2001.
The charge for 2002 includes interest of 4.2 million on the 100 million convertible bonds issued in January 2002 and 0.5 million in respect of the amortisation of issue costs.
Interest on bank term loans was 9.2 million, which was 1.2 million lower than 2001.
Taxation The tax charge for the year represents an average rate of 61% on the profit before taxation 2001 39%.
Excluding the charge for goodwill amortisation, which is not an allowable deduction for tax purposes, the underlying effective rate of tax is 29.5% 2001 25.8%.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share, excluding the effects of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 16.51p, which is down from 21.12p last year.
The diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, was 16.47p, a reduction from 19.49p last year.
Basic earnings per share, after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 3.29p compared to 8.51p in 2001.
The diluted earnings per share, calculated on the same basis, was 3.28p compared to 8.26p in 2001.
Net borrowings At 30 September 2002 the Groups net borrowings were 234.5million, an increase of 51.6 million over 30 September 2001.
This represented a gearing ratio of 113% of shareholders funds.
During the year, the Group issued 100 million 5.875% Convertible Bonds 2007.
Part of the proceeds of this issue were used to fund the 36.6 million acquisition of the Old Mutual companies.
In addition, 71.9 million of bank term loans were repaid during the year.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings remains weighted towards the longer term, with 55% of the total being due in 2006 and 2007 and only 27 million due for repayment during 2003.
The Group continues to comply with all covenants attached to bank and other borrowings, and intends to use the anticipated proceeds of divesting the property division to reduce borrowings further.
Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives comprise fixed asset and current asset investments, cash and liquid resources, convertible subordinated loan notes, bank term loans, convertible bonds, floating rate guaranteed unsubordinated loan stock, deferred consideration and various items, such as trade debtors, trade creditors, etc that arise from its operations.
Details of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities are given in note 23 to the accounts.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS13 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments and excluded short term debtors and creditors from the disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures of financial instruments.
The Group has adopted a policy of minimising exposure to exchange risk arising from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The major non-sterling liability is in respect of Convertible Loan Notes, which are denominated in US Dollars.
To the extent that this liability is not matched at any time by US Dollar assets, the exposure is hedged by means of a currency swap arrangement.
Interest is payable on the Convertible Loan Notes at a rate of 7% per annum, fixed until the earlier of conversion or 29 March 2003.
Thereafter the interest rate increases to a fixed rate of 7.5% per annum.
The Group has also undertaken a cross-currency interest rate swap, for the period to 30 September 2005, in respect of 89 million of bank term loan borrowings.
Under this arrangement the Group pays interest in US dollars at a fixed rate of 5.03% and receives interest at the variable rate of six-month sterling LIBOR.
The variable LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 1.25% is payable to the lenders under the bank term loans.
The fixed rate of interest is payable in US dollars from the Groups US dollar revenues, while the principal amount of the loans remain denominated in sterling.
Surplus cash balances are invested in money market deposits and other interest bearing accounts, taking advantage of Group offset arrangements, in order to optimise interest income while also retaining flexibility in respect of the Groups expected cash requirements.
