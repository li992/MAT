Financial review Introduction Group operating profit including joint-ventures and associates but before exceptional items fell by 30.2m to 433.3m.
The segmental analysis in note 1 to the accounts on page 51 of the Annual Report provides a detailed breakdown of this profit.
A description of the contribution from our four divisions is described in the preceding Review of operations on pages 16 to 25.
2002 was a challenging year, particularly in North America.
Throughout the world, we have concentrated on managing our businesses as efficiently as possible.
Cost control in declining markets is fundamental and this has been reected in our ability to restrict the reduction in margins from signicantly lower volumes in the USA.
We have benefited from the geographic spread of our operations and have seen good improvements in profitability in the UK and Australia.
Cash ow remains one of the key strengths of this group and as our balance sheet ratios were restored, we were able to renew our focus on bolt-on acquisitions.
Jonathan Nicholls Finance Director profits from disposals of property and other income were 11.6m and central costs were 18.0m.
EBIT reconciliation m The movement in exchange rates in the year resulted Sales EBITA Goodwill EBIT in a reduction in profits of 9.0m.

This has reduced further following the disposal of our interest in North Texas Cement Company NTCC for 78.8m which completed early in 2003.
The amount of debt that we carry in the group balance sheet is managed through the use of an EBITA interest cover ratio.
We have a target minimum of five times.
At this level, we believe we balance the need to reduce Key nancials our cost of capital through the use of debt, whilst at 2002 2001 the same time ensuring that the group balance sheet Interest cover EBITA 6.3x 4.9x is not over-extended.

Following a review of certain of our US, UK and Asian operations we have identied impairments in the carrying value of those assets, reecting more negative business outlooks in the medium term.
As a consequence, 87.0m of the operating exceptional charges relate to the write-down of these assets.
Non-operating exceptional items totalled a profit of 11.0m 115.7m.
Provisions established at the time of the demerger totalling 37.4m are no longer 26 Financial review required and have been released.

Closing borrowings 1,169.9 1,429.7 The annual increase of 10%, which reects a change to our policy, demonstrates our progressive approach to the dividend payout and the confidence we have in the cash generative nature of the business.
Cash ow Operating cash ow was 585.9m, or 79.6p per share in 2002.
The cash ow generated by the operations, in difficult economic conditions, is one of the key strengths of this group.
We have successfully restored our balance sheet ratios after the acquisition of Pioneer in April 2000.
Whilst net debt has been reduced, we have still continued to invest in the infrastructure of our business and in our programme of bolt-on acquisitions.
In total, we invested 152.7m of cash in new businesses in 2002.
In addition, we have continued to invest in plant and equipment with a total spend of 143.2m, 58.2% of which was in North America and 28.9% in our European operations.

Net liquidity surplus 851.7m On a daily basis, Treasury manages the net debt position using a combination of US and Euro commercial paper borrowings, bank borrowings and foreign exchange, in order to achieve the lowest overall funding cost within the parameters set by the Risk Committee.
Treasury is also involved in reviewing the financial risks and funding of major cash ows such as acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure.
Treasury reports quarterly to the board and the Risk Committee as well as on an ad hoc basis when required.
As part of this reporting process, Treasury will periodically recommend changes in nancing strategy, usually as a result of changes in either the financial markets or the financial prole of the group.
Such changes are considered by the Risk Committee and, if necessary, by the board.

Financial review 29 Environment, community and health and safety We demonstrate our corporate responsibility in Good environmental many ways: how we run our business, develop new performance underpins our products, manage and restore our sites, and support the communities in which we operate.
We also have business strategy.
We have a duty to work to high environmental standards, and a duty to work to the highest to provide safe working conditions for our employees.
2002 was another year of progress throughout the achievable standards.
Environment Caring for the environment is an integral part of our business strategy.
We endeavour to achieve a high quality of environmental performance.
For example, in the UK a central computerised system is being used to monitor energy use at all 15 of our brick factories.
The system is the most developed in the UK brick industry and can track gas and electricity wastage and highlight possible leaks.
Its findings have been used to introduce more energy-efficient procedures.
In Australia, four ready-mixed concrete plants were honoured in the Australian Pre-mixed Concrete Associations environmental performance awards.
The awards recognise excellence in the area of environmental management.
In abandoned caverns at our Jamesville property in New York State, a hibernating colony of the Indiana brown bat was discovered.
Hanson employees worked with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and Natural Resources and staff and students from Cornell University to ensure the safety of these mammals was guaranteed.
Blasting procedures during the hibernation period from September to May were modied to minimise shock transfer to the caverns and a seismographic monitoring programme was introduced.
We will ensure that our Jamesville property continues to provide a safe haven for the Indiana brown bat and other wildlife which inhabit the property.
One of the rarest butteries in the UK is being protected at Builth Wells quarry in Wales.
The quarry is the last site in Radnor and one of only 12 in Wales where the pearl bordered fritillary is found.
Hanson joined forces with environmental groups to carry out management work at the quarry to ensure the continued survival of the buttery.
