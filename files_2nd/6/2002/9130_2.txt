IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS The reported performance of the Group has been significantly affected by the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of the results into Sterling, mostly related to the US Dollar.
The principal exchange rates used to translate results were: 2002 2001 MOVEMENT US Dollar 1.50 1.43 4.9% Euro 1.59 1.62 1.9% The exchange loss on US Dollar translation was partly offset by currency hedging, which generated both a profit and loss account and cash gain of 4.2m and resulted in an effective exchange rate for 2002 US Dollar profit translation of 1.42.
Turnover was translated at a US Dollar exchange rate of 1.50.
Removing the effects of fluctuating exchange rates from our results, turnover increased by 5.3m and divisional profit by 0.7m.
