Legal & General Nederland Stichting Pensioenfonds a multi-company dened benefit scheme.
This scheme is a multi-employer dened benefit scheme which, as the company share of the underlying assets and liabilities cannot be identied, has been treated for reporting purposes as a dened contribution scheme.
The contribution in respect of this scheme for the year was 0.6m.
All significant schemes have been subject to regular valuation or formal reviews by qualied actuaries who were employees of the Group.
There were no contributions prepaid or outstanding at either 31 December 2002 or 31 December 2001 in respect of these schemes.
The Group has no liability for retirement benets other than for pensions, except for a small scheme in France Indemnites fide n carriere which provides for lump sum benets on retirement.
The Fund and Scheme account for virtually all of the UK and over 95% of worldwide assets, contributions and members of the Groups dened benefit schemes.
The charges for pension costs for the schemes within the Group under the statement of standard accounting practice SSAP 24 were: 62 2002 2002 2001 2001 m m m m Defined benefit schemes The Fund Regular pension costs 8 7 Amortisation of surplus 3 5 3 4 The Scheme Regular pension costs 6 6 Amortisation of surplus 2 4 2 4 Other UK and Overseas schemes 1 0 10 8 Defined contribution schemes 8 6 18 14 The actuarial value of the combined assets of the Fund and Scheme at 31 December 2001, the date of the last full actuarial valuation, was 506m, sufficient to cover 111% of the accrued members benets.
The surpluses of the Fund and Scheme based on this valuation are being amortised over 11 years the average expected remaining service lives of the members of the current schemes using the percentage of pay amortisation method.
The average contribution rate of pensionable salary in 2002 was 12.7%.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries of the dened benefit schemes under SSAP24 were: Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.75% Retail price index 4.00% Rate of growth in dividend income 4.00% Rate of return on investment 8.00% Rate of interest applied to discount liabilities 8.00% Rate of increase in salaries, excluding promotional increases 6.00% Following the continued decline in equity markets the actuary of the Fund and Scheme has conducted a preliminary review from which the actuarial value of the combined assets at 31 December 2002 have been established at 463m, sufficient to cover 85% of the accrued members benets with the average expected remaining service lives of the members increasing to 12 years.
The pension contribution rate was revised to 15.4% with effect from September 2002.
All of the dened benefit schemes are valued under the projected unit method.
As the Fund and Scheme are effectively closed to new members, the current service costs will increase as the age prole of active members rises.
