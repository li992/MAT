Year ended 30 September 2002 Results of operations unaudited 000s % 16 Revenue 282,980 100.0 Operating costs Ground handling charges, including salaries 22,977 8.1 Airport charges 32,794 11.6 Fuel 38,462 13.6 Navigation charges 19,957 7.1 Crew costs, including training 23,588 8.3 Maintenance, including reserves 33,769 11.9 Advertising 14,573 5.1 Merchant fees & incentive pay 3,781 1.3 17 Other costs 31,552 11.1 Selected aircraft financing costs Aircraft dry lease costs 38,002 13.4 8 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Operational and financial review continued Financial year 2002 compared with financial year 2001 Revenue easyJets revenue increased 54.6 per cent from 356.9 million to 551.8 million, from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 36.1 per cent to 485.9 million in financial year 2002.
This increase reflected a 42.7 per cent growth in passenger volumes, from 7.1 million to 10.2 million passengers, partly offset by a 6.0 per cent decline in average fares.
The number of passengers carried reflected an increase in the size of the easyJet fleet in operation from an average of 21.1 aircraft to an average of 29.8 aircraft and an increase in the average load factor achieved from 83.0 per cent to 84.6 per cent.
Revenue from non-ticket sources, within ongoing operations, includes in-flight sales of food and beverages, excess baggage charges, change fees, credit card booking fees and commissions received from products and services sold such as hotel and car hire bookings and travel insurance.
In financial year 2002, 23.8 million was earned from non-ticket sources, up 101.1 per cent from the prior year.
This increase is higher than the growth in passenger volumes and primarily reflects the full year effect of credit card booking fees, which were introduced in April 2001, the renegotiation of contractual arrangements and the exploration of new revenue earning opportunities.
Revenue arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, was 66.0 million, reflecting the 1.2 million passengers flown on the 27 aircraft operated by Go Fly in the two months of August and September.
Ground handling charges, including salaries easyJets ground handling charges increased by 46.3 per cent from 33.3 million to 48.8 million, from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Ground handling charges from continuing operations increased by 32.4 per cent to 44.1 million in financial year 2002.
The increase in third-party ground handling charges reflects the increase in the number of sectors flown and the higher rates charged at certain primary airports where much of easyJets organic growth was centred in 2002.
Ground handling at Geneva and Luton grew less than the level of passenger increase reflecting the improved efficiency of self-handling at these airports.
Ground handling charges in financial year 2001 also included the startup costs of self-handling at Geneva.
The ground handling charges arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 4.6 million.
Airport charges easyJets external airport charges increased by 85.6 per cent from 39.6 million to 73.5 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Airport charges from continuing operations increased by 68.6 per cent to 66.8 million in financial year 2002.
This increase was attributable to the increase in the number of sectors flown, increases in charges at certain airports following the events of 11 September 2001 and the full year effect of the increases in charges at London Luton, which were raised in February 2001.
The increase also reflects the higher rates charged at certain primary airports where much of easyJets organic growth was centred in 2002.
Airport charges arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 6.7 million.
9 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Operational and financial review continued Fuel easyJets fuel costs increased by 17.2 per cent from 47.1 million to 55.2 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Fuel charges from continuing operations increased by 1.3 per cent to 47.7 million in financial year 2002.
This increase was considerably lower than the 36.0 per cent increase in number of block hours flown by easyJet.
This change is due to approximately 20.5 per cent decline in easyJets average unit US dollar fuel cost, compared with the previous year, resulting in a benefit to easyJet of approximately 11.9 million.
The strengthening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which fuel prices are denominated, over the course of financial year 2002 also provided a benefit of approximately 1.1 million.
The improved fuel burn of the new Boeing 737-700 aircraft, compared to the older Boeing 737-300 aircraft, assisted the year-on-year change in fuel cost.
Fuel charges in financial year 2001 also included the cost of a financial instrument taken out in September 2001 to cap the Groups fuel price over six months.
Fuel charges arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 7.5 million.
Navigation charges easyJets navigation charges increased by 67.6 per cent from 22.5 million to 37.8 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Navigation charges from continuing operations increased by 48.1 per cent to 33.4 million in financial year 2002.
This increase was principally attributable to the increased number of sectors flown in financial year 2002 as well as an increase in unit charges following the events of 11 September 2001.
The increase was partially offset by a 4.3 per cent decrease in the average sector length to 782 kilometres 2001: 817 kilometres.
Navigation charges arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 4.4 million.
Crew costs, including training easyJets crew costs increased by 44.9 per cent from 39.9 million to 57.8 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Crew costs from continuing operations increased by 33.7 per cent to 53.4 million in financial year 2002.
The increase in crew costs resulted from an increase in headcount during the financial year 2002 to service the additional sectors and aircraft operated by easyJet during the year and the recruitment and training necessary for aircraft not yet delivered.
Crew costs arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 4.5 million.
Maintenance, including reserves Maintenance expenses, including reserves, increased by 86.4 per cent from 28.2 million to 52.5 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Maintenance costs from continuing operations increased by 59.3 per cent to 44.9 million in financial year 2002. easyJets maintenance expenses consist primarily of the cost of routine maintenance and spare parts and reserve payments for the estimated future cost of heavy maintenance and engine overhauls on aircraft operated by easyJet pursuant to dry leases.
The extent of the required annual maintenance reserve payment is determined by reference to the number of flight hours and cycles permitted between each engine shop visit and heavy maintenance overhaul on aircraft airframes.
The increase in maintenance costs was largely due to the addition of a net eleven leased aircraft to the fleet and the resultant increase in flying and the fact that during financial year 2002 all new aircraft were financed under operating leases, necessitating the payment or provision of maintenance reserve liabilities.
Aircraft financed by operating lease incur reserves for maintenance, while the corresponding maintenance effect for owned aircraft is dealt with through a depreciation charge under aircraft ownership.
The maintenance costs arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 7.6 million.
10 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Operational and financial review continued Advertising Advertising costs increased by 45.6 per cent per cent from 13.3 million to 19.4 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Advertising costs from continuing operations increased by 27.9 per cent to 17.0 million in financial year 2002.
In May 2002, easyJet commenced flying four new routes from Paris, the largest new market launched since easyJet commenced its services in London in 1995.
Consequently much of the increased advertising expenditure was focused in this market.
Despite this, spend per passenger was approximately ten per cent lower than the previous year which is principally due to market maturation.
In addition, the majority of organic growth during the period came from starting new routes linking cities already served by easyJet and increasing frequencies on existing routes.
This focus on developing network density resulted in lower advertising than was required to establish new markets.
Advertising costs arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 2.4 million.
Merchant fees and incentive pay Merchant fees and incentive pay increased by 34.1 per cent from 6.8 million to 9.1 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Merchant fees and incentive pay from continuing operations increased by 24.5 per cent to 8.5 million in financial year 2002.
Merchant fees and incentive pay includes the costs of processing fees paid to credit card companies on all of easyJets credit and debit card sales and the per-seat sold transferred commission paid as incentive pay to easyJets telesales staff.
In financial year 2002, approximately 82 per cent of bookings were made using credit cards compared with 87 per cent in financial year 2001.
This reduction, due to the introduction in April 2001 of a customer credit card fee, reduced the rate of growth of credit card processing fees to below that of the increase in passenger numbers during financial year 2002.
Incentive pay paid to telesales personnel remained flat year-on-year due to the rise in initial sales made over the internet, from 86.5 per cent of initial seats sold during financial year 2001 to 91.4 per cent of initial seats sold during financial year 2002.
Merchant fees and incentive pay arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, was 0.7 million.
Gift of shares 1.8 million was charged in 2001, principally in respect of granting a one-off gift of shares to certain employees of the group, which crystallised upon the company obtaining a listing on the London Stock Exchange during 2001.
The charge to the profit and loss account during the year was based upon the estimated fair value of the shares of the company at the date it granted the shares to the employees.
Swiss VAT charges 2.0 million was charged in 2001, in respect of a court decision against easyJet Switzerland.
The Swiss Federal Tax Administration SFTA brought a claim against easyJet Switzerland, relating to VAT on tour operators for services provided.
Following successive proceedings and appeals, in 1998 the Federal Recourse Committee for VAT matters, a specialised court dealing with tax matters, ruled in favour of easyJet Switzerland, stating that its charter operations were not subject to VAT.
In 1999, the SFTA appealed against this decision to the Swiss Federal Court the highest court in Switzerland and gained a decision in its favour during the 2001 financial year.
The total amount claimed by the SFTA is approximately 9.4 million plus interest estimated at approximately 1.0 million.
The group believes that the majority of this has now been be re-claimed from its customers.
Taking into account amounts that the group believes it will collect from these customers, this has resulted in a net profit and loss account charge of approximately 1.0 million, plus interest of approximately 1.0 million.
11 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Operational and financial review continued Cost of integrating businesses of easyJet and Go Fly Costs of integrating the businesses of Go Fly and easyJet were 7.1 million in financial year 2002.
Included within these costs are 5.1 million as an accrual for the costs of the Management Combination Incentive Plan the Combination Plan.
The Plan is designed to reward key participants in the process of combining the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly with free shares if performance milestones are met within certain periods.
Good progress has been made towards the three performance milestones of single brand, single AOC and combination completion.
Other costs have been incurred in respect of systems, property and consultancy costs.
Other costs Other costs increased by 40.1 per cent from 41.6 million to 58.3 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
Other costs from continuing operations increased by 23.9 per cent to 51.6 million in financial year 2002.
This cost category includes the salary costs of all easyJets personnel other than flight crew, cabin crew and ground handling personnel, and therefore includes the salary costs attributable to easyJets administrative, management, engineering, operational and network management functions.
Salaries in this category increased, reflecting the rise in personnel numbers throughout easyJet necessary to manage and maintain easyJets business as the scope of its operations grew during financial year 2002 and in preparation for the further increase in the scale of easyJets operations.
Other items in this cost category include administrative and operational costs not included elsewhere, the costs associated with short-term aircraft wet leases, compensation paid to passengers, certain other items, such as currency exchange gains and losses and the profit or loss on the disposal of fixed assets.
Many of these costs also increased as the scope of operations grew.
The significant increase compared to financial year 2001 was mainly as a result of higher insurance costs, which rose dramatically after the events of 11 September 2001.
Aircraft insurance costs rose from 1.9 million in financial year 2001 to 14.5 million in financial year 2002.
These costs were offset slightly by lower disruption costs principally due to the milder weather experienced in the first half of the financial year, compared to the previous year.
Other costs arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 6.7 million.
Depreciation Depreciation charges increased by 1.2 per cent from 18.5 million to 18.7 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002. easyJets depreciation charge from continuing operations fell by 1.0 per cent to 18.3 million in financial year 2002.
The depreciation charge reflects depreciation on owned aircraft and capitalised aircraft maintenance charges, and also includes depreciation on computer systems and other assets.
easyJet has owned ten B737-300 aircraft over the period and the slight decrease in depreciation primarily reflects the improvement in the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which the majority of easyJet's assets are denominated and the fact that all aircraft introduced to the fleet during the period were financed under operating lease, with none of the owned aircraft being disposed.
The depreciation charges arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 0.4 million.
Go Fly did not own any of its 27 aircraft over the period.
Goodwill amortisation Goodwill amortisation charges increased from 0.2 million to 3.1 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002.
This increase reflects the amortisation of goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Go Fly, provisionally set at 349.8 million, and this is being amortised to the consolidated profit and loss account over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
In financial year 2002, this charge was 2.9 million.
The balance of goodwill amortisation of 0.2 million arose from the acquisition of easyJet Switzerland SA and is amortised to the consolidated profit and loss account over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
12 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Operational and financial review continued Aircraft dry lease costs easyJets aircraft dry lease costs comprise the lease payments paid by easyJet in respect of those aircraft in its fleet operated pursuant to dry operating leases.
Aircraft dry lease costs increased by 76.2 per cent from 23.3 million to 41.0 million from financial year 2001 to financial year 2002. easyJets dry leasing costs from continuing operations increased by 46.8 per cent per cent to 34.2 million in financial year 2002.
This increase was principally due to all aircraft introduced to the fleet during the period being under operating lease.
During the period twelve new Boeing 737-700 aircraft were added to the fleet, with one Boeing 737-300 aircraft being returned to its lessor.
Over the period, easyJet has benefited from the strengthening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which lease costs are denominated, over the course of financial year 2002 and a very favourable leasing market.
As a consequence, easyJet has seen its average leasing cost per aircraft fall by around 20 per cent, year-on-year.
Aircraft dry lease costs arising from Go Fly, from 31 July, the date of acquisition, were 6.8 million.
All 27 of Go Flys aircraft are under operating lease.
Aircraft long-term wet lease costs easyJets aircraft wet lease costs comprise the lease payments paid by easyJet in respect of those aircraft in its fleet operated pursuant to ACMI leases that is, leases of an aircraft plus crew, maintenance and insurance of a duration of more than one month.
The 0.7 million charge in financial year 2001 relates to the costs incurred leasing one aircraft for one month under a five month wet lease for the summer 2000 season.
This aircraft was returned to the lessor as planned at the end of October 2000.
Net interest Net interest reflects interest paid or payable by easyJet net of interest received or receivable by easyJet.
easyJets net interest receivable increased from 2.0 million in financial year 2001 to 10.5 million in financial year 2002. easyJets interest paid or payable primarily relates to financing costs associated with loans used to finance the acquisition of certain aircraft.
easyJets interest paid or payable declined from 8.2 million in financial year 2001 to 5.2 million in financial year 2002.
This decline reflects the effects of lower interest rates, the improvement in the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which the majority of easyJet's debt is denominated, the financing of all aircraft delivered in 2002 through operating leases and the decline in interest bearing debt due to loan repayments.
Interest received or receivable increased from 10.2 million in financial year 2001 to 15.8 million in financial year 2002, reflecting increased cash balances held by easyJet during the year, in particular due to the strong cash generation of the business, the financing of all aircraft deliveries during the year by sale-andleaseback, and the proceeds from the placing and open offer in November 2001 and the Rights Issue in July 2002.
Committed contribution to result of Deutsche BA In August 2002, easyJet and British Airways entered into an Option agreement under which the group was granted an option to acquire 100 per cent of the share capital of British Airways wholly owned subsidiary Deutsche BA Holding GmbH Deutsche BA.
The group is able to exercise the option at any time until April 2003 extendable by the group until August 2003.
The group has agreed to second personnel equivalent to three full time managers to Deutsche BA for no charge as consultants.
The group has also committed to pay British Airways 0.6 million 0.4 million per month from the signing of the option agreement to the date of the option being exercised or expired.
These costs are also included in this cost category.
In financial year 2002, Deutsche BA related costs were 1.4 million.
13 easyJet plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2002 Operational and financial review continued Amounts written off investments easyJet is one of seven shareholders in The Airline Group Limited, a consortium of airlines which owns a minority interest in the company that operates the UK air traffic control system NATS.
During the year, the impact of the events of 11 September 2001 contributed to a substantial reduction in NATS revenue.
As a result there is now a long period before which the Group expects to realise a return.
Accordingly, the Board has decided to be prudent and to provide for the investment in full.
Taxation In financial year 2002, easyJet incurred a tax charge of 22.6 million, an effective tax rate of 31.5 per cent.
The effective tax rate is higher than the UK standard rate of tax due to purchased goodwill not being tax deductible, and an increase in deferred tax due to the adoption of the FRS 19 accounting standard.
During the year, the share price has reduced and as a result there has been a partial claw back of tax allowances granted in previous years in respect of the gain on share options.
These increases were offset by brought forward losses available in the UK, and an exemption from cantonal and communal tax charges for easyJet Switzerland.
Retained profit for the year For the reasons described above, easyJets retained profit after interest and taxes increased by 29.3 per cent from 37.9 million in financial year 2001 to 49.0 million in financial year 2002.
Earnings per share The basic earnings per share increased by 8.5 per cent from 13.47 pence in the financial year 2001 to 14.61 pence in the financial year 2002, 2001 restated to reflect the bonus element implicit within the rights issue of shares during 2002.
The basic earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation, increased by 14.8 per cent from 13.53 pence in the financial year 2001 to 15.53 pence in the financial year 2002, 2001 restated to reflect the bonus element implicit within the rights issue of shares during 2002.
