FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE GROUP FOR THE YEAR ARE DOMINATED BY TWO THEMES: THE SUCCESS OF THE CONTINUING BUSINESS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.
Against a backdrop of considerable change within the Group, RESULTS SUMMARY 2002 was a year of commendable financial performance.
Cox The financial results of the Group for the year are dominated achieved considerable growth in its chosen areas of speciality by two themes: the success of the continuing businesses, and while realigning its operations to reflect changing circumstances.
the management of the discontinued operations.
In summary, continuing operations reported pre-tax profits of 51.2m, In the first half of 2002, the Group implemented the decision a significant improvement on last year, while the discontinued made the previous year to discontinue all Commercial Division businesses in the second half reported a steady improvement underwriting.
An Isolation Agreement was reached with Lloyds in their financial condition.

The Group then successfully completed a capitalthe Financial Statements on page 44, Cox ultimate economic raising and debt re-financing package.
exposure to the discontinued operations is limited to the value of an agreed set of Isolated Assets.
These assets are defined in In the second half of the year, the Group completed its exit from Note 2, and provide for the settlement of liabilities arising from Nuclear and Aviation insurance and further reduced exposure the discontinued operations.
As a consequence, Cox has no within the other discontinued commercial activities.
At the same further economic exposure to the discontinued business beyond time, the reorganisation of head office management and the value of these assets, but will benefit from any surplus reporting processes to address the new Group structure was arising in the Isolated Assets.
At 31 December 2001 Cox had accounted for all of the Isolated Assets and Liabilities except for the future income streams from Syndicate 218 and the discontinued commercial operations.
The Board believes that the most appropriate manner to consider the results of the discontinued operations is on a fund basis, notwithstanding that the accounting presentation will be more complex.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 10 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 The table below summarises the 2002 results on this basis by showing the amount of 23.2m, being the underwriting result net of profit commission for the continuing retail operations, as an element of the Isolated Assets.

RESULTS DISCONTINUED The accounting presentation required for the commercial business differs from the fund basis that the Board feels is a more realistic presentation of the underlying economics.
The principal difference is that of timing.
The Isolation Agreement encompasses the future income stream arising from retail underwriting up to and including the 2002 year of account in addition to the assets and liabilities existing at the balance sheet date.
Whilst part of the retail underwriting result for the 2002 year of account has been recognised in the 2002 profit and loss account, a significant portion will only be recognised in 2003, with lesser amounts in 2004 and 2005.
Provision has been made for all expected claims liabilities and the costs, to the extent not covered by future investment income, of running the operations to closure.
Future income statements will reflect separately the costs of run-off and investment income.
The technical provisions established at the year end have been determined on the basis that adverse development is not expected.
However, were there to be any change in expectation, either favourable or adverse, then either a profit or a loss would be reported as part of discontinued operations.
The maximum cash that could remain to be contributed to the Isolated Assets at any time comprises the amount of benefit derived by the continuing operations from utilisation of the tax losses generated by the discontinued operations plus a financing charge as disclosed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.
In operational terms good progress has been made in the run-off of the commercial activities.
Since June the Company has exited Aviation and Nuclear, and over the year has successfully reduced its exposure to future claims by agreeing early termination of a number of policies.
Claims positions have been firmly managed with some significant savings against provisions.
The overall reserving position at the end of the year has improved from that at the end of last year, and the result has benefited from some modest reserve releases.
With much of the claims liability being due in US dollars, but some of the supporting assets being in sterling, the result has also benefited in some measure from the strength of sterling against the dollar.
Any future benefit from foreign exchange fluctuations will be less as the foreign exchange exposure has been reduced.
A more detailed note on the current position with regard to World Trade Center claims, and the significant uncertainties that still remain, is included in Note 29 to the Financial Statements.

The acquisition of the renewal rights to Crowe Syndicate 963 at the end of 2001, combined with the continuing hard market in specialist motor classes, enabled a growth in Syndicate 218s total gross written premium to 526.7m, an increase of 13%.
The effect of the Isolation Agreement is shown at the bottom of the table where the after-tax result of Cox share of Syndicate 218s results is transferred out.
The remaining underwriting after-tax amount of 5.4m represents the benefit of the agency and profit-share commissions received by the Group in respect of Cox participation in Syndicate 218.
These amounts are not subject to the Isolation Agreement.
DIRECT DIVISION This division comprises two operations: Boncaster, a telephone direct broker, which accounts for approximately 88% of revenues, and insure-shop, a chain of high-street branches.
2002 was a year of consolidation for the Direct Division.
Aggressive cost control has resulted in a reduction in expense ratio to 85% 2001 90% and contributed towards the total division operating profits of 4.2m for the year.
WHOLESALE DIVISION The Wholesale Division comprises agency management, claims management and other services provided to brokers, particularly the provincial market.
Performance was strong in 2002, generating operating profits of 15.1m.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc 12 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 BALANCE SHEET The Groups operations are complex and, with a significant element of activity within the Lloyds marketplace, it is important to understand the structure of the Groups balance sheet.
A consolidating balance sheet is shown below: 2002 2001 Broking and Insurance Isolated Assets Services Syndicate 1208 Syndicate 218 and Group discontinued continuing companies Group Group m m m m m Assets Investment in syndicate capacity 16.9 16.9 17.7 Goodwill 24.5 24.5 25.7 Investment in own shares 2.9 2.9 2.9 Other investments excluding Funds at Lloyds 165.7 193.7 20.4 379.8 310.5 Funds at Lloyds 25.0 54.0 79.0 163.8 Reinsurers share of technical reserves 157.0 78.2 235.2 330.6 Debtors excluding deferred tax 97.8 95.5 76.8 270.1 278.8 Deferred tax asset 45.5 9.4 9.0 27.1 39.6 Fixed assets 26.9 26.9 24.3 Cash 6.0 5.5 27.9 27.4 59.9 Deferred acquisition costs 3.0 35.8 38.8 56.1 Prepayments and accrued income 1.3 7.6 8.9 8.3 488.0 400.6 248.9 1,137.5 1,318.2 Liabilities Technical provisions 484.5 348.4 832.9 1,011.9 Other provisions 2.0 2.0 1.7 Creditors 22.8 7.0 144.5 174.3 265.9 Accruals and deferred income 8.7 36.4 45.1 49.2 516.0 355.4 182.9 1,054.3 1,328.7 Net assets liabilities 28.0 45.2 66.0 83.2 10.5 Net Isolated Assets 17.2 The Group includes in the consolidated balance sheet its share of the assets and liabilities of the Lloyds syndicates in which it participates on a proportionate basis.
The actual assets and liabilities remain within the syndicates themselves.
On this basis the Group has included the assets and liabilities of Syndicate 1208 in full, and for Syndicate 218 at approximately 57%.
However, value will only be derived to the Group as the syndicates close each year of account and release any profits arising.
Under the Isolation Agreement, the Group has pledged any value arising from its participation in Syndicate 218 up to and including the 2002 year of account to the extent necessary to support liabilities within Syndicate 1208.
In the table above the Groups share of the syndicate assets and liabilities are shown separately.
As Syndicate 218 closes each of the open years of account 2000 to 2002, the share of profits arising will be applied to any deficiency arising from Syndicate 1208.
At 31 December 2002 the Group anticipated that after settling the liabilities of Syndicate 1208, there would be a surplus of some 17.2m within the Isolated Assets.
This surplus may be increased or reduced by any improvement or deterioration in the financial position of the two syndicates.
Such change will be recorded in future Profit and Loss accounts as Discontinued if arising from Syndicate 1208, or Continuing if arising within Syndicate 218.
Cox Insurance Holdings Plc ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 13 FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW CONTINUED The significant movements in the Group balance sheet during the year have arisen as follows: Investments other than Funds at Lloyds: the increase reflects the net benefit of new business inflow offset by expense and claims outflow and movements in the market values of investments held.
Funds at Lloyds: the movement reflects the transfer of 138m of funds to support the discontinued business, offset by the deposit of 54m following the capital-raising during the year to support the ongoing businesses.
Deferred tax asset: the reduction in the year reflects the value of prior year losses utilised in the year to shelter current year profits.
The amount of 9m shown as a liability for continuing operations is the benefit derived in the year by the Broking and Insurance Services businesses from the use of discontinued business losses.
Under the Isolation Agreement this amount might have to be transferred to Cox Dedicated Corporate Member Limited if the other assets available to Cox Dedicated Corporate Member Limited prove inadequate to meet its liabilities.
Technical provisions and reinsurers share of technical reserves: the reductions in these amounts reflect, primarily, the payment of commercial claims, and recovery of amounts due under reinsurance arrangements.
CASH FLOW, CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND SOLVENCY Cash flows arising within the syndicates are not available to the Group on a current basis.
These only become available as the individual years of account are closed and the profits are transferred to the members or losses are made good by the members of each syndicate.
In addition, Group profits arising outside the syndicates include amounts in respect of agency profit commission and Crowe administration fees.
Cash is only available to the Group from these areas as the underlying years of account are closed or, in the case of Crowe, as the 2001 year of account closes.
As a consequence free cash flow to the Group is significantly less than might normally be expected from the levels of reported profits.
As part of the re-financing completed in the first half of 2002 the Group secured bank finance which is committed until 30 June 2005, and completed a capital raising of 67m net of expenses.
Immediately afterwards the Group placed 50m with Lloyds to support premiums being written in 2002 and later years.
This amount was subsequently increased to 54m to support additional premium capacity acquired at the end of 2002.
As a consequence of these arrangements the Group has in place the capital necessary to support anticipated premium levels through 2004. DIVIDEND The profits for the year predominantly reflect improved retail underwriting, deterioration within the discontinued businesses, fees in respect of the Crowe contract and profit commission arising to the Managing Agency in respect of underwriting performance.
These amounts are held in Lloyds until the relevant years of accounts close.
In respect of the Isolated Assets this is not expected to be finalised before early 2005.
As a consequence it is not prudent to include these amounts when currently considering possible dividends.
As indicated in the Chairmans statement, the Directors are not recommending a dividend in respect of 2002.
Recognising the performance in 2002 and the prospects for 2003, the Directors have concluded that, in the absence of unforeseen events, it will be appropriate to recommend a final dividend in respect of 2003.
The Directors intend to consider the position again at the time of the interim results announcement.
