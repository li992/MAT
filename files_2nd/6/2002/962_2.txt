Accordingly, the currency translation differences of $2,531 million recorded in note 25 have been reported through the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses on page 32 and appear as an increase in shareholders funds.
These differences do not affect the consolidated profit and loss account or the consolidated cash flow statement.
The currency translation differences which have arisen are mainly attributable to the appreciation of the South African rand against the dollar since 1 January 2002, although the appreciation of the Australian dollar, euro and sterling against the dollar have also contributed.
The non-dollar denominated businesses actually derive the majority of their revenues in dollars, whilst the majority of their costs continue to be incurred in their local currency.
To this extent, the currency appreciation does not impact on the real underlying value of the non-dollar denominated assets within these businesses.
Furthermore, the cash generating ability of these assets is not affected by the currency adjustments described herein.
If the South African rand and other currencies appreciate or depreciate against the dollar in future reporting periods, currency translation differences will continue to appear as an increase or a reduction in shareholders funds, respectively.
However, to the extent that the non-dollar denominated assets continue to derive their revenues in dollars, these potential exchange differences are not expected to impact the profitability of Anglo American or to affect the ability of the company to pay future dividends.
