GlaxoSmithKline 51 Operating and financial review and prospects The Operating and financial review and prospects discusses the operating and financial performance of the Group, the financial outlook and the financial resources of the Group, under the following headings: 52 Financial trends and ratios 53 2002 Year results for the year to 31st December 2002 compared to the year to 31st December 2001 60 Financial position and resources at 31st December 2002 64 Outlook and risk factors Additionally, in accordance with US requirements: 66 2001 Year results for the year to 31st December 2001 compared to the year to 31st December 2000 71 Selected financial data UK US GAAP 72 Results under US accounting principles 2002 and 2001 The results for each year are compared primarily with the results for the preceding year.
Reference is made also to quarterly and half-yearly trends within the results.
Exchange The Group, as a multinational business, operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies.
The results of the Group, as reported in sterling, are therefore affected by movements in exchange rates between sterling and overseas currencies.
The Group uses the average exchange rates prevailing during the period to translate the results and cash ows of overseas Group subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures into sterling and period end rates to translate the net assets of those undertakings.
The currencies which most inuence these translations are the US dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
During 2002 average sterling exchange rates were stronger against the US dollar and the Japanese Yen by four per cent and seven per cent, respectively, and weaker against the Euro by one per cent, compared with 2001. Business performance and constant exchange rates Business performance, which is the primary performance measure used by management, is presented after excluding merger items, integration and restructuring costs and the disposal of businesses.
Management believes that exclusion of these non-recurring items provides a better comparison of business performance for the periods presented.
Statutory results include these non-recurring items.
In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Groups practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate CER growth.
This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year.
The discussion in this review is therefore in terms of CER unless otherwise stated.
