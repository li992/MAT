operating and financial review 29 operating and financial review The following operating and financial review includes certain financial information extracted without adjustment from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
This information is a review only and you should read the entire Annual Report carefully.
Overview We were incorporated on March 21, 1996, and commenced commercial operations in July 1996.
We delivered our software products to our first customer in November 1996.
We established our U. S. operations, which are conducted through Autonomy, Inc. in 1996.
Revenues Substantially all of our revenues currently are derived from licenses of our technology, through direct and indirect sales, including licenses to OEM customers: and provision of support and maintenance under licenses and to OEM customers.
Indirect sales methods include sales by value added resellers, distributors, systems integrators and OEMs.
Our sales force and marketing efforts are used to develop brand awareness and support our indirect channels, as well as to generate direct sales.
Customer support and maintenance agreements are generally entered into in connection with licenses of our technology.
Fees are established as a percentage of the software license price, typically 15% to 18% per year for first-line support and maintenance, and are generally paid annually.
Where collectability of sales revenue is not considered probable at the time a sale is made, revenue is recognized when the cash is collected.
Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenues primarily consists of shipping, software documentation, third-party labor, third-party license fees and other costs associated with the delivery of software products from which license revenue is derived and the cost of providing after-sale support and maintenance services to customers.
Operating Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive, accounting and administrative personnel, professional fees and other general corporate expenses.
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs of marketing programs, including advertising, trade shows, public relations and promotional expenses, and salaries, commissions and related personnel expenses for our direct sales force and marketing staff.
Provision for doubtful accounts represents both specific and general provisions made for accounts receivable where ultimate collection becomes less than probable after the date the sale is made.
Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses, consultant fees and expenses related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our family of products.
These include expenses for technical support we provide to customers in connection with the implementation of our products.
Our results are reported in US dollars.
The major component of foreign exchange gains and losses reported through our statement of operations has been the result of translating our U. S. dollar-denominated cash balances that are held by our U. K. parent company into pounds sterling.
30 operating and financial review Results of Operations Years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Revenues Revenues were $51.0 million in 2002, a decrease of approximately $1.6 million or 3.0% from $52.6 million in 2001.
This decrease was primarily the result of a continued general worldwide slowdown in the macro-economic environment which affected IT spending patterns including, in particular, the lengthening of purchasing cycles.
Cost of revenues Cost of revenues was $0.9 million in 2002, a decrease of approximately $1.0 million or 52.6% from $1.9 million in 2001.
This decrease was primarily due to lower hardware expenditures, third party licenses and appointing third parties for training, implementation and other services.
Gross profit Gross profit was $50.0 million in 2002, a decrease of $0.7 million or 1.4% from $50.7 million in 2001.
Gross profit margin was 98% in 2002, an increase of approximately 2.0% from 96% in 2001.
Operating Expenses General and administrative.
General and administrative expenses, which principally comprise staff and office costs, were $6.5 million in 2002, a decrease of $1.1 million or 14.5% from $7.6 million in 2001.
This decrease was primarily due to lower staff and office costs, and lower costs of third-party suppliers.
Sales and marketing expenses were $29.2 million in 2002, a decrease of $2.5 million or 7.9% from $31.7 million in 2001.
The decrease was due to a number of factors, including a decrease in advertising, promotion, marketing and public relations rates, and a decrease in sales commissions as a result of reduced revenues.
Provision for doubtful accounts was $2.0 million in 2002, an increase of $1.0 million or 100.0% from $1.0 million in 2002.
Provision for doubtful accounts represented 3.9% of revenues in 2002, as compared to 1.9% in 2001.
This increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the insolvency of two customers during the year.
Amortization of share-based compensation was $Nil in 2002, compared to a credit of $0.2 million in 2001.
Amortization of share-based compensation is included in the operating expense to which it relates.
Research and development expenses were $9.2 million in 2002, an increase of $0.9 million or 10.8% from $8.3 million in 2001.
The increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in technical personnel and the development and implementation of new products, including the Autonomys Collaboration and Expertise Networks, Legacy Compatibility Modules and the new development of PODs.
Gain on foreign exchange was $0.1 million in 2002, a decrease of $5.0 million or 98.0% from $5.1 million in 2001.
This decrease was primarily due to conversion of substantially all of our dollar denominated cash deposits into sterling in May 2001, and the relative weakening of the U. S. dollar versus other currencies.
We converted substantially all of our dollar denominated cash deposits into sterling in May 2001.
Other income expense in 2002 consisted of interest income net and write-downs against certain investments.
Other income expense was $3.2 million in 2002, a decrease of $3.0 million or 47.5% from $6.2 million in 2001.
Interest operating and financial review 31 income net was $5.1 million in 2002, a decrease of $1.3 million or 20.3% from $6.4 million in 2001.
The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in interest rates and lower average cash balances as a result of our share repurchase program.
Following a deterioration of the financial status of certain fixed asset investments, we have written down the value of these investments in 2002 by $1.9 million, compared to $0.3 million in 2001.
Profit before benefit provision for income taxes and share of loss of associated company and minority interest As a result of the above factors, we reported a profit before taxes and share of loss of associated company and minority interest of $6.5 million and net profit of $6.1 million in 2002, as compared to a profit before taxes and share of loss of associated company and minority interest of $13.3 million and net profit of $9.4 million in 2001.
This decease is primarily attributable to a decrease of gain on foreign exchange of $5.0 million or 98.0% from 2001 to 2002.
Income taxes We provided for a benefit from income taxes of $0.2 million in 2002 compared to a provision of $3.9 million in 2001.
Our effective group tax rate fell from 29% in 2001 to a benefit of 4% in 2002.
A valuation allowance was recorded against net deferred tax assets to reduce the amount of such assets to that which is more likely than not to be realized.
Share of loss of associated company and minority interest Share of loss of associated company and minority interest in 2002 and 2001 primarily consisted of the retained losses of Dremedia Limited and SoftSound Limited.
Share of loss of associated company and minority interest was $0.6 million in 2002, an increase of $0.5 million, from $0.1 million in 2001.
The increase in share of losses was primarily due to the inclusion of 12 months of operations of Dremedia in 2002 compared to six months in 2001, and increased investment by SoftSound.
Years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Revenues Revenues were $52.6 million in 2001, a decrease of approximately $12.8 million or 19.6% from $65.4 million in 2000.
This decrease was primarily the result of a general worldwide slowdown in the macro-economic environment which affected IT spending patterns including, in particular, the lengthening of purchasing cycles.
Cost of revenues Cost of revenues was $1.9 million in 2001, a decrease of approximately $2.0 million or 51.3% from $3.9 million in 2000.
This decrease was primarily due to lower hardware expenditures, third party licenses and the appointing third parties for training, implementation and other services.
Gross profit Gross profit was $50.7 million in 2001, a decrease of $10.8 million or 17.6% from $61.5 million in 2000.
Gross profit margin was 96% in 2001, an increase of approximately 2% from 94% in 2000.
