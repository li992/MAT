com 3 Financial review Group summary The results for the year reect the significant changes across the Group following the announcement made at the end of last financial year.
We have focused on UK Retail, securing a turnaround in performance, closed loss making operations and disposed of non-core businesses, with the exception of Kings Super Markets where disposal negotiations are ongoing and Hong Kong which we have decided to retain and run as a franchise.
We have also restructured our balance sheet, raising 794m from the property portfolio through sale and leaseback, securitisation and the disposal of other properties as well as 719m from two public Eurobonds.
We completed the changes to our capital structure allowing 2bn to be returned to shareholders, leaving the Group with the right capital structure in place to generate greater value for our shareholders.
We continue to report results from continuing operations for three main operating divisions: UK Retail, Financial Services and International Retail.
During the year, we sold Brooks Brothers and closed the Continental European operation.
The results of these businesses up until the dates of disposal or closure are reported under discontinued operations.
Summary of results from continuing operations 2002 2001 m m Turnover ex VAT 7,619.4 7,342.6 Operating profit before exceptional charges 629.1 480.9 Exceptional operating charges 26.5 Operating profit after exceptional charges 629.1 454.4 Non-operating exceptional income charges 41.2 84.7 Interest 17.6 13.9 profit on ordinary activities before tax 687.9 383.6 Basic earnings per share 17.4p 8.3p Adjusted earnings per share 15.9p 11.9p Dividend per share 9.5p 9.0p Presented below are the highlights for the year for the Groups continuing businesses.

In addition, key features of the Groups profit and loss account including discontinued operations, balance sheet and cash ow are also discussed.
Highlights Turnover up 3.8%: Operating profit before exceptional charges up 30.8%, largely driven by a turnaround in performance by UK Retail: profit on ordinary activities before tax and exceptional items up 30.7%: Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations up 33.6%: and Dividend per share up 5.6%.

Reported sales performance including VAT per quarter improved in the second half of the year following the launch of the autumn ranges in early September.
Like-for-like sales show a similar trend to actual sales.
For the 52 weeks ended 30 March 2002, General Merchandise which comprises clothing, footwear, gifts and home like-for-like sales increased by 3.5% and Food like-for-like sales increased by 4.4%.
The second half Clothing performance was signicantly better than the first, as customers reacted positively to the improvements in product appeal, quality and t. In Womenswear, this was helped by the changes made to product segmentation, ranging from the per una collection, targeting younger customers, through the Perfect ranges, to the Classic shops for the more traditional customer.
The momentum was maintained with the Magic & Sparkle Christmas campaign and the launch of the spring ranges in January, together with the Blue Harbour branding of the casual Menswear ranges.
Customer response to the spring ranges in Womenswear and Menswear has been encouraging and has continued the progress made.
The actions taken to consolidate the supply base and produce more merchandise overseas continue to deliver benets in the Clothing buying margin, which is 3 percentage points higher than last year.
Together with improvements in appeal, quality and t, which resulted in a decrease in the proportion of merchandise sold at reduced prices, this has delivered a significant improvement in the Clothing gross profit.
Going forward, we aim to exploit the opportunities that exist to improve the speed and exibility of the supply chain.
The performance of the Home business was adversely affected at the start of the year by the announcement to close the Direct clothing catalogue business.
This impact was short-lived and sales subsequently improved, further helped by two Chargecard events in October and February.
In addition, we have created 27 Home concept stores within our larger stores.
The performance of the Food business was relatively constant throughout the year, even against challenging comparatives for the second half of last year.
Overall, we maintained our market share in a competitive environment.
We have extended our reach in Food, having opened two stand-alone 10,000 sq.
Simply Food outlets and three outlets at railway stations in partnership with Compass Group.
In the coming year we plan to open a further 20 Simply Food stores.
Overall operating costs have increased by 3.6%.
Employee costs includes an additional 52.8m of performance bonuses for management and store staff which was shared across 56,000 employees, and 26.0m of additional pension costs following an actuarial valuation of the pension scheme.
Property and equipment costs have increased, which is in part attributable to the rental expense following the sale and leaseback transaction, but also the store renewal programme.
These increases are offset by a decrease in other operating costs due to savings in consultancy fees, marketing, IT and cost savings arising out of the closure of the Direct clothing catalogue operation.
Excluding performance bonuses, UK Retail operating costs increased by 0.5%.
com 5 Financial Services 2002 2001 m m Turnover 350.8 363.1 Operating profit 84.2 96.3 Operating profit from Financial Services decreased by 12.1m to 84.2m.
Within this, the operating profit from Financial Services retailing activities was 73.2m last year 81.5m.
The balance of the operating profit is attributable to the captive insurance company which was affected by negative investment returns for the year as a whole due to falls in the underlying markets.

The number of active Chargecard accounts decreased during the year, but the average outstanding balance per customer increased by 7%.
Average customer borrowings have been broadly level year on year which, together with an improved net interest margin, has led to an increase in net income.
In a very competitive environment personal loan advances have fallen.
During the year, we reviewed the bad debt policy and amended our approach to providing for bad debts.
This resulted in a revised write-off policy which, together with an increase on the proportion of balances in arrears and a strengthening of provisions in line with other providers, has led to an increase in bad debt charges of 11.9m across all credit products compared to last year.
In other areas the number of new life and pension policies has fallen year-on-year in a competitive market and personal lines insurance and mortgage protection products have not grown to sufficient scale.
During the year, we have looked at ways of more effectively leveraging the synergies between our retail and financial services businesses.
We have held two discount days in stores for our Chargecard customers which were well received.
Later this year we intend to pilot a combined credit and loyalty card in two regions of the UK, as part of a plan to strengthen and extend the relationship with our customers.
It is expected that the impact of the pilot will add approximately 35m to Financial Services operating costs in the coming year.
This includes the cost of the pilot, together with necessary infrastructure costs.
However, we expect to reduce our ongoing operating costs by some 10m.
International Retail 2002 2001 Turnover m Retained businesses 364.7 373.4 Kings Super Markets 328.7 313.1 693.4 686.5 Operating profit m Retained businesses 20.7 30.0 Kings Super Markets 12.6 11.9 33.3 41.9 Number of stores at the end of the year Owned 42 41 Franchise 132 125 Selling space at the end of the year 000 sq ft Owned 955 954 Franchise 1,095 1,018 6 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Financial review The results from continuing operations include sales and operating profits from Kings Super Markets as the intended disposal has not been completed.
During the year, Kings Super Markets contributed 328.7m to turnover last year 313.1m and 12.6m to operating profits last year 11.9m.
Turnover for the retained International Retail business Republic of Ireland, franchises and Hong Kong decreased by 2.3% to 364.7m.
Operating profits for the retained businesses were down 31.0% at 20.7m.
Within this, there was an encouraging performance in the Republic of Ireland but some of our franchises partners experienced difficult trading conditions, although franchise sales improved in the final quarter.
Our business in Hong Kong, which we have decided to retain and run as if it were a franchise, also traded below last years level in a weak economy and incurred approximately 5m in restructuring and abortive sale costs.
Discontinued operations The Group announced in March 2001 that it intended to divest or close non-core or loss making activities including Marks and Spencer Direct, stores in Continental Europe, Brooks Brothers and Kings Super Markets in the US and to sell the Hong Kong subsidiary to a franchise partner.
All of these have been achieved with the exception of the sale of Kings Super Markets which is currently under negotiation and Hong Kong which has been retained as a subsidiary, but is run as a franchise.
The results of Brooks Brothers and the Continental European operation up until the dates of disposal or closure are reported under discontinued operations.
The cost to date of exiting Continental European operations is 136.8m, including trading losses of 42.5m.
The provision we set up at 31 March 2001 has been utilised against these costs and we have released 10.0m as we now expect the total cost of closure to be less than originally anticipated.
Brooks Brothers was sold for 157.1m.
The disposal gave rise to a book loss of 376.7m after a charge of 368.2m for goodwill which was previously written off to reserves when Brooks Brothers was acquired.
Excluding goodwill, the net loss on disposal was 8.5m subject to nalisation of the sale process.
Asset disposals The sale and leaseback of 78 smaller stores raised 344.1m net of costs and generated a profit of 50.0m which is included in the overall profit on disposal of xed assets of 41.2m.
The disposal of other properties has raised 111.8m net of costs.
Interest Net interest income increased to 17.6m from 13.9m last year, as a result of higher average retail cash balances, which benefited from the proceeds of the disposal of businesses and properties, pending the repayment to shareholders.
Interest payments on intra-group and external borrowings for the Financial Services business are charged to that business as cost of sales.
The operating profit for Financial Services is shown in the segmental analysis see note 3.
The total interest cost incurred by Financial Services was 103.7m last year 115.3m.
In the consolidated financial statements, the excess of intra-group interest over third-party interest payable, has been added back in the segmental analysis to arrive at total operating profit.
The intra-group interest added back this year of 6.4m arose in the first half of the year when the interest charged to cost of sales of Financial Services was greater than the interest payable for that period.
Taxation The pre-exceptional tax charge for the year was 195.7m, giving an effective tax rate of 29.6% excluding the effect of exceptional items compared to 32.9% last year.
The decrease in the rate is attributable to losses in the prior year in respect of Continental European businesses for which no tax credit was available trading losses for this year were provided for at the previous year end.
These rates also reect the adoption of the new accounting standard on deferred tax which has reduced profit after tax by 3.3m last year 6.8m from 156.7m to 153.4m and increased the effective rate of tax by 0.5 percentage points last year 1.4 percentage points.
An adjusted earnings per share gure of 16.3p last year 11.2p has been calculated excluding the effect of exceptional items.
Details of the calculation are given in note 10. Dividend A final dividend of 5.8p last year 5.3p is proposed, making the total dividend for the year 9.5p last year 9.0p.
Cash ow Analysis of free cash ow operating cash ow before acquisitions and disposals and transactions with shareholders is as follows: Cash ow analysis 2002 2001 m m Cash inow from Retail operating activities 853.5 654.2 Cash inow from Financial Services operating activities 240.2 22.2 Capital expenditure 285.7 269.8 Proceeds from asset disposals 455.6 18.9 Net interest received 36.8 13.1 Tax paid 179.4 164.6 Free cash ow 1,121.0 274.0 The cash inow from Financial Services operating activities is stated after a 76.2m decrease this year last year a 117.8m increase in loans and advances to customers.
During the year, the Group acquired tangible xed assets totalling 290.5m last year 255.7m.
After taking into account the timing of payments the cash outow for capital expenditure was 285.7m last year 269.8m.
Of this, 61.7m was spent on new space and 122.0m on store modernisation.
Capital expenditure is expected to be broadly level in the coming financial year.
Net proceeds from asset disposals include 344.1m from the sale and leaseback of properties, together with the proceeds from other asset disposals.
The sale and leaseback transaction has a committed rental liability in the first year of approximately 25m rising by 1.95% per annum.
Capital structure The total movements in net debt comprise the amounts shown in the table below: m Opening net debt 1,277.8 Free cash ow 1,121.0 Dividends 256.7 Net sale of xed asset investments 6.1 Sale closure of businesses 261.6 Issue of new shares under employee share schemes 17.3 Repurchase of own shares 52.0 Redemption of B shares 1,717.9 Issue redemption expenses 9.3 Exchange movement 0.7 Closing net debt 1,907.0 Purchase of own shares During the financial year, 21,446,162 shares representing 0.75% of issued share capital of Marks and Spencer p. l. c. were purchased in the market for a total cost of 52.0m, at an average price of 241.9p.
Financing Bonds were issued in a total amount of 321.5m net of costs securitising the rental income from a portfolio of 45 retail properties.
After interest rate swaps this debt is at an average xed rate of 6.32% with maturities ranging until 2026.
8 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Financial review The Group issued two public Eurobonds during the year, 368.2m net of costs at a xed rate of 6.38% maturing in 2011 and EUR550m, swapped into rates linked to LIBOR resulting in 344.0m net of costs maturing in 2006.
The Medium Term Note MTN programme was increased to 3bn and Marks and Spencer p. l. c. was added as an Issuer during the year.
Twenty five new MTNs were issued during the year excluding the two public Eurobonds with a sterling equivalent of 822.0m and maturities ranging from one to six years.
The Groups total outstandings within this programme at the end of the financial year were equivalent to 2,062.6m last year 1,085.1m.
We currently have uncommitted bank facilities of 498.6m available together with committed facilities of 425.0m supporting our 1bn Commercial Paper programme.
Average interest rates on borrowings were lower during the year at 5.9% last year 6.5%.
Capital restructuring The Group announced on 29 March 2001 that in order to create a more efficient capital structure and improve the potential for a faster rate of earnings growth, it intended to return 2bn to shareholders.
This was effected by a Scheme of Arrangement, details of which are set out in notes 1 and 24 to the financial statements.
Of the 2,848,387,227 redeemable B shares that were issued under the Scheme of Arrangement, 86.2% were redeemed prior to 30 March representing 54.1% of shareholdings.
The remainder have the opportunity to be redeemed next in September 2002 and at six-monthly intervals thereafter.
Historically, the retail business has been debt free.
Part of the intention behind the return of capital was to gear up the retail balance sheet to a more optimum capital structure.
Retail gearing at 30 March 2002 was approximately 27.0%, broadly in line with our expectations.

We will target a xed charge cover of between five and seven times.
In future we will focus on retail gearing and xed charge cover to enable targeting the optimum gearing of the retail business, thereby maximising shareholder value.
Treasury policy and financial risk management The Board approves treasury policies and senior management directly controls day-to-day operations.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups Treasury also enters into derivatives transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and nancing.
It has been and remains the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
com 9 The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, liquidity, counterparty and the financial risks associated with the Financial Services operation.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk in respect of debt on the retail balance sheet is reviewed on a regular basis.
At the balance sheet date interest obligations in respect of the property securitisation and the Eurobond issued in sterling were at xed rates.
As approximately two thirds of the debt currently nances the operation of Financial Services see point e below, current Group policy is to maintain this portion of debt as oating rate and this is achieved with the help of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
b Foreign currency risk Currency exposure arising from exports from the UK to overseas subsidiaries is managed by using forward currency contracts to hedge between 80% and 100% of sales for periods averaging 10 to 15 months forward.
Imports are primarily contracted in sterling and only economic exposures arise.
The Group will be increasing the proportion of imports contracted in local currencies and a policy is in place for the hedging of these exposures, principally using forward currency contracts.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss account translation exposures.
Where appropriate, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
c Liquidity risk The objective is to ensure a mix of funding methods offering exibility and cost effectiveness to match the needs of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are nanced by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, commercial paper and medium term notes.
Commercial paper issuance is backed by committed bank facilities totalling 425.0m.
d Counterparty risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by counterparties.
The risk is managed by using a number of banks and allocating each a credit limit according to credit rating criteria.
These limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
Dealing mandates and derivative agreements are agreed with the banks prior to deals being arranged.
e Financial Services Interest rate exposures for Financial Services are managed, as far as practical, by matching the periods of borrowings and their interest basis with that of the customer debt.
Interest rate swaps are used to convert xed income from personal loan customers to short-term variable income to match short-term variable rate borrowings.
The details of derivatives and other financial instruments required by FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, are shown in notes 18, 21 and 23 to the financial statements.
Euro Approximately 2.6m was charged during the period to complete the necessary work for the introduction of the Euro, giving an overall cost of approximately 7.8m.
Pro-forma profit and loss account The sale and leaseback transaction, return of capital to shareholders and the proposed disposal of Kings Super Markets will have a significant effect on earnings in the coming year.
If these transactions had occurred at the beginning of the year, then we estimate that our earnings from continuing operations, but before exceptional items, would have been as follows: 2002 Pro-forma m Turnover 7,291 Operating profit 602 Interest 49 profit before tax 553 Retail xed charge cover 6.0x Earnings per share 16.7p 10 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Financial review Accounting for pensions Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 to replace SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs and is fully effective for the accounting periods ending on or after 22 June 2003.
This year the Group has continued to account for pension costs under SSAP 24 although in accordance with the FRS 17 transitional arrangements, certain additional disclosures are included in the notes to the financial statements.
The actuary of the Groups UK dened benefit pension scheme carried out a formal valuation of the scheme as at 1 April 2001.
This valuation revealed a shortfall of 134m in the market value of the assets of 3,102m compared to the actuarial liability for pension benets a funding level of 96%.
In accordance with FRS 17, the actuary has updated the valuation of the UK scheme as at 30 March 2002.
The results of the update show that the deficit has increased to 400m 280m after deferred tax.
Details of the assumptions used in the formal and updated valuations are given in note 11A to the financial statements.
The increase in the deficit over the year is attributable to the actuarial loss that would have been recognised through the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses if FRS 17 had been fully implemented.
Approximately 60m of the increase in the deficit over the year results from a reduction in the corporate bond rate used to discount the liabilities from 6.0% to 5.9% with the balance due largely to a lower than expected value of assets in the fund.
The FRS 17 net pension liability has no impact on pension funding and as a consequence has no impact on the Groups current or future cash ow or reported earnings.
Had the Group charged pension costs to the profit and loss account under FRS 17, the charge would have been in the region of 100m compared to the current charge of 148m under SSAP 24.
Outlook for 2002 03 Clothing margins should continue to improve as we anticipate an improvement of approximately 1 percentage point in the Clothing buying margin and lower markdowns following improved performance in the second half of 2001 02.
Food sales will be adversely affected by no Easter trading periods in 2002 03 compared to two in 2001 02 and this will impact sales by approximately 0.7% for the full year.
Underlying UK Retail operating costs for 2002 03 are budgeted to increase marginally ahead of ination.
In addition, there will be: the full year impact, approximately 25m, of the sale and leaseback transaction: one-off costs of approximately 10m, which will be incurred principally for IT and infrastructure in preparation for the relocation of the Corporate Head Ofce: and additional costs of approximately 15m relating to the Zip project offset by a corresponding benefit in the Childrenswear gross margin.
Taking these into account, UK Retail operating costs will increase by approximately 5%.
In addition, the pilot of a combined credit and loyalty card will add approximately 35m to Financial Services operating costs in the coming year.
This includes both the cost of the pilot together with necessary infrastructure costs.
However, we expect our ongoing operating costs to decrease by some 10m and bad debts to return to the level experienced in the previous year.
Going concern statement After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
