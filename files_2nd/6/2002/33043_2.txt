Two of these are measures of the internal results of the Group.
The first of these measures is based on earnings per share EPS.
The table below isolates the impact of major restructuring costs, goodwill amortisation and profits and losses on disposals on EPS.
The result is a 7% increase in underlying EPS.
Excluding the impact of exchange rate movements, underlying EPS growth was 11%.
This exceeded the Groups performance target of at least 10% earnings growth for the period 2001 to 2004.
Earnings per share 2002 2001 % pence pence increase Basic EPS 27.4 27.0 1 Adjust for: Goodwill amortisation 3.2 2.3 Profit on disposal of fixed assets, investments and subsidiaries, net of tax and minorities 0.5 1.4 Major restructuring costs, net of tax 1.9 2.1 Underlying EPS 32.0 30.0 7 Free cash flow was 315 million in 2002 and exceeded the Groups second performance target of 300 million free cash flow see table below.
Free cash flow is the amount of cash generated by the business after meeting all its obligations for interest, tax and dividends and after all capital investment excluding share sales or purchases by the Employee Trust.
Although free cash flow was lower than in the previous year, the Group remains strongly cash generative, reflecting the high margin and cash generative nature of the Groups business.
The decrease in the Groups free cash flow in 2002 compared with 2001 was largely driven by the impact of adverse exchange rate movements and a higher level of capital expenditure.
The Group believes that by maintaining controls on working capital levels it will be able to maximise cash delivery.
Free Cash Flow 2002 2001 2000 m m m Cash flow from operating activities and associates 1,109 1,139 927 Net capital expenditure a 251 233 101 Taxation, returns on investments and servicing of finance 320 295 222 Ordinary dividends 223 214 203 Free cash flow 315 397401 a excluding sale or purchase of shares by the Employee Trust.
The Groups third target relates to Total Shareholder Return TSR.
In 2002 the Group changed the target from an absolute measure of doubling TSR every four years, to a relative measure of top quartile TSR performance against a range of international consumer goods companies over a rolling four year period.
The relative measure of TSR growth is considered more appropriate given the significant influence of macro economic and political factors on the performance of the world stock markets and thus Cadbury Schweppes share price.
In 2002 the Groups TSR performance was second quartile relative to the stated peer group, over this rolling four year period.
This performance puts Cadbury Schweppes in line with, or above, our closest peers in the international consumer foods group.
14 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Operating Review Operating profit refers to Group operating profit before major restructuring costs and amortisation of goodwill.
This is the measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment used by management, as analysed in the Geographical Analysis on page 74 of the financial statements.
Constant exchange rates refer to 2001 and 2002 sales or operating profit translated at 2002 average exchange rates.
2002 Compared to 2001 Overview An overview of the Groups results is given in the table below, which highlights the effects of acquisitions and disposals and exchange rates to show turnover and operating profit growth of 3% and 4% respectively from continuing operations.
The Groups operating profit in 2002 was 983 million, a 6% increase over operating profit in 2001 of 930 million.
This increase was driven by the solid performance in North America Beverages and strong growth in Europe Confectionery particularly Cadbury Trebor Bassett, Asia Pacific Confectionery and several emerging markets.

In 2002 compared with 2001, the biggest exchange rate impact on the Groups results was the 4% weakening of the US dollar.
The Canadian dollar also weakened 5%, the South African rand by 26%, and the Mexican peso by 7%.
These were very slightly offset by the 1% improvement in the value of the euro.
Overall the impact of exchange rate movements on the Group was adverse and therefore turnover and operating profit were 179 million, and 34 million lower respectively, than would have been the case had the exchange rates prevailing during 2001 been applied.
General price inflation in countries where the Group has its most significant operations remained at a low level throughout the year and in general terms was within the 1% to 3% range.
In certain developing markets the rate of inflation was higher than this range, but the impact was generally not significant to the Group results.
Future turnover and operating profit results may be affected by certain trends affecting the principal product markets in which the Group operates.
Changing consumer preferences may Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 15 Operating and Financial Review 2002 Compared to 2001 Overview continued affect growth rates in carbonated soft drinks and certain confectionery products, particularly in developed markets.
The Group has sought to address this through continuing product innovation and diversification, including expansion in still and fruit-based beverages and waters.
In confectionery, the Group has sought to expand its product range in sugar and functional confectionery products and chewing gum.
The Group has also sought to continue to expand its business operations in developing markets which may hold the potential for more significant volume growth.
Acquisitions and Disposals The Group continued to acquire businesses in 2002.
The largest of these acquisitions was Dandy, a Danish chewing gum company with operations in Denmark, Scandinavia, the Benelux Countries and Russia.
The Group completed this acquisition in September 2002 for 222 million.
There were four other large acquisitions during the year: Squirt, a Mexican soft drinks brand in February 2002: a 65% equity share in Kent, a Turkish sugar confectionery company for 70 million in May 2002: Nantucket Allserve, Inc, a US premium beverage company in May 2002: and the remaining 72% of Apollinaris & Schweppes, the Groups German beverage associate, for 115 million in November 2002.
The Group also increased its shareholding in two existing Group companies.
The Group purchased 44% of the outstanding shares of Cadbury India throughout the year for 111 million, which increased the Groups ownership to over 94%, and acquired a further 6% of its associate, Cadbury Nigeria.
The Group now owns 46% of Cadbury Nigeria.
Overall 518 million of goodwill and intangible assets arose on acquisitions during the year.
In addition, the Group announced on 17 December 2002 that it had signed an agreement to purchase the Adams confectionery business from Pfizer Inc. for US$4.2 billion 2.7billion.
The acquisition price includes US$450 million for expected tax benefits.
The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2003.
The disposals during the year were beverage brands in Indonesia and 25% of the Groups holding in Camelot Group plc, to reduce the overall Group ownership to 20%.
The profit on disposals was 3 million.
For further information on certain risks associated with acquisitions see page 140.
Major Restructuring Costs The 2002 results included 53 million 2001: 53 million in expenditure on major restructuring activities, 42 million of which related to integrating acquired businesses into the Group and 11 million of which related to the ongoing business.
The main acquisition integration restructuring schemes during 2002 were the integration of Orangina into Schweppes France 13 million, the integration of La Casera into Schweppes Spain 10 million, and the integration of Hollywood into Cadbury France 10 million.
The costs of these three restructuring schemes were mainly redundancy related.
The costs of the other acquisition restructuring schemes were the integration of Nantucket into Snapple which were a mixture of redundancy and production transfer costs 5 million, and acquisition related restructuring projects in respect of the Lion Nathan, Mother Earth, and Dandy acquisitions 4 million.
16 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 The 11 million of restructuring in the ongoing business related mainly to redundancy costs in certain operations.
Included within the total restructuring charge of 53 million are 38 million of redundancy costs.
Assuming the Group completes the proposed Adams acquisition the Group expects that restructuring costs are likely to rise to around 140 million in 2003, as a consequence of integrating the new business.
Marketing and Capital Expenditure Total marketing expenditure in 2002 was 547 million 2001: 505 million : at constant exchange rates this was an increase of 12% over total marketing spend in 2001.
The Groups marketing to sales ratio increased to 10.3% 2001: 10.2%, the sixth consecutive year of increase in this key indicator of marketing investment, despite the continuing acquisition of lower marketing to sales ratio businesses.
The focus on driving growth and the expansion of the Groups businesses are expected to result in continuing increases in marketing expenditure requirements.
Capital expenditure in 2002 was 279 million 2001: 240 million, an increase of 16% over the level of expenditure in 2001.
The Group continued to implement a major project to standardise business systems and processes Project PROBE using an SAP platform.
This project was a significant contributor to the increased level of capital expenditure in 2002.
The Group also carried out specific projects to increase production capacity in Motts, Schweppes Spain and Cadbury Trebor Bassett.
All these projects were funded from internal resources.
The continuing implementation of project PROBE and other capital projects throughout the Groups businesses are expected to require comparable capital expenditures in 2003, which the Group expects to continue to fund from internal resources.

The net effect of exchange movements during the year was a decrease in reported turnover by 179 million or 3%.
The biggest contributor to this movement was the weakening of the US dollar.
The full year impact of prior year and current year acquisitions, net of disposals, was 364 million.
Group operating profit in 2002, excluding major restructuring costs and goodwill amortisation, was up 53 million or 6% to 983 million.
The net impact of exchange rate movements was a decrease of 34 million or 3%.
Acquisitions, net of disposals, contributed 48 million or 5% against last year.
On a like-for-like basis, the Groups operating profit increased by 39 million or 4% against last year.
The Groups overall operating margin was 18.5% in 2002 which was marginally below last years 18.8%, due to the increasing proportion of non-franchise businesses.
On a like-for-like basis the margin would have been 19.0%.
North America Beverages North America Beverage sales rose by 3% to 1.8 billion and operating profits by 1% to 548 million compared to 541 million in 2001.
At constant exchange rates, sales and operating profits rose by 7% and 6% respectively.
Excluding acquisitions and at constant exchange rates, sales grew 2% and operating profits by 4%.
Volumes for the region increased by 6% driven by growth in still drinks, innovation in carbonated soft drinks primarily Red Fusion from Dr Pepper and acquisitions.
On a like-forlike basis, volumes were flat with the second half seeing a modest increase following a 0.6% decline in the first half of the year.
The like-for-like volume performance was adversely impacted by the termination of certain of Dr Pepper Seven Ups distribution arrangements, which primarily affected 7 UP and Hawaiian Punch during the year.
Excluding the impact of these terminations, it is estimated that like-for-like volume growth would have been around 1% higher in the region in 2002.
After a slow start to the year, Dr Pepper volumes improved as the year progressed, benefiting both from the implementation of the volume impact programme which drove incremental profit and volume through more focused and innovative brand marketing programmes and the launch of Red Fusion in the third quarter.
Overall, Dr Pepper volumes for the year were flat.
7 UP volumes fell 7% due to continued weakness in the lemon-lime category, bottling transfers and intense competition.
In the fourth quarter, dnL was launched with encouraging initial results.
The still drinks portfolio continued to show growth 4.4% with strong performances from Hawaiian Punch through Motts 26% and from Clamato 8%.
Core brand Snapple improved through the year with full year volumes up 3.5%.
Europe Beverages Sales in the Europe Beverages region grew by 39% to 717 million and operating profits by 54% to 140 million.
Excluding exchange rate movements, sales increased by 40% and operating profits by 56%.
Recent acquisitions were a significant contributor to the increase in overall sales and operating profit, notably Orangina in France, La Casera in Spain and Squirt in Mexico.
Like-for-like sales growth of 3% was impacted by unseasonably poor summer weather in Southern Europe while a 22% increase in operating profits on the same basis benefited from efficiency gains in France.
Mexico had another excellent year with strong growth in volumes, sales and profits.
The integration of recent acquisitions is on track, although Oranginas performance in France was impacted by weak and competitive market conditions.
18 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Europe Confectionery In Europe Confectionery, sales increased by 7% to 1,546 million and operating profits by 17% to 247 million.
The impact of exchange rate movements was negligible.
Overall performance of the region benefited from the major investments made in growth and efficiency initiatives in recent years.
The Group saw strong results from the key markets in the UK, France, Poland and Russia and recovery in the smaller markets, notably Spain.
Cadbury Trebor Bassett in the UK had an excellent year with performance exceeding expectation.
Branded volumes grew by 6% with strong growth in chocolate led by moulded and a recovery in sugar volumes in the second half.
Marketing investment was 10% higher with spend focused on a fewer number of core lines and the highly successful sponsorship of the Commonwealth Games.
The business performed strongly during the Christmas season and more innovation is planned around core brands in 2003.
Elsewhere in Europe, France benefited from continued growth in gum, a recovery in its chocolate business and the integration of the previously separate gum, sugar and chocolate commercial functions.
Cadbury Wedel in Poland produced good results in a difficult market through positive movements in price and mix and efficiency gains.
Russia made a modest profit for the full year.
In September the acquisition was completed of Dandy in Denmark, the number two gum business in Europe.
The integration of Dandy into the Group is proceeding as planned.
Americas Confectionery Americas Confectionery operating profits fell by 54% to 20 million.
Sales fell by 19% from 312 million in 2001 to 252 million in 2002.
Adverse currency movements, most notably the Argentinean peso against sterling, had a significant impact on overall sales 59 million and operating profit 5 million.
At constant exchange rates sales fell by less than 1% and operating profits by 43%.
2002 was a challenging year for the Americas Confectionery region with significant shortfalls seen in the Canadian and Argentinean businesses.
In the US, while Jarets sales grew by 1%, margins fell as result of higher trade investment and marketing investment.
In Canada, Cadbury Trebor Allans CTAI volumes fell 7% as a result of significant destocking in the trade during the year, most notably in the last quarter.
However, sales by retailers to consumers were ahead year-on-year and CTAI gained share in both chocolate and sugar.
Together, profits from Jaret and CTAI were 12 million lower year-on-year.
In Argentina, the economic crisis led to a 13% shortfall in volumes and a halving of profits in local currency.
However, the business performed ahead of expectation for the year as a whole and remains in profit.
Asia Pacific In the Asia Pacific region sales grew by 3% to 642 million while operating profits were 9% lower at 99 million.
Positive exchange rate movements contributed 1% to sales and operating profits.
Another record year for our Australian and New Zealand confectionery businesses was diluted by weaker performances in the chocolate business in China and the food and beverages business in Australia.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 19 Operating and Financial Review Asia Pacific continued Our confectionery business in Australia and New Zealand continued to perform well with a double-digit increase in operating profit driven by a 7% increase in volumes.
Performance was driven by moulded chocolate with encouraging results in the sugar business following the launch of Trebor 24 7 and Pascalls brand rejuvenation.
2002 is the third consecutive year of mid-single digit volume gains seen in ANZ confectionery as it continues to reap the benefits of sustained investment in brand development and increased availability.
Cadbury China had a difficult year with a significant reversal in profits after a number of very successful years of growth.
The shortfall was principally related to the combination of falling consumer demand for chocolate confectionery and the trade reducing levels of stock holding.
The combination of these factors was estimated to have cost the business nearly 8 million.
In October, the new business processes and systems programme PROBE was implemented in the food and beverage business in Australia, the first in a staged roll-out programme around the Group.
While the majority of the system worked well, there were start-up problems with the logistics and distribution modules that severely impacted the ability of the business to deliver at the start of the key summer selling season.
It is estimated that the combination of lost revenues and increased costs was around 10 million, all of which fell in the last quarter of the year.
These problems are now resolved.
Africa, India and Middle East Sales and operating profits in the Africa, India and Middle East region AIM increased by 8% and 27% to 320 million and 44 million respectively or by 23% and 46% at constant exchange rates.
2002 was another outstanding year with all major markets performing strongly.
In South Africa, the turnaround seen in the confectionery business continued, driven by recovery in the sugar business.
In India, increased distribution and availability combined with the launch of Chocki liquid chocolate in a tube drove both category growth and market share.
The launch of a low cost range of moulded Cadbury countlines in Egypt contributed to double-digit sales and profits growth.
In May, the acquisition of a majority equity interest in Kent was completed for 70 million.
Kent is the leading sugar confectionery business in Turkey.
Profits were in line with expectations.
Central and Other Central costs increased to a net 115 million in 2002, compared with 101 million in 2001.
This reflected the continued investment in a number of central initiatives including Project PROBE with the first business unit having already implemented the system in late 2002.
In addition the Group continued to expand its global procurement team, which was created in 2001 to better leverage the Groups purchasing power.
2001 Compared to 2000 Overview An overview of the Groups results is given in the table below, which highlights the effects of acquisitions and disposals and exchange rates to show turnover and operating profit growth of 4% and 8% respectively from continuing operations.
Overall volume was ahead of 2000 with a solid performance in North America Beverages and strong growth in Asia Pacific confectionery and several emerging markets.
The Group maintained operating profit margins at 18.8% in line with 2000 levels, despite a change in product mix within the Group as a result of acquisitions in 2001.

In 2001 compared with 2000, the biggest impact on the Groups results was a 6% improvement in the value of the US dollar.
The euro also improved during 2001 up 2%, however weakness in the Australian dollar down 6% and the South African rand down 16% adversely affected results.
Overall, the impact of exchange rate movements on the Group was favourable and, as the table above illustrates, turnover and operating profit were 55 million and 19 million higher respectively, than would have been the case had the exchange rates prevailing during 2000 been applied.
General price inflation in countries where the Group had its most significant operations remained at a moderate level throughout 2001 and in general terms was within the 0% to 4% range.
Acquisitions and Disposals The Group acquired several businesses during 2001.
The largest of these was the acquisition of Orangina Pampryl, the soft drinks brands and businesses of Pernod Ricard, which was completed in October 2001.
The total cost of the acquisition was 445 million.
The two other major acquisitions in 2001 were the acquisition of La Casera, a Spanish soft drinks manufacturer, for 65 million in July 2001, and the acquisition of the ReaLemon and ReaLime brands for 88 million in September 2001.
The Group also completed the acquisitions of Slush Puppie, Carteret a US beverage operation, Spring Valley a juice brand in Australia, Mantecol an Argentinean confectionery brand and Mother Earth a New Zealand health food company.
The Group also purchased the outstanding 20% of Cadbury Egypt for 6 million.
Overall 586 million of goodwill and other intangible assets arose on acquisitions during 2001.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 21 Operating and Financial Review Acquisitions and Disposals continued The significant disposals during 2001 were RC Cola International, and its private-label concentrate business, acquired with Snapple Beverage Group, Schweppes Zimbabwe Ltd, the Groups bottling business in Zimbabwe, beverage brands in Zimbabwe and Serbia, and food brand licences in Australia.
The overall profit on disposals was 31 million.
Major Restructuring Costs The 2001 results included 53 million in expenditure on major restructuring activities.
The key elements of this expenditure included the merging of both the confectionery operations in the UK and Canada and the integration of the Spring Valley, Wave, La Casera, ReaLemon ReaLime and Orangina acquisitions.
The Groups share of operating profit in associates also included 5 million of major restructuring costs which mainly represented the Groups share of one-off costs from Camelot Group plc.
Marketing and Capital Expenditure Total marketing expenditure in 2001 was 505 million 2000: 418 million : at constant exchange rates this was an increase of 18% over total marketing spend in 2000.
Some of this increase was attributable to businesses acquired by the Group during 2001.
Marketing as a percentage of sales increased to 10.2% 2000: 10.1%, the fifth consecutive year of increase in this key indicator of marketing investment.
Capital expenditure in 2001 was 240 million, an increase of 90% over the level of expenditure in 2000.
The Group continued to implement a major project PROBE to standardise business systems and processes, and this project was a significant contributor to the increased level of capital expenditure in 2001.
The Group also incurred expenditure on increased production capacity and a number of projects aimed at improving efficiency in both the beverages and confectionery businesses.
These projects were funded from internal resources.

The net effect of exchange rate movements during 2001 was to increase reported turnover by 55 million or 1%.
The biggest contributor to this movement was the strengthening in the US dollar against sterling.
The full year impact of 2000 and 2001 acquisitions, net of disposals, was 629 million.
Group operating profit in 2001, excluding major restructuring costs and goodwill amortisation, was up 155 million or 20%, to 930 million.
The net impact of exchange rate movements was an increase of 19 million or 2%, while a full year of acquisitions, net of disposals, contributed 78 million, or 10% growth.
On a like-for-like basis, the Groups operating profit increased by 58 million or 8% against 2000.
The Groups overall operating margin was 18.8%, which was unchanged from the operating margin reported in the year 2000 results.
North America Beverages Sales in the region at 1,757 million were up 578 million or 49% on 2000, largely reflecting a full years contribution from the Snapple business that was acquired by the Group in October 2000.
Movements in exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the US dollar during 2001, accounted for a 82 million or 7% increase in reported sales.
Dr Pepper volumes in total were down slightly year-on-year, although Diet Dr Pepper continued its 11 year growth trend with volumes again up in 2001.
The performance of Dr Pepper was most affected by difficulties in the bottling system, where new product and packaging initiatives adversely affected bottler focus.
However, volume trends improved in the second half of the year and were up in the fourth quarter of 2001.
7 UP had a challenging year and volumes were adversely impacted by the launch of a competitive product in the lemon lime category.
The Groups flavour brands performed well, particularly Sunkist and A&W, with volumes up 11% and 6% respectively.
The Motts business had another very good year with like-for-like sales up 11% over 2000.
The Clamato and Hawaiian Punch brands again saw strong volume growth in 2001, benefiting from targeted marketing activity and successful promotional programmes with key retailers.
The Snapple business had a year focused on integration into the Group and volumes were slightly below expectations.
While trends in the second half of 2001 showed improvement, the business was adversely affected by the events of September 11, with the New York City market representing a significant proportion of total company sales.
Operating profit for North America Beverages region at 541 million was up 138 million or 34%.
The impact of exchange rate movements contributed 26 million of this increase, while a full year of contribution from acquisitions, net of disposals, added 63 million.
On a like-forlike basis, operating profit for the region was up 12% in 2001.
Europe Beverages Sales in Europe Beverages increased by 16% to 515 million, which was an increase of 13% excluding the impact of exchange rate movements, with the euro strengthening 2% against sterling during 2001.
In France, branded volume increases were achieved through innovation and increased marketing support.
The core brands of Schweppes and Oasis showed good growth, with volumes up 3% and 5% respectively versus 2000.
In Spain, despite aggressive competitive activity, the TriNa brand achieved 5% volume growth and overall branded volumes for the business were up year-on-year.
Further efficiency gains in this market also contributed to the double-digit profit growth reported by the business.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 23 Operating and Financial Review Europe Beverages continued The acquisitions of Orangina in France and La Casera in Spain in the second half of 2001 strengthened the Groups position in each of these markets.
Both acquisitions performed in line with expectations although the profit impact on the region was minimal.
Operating profit for the overall region at 91 million was 13 million or 17% up on 2000, with exchange rate movements and acquisitions contributing 3% and 1% growth respectively.
Europe Confectionery Sales in Europe Confectionery rose 95 million or 7% to 1,457 million.
Movements in exchange rates contributed 1% growth while the full year impact of acquisitions, mainly Hollywood, accounted for 75 million of the increase.
Cadbury Trebor Bassett in the UK had a slow start to 2001 as the business focused on integration and trading profits were modestly lower year-on-year.
However, seasonal sales were strong both at Easter and Christmas and performance strengthened throughout 2001, with branded chocolate volumes 2% up in the final quarter of 2001.
The integration of the previously separate Cadbury and Trebor Bassett sales forces was completed on time and in line with budget, and at the end of 2001 the business had in place customised sales teams for the Grocery, Impulse and Food Service sectors.
In Ireland, sales were up, and volume performance outpaced the market resulting in market share growth.
In France, the Hollywood business launched three new sugar-free gum products that helped the Company achieve an additional six market share points in the important grocery sector.
The Groups business in Russia broke even for the first time in the last quarter of 2001 and the business was well placed for future growth.
In Poland, turnover and profit growth was achieved by re-focusing on the local brand Wedel, which showed volume growth of 13% against 2000.
Operating profit in the Europe Confectionery region at 212 million was 6% up on 2000.
The net impact of exchange rate movements was minimal, while the contribution of acquisitions to the year-on-year increase was 7 million.
Americas Confectionery Sales in the region at 312 million were 2% up on 2000.
However, excluding the impact of exchange rate movements and the full year effect of acquisitions, underlying sales were 2% lower than reported in 2000.
In North America, the Jaret sugar confectionery business in the US made good progress with sales up 5% at constant exchange rates.
However, in Canada, the integration of the previously separate sugar and chocolate businesses caused considerable disruption.
In addition, some capacity constraints limited the businesses ability to service the market.
These factors combined to contribute to a 5% reduction in sales and significantly lower operating profit.
Importantly, the integration of the businesses was completed and the capacity constraints began to be addressed.
The Groups business in Argentina performed creditably in very difficult market circumstances.
The acquired brand Mantecol generally performed in line with expectations.
Devaluation of the local currency late in 2001 was expected to impact negatively on performance going forward.
24 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Operating profit for the overall Americas Confectionery region in 2001 was in line with 2000 at 44 million.
Excluding the impact of currency movements and the contribution of acquisitions, operating profit was actually down 9%.
Asia Pacific Sales in the Asia Pacific region at 625 million were up 13% on 2000.
Excluding the effect of exchange rate changes and the full year impact of acquisitions, the base business delivered sales growth of 6%.
In Australia, confectionery volumes were up 6% in 2001, following on from the achievement of 4% volume growth in 2000.
This growth had been achieved through investment behind core brands, increased availability and product innovation.
The successful launches of Dream and Viking also contributed to the volume performance.
The business continued to find efficiency gains and these were used to fund the increased marketing investment and generate improved margins.
In New Zealand, total volumes were up 1% in a highly competitive market place.
Product launches during 2001 included Breakaway, Viking and Hazelnut Dream.
The Australian beverages business completed the integration of the Lion Nathan soft drink business with Schweppes Cottees during 2001.
The integration process caused a significant amount of disruption and this adversely affected sales.
However, the integration was completed and with a broader portfolio of brands and a more efficient and effective route to market, the business was well positioned going forward.
In the emerging Asian markets, the Groups businesses continued to make good progress.
The confectionery business in China reported volume growth of 6% and a strong improvement in trading profit versus 2000.
Trebor Wuxi, the chewing gum business acquired by the Group in November 2000, performed well in 2001 with volumes and profit ahead of expectations.
Operating profit for the overall Asia Pacific region at 109 million was 11% up on 2000.
Excluding the adverse effects of currency movements and the impact of recent acquisitions, the results reported by the region were up 15% over year 2000.
Africa, India and Middle East Sales for the region at 285 million were 6% up on 2000, despite a 12% adverse movement due to devaluation of currencies in the region against sterling.
The full year impact of acquisitions, net of disposals, contributed 12 million to sales growth in 2001.
Cadbury India had another very successful year, growing sales by 10% and operating profit by 21%.
Increased marketing spend behind core brands and investment in increasing distribution and availability continued to strengthen the Groups business in India.
In South Africa, the Groups confectionery business recorded share gains in what was then a growing market for the first time in several years.
The Groups food and beverage business, Bromor Foods, reported good volume and operating profit growth in 2001.
The Cadbury business in Egypt performed strongly after a difficult year in 2000.
At constant exchange rates, sales were up 18% and operating profit was more than double the level reported in 2000.
For the overall region, operating profit at 34 million was 21% better than 2000.
Excluding the impact of exchange rate movements and the contribution from acquisitions, like-for-like operating profit was up 25%.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 25 Operating and Financial Review Central and Other Central costs increased to a net 101 million in 2001 reflecting the significant investment the Group was making in a number of central initiatives.
These included establishing a global procurement team to better leverage the Groups purchasing power: increased resources behind merger and acquisition activity: a global commercial team and the development of global advertising material.
All of this investment was targeted at either driving more efficiency out of the Groups global business or supporting the Groups growth plans for the future.
Financial Review Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Groups financial statements in conformity with UK GAAP and the reconciliation of these financial statements to US GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and turnover and expenses during the period.
Significant accounting policies employed by the Group, including the use of estimates, are presented in the notes to the financial statements.
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Groups financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable.
The Groups critical accounting policies are discussed below.
Actual results could differ from estimates used in employing the critical accounting policies and these could have a material impact on the Groups results.
Brands Brands acquired through acquisition, above a threshold of 10 million, are capitalised on the balance sheet and are not amortised, but are subject to an annual impairment review.
If the annual impairment review indicated that a brand was impaired then the impairment would be charged to the profit and loss account in the year.
These brands are valued on acquisition using a discounted cash flow methodology and the Group makes assumptions and estimates regarding future sales growth, prices, marketing costs and economic factors in valuing a brand.
These assumptions reflect managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties which may not be controlled by management.
The Group does not amortise brands, as it believes that through marketing investment in the brand the value of the brand is maintained indefinitely.
Advance Payments in Beverage Market Up front payments are made to secure product installation in the fountain and food service channel of several of the Groups beverage markets.
These payments are amortised over the period of the supply contract on a straight line basis or using other suitable estimates.
The Group also has multi year contracts in respect of branded cold drink vending machines supplied by bottlers, and related payments are amortised over the life of the assets owned by the bottlers.
Cocoa Accounting The Group hedges the cost of its future Cocoa requirements through the use of future contracts via commodity exchanges.
The Group uses hedge accounting to defer profits and losses on these contracts to match future physical deliveries, and this complies with UK GAAP for hedge accounting.
26 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 For US GAAP purposes the Group has not designated its commodity contracts and financial instruments as hedges and all profits and losses on hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account annually.
This is recognised as a UK to US GAAP difference in Note 31, Summary of Differences between UK and US GAAP.
Capitalised Costs The Group is currently developing global standardised business processes and systems, called Project PROBE.
Part of the costs of this development are capitalised and the Group accounting policy has been designed to comply with both UK and US GAAP.
Capitalised costs include the following directly attributable costs: external consultants, internal payroll costs, hardware and software costs.
The local implementation costs will be amortised over the period of their estimated benefit to the business, which is currently eight years.
The central costs will be amortised in line with usage.
These assumptions will be reviewed annually and accounting for capitalised costs could change materially if management used different estimates or if different conditions occured in future periods.
Pensions Under UK GAAP the cost of providing pension benefits is calculated by the use of recognised actuarial methods which are appropriate and whose assumptions reflect the long term nature of the assets and liabilities involved.
Under US GAAP the costs of providing these benefits are calculated using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate that reflects market rates.
The main assumptions made under both UK and US GAAP are the rate of increase in salaries and pensions, discount rates for liabilities, the expected return on assets and inflation.
These assumptions are made in conjunction with the Groups actuaries and are the best estimate of future developments.
The accounting for pensions could change materially if management used different estimates or if different conditions occured in future periods.
Income taxes As part of the process of preparing the financial statements the Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This process involves an estimation of the actual current tax exposure together with assessing timing differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when the Group believes it is more likely than not that these assets will be recovered.
Significant management judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
In the event that actual results differ from these estimates the Group adjusts these estimates in future periods which could materially impact the Groups financial position and results of operations.
Accounting Policy Changes There have been no new Financial Reporting Standards adopted in this financial year.
In 2002 the Group adopted, for UK and US reporting purposes, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force the EITF Issue No.
0025, Vendor Income Statement Characterisation of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products, and Issue No.
0014, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives, which were codified along with other similar issues, into Issue 0109, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products in April 2001.
This resulted in a restatement of Group turnover for 2001 and 2000 to reflect these new accounting provisions.
EITF Issue 0109 clarifies the Profit and Loss Account classification of costs incurred by a vendor in connection with the resellers purchase or promotion of the vendors products, resulting in certain cooperative advertising and product placement costs previously classified as trading expenses to be reflected as a reduction of turnover.
As a result of applying the provisions of EITF Issue 0109, the Group turnover and trading expenses have been restated by 457 million Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 27 Operating and Financial Review Accounting Policy Changes continued for 2000 and 559 million in 2001.
This had no effect on Group operating profit or net earnings.
In 2001 the Group adopted FRS 18 Accounting Policies which did not lead to a restatement of prior year results, and FRS 19 Deferred Tax which did lead to a restatement of prior year results.
In 2000 the Group adopted FRS 16 Current Tax which did not lead to a restatement of prior year results.
Summary of Significant UK GAAP to US GAAP Differences All UK to US GAAP differences applicable to the Group are explained in Note 31 to the Financial Statements.
There are three major differences between UK and US GAAP that are highlighted below: a Under UK GAAP goodwill is amortised over 20 years.
Under US GAAP goodwill is not amortised from 2002 onwards, but is reviewed for impairment annually.
b Under UK GAAP hedge accounting is adopted to account for commodity and financial instrument hedges.
For US GAAP purposes the Group has not designated its commodity and financial instruments as hedges, and all profits and losses on hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account annually.
c Under UK GAAP pension costs are accounted for under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Under US GAAP pension costs are accounted for under SFAS 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS 106 Employers Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other than Pensions.
This means that under UK GAAP, the costs of providing pension benefits may be calculated by the use of a recognised actuarial method which is appropriate and whose assumptions reflect the long-term nature of the assets and liabilities involved.
Under US GAAP, the costs of providing these benefits are calculated using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate being the rate of interest at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled which reflects current market rates.
Share of Operating Profit in Associates In 2002 the share of operating profit in associates increased 1 million to 58 million.
This was the result of a good performance from Cadbury Nigeria, and consistent results from Camelot Group plc and DPSUBG.
In 2001 the share of operating profit in associates decreased by 8 million to 57 million as a result of a further strong performance from DPSUBG, offset by declining results from Camelot Group plc, and the disposal of Amalgamated Beverage Industries Ltd at the end of 2000.
Interest The overall interest charge for the Group in 2002 remained the same as 2001 at 106 million.
This consists of the interest charge arising in Group companies, and the Groups share of interest in associates.
In 2002 the net interest charge arising in Group companies increased slightly by 3 million to 86 million.
This reflected the increased borrowings as a result of the Groups ongoing acquisition programme, mitigated by falls in global interest rates.
This increased Group charge was offset by a fall in the Groups share of associate interest, which fell by 3 million to 20 million as a result of exchange rate movements.
Overall interest cover rose slightly from 8.4 times in 2001 to 8.7 times in 2002.
In 2001 the net interest charge arising in Group companies increased by 58 million to 28 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 83 million, principally as a result of the interest charges on the Groups significant acquisition programme in the second half of 2000 and in 2001.
The Groups share of associate interest fell 1 million from 2000 to 23 million.
Overall interest cover in 2001 fell to 8.4 times from 16.0 times.
Taxation The Groups effective tax rate excluding tax on disposals of fixed assets, subsidiaries and investments increased to 30.9% from 30.6% in 2001.
2 million tax was payable on the disposal gains in 2002 The Groups effective tax rate in 2001 excluding tax on disposals of subsidiaries and investments decreased to 30.6% from 30.7% in 2000.
1 million tax was payable on the disposal gains in 2001.
Minority Interests Profit attributable to equity and non-equity minority interests in 2002 of 27 million was 3 million lower than 2001.
This was a result of the purchase of the major share of the Cadbury India minority partially offset by the 35% minority interest in the newly acquired Turkish business, Kent.
Profit attributable to equity and non-equity minority interests in 2001 of 30 million was 6 million lower than 2000.
This reduction is a result of the ongoing process of buying out minorities, which continued in 2001 with Cadbury Egypt, which was bought in July.
Dividends The total dividend for 2002 of 11.5 pence per share was 5% higher than in 2001 and represents underlying dividend cover of 2.8 times.
Further dividend information for shareholders is given in Additional Information for Shareholders on page 132.
Capital Structure and Resources During 2002 the Groups market capitalisation decreased by nearly 1.2 billion to 7.9 billion, due to a 63 pence decrease in the share price during the year to 382 pence at 29 December 2002 445 pence at 30 December 2001.
Net borrowings rose during the year from 1,637 million at the end of 2001, to 1,846 million at the end of 2002, representing 23% of total market capitalisation.
The Group intends to manage its capital structure proactively to maximise shareholder value whilst maintaining flexibility to take advantage of opportunities which arise to grow its business.
One element of the Groups strategy is to make targeted, value-enhancing acquisitions.
It is intended that these will, where possible, be funded from cash flow and increased borrowings.
The availability of suitable acquisitions, at acceptable prices is, however, unpredictable.
Accordingly, in order to maintain flexibility to manage the capital structure, the Company has sought, and been given, shareholder approval to buy back shares as and if appropriate.
This authority has only been used once, in 1999, when 24 million shares representing approximately 1% of the Companys equity were purchased.
Renewal of this authority will be sought at the Annual General Meeting in May 2003.
Additionally, many of the obligations under the Groups share plans described in Note 30 to the Financial Statements will be satisfied by existing shares purchased in the market by the Cadbury Schweppes Employee Trust the Employee Trust rather than by newly issued shares.
The Employee Trust did not purchase any shares during 2002 2001: 23 million purchased and held 52 million shares at the end of 2002, representing approximately 2.5% of the Companys issued share capital.
At the end of 2002, the total of short-term and long-term borrowings was 2,318 million compared with 2,094 million at the end of 2001.
Cash and liquid resources increased to 472 million at the end of 2002 compared to 457 million at the end of 2001.
The Groups borrowings net of cash and short-term investments increased to 1,846 million at the end of Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 29 Operating and Financial Review Capital Structure and Resources continued 2002, from 1,637 million at the end of 2001.
66% of the gross debt of the Group at the end of 2002 was due after one year, but all debt due within one year was supported by undrawn committed facilities maturing after more than one year.
Gearing, defined as borrowings net of cash and short-term investments, expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds plus equity minority interests, increased to 61% at the end of 2002 from 56% at the end of 2001.
At the end of 2002, 75% of the Groups net borrowings were either at fixed rates or converted to fixed rates through the use of interest rate swaps.
It should be noted, however, that the year-end is the low point in the Groups seasonal borrowing cycle.
Further information on the Groups use of derivative financial instruments is given below.
Interest cover was 8.7 times in 2002 compared with 8.4 times in 2001.
Capital expenditure in 2003 is expected to be in line with 2002.
At 29 December 2002 the Group had capital commitments of 17 million, principally in respect of replacement and expansion of manufacturing facilities in North America and Asia Pacific.
It is anticipated that these commitments will be financed out of the Groups operational free cash flow.
At 29 December 2002 the Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 4.1 billion.
3.8 billion relates to a new revolving credit facility which has a maturity of up to five years.
The margins payable on these borrowing facilities are LIBOR plus 0.4% to 0.65% per annum.
This increased facility has been put in place in preparation for the acquisition of the Adams businesses from Pfizer and replaces existing facilities.
This facility is subject to customary covenants and events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to affect Group operations.
In view of its committed facilities, liquid resources and cash flow from operations, the Group believes that there are sufficient funds available to meet its anticipated cash flow requirements for the foreseeable future.
As a result of the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Adams, which is to be totally funded by debt, the Groups long-term credit rating has been downgraded by Standard & Poors from A to BBB.
The main effect of this is to increase the cost of borrowing for the Group, although the impact is not expected to be material.
The table below summarises the Groups contractual obligations as at 29 December 2002.
Payments due by Period Total 1year 13years 35years 5years Contractual Obligations m m m m m Bank Loans and Overdrafts 102 98 4 FinanceLeases 18 4 75 2 Other Borrowings 2,198 689 426 1,046 37 OperatingLeases 250 42 65 37106 Total 2,568 833 502 1,088 145 The Company has guaranteed borrowings and other liabilities of certain subsidiary undertakings, the amounts outstanding and recognised on the Group Balance Sheet at 29 December 2002 being 2,188 million 2001: 1,959 million.
The Company has also guaranteed certain contingent liabilities of some undertakings in which it has an equity interest, the maximum liability at 29 December 2002 being 12 million 2001: 12 million.
Subsidiary undertakings have guarantees and indemnities outstanding amounting to 50 million 2001: 52 million.
While there are exchange control restrictions which affect the ability of certain of the Groups 30 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group, the operations affected by such restrictions are not material to the Group as a whole and the Group does not believe such restrictions have had or will have any material adverse impact on the Group as a whole or the ability of the Group to meet its cash flow requirements.
Cash Flows Net cash flow from operating activities as shown in the Cash Flow Statement on page 73 was 1,096 million in 2002 compared with 1,101 million in 2001 and 908 million in 2000.
Note 26 to the Financial Statements contains further detail.
These cash flows include a net working capital decrease of 5 million in 2002, a decrease of 88 million in 2001 and a decrease of 37 million in 2000.
Cash purchases of fixed assets were 288 million in 2002, compared with 239 million in 2001 and 126 million in 2000.
This increase was primarily due to the continued spend on Project PROBE.
Financial investments represent 86 million of share purchases by the Employee Trust in 2001 and 65 million in 2000.
No shares were purchased by the Employee Trust in 2002.
The cash outflow in 2002 on acquisitions was 628 million.
This included the acquisition of Dandy, a Danish chewing gum company, for 222 million: Squirt: a 65% majority share in Kent: and Nantucket Allserve, Inc. as well as increasing the shareholdings in Cadbury India, Cadbury Nigeria and Apollinaris & Schweppes.
These acquisitions were funded from a combination of commercial paper and medium-term note issuance as described below.
Disposal proceeds of 4 million arose principally from the disposal of brands in Indonesia and the reduction in the Camelot Group plc shareholding to 20%.
Assuming completion of the Adams transaction in 2003, cash outflow for acquisitions in 2003 will be substantially increased.
The Company nonetheless expects to have sufficient funds available to meet such acquisition costs and other anticipated cash flow requirements from committed facilities, liquid resources and cash flow from operations.
The cash outflow in 2001 on acquisitions was 798 million.
This included the acquisition of Orangina Pampryl, a division of Pernod Ricard, ReaLemon ReaLime and La Casera as well as a payment of US$200 million 139 million to the vendor of Snapple for the benefit of a US tax election.
This election is expected to generate annual cash tax savings over fifteen years with an estimated present value of US$250 million 172 million.
These acquisitions were funded by a combination of commercial paper and medium-term note issuance.
Disposal proceeds of 84 million arose principally from the sale of the international brands of RC Cola and of the Groups beverage business in Zimbabwe.
The cash outflow on acquisitions in 2000 was 1,078 million.
This included the acquisitions of Snapple, Hollywood, Mauna Lai and the Lion Nathan bottling operations as well as the minority interest buyout in South Africa.
These were financed principally from new issues of commercial paper.
Disposal proceeds of 39 million arose primarily from the sale of the Groups interest in Amalgamated Beverage Industries Ltd see Note 2 to the Financial Statements.
Net cash flows before the use of liquid resources and financing were an outflow of 295 million in 2002, 403 million in 2001 and 703 million in 2000.
Excluding Employee Trust share sales and purchases, acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and investments, free cash flow was 315 million in 2002, 397 million in 2001 and 401 million in 2000.
The net cash inflow from the use of liquid resources and financing during 2002 was 324 million.
The most significant part of this was the issue during the year of new Medium Term Notes to the value of 437 million with a weighted average life to maturity of 4.2 years, extending the repayment profile of the Groups debt.
The issue of these Medium Term Notes was Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 Cadbury Schweppes 31 Operating and Financial Review Cash Flows continued used primarily to repay commercial paper which had been issued to fund acquisitions in the short-term.
Details of the resulting currency and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings are disclosed in Notes 19 and 20 to the Financial Statements.
The net cash inflow from the use of liquid resources and financing during 2001 was 402 million.
The most significant part of this was the issue of new Medium Term Notes to the value of 1,070 million, extending the repayment profile of the Groups debt.
The proceeds of these Medium Term Notes were used primarily to repay commercial paper which had been issued to fund acquisitions in the short-term.
The net cash inflow from the use of liquid resources and financing during 2000 was 685 million.
The most significant part of this was increased commercial paper borrowings used principally to fund the acquisition of Snapple and also the redemption of a 150 million 8% Eurobond.
During 2000 the Group issued a US$300 million 7.75% Eurobond, maturing in 2005, and swapped the proceeds to sterling.
Net cash increased during 2002 by 29 million, decreased in 2001 by 1 million and decreased by 18 million in 2000.
The Group invests its cash predominantly in instruments with investment grade credit ratings and the maximum exposure to any single counterparty is strictly limited.
Treasury Risk Management The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international business.
Derivative financial instruments are utilised by the Group to lower funding costs, to diversify sources of funding, to alter interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
These instruments are entered into in accordance with policies approved by the Board of Directors and are subject to regular review and audit.
Substantially all financial instruments hedge specifically identified actual or anticipated transactions: movements in their fair value are highly negatively correlated with movements in the fair value of the transactions being hedged and the term of such instruments is not greater than the term of such transactions or any anticipated refinancing or extension of them.
Such anticipated transactions are all in the normal course of business and the Group is of the opinion that it is highly probable that they will occur.
Liquidity Risk The Group seeks to achieve a balance between certainty of funding even at difficult times for the markets or the Group and a flexible, cost-effective borrowings structure.
The policy, therefore, seeks to ensure that at a minimum all projected net borrowing needs are covered by committed facilities.
Also, the objective for debt maturities is to ensure that the amount of debt maturing in any one year is not beyond the Groups means to repay and refinance.
To this end the policy provides that at least 75% of year end net debt should have a maturity of one year or more and at least 50%, three years or more.
Committed but undrawn facilities are taken into account for this test.
Interest Rate Risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and manages these by the use of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps.
The objectives for the mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings are set to reduce the impact of an upward change in interest rates while enabling benefits to be enjoyed if interest rates fall.
Thus the policy sets minimum and maximum levels of the total of net debt and preferred securities permitted to be at fixed rates in various time bands, ranging from 50% to 100% for the period up to six months, to 0% to 30% when over 32 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2002 five years.
78% was at fixed rates of interest at the year-end, but the year-end level of total net debt is typically 150 million to 200 million lower than the annual average.
Assuming no changes to the borrowings or hedges, it is estimated that a rise of 1 percentage point in interest rates in all currencies in which the Group has borrowings would have affected 2002 profit before tax by less than 1%.
Currency Risk The Group operates internationally giving rise to exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly the US dollar.
The Group does not hedge translation exposure and earnings because any benefit obtained from such hedging can only be temporary.
If the exchange rates prevailing at the year-end had applied throughout 2002, underlying earnings per share would have decreased by 4%.
The Group seeks to relate the structure of borrowings to the trading cash flows that service them and the Groups policy is to maintain broadly similar fixed charge cover ratios for each currency bloc.
Also, the ratio for any currency bloc may not fall below two times in any calendar year.
This is achieved by raising funds in different currencies and through the use of hedging instruments such as swaps.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures arising from its international trade.
The Groups policy is to take forward cover for all forecasted receipts and payments for as far ahead as the pricing structures are committed, subject to a minimum of three months cover.
The Group makes use of the forward foreign exchange markets to hedge its exposures.
The table below presents the changes in fair value of the Groups financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates.
The fair values are quoted market prices or, if not available, values estimated by discounting future cash flows to net present values.
The change in fair values for interest rate movements assumes an instantaneous 1% 100 basis points decrease in interest rates of all currencies, from their levels at 29 December 2002, with all other variables remaining constant.
The change in fair values for exchange rate movements assumes an instantaneous 10% weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from their levels at 29 December 2002, with all other variables remaining constant.
Further information on fair values is set out in Note 20 e to the Financial Statements.
The sensitivity analysis below shows forward-looking projections of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
This is a method of analysis used to assess and mitigate risk and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
Actual results and market conditions in the future may be materially different from those projected and changes in the instruments held and in the financial markets in which the Group operates could cause losses to exceed the amounts projected.

A significant proportion of these forward contracts is held in the form of cocoa futures, which subsequently can be converted into physical supply contracts with commercial suppliers.
The use of futures contracts enables the Group to obtain the benefit of guaranteed contract performance on firm priced contracts offered by the exchanges and their clearing houses.
The sensitivity analysis in the table below reflects the market risk to the Group of an adverse price movement of 10%, based on the net commodity position of the Group at four dates equally spaced during the year.
Net commodity positions consist of the excess of futures contracts held over unpriced forward contracts for the same commodities, principally cocoa.
Stocks, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases are not included in the calculations of the sensitivity analysis.
A loss is defined, for the purpose of defining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from a 10% adverse price movement.
The fair values of net commodity positions were based on official settlement prices on the LIFFE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange and CSCE Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, Inc. on the relevant dates.
Current Value Market Risk m m Highest long position 9710 Lowest long position 38 4 Average long position 64 8 Credit Risk The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given the Groups policy of selecting only counterparties with high credit ratings.
The credit exposure of interest rate and foreign exchange contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date.
