Annual Report and Financial Statements Finance Directors Review Profit and loss account Turnover Turnover for the year was 16.6% lower at 383.5m 2001: 459.5m.
In the second half of 2002, turnover was 6.2% lower than in the first half reflecting a weakening of economic conditions in the majority of markets in which the Group operates.
Turnover from temporary placements decreased by 6.7% to 242.2m 2001: 259.6m and represented 63.2% 2001: 57.1% of Group turnover.
This increasing proportion supports the widely held view that activity in temporary placements is less affected than permanent placements in an economic slowdown.
Gross profit revenue Revenue for the year decreased by 21.4% to 192.6m 2001: 245.1m representing an overall gross margin of 50.2% 2001: 53.3%.
The percentage reduction in revenue is greater than the reduction in turnover because of the higher proportion of temporary placements in 2002.
Revenue from temporary placements was 59.7m 2001: 62.8m and represented 31.0% 2001: 25.6% of Group revenue.
The gross margin achieved on temporary placements increased marginally to 24.7% 2001: 24.2%.
The graph below plots the Groups quarterly revenue for the last three years.
It shows revenue peaking in the first quarter of 2001 at 69.6m and then declining sequentially to 49.5m in the first quarter of 2002.
After three relatively stable quarters of around 50m from the fourth quarter of 2001 to the second quarter of 2002, revenue declined into quarters three 47.8m and four 43.9m of 2002.

One of the main factors in the reduced expense is the lower profit related bonuses payable to staff.
Administrative expenses in the first half of 2002 were 83.0m, reducing to 77.5m in the second half.
This reduction in the second half is primarily due to fewer numbers of staff.
The Groups largest category of expenditure is the remuneration of our consultants and support staff.
Headcount of the Group was 2,657 at 1 January 2002 and reduced to 2,440 at 30 June.
The Groups headcount remained relatively stable during the second half of the year and at 31 December 2002 we employed 2,390 consultants and support staff.
As a result of the revenue decline and the Groups high operational gearing, operating profit was 32.1m 2001: 64.0m before exceptional items.
There were no exceptional items in 2002.
Net interest The net interest receivable in the year was 0.5m 2001: 4.1m payable.
During the year 0.8m of interest was earned on surplus cash balances which were invested in the short-term money market.
Interest paid during the year includes interest on loan notes which were repaid in full at the end of December 2002.
Taxation Tax on profits before goodwill amortisation was 11.4m 2001: 20.5m before exceptional items, representing an effective tax rate of 35.0% 2001: 34.1% before exceptional items.
The rate was higher than the UK corporation tax rate of 30% as a result of non-deductible business expenses, profits arising in higher tax rate jurisdictions, and losses which are unable to be offset against profits in the current year and against which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The effective rate increased in 2002 as a result of disallowable expenditure being a greater proportion of taxable profits and higher unrelieved losses.
Earnings per share and dividends Basic earnings per share were 5.8p 2001: 11.8p and adjusted earnings per share before exceptional items were 5.8p 2001: 10.6p.
The weighted average number of shares for the year was 366,355,000 2001: 370,714,000.
The 2002 average number of shares was lower than 2001 due to the full year effect of shares held in the employee benefit trust and the impact of the shares repurchased and cancelled during the second half of 2002.
A maintained final dividend of 2.3p 2001: 2.3p per ordinary share has been proposed by the Directors which, together with the interim dividend of 1.1p 2001: 0.275p per ordinary share, makes a total dividend for the year of 3.4p 2001: 2.575p per ordinary share.
The final dividend, which amounts to 8.2m, will be paid on 6 June 2003 to those shareholders on the register at 9 May 2003.
Balance sheet The Group had net assets of 58.9m at 31 December 2002 2001: 62.4m of which 21.4m 2001: 14.3m is represented by net cash.
With retained earnings of 8.9m for the year, the reduction in net assets is solely a consequence of the share repurchase programme.
During the year we spent 13.7m buying back 11.3m shares at an average cost of 121p per share.
Capital expenditure is fundamentally driven by the Groups headcount.
As headcount reduced during 2002 the amount of capital expenditure on tangible fixed assets net of disposal proceeds was a modest 2.5m 2001: 11.2m.
Capital expenditure in 2003 will increase as a result of the fit out costs of the new building in London and the implementation of the new IT system.
Michael Page International plc - 7 Annual Report and Financial Statements Finance Directors Review Trade debtors have reduced to 53.2m at 31 December 2002 2001: 65.7m reflecting a small improvement in Group debtor days to 51 days 2001: 52 days and the lower business activity at the end of 2002 when compared to the end of 2001.
Within creditors the amount of accruals and deferred income has reduced to 21.4m at 31 December 2002 2001: 24.7m primarily because of lower bonus accruals following the fall in profitability.
Cash flow At the start of the year the Group had net cash of 14.3m.
During the year the Group generated net cash from operating activities of 46.7m 2001: 75.9m being 40.5m 2001: 65.9m of EBITDA and a reduction in working capital requirements of 6.2m 2001: 10.0m.
The principal payments have been: The purchase of 11.3m Michael Page International shares for cancellation at a cost of 13.7m: 2.5m 2001: 11.2m of capital expenditure, net of disposal proceeds, on property, infrastructure, information systems and motor vehicles for staff: Taxes on profits of 11.5m 2001: 18.1m : Dividends of 12.5m 2001: 1.0m.
At 31 December 2002 the Group had net cash balances of 21.4m.
Treasury management and currency risk It is the Directors intention to finance the activities and development of the Group principally from retained earnings and to operate the Groups business while maintaining the net debt cash position within a relatively narrow band.
Cash generated in excess of these requirements will be used to buy back the Companys shares for which renewal of the existing authority is being sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits with any working capital requirements being provided by local overdraft facilities.
In addition the Group has a committed 40m facility, which expires on 1 March 2004.
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.
The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures nor is there a material exposure to foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations although our policy is not to hedge this exposure.
