Wholesale Banking improved its position year on year by $292 million, despite a $75 million charge for Argentina.
This was achieved through a pro-active focus on risk management and a strong performance on recoveries.

Post tax return on equity normalised was 13.4 per cent, up from 12.0 per cent in 2001.

Consumer Banking Consumer Banking remains of prime importance to the Bank.
Revenue has increased by nine per cent from $2,222 million in 2001 to $2,416 million in 2002, and costs have been reduced by five per cent to $1,190 million.
The total debt charge has increased by $273 million to $603 million mainly due to the bankruptcy situation in Hong Kong.
This reduced the operating profit by two per cent from $638 million to $623 million.
The following table provides an analysis of operating profit before tax by geographic segment for Consumer Banking.

However, profits before bad debts have increased by four per cent.
Market conditions continue to be difficult with rising unemployment, reduced margins and the bankruptcy problem affecting the whole industry.
This has impacted revenue and bad debts.
Revenue has fallen by three per cent largely because the Group took decisive and early action to mitigate bankruptcy risk in its unsecured portfolio.
Revenues from cards and personal loans fell by twelve per cent, while revenues from Mortgages and Wealth Management grew by eight per cent.
Growth in Mortgages was from improved margins and volume growth.
Wealth Management delivered strong growth in fee-based income, partially offset by declining margins as a result of the low interest rate environment in response to lower revenues.
Costs in Hong Kong have been strongly managed and have been reduced by $52 million.
Singapore has increased operating profit by 25 per cent and significantly increased its market share in secured and unsecured lending.
This has been driven by lower funding costs, the successful launch of the innovative MortgageOne housing loan solution which offers debt consolidation, Liquidity Management and Wealth Management, and through leveraging Standard Chartereds Qualifying Full Banking licence.

Malaysia has generated an additional $98 million, MESA $65 million and Hong Kong $43 million.
In MESA and India the improved performance was in part due to the integration of the Grindlays acquisition and higher volume growth and improved margins in Global Markets.
In Africa, the reduction in revenue of $29 million was driven by hyper-inflationary adjustments in Zimbabwe.
The profit in the Americas and the United Kingdom has fallen from $95 million to $41million.
This is mainly due to a $75 million charge taken against Argentina in the first quarter of 2002, and costs associated with repositioning the business.
An analysis of revenue by product is set out below: 2002 2001 $million $million Trade and Lending 775 849 Global Markets 973 914 Cash Management 315 355 Custody 60 65 2,123 2,183 Trade and Lending revenues have fallen by nine per cent from $849 million to $775 million.
The reduction in business is in line with the strategy to trade revenue for risk and to concentrate resources on Global Markets.
This, together with weak market demand, has had an impact on results.
Global Markets revenue has increased by six per cent to $973 million.
Asset and liability management is a significant component within Global Markets and the positions taken generated substantial revenues in the low interest rate environment, particularly in the first half of 2002.
Revenue growth was also generated as the Group focused on higher return business.
Cash Management balances have grown significantly by 16 per cent but revenues have not improved as margins have declined as a result of the low interest rate environment.
The reduction in Custody revenues by eight per cent reflects the decrease in equity activity as this business is driven by volume and equity values.
However, partially offsetting this was additional revenue from winning new mandates.
Costs have risen by $20 million.
Costs in 2002 include $45 million staff redundancy and other costs associated with repositioning the business.
Investment to enhance product capability has been funded by other underlying cost efficiencies within the Wholesale Banking business.
The significant improvement in the charge for debts reflects the risk management initiatives over the last two years and strong recoveries.

The long-term portfolio, i. e. with a maturity of over five years, primarily relates to the Consumer Banking retail mortgages portfolio.
Approximately 52 per cent 2001: 52 per cent of total loans and advances to customers relate to Consumer Banking lending, predominantly personal residential mortgages.
The Wholesale Banking portfolio is well diversified across both geography and industry.
The Group does not have any significant concentration to industries of special interest such as Telecommunications, Aviation and Tourism.
Exposure to each of these industries is less than five per cent of Wholesale Banking loans and advances to customers.
Problem Credits The Group employs a variety of tools to monitor the portfolio and to ensure the timely recognition of problem credits.
In Wholesale Banking, accounts are placed on Early Alert when they display signs of weakness.
Such accounts are subject to a dedicated process involving senior risk officers and representatives from a specialist recovery unit, which is independent of the business units.
Account plans are re-evaluated and remedial actions are agreed and monitored until complete.
Remedial actions include, but are not limited to, exposure reduction, security enhancement, exit of the account or immediate movement of the account into the control of the specialist recovery unit.
In Consumer Banking, an account is considered to be in default when payment is not received on the due date.
Accounts that are overdue by more than 30 days 60 days for mortgages are considered delinquent.
These are closely monitored and subject to a special collections process.
In general, loans are treated as non-performing when interest or principal is 90 days or more past due.
Consumer Banking Provisions are derived on a formulaic basis depending on the product: Mortgages: a provision is raised where accounts are 150 days past due based on the difference between the outstanding value of the loan and the forced sale value of the underlying asset.
Credit cards: a charge off is made for all balances which are 150 days past due or earlier as circumstances dictate.
In Hong Kong charge off is currently at 120 days.
Other unsecured Consumer Banking products: a charge off is made at 150 days past due.
Other secured Consumer Banking products: a provision is raised at 90 days past due for the difference between the outstanding value and the forced sale value of the underlying asset.
The underlying asset is then re-valued periodically until disposal.
30 Standard Chartered It is current practice to provision and write off exposure in respect of Hong Kong bankruptcies at the time the customer petitions for bankruptcy.
The Small and Medium Enterprises SME portfolio is provisioned on a case by case basis.
The following table sets out the non-performing portfolio in Consumer Banking: 2002 Asia Pacific Middle Americas, Hong Other East & Other UK & Group Kong Singapore Malaysia Asia Pacific India South Asia Africa Head Office Total $million $million $million $million $million $million $million $million $million Loans and advances Gross non-performing 118 111 176 68 41 27 15 18 574 Specific provisions for bad and doubtful debts 45 18 24 16 8 7 8 1 127 Interest in suspense 1 3 22 10 7 7 7 1 58 Net non-performing loans and advances 72 90 130 42 26 13 16 389 Cover ratio 32% 2001 Asia Pacific Middle Americas, Hong Other East & Other UK & Group Kong Singapore Malaysia Asia Pacific India South Asia Africa Head Office Total $million $million $million $million $million $million $million $million $million Loans and advances Gross non-performing 164 115 168 68 39 78 18 21 671 Specific provisions for bad and doubtful debts 70 15 20 24 11 52 5 13 210 Interest in suspense 2 20 8 6 15 7 58 Net non-performing loans and advances 94 98 128 36 22 11 6 8 403 Cover ratio 40% In 2001, gross non-performing loans and advances for Other Asia Pacific have been restated.
$58 million of gross non-performing loans in Standard Chartered Nakornthon Bank SCNB subject to a Loan Management Agreement LMA are now reported in Wholesale Banking.
The relatively low Consumer Banking cover ratio reflects the fact that Standard Chartered classifies all exposure which is 90 days past due as non-performing, whilst provisions on unsecured lending are only raised at the time of charge-off see details relating to the raising of provisions above.
Wholesale Banking Loans are designated as non-performing as soon as payment of interest or principal is 90 days or more overdue, or where sufficient weakness is recognised that full payment of either interest or principal becomes questionable.
Where customer accounts are recognised as non-performing or display weakness that may result in non-performing status being assigned, they are passed to the management of a specialist unit, which is independent of the main businesses of the Group.
For loans and advances designated non-performing, interest continues to accrue on the customers account but is not included in income.
Where the principal or a portion thereof, is considered uncollectable and of such little realisable value that it can no longer be included at its full nominal amount on the balance sheet, a specific provision is raised.
In any decision relating to the raising of provisions, the Group attempts to balance economic conditions, local knowledge and experience and the results of independent asset reviews.
Where it is considered that there is no realistic prospect of recovering the principal of an account against which a specific provision has been raised, then that amount will be written off.
The Group reports non-performing loans on a net at risk basis two years after first raising a specific provision.
Net at risk is the result of netting interest in suspense and specific provision against applicable gross outstandings.
Normal account management and collection efforts are not impacted by this process.

They comprise loans and advances, interest bearing deposits with other banks, trade and other bills, acceptances, amounts receivable under finance leases, certificates of deposit and other negotiable paper and investment securities where the counterparty is resident in a country other than that where the cross border asset is recorded.
Cross border assets also include exposures to local residents denominated in currencies other than the local currency.
This provides a cover ratio of 64 per cent 2001: 15 per cent.

Market Risk The Group recognises market risk as the exposure created by the potential changes in market prices and rates.
Market risk arises on financial instruments, which are either valued at current market prices mark-to-market or at cost plus any accrued interest non-trading basis.
The Group is exposed to market risk arising principally from customer driven transactions.
Market risk is supervised by the Group Risk Committee, which agrees policies and levels of risk appetite in terms of Value at Risk VaR.
A Group Market Risk Committee sits as a specialist body to provide business level management, guidance and policy setting.
Policies cover the trading book of the Group and also market risks within the non-trading books.
Limits by location and portfolio are proposed by the business within the terms of the agreed policy.
Group Market Risk agrees the limits and monitors exposures against these limits.
Group Market Risk augments the VaR measurement by regularly stress testing aggregate market risk exposures to highlight potential risk that may arise from extreme market events that are rare but plausible.
In addition, VaR models are back tested against actual results to ensure pre-determined levels of accuracy are maintained.
Additional limits are placed on specific instrument and currency concentrations where appropriate.
Factor sensitivity measures are used in addition to VaR as additional risk management tools.
Option risks are controlled through revaluation limits on currency and volatility shifts, limits on volatility risk by currency pair and other underlying variables that determine the options value.

Standard Chartered also seeks to match closely its foreign currency-denominated assets with corresponding liabilities in the same currencies.
The effect of exchange rate movements on the capital risk asset ratio is mitigated by the fact that both the value of these investments and the risk weighted value of assets and contingent liabilities follow substantially the same exchange rate movements.
37 Financial Review Continued Capital Standard Chartereds policy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and strong capital base.
The Group Asset and Liabillity Committee targets Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios of seven to nine per cent and 12 to 14 per cent respectively.
The Group believes that being well capitalised is important.

The Group identified improving the efficiency of capital management as a strategic priority for 2002.
A capital plan to achieve this has been developed.
This includes several key elements.
In particular, to reduce the amount of Tier 2 capital and to improve the overall capital mix within the broad target ratios.
In October 2002, Standard Chartered PLC listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The Company issued 35 million ordinary shares of $0.50 per share.
The shares were issued at HK$84 per share, raising $17.5 million of share capital and $328 million of share premium.
In December 2002, the Company repurchased 659,126 Non-cumulative Preference Shares with a nominal value of $5 and issued at a price of $1,000 per Preference Share.
The Shares were repurchased at $1,110 per share, together with an amount to compensate for accrued dividend.
The deduction from the share premium reserve was restricted to the $328 million premium raised on the Hong Kong listing.
