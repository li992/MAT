During the year, the Group has, in partnership with specialist environmental consultants, developed an Environmental Management System 25 June 2002 EMS, with the object of consistent management of environmental issues, the establishment and measurement of meaningful performance standards, the promotion of best practice throughout the Group and the development of a reputation for environmental management which will attract support and investment.
Each of the Groups businesses has identified its main environmental risks and impacts and appointed an officer with responsibility for championing the implementation of the EMS locally.
Guidelines on the management of environmental issues have been issued to all of the Groups businesses and a series of environmental performance indicators has been developed for the Group.
An environmental awareness training programme has commenced in the UK and is to be extended throughout the Group.
While airports make a major economic and social contribution to the community, it is recognised that they have an environmental impact.
The Groups businesses aim to take appropriate action to mitigate or remedy this impact, including the following: Air noise: a number of noise mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of noise generated by aircraft movements at our airports.
For example, at London Luton Airport there are departure noise preferential routes, away from highly populated areas near the airport, and departure noise limits Water management: airports consume large amounts of water and produce effluent containing chemicals that can influence the environment.
Water management techniques are taken into account in all new projects.
For example, reed bed technology is being used at Cardiff International Airport to remove fire fighting chemicals from waste water Air quality: airport studies have shown that, while aircraft and vehicles are significant sources of emissions, regional background pollution is a large contributor to air quality in neighbouring communities.
Although the Group has no direct influence on aircraft emissions, it can control other ground level emissions.
For example, fixed electrical ground power, which enables aircraft to shut down their auxiliary engines while on stand, has been installed on all stands at London Luton Airport Waste: studies have shown that between 60% and 70% of waste generated at airports originates from aircraft.
The Groups airports are promoting various recycling schemes Ground noise: the Groups airports are using the best practical means to reduce emissions from ground based sources, such as construction activities, engine testing and taxiing aircraft Energy: under the Kyoto Agreement, the UK is committed to reducing its carbon dioxide and other emissions harmful to the environment to 12.5% below 1990 levels by 2012.
The Group is committed to helping to achieve this target and is adopting energy conservation measures throughout its European businesses 24 TBI ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 TBI ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 25 CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT BALANCE SHEETS 31 MARCH 2002 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2002 Before Restated Restated exceptional Exceptional 2002 2001 2002 2001 items items Total Restated Group Group Company Company 2002 2002 2002 2001 Notes 000 000 000 000 Notes 000 000 000 000 Fixed assets Turnover: Group and share of joint ventures 186,170 - 186,170 139,145 Goodwill 141,688 149,576 - - Less: share of joint ventures turnover --- 14,037 Negative goodwill - 5,730 - - Other intangible assets 13,140 13,747 - - Group turnover 2 186,170 - 186,170 125,108 Intangible assets 11 154,828 157,593 - - Cost of sales 27,078 - 27,078 29,670 Tangible assets 12 214,520 225,273 536 691 Gross profit 2 159,092 - 159,092 95,438 Investment properties 13 123,283 127,682 1,050 - Administrative expenses 126,510 9,225 135,735 74,127 Investments in joint ventures: Group operating profit before depreciation, 2 53,061 - 53,061 31,076 - share of gross assets - 4,296 - - amortisation and exceptional items - share of gross liabilities - 3,086 - - Depreciation 2 12,235 5,743 17,978 5,558 14 - 1,210 - - Amortisation of intangible assets 2 8,244 5,630 2,614 4,624 Trade investments 14 1,232 22,568 - - Exceptional charges credits 4 - 9,112 9,112 417 Investments in subsidiaries 14 - - 216,844 126,844 Investments 1,232 23,778 216,844 126,844 Group operating profit 2 32,582 9,225 23,357 21,311 Share of operating loss in joint ventures --- 906 493,863 534,326 218,430 127,535 Current assets Group operating profit 32,582 9,225 23,357 21,311 Stock 17 1,026 1,206 - - Share of operating profit in joint ventures --- 539 Debtors 18 45,646 54,322 290,758 381,099 before exceptional items Cash at bank and in hand 19 35,181 27,646 10,479 11,282 Operating profit before exceptional items in joint ventures: 32,582 9,225 23,357 21,850 Group and share of joint ventures 81,853 83,174 301,237 392,381 Share of exceptional loss in joint ventures --- 1,445 Current liabilities Creditors amounts falling due within one year 20 61,068 64,612 98,628 67,179 Total operating profit: Group and share of joint ventures 32,582 9,225 23,357 20,405 Profit on sale of investments and joint ventures 14 4,940 - Net current assets 20,785 18,562 202,609 325,202 Net interest payable 3 11,752 7,228 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 2 16,545 13,177 Total assets less current liabilities 514,648 552,888 421,039 452,737 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 7 6,397 5,730 Creditors amounts falling due after more than one year 20 200,037 231,717 88,697 115,236 Profit on ordinary activities after tax 10,148 7,447 Accruals and deferred income 22 2,747 2,694 - - Equity minority interests 1,909 - Provisions for liabilities and charges 23 16,784 12,685 - - Profit for the financial year 8,239 7,447 Net assets 295,080 305,792 332,342 337,501 Dividends 9 12,854 11,686 Retained loss for the year 25 4,615 4,239 Capital and reserves Called up share capital 24 55,889 55,889 55,889 55,889 Share premium account 25 166,611 166,611 166,611 166,611 Earnings per share 10 1.47p 1.46p Capital reserve 25 49,634 49,634 69,653 69,653 Diluted earnings per share 10 1.47p 1.46p Revaluation reserve 25 7,137 14,681 - - Earnings per share before normal amortisation 10 3.71p 2.67p Profit and loss account 25 18,677 23,337 40,189 45,348 and exceptional items Equity shareholders funds 26 297,948 310,152 332,342 337,501 Equity minority interests 2,868 4,360 - - Capital employed 295,080 305,792 332,342 337,501 The results shown above are derived from continuing operations.

the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to a revaluation reserve.
No provision is made for depreciation of investment properties.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, which requires all properties to be depreciated is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the FRS 17 also requires the resulting pension scheme surplus or deficit to be recognised immediately on the balance sheet and any resulting actuarial gains financial statements to show a true and fair view in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
