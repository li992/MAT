Operating and Financial Review Overview Profit before tax for the year amounted to 326.2 million, an increase of 18.0% over the restated figure for 2001.
On the same basis, profit after tax increased by 19.1% to 229.7 million and return on equity increased to 20.2% 2001 - 19.4%.
"The 2001 comparative figures have been restated following the introduction of UITF 33 ""Obligations in Capital Instruments"" such that interest expense and total income have been restated to include the coupon payable on Reserve Capital Instruments whereas previously this coupon was included as an appropriation of profits, net of the associated tax credit see note 2 to the accounts."
The 2002 tax charge has been restated to include this tax credit.
Earnings per share have grown to 55.6p in 2002 2001 - 46.2p, an increase of 20.3%.
During 2002, our strong organic growth was supplemented by the acquisition of the banking operations of Legal & General, resulting in the acquisition of assets amounting to almost 1.9 billion.
Assets under management, including securitised mortgage balances, at 31 December 2002 amounted to 41.9 billion, an increase of 34.7% 2001- 31.1 billion.
The balance sheet, including the securitised bonds shown as a deduction from assets grew by 23.7% to 32.7 billion 2001- 26.4 billion.
Organic growth, excluding the acquired assets, was 28.8% for assets under management and 16.7% for balance sheet assets.
Total income 2002 2001 Restated m m Net interest income 299.6 305.9 Other income 261.4 170.5 Total income 561.0 476.4 Total income : mean total assets 1.90% 1.95% Total income : mean assets under management 1.54% 1.70% Total income in 2002 amounted to 561.0 million 2001 - 476.4 million an increase of 17.8%.
Total income as a proportion of mean total assets at 1.90% has remained stable during 2002 and shows a slight reduction compared with 1.95% in 2001.
In line with the rapid growth in assets under management, the ratio of total income to mean total assets under management eased to 1.54% compared with 1.70% in 2001.
Margins 2002 2001 Restated m m Interest receivable 1,832.1 1,732.0 Interest payable 1,440.9 1,385.9 391.2 346.1 Average interest earning assets 36,035.5 27,523.8 Average interest bearing liabilities 35,207.6 26,679.9 Net interest margin 1.09% 1.26% Net interest spread 0.99% 1.10% 34 Operating and Financial Review continued Group interest margin and spread are calculated taking into account interest recorded in the profit and loss account together with that reported in the special purpose securitisation companies and income from equity shares and other variable yield securities.
Similarly, average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities include items on balance sheet and also in the balance sheets of the securitisation companies and interest earning assets include equity shares and other variable yield securities.
In 2002 net interest margin and spread were 1.09% and 0.99% respectively 2001 - 1.26% and 1.10%, stable compared with the first half of the year.
Asset spreads of 1.09% in the second half of 2002 were 0.01% higher than in the first half, with liability spreads unchanged.
During the second half of 2002, the relationship between money market interest rates and bank base rate was beneficial although this was offset by the higher relative costs of securitised bonds, use of longer maturity non-retail funds and a general widening of spreads to cover counterparty credit risk.
Operating expenses excluding the covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation and amortisation of goodwill 2002 2001 m m Staff costs 85.1 74.6 Other expenses 70.9 65.0 Depreciation 13.0 9.5 Total recurring expenses 169.0 149.1 Non-recurring costs 2.3 - Total operating expenses 171.3 149.1 Total operating expenses amounted to 171.3 million.
Excluding the one off costs of 2.3 million involved in the acquisition of the Legal & General banking operations, underlying operating expenses amounted to 169.0 million 2001 - 149.1million.
We have again achieved our strategic objectives of growing our underlying cost base at no more than one half to two thirds the growth in assets under management and less than the growth in total income.
During 2002 underlying operating expenses increased by 13.3%, assets under management increased by 34.7% and total income by 17.8%.
As a result our underlying cost to income ratio fell to 30.1% 2001 - 31.3% and our underlying ratio of cost to assets under management fell to 0.46% 2001 - 0.53%.
In December 2002 Northern Rock contributed 33.7 million to the Northern Rock pension scheme to eliminate an estimated actuarial funding deficit.
In accordance with SSAP 24 this prepayment is being amortised from April 2002 over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the defined benefit scheme, estimated at 13 years, resulting in an additional charge in 2002 of 1.6 million.
The Northern Rock Foundation Northern Rock donates 5% of pre tax profit to The Northern Rock Foundation under a deed of covenant.
Such donations are used to support community and charitable causes mainly, but not exclusively, in the North East of England.
The donation from 2002 profits amounts to 16.3 million 2001 - 14.8 million.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts Despite the growth in our mortgage book there has been no deterioration in asset quality as evidenced by the arrears statistics.
At 31 December 2002 there were 2,737 2001 - 2,525 accounts three months or more in arrears representing only 0.56% 2001 - 0.61% of all mortgage accounts, about half of the UK average.
There are no signs of any deterioration in the quality of our mortgage book, although we have probably now reached the floor of arrears in the current credit cycle.
"The ""together"" secured advances payment performance has also remained robust as it matures, with three months plus arrears at 0.7% at 31 December 2002 2001 - 0.7% which is also significantly below the UK average for all mortgages."
At 31 December 2002 only 170 properties were in possession compared with 202 at the end of 2001.
35 Operating and Financial Review continued Other loan portfolios continue to perform extremely well, with only 0.6% of our commercial loans 2001 - 0.7% and 1.3% of our personal unsecured loans 2001 - 1.4% three months or more in arrears.
"The ""together"" unsecured loans continue to show characteristics similar to secured loans and perform significantly better than traditional personal unsecured loans with only 0.7% three months or more in arrears at 31 December 2002 2001 - 0.8%."
The total charge for provisions for bad and doubtful debts amounted to 43.1 million for the year 2001 - 34.5 million representing 0.19% of mean advances to customers 2001 - 0.18%.
The combination of high quality lending, low interest rates, low arrears and high house price inflation have resulted in a reduction in the specific provisions required for residential mortgages.
Provisions for the other secured lending portfolio have been maintained consistent with views on economic conditions for this sector.
The growth in provision balances against our personal credit portfolios reflects growth in balances, the maturing nature of the portfolios and our continued prudent provisioning policy.
As a result, general provisions as a proportion of total provision balances for these portfolios increased to 38% 2001 - 24%.
Total provisions against our personal credit portfolios are considered appropriate given the potential risks facing this sector.
Taxation The corporation tax charge for the year as a percentage of profit before tax was 29.6% 2001 - 30.3%, compared with the standard corporation tax rate for the year of 30%.
The difference is explained as follows: % Standard corporation tax rate for 2002 30.0 Effect of non-allowable provisions and other timing differences 0.5 Adjustment to prior year tax provisions 0.9 Effective tax rate 29.6 Lending During 2002 Northern Rock achieved record levels of total lending.
Total gross lending was 14,128 million, an increase of 59.6% 2001 - 8,853 million, with total net lending of 8,241 million, an increase of 60.7% 2001 - 5,127 million.
Included in total lending are 1,544 million of loan balances acquired as a result of our acquisition of the banking operations of Legal & General.
Excluding these balances organic gross lending amounted to 12,584 million and organic net lending 6,697 million, representing increases of 42.1% and 30.6% respectively.
Prospects for the current year are good, with an opening pipeline of 3.5 billion, two thirds higher than at the same time last year.
The residential lending market remained extremely buoyant during 2002 with record levels of both gross and net lending.
House price inflation for the year was reported at around 25% although some easing was seen in the last few months of the year, particularly in Greater London.
Bank base rate remained unchanged throughout the year at 4%, sustaining mortgage affordability.
In addition, realistic credit assessment continued to provide safeguards for Northern Rock against the dangers of borrowers overstretching their finances.
Competition remained intense throughout the year, mainly from established lenders.
We achieved gross residential lending of 12,001 million 2001 - 6,901 million and net residential lending of 7,184 million 2001 - 3,817 million, representing increases of 73.9% and 88.2% respectively.
Acquired residential lending balances included in these figures amounted to 1,477 million resulting in organic gross residential lending of 10,524 million and organic net residential lending of 5,707 million, representing increases of 52.5% and 49.5% respectively.
Our estimated market share of gross residential lending was 5.5% organic 4.8% and our estimated market share of net residential lending was 9.1% organic 7.3% compared with our opening share of stock of 3.7%.
Our estimated share of redemptions in the year was 3.5%, significantly lower than our closing share of stock of 4.3%.
This was due to our retention process and our transparent policy allowing existing customers, subject to contractual terms, to transfer their loan to any new product available to new borrowers.
36 Operating and Financial Review continued Despite the strong growth in new lending, our risk profile has improved.
The proportion of lending to first time buyers reduced to 26% 2001 - 32% with 74% of new customers having a proven payment track record.
New lending at or below 90% LTV improved to 77% 2001 - 73%, new lending below 75% LTV also improved to 46% 2001 - 30% and the average indexed LTV of our mortgage book, reflecting house price inflation, is now 58% providing strong cover in the event of default.
We have minimal exposure to large loans with only around 1.0% of new loans over 500,000 and we maintained an excellent geographic spread of lending.
We offer customers a wide range of innovative and attractive products including lifestyle products and price-led products.
"Our ""together"" family of products, which combines a secured and unsecured loan at one interest rate and one monthly payment, remained popular."
"New business volumes for ""together"" products amounted to 4.1 billion of which 3.3 billion were advances secured on residential property representing 31% of new residential lending."
"Our ""together connections"" product, allowing the option of interest offset from associated customer savings and current account balances, generated 545 million of new lending."
Home Equity Release Mortgages, aimed at homeowners aged over 60 who wish to utilise equity in their homes to improve their quality of life, accounted for 271 million or 3% of new residential lending.
In total our lifestyle products represented 34% of our organic gross new lending.
Of our traditional, price-led mortgage products, fixed-rate mortgages remained the most popular with 38% of new lending accounted for by short term fixed products, up to two years, and 17% by longer term fixes mainly up to a maximum of seven years.
Given the economic uncertainty in the commercial property sector, we have remained cautious in the expansion of our commercial lending portfolio but have continued to expand at a steady and appropriate pace.
This approach will continue until market conditions and the risk reward relationship improves.
Gross lending amounted to 406 million 2001 - 454 million with net advances of 196 million 2001 - 245 million.
"Our personal credit lending has increasingly been driven mainly by our credit bundled ""together"" products, consistent with our strategy of lending to customers with whom we have a secured loan relationship."
This approach benefits credit quality and enhances product retention.
Total gross unsecured lending amounted to 1,721 million 2001 - 1,498 million with net lending of 861 million 2001 - 1,065 million.
"Of the total net lending, 513 million 2001 - 585 million related to our ""together"" unsecured products."
"At 31 December 2002 our unsecured lending balances were 2,941 million 2001 - 2,080 million of which 48.9% 2001 - 44.5% represented ""together"" unsecured advances."
Retail funding Total retail deposit balances for the year increased by 1,966 million to 15.3 billion 2001 - 13.4 billion, an increase of 14.7%.
This increase comprised a net inflow of retail funds for the year of 773 million, including interest credited of 447 million, and acquired savings balances of 1,193 million following the acquisition of the Legal & General subsidiaries.
The organic funding during the year was largely due to flows of new funds into our tracker online and ISA deposit accounts.
These are contractual accounts where the transparency of terms and conditions provides clarity for the customer and less volatility for us to manage.
On-line balances now account for over 2.0 billion of our retail deposit base.
Balances in our Irish based operations have risen to 470 million.
Non - retail funding Total new non-retail funding for the year amounted to 3,232 million with total non-retail balances at 31 December 2002 amounting to 13.7 billion 2001 - 10.4 billion.
We will continue to utilise our non-retail funding programmes especially in Continental Europe and the United States and to develop investor interest from the Far East.
Already in 2003 we have raised $1.425 billion floating rate notes under our US Medium Term Note programme.
37 Operating and Financial Review continued Securitisation Northern Rock remained at the forefront of securitisation of residential mortgages during 2002 raising 5.2 billion from two issues.
We have continued to widen our investor base as evidenced by over 60% of the securitised bonds in 2002 being issued in Continental Europe and the United States.
We have reduced the period of time the loans are on the balance sheet prior to securitisation and the mix and risk characteristics of our securitised mortgages mirror those of our on balance sheet mortgages, ensuring that we are maintaining the quality of our balance sheet.
In addition, we also completed our first securitisation of 100% risk weighted commercial loans amounting to 500 million, further enhancing capital efficiency.
At 31 December 2002 securitised assets under management amounted to 9.6 billion 2001 - 4.9 billion, representing 28% 2001 - 19% of our total lending portfolios.
Our programmes will continue to be developed with further issues during 2003.
Already in the current year we have completed a very well received 3.0 billion securitisation of residential mortgages.
Acquisition of Legal & General subsidiaries On 1 August 2002 we completed the acquisition of the banking operations of Legal & General for a total cash consideration of 133.2 million.
On completion we acquired total assets of 1.9 billion of which 1.5 billion were loans and advances to customers, primarily residential mortgage advances.
In addition we acquired 1.2 billion of retail deposit balances.
The majority of these acquired balances have been retained and supplemented our organic growth.
The acquisition resulted in goodwill of 35.8 million, which is being amortised over 10 years from the date of acquisition.
The acquired operations have now been fully integrated into Northern Rock, which will result in significant cost savings.
In addition, the Legal & General brand is now being utilised to originate new business for Northern Rock.
Dividends The interim dividend paid in October 2002 was 6.5p per share.
The proposed final dividend of 13.7p per share is payable on 30 May 2003 to shareholders on the register on 2 May 2003.
This results in a total dividend payable for the year of 20.2p per share 2001 - 17.1p an increase of 18.1%.
Capital At 31 December 2002 total consolidated capital amounted to 2.8 billion resulting in a total capital ratio of 16.1%, comfortably above regulatory and internal requirements.
Tier 1 capital was 1,618 million and the Tier 1 ratio 9.3%.
The comparable ratios at 31 December 2001 were 13.2% and 8.4% respectively.
"During 2002 we issued 200 million of Tier One Notes ""TONs"" the full amount of which is permitted within Tier 1 for regulatory capital purposes."
Payments in relation to the TONs are tax deductible and contribute to a lowering of the weighted average cost of capital.
In the first half of 2002 we increased our Lower Tier 2 capital by a net 225 million with a further issue of 300 million in the second half.
We anticipate that the capital markets in 2003 will be difficult and that our current levels of capital, together with our securitisation programmes, will result in no further capital issues being required in the current year.
Our assessment of the impact of the Basel II Pillar I proposals, including our participation in the Basel Quantitative Impact Study 3, continue to support our assessment for significantly lower levels of capital being required in the future to support credit and operational risk.
During 2003 we will continue with preparations for the introduction of Pillar I and will commence a detailed review of Pillar II requirements, to ensure that the capital benefits of Basel II are available to Northern Rock as quickly as possible.
38 Operating and Financial Review continued The table below analyses Northern Rocks consolidated capital resources at 31 December 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 m m Tier 1 Share capital 123.9 123.9 Share premium account 6.8 6.8 Capital redemption reserve 7.3 7.3 Profit and loss account 1,071.6 925.3 Reserve capital instruments 242.7 187.6 Tier one notes 200.0 - Goodwill 34.3 - Total Tier 1 capital 1,618.0 1,250.9 Upper Tier 2 Perpetual subordinated debt 350.3 350.3 Reserve capital instruments 57.3 112.4 General provisions 49.1 32.0 Total Upper Tier 2 capital 456.7 494.7 Lower Tier 2 capital Term subordinated debt 769.2 243.0 Total Tier 2 capital 1,225.9 737.7 Deductions 44.5 26.3 Total capital 2,799.4 1,962.3 Risk weighted assets 17,383.5 14,858.2 Tier 1 ratio % 9.3% 8.4% Tier 2 to Tier 1 ratio % 75.8% 59.0% Total capital % 16.1% 13.2% Outlook Northern Rock has again produced good results: the business model works well.
We operate mainly in the gross residential mortgage market.
This is a large market and will remain so even if the housing market slows, as we expect it will.
With respect to house prices, we do not expect a sharp reduction.
We anticipate annualised house price inflation will be around 5% by the end of 2003, trending towards the rate of growth in average earnings, underpinned by low inflation, low interest rates and generally low levels of unemployment.
We also expect to see remortgage activity remaining strong, although equity withdrawal will decline.
Assisted by our relative size in a large market, our leading cost advantage and through good customer retention, even with a slowing residential loan market, we expect to achieve annual growth in assets under management within our strategic range of 15% to 25%.
Our strategy is built upon organic growth.
If this can be supplemented with income generating acquisitions, as we achieved with the Legal & General subsidiaries, then we will do so, but only where they fit our focused strategy at the right price, scale and quality.
Our funding programmes will continue to support our growth.
Securitisation continues to provide a major source of funding and is also a key feature of our capital management.
We do not anticipate raising any additional capital in 2003.
Northern Rocks virtuous circle strategy remains in good shape and continues to support the growth we anticipate going forward.
