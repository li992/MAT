place to manage risk exposure.
Market risk All the Groups derivatives activity is contracted with The primary market risk of the Group is interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk arises in the Groups balance sheet as a result of fixed rate, variable rate and non-interest bearing assets and liabilities.
Exposure to interest rate movements arises when there is a mismatch between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities.
The composition of interest rate risk is closely monitored and managed on a day-to-day basis by Treasury where professional expertise and systems exist to control it.
This is primarily done via asset and liability models that look at the sensitivity of earnings to movements in interest rates to measure overall exposure which may then be hedged in accordance with policy limits set by ALCO.
Currency risk The risks arising from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are managed by Treasury within agreed limits set by ALCO.
During the year cash flows generated by the foreign currency assets and liabilities are hedged using derivatives contracts to manage exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
Positions in foreign currencies also arise from the investment that the Group has made in 2002 in Egg SA.
The management of funding such investments in overseas subsidiaries is carried out by Treasury.
The Group has followed the normal practice of setting up a separate currency balance sheet whereby the foreign currency euro denominated assets are matched closely to the corresponding liabilities.
Derivatives The Group uses derivative instruments for the purpose of supporting the strategic and operational business activities of the Group and reducing and eliminating the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives are used solely to hedge risk exposure and the Group takes no trading position in derivatives.
