The balance sheet of the parent company has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 230 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985.
In accordance with the exemption permitted under this section, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented as part of these accounts.
The financial statements consolidate the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary undertakings, its Employee Share Ownership Trust and the Groups underwriting through participation on Lloyds syndicates.
The accounting information in respect of non-aligned syndicate participations has been provided by the managing agents of those syndicates through an information exchange facility operated by Lloyds and has been audited by the respective syndicates auditors.
Goodwill arising on consolidation on acquisitions prior to 31 May 1998, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, has been written off against reserves.
Aligned syndicate participations The Groups aligned syndicate participations are presented on an annual accounting basis.
Premiums Written premiums comprise premiums on contracts incepting during the financial year.
Premiums are disclosed gross of brokerage and exclude taxes and duties levied on them.
Estimates are included for pipeline premiums, representing amounts due to the Group but not yet notified, as well as adjustments made in the year to premiums written in prior accounting periods.
Outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related direct insurance or inwards reinsurance business.
Unearned premiums A provision for unearned premiums represents that part of premiums written, and reinsurers share of premiums written, which is estimated to be earned in following financial years.
It is calculated separately for each insurance contract on the 24ths or 365ths basis, where the incidence of risk is the same throughout the contract.
Where the incidence of risk varies during the term of the contract, the provision is based on the estimated risk profile of business written.
Acquisition costs Acquisition costs comprise brokerage incurred on insurance contracts written during the financial year.
They are spread over an equivalent period to that which the premiums on the underlying business are earned.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred in respect of unearned premiums at the balance sheet date.
Claims Claims incurred comprise claims and claims handling expenses paid during the financial year together with the movement in the provision for claims outstanding and settlement expenses, including claims incurred but not reported IBNR.
Outward reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same accounting period as the associated incurred claims.
Claims outstanding comprise provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the balance sheet date whether reported or not, and include the related internal and external claims handling expenses.
Provisions for claims outstanding are based on information available to the directors and the eventual outcome may vary from the original assessment.
Provisions for IBNR are finalised through a review process.
The claims reserves are proposed, on a gross and net of reinsurance basis, based on the historical trends of claims development and taking account of underwriting conditions.
These are independently reviewed, including assessment of an actuarial best estimate reserve for each class.
Provisions for doubtful debt associated with reinsurance receivables are made after a review of the financial strength and trading position of reinsurers.
Unexpired risks provision Provision is made for unexpired risks where, at the balance sheet date, the costs of outstanding claims and related deferred acquisition costs are expected to exceed the unearned premium provision.
The unexpired risks provision is included within technical provisions in the balance sheet.
54 AMLIN PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Non-aligned syndicate participations The Groups non-aligned syndicate participations, which are presented as a discontinued operation, consist entirely of run-off syndicate years of account.
These participations are reported on an extension to the three year accounting basis, whereby movements in the calendar year are reported.
Premiums are disclosed gross of brokerage payable and exclude taxes and duties levied on them.
Estimates are made for pipeline premiums, representing accounts due to the Group but not yet notified, as well as adjustments made in the year to premiums written in prior accounting periods.
Claims Claims incurred comprise claims and claims handling expenses paid during the financial year together with the movement in the provision for claims outstanding and settlement expenses, including claims incurred but not reported.
Loss provisions on open years Provision is also made for losses on each open year of account when it is considered that profits in corporate member subsidiaries may be insufficient to meet these losses.
In addition, provision is made for the estimated future deterioration of years of account in run-off.
While the directors make every effort to ensure that adequate provision is made for losses on open years of account, their view of the ultimate loss may vary in later periods as a result of subsequent information and events.
This in turn may require adjustment of the original provisions.
These adjustments are reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the related adjustments are made.
Other accounting policies Exchange rates Income and expenditure in US dollars, Euros and Canadian dollars is translated at average rates of exchange for the period.
Underwriting transactions denominated in other foreign currencies are included at their historical rates.
Syndicate assets and liabilities, expressed in US dollars, Euros and Canadian dollars are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Differences arising on translation of foreign currency amounts in syndicates are included in the technical account.
Other assets, liabilities, income and expenditure expressed in foreign currencies have been translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date unless contracts to sell currency for sterling have been entered into prior to the year end, in which case the contracted rates have been used.
Differences arising on translation of foreign currency amounts on such items are included in the non-technical account.
Investments Listed investments are stated at market value at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors on a prudent basis with regard to their likely realisable value.
In the Companys accounts, investments in Group undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Syndicate investments and investment income Syndicate investments and cash are held on a pooled basis, the return from which is allocated to underwriting years of account proportionately to the funds contributed by the year of account.
Investment return All dividends and any related tax credits are recognised as income on the date the related listed investments are marked ex-dividend.
Other investment income, interest receivable, expenses and interest payable are recognised on an accruals basis.
Realised gains or losses are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and their purchase price in the financial year or their valuation at the commencement of the year.
Unrealised gains and losses are calculated as the difference between the valuation of investments at the balance sheet date and their purchase price in the financial year or valuation at the commencement of the year.
In the Companys accounts, realised gains and losses on investments are included in the profit and loss account and unrealised gains and losses are taken directly to capital reserve-unrealised.
AMLIN PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 55 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Allocation of investment return All of the investment return arising in the year is reported initially in the non-technical account.
A transfer is made from the non-technical account to the technical account representing: for the aligned syndicate participations, the longer term investment return on investments supporting the technical provisions and related shareholders funds.
The longer term investment return is an estimate of the expected return over time for each relevant category of investments having regard to past performance, current trends and future expectations: and for the non-aligned syndicate participations, the actual return on investments supporting the technical provisions and related shareholders funds.
Intangible fixed assets The cost of syndicate participations which have been purchased in the Lloyds capacity auctions is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life of twenty years beginning in the underwriting year in which the purchased syndicate participation commences.
Other income and charges Agency fees are recognised on an accruals basis.
Profit commission receivable is accrued in direct relation to underwriting income earned and is subject to the normal managing agents terms.
Tangible fixed assets The cost of other fixed assets is depreciated over their expected useful lives on a straight line basis.
Depreciation rates are within the following ranges: Leasehold land and buildings Over period of lease Motor vehicles 25 33% per annum Computer hardware and software 33 50% per annum Furniture and office equipment 20 50% per annum Internal property improvements 20 33% per annum Pensions Pension contributions to defined benefit schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group, based on Actuarial triennial valuations.
Pension contributions to employees money purchase schemes are charged to the profit and loss account when due.
Deferred tax Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Leased assets Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase transactions are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their useful lives.
The outstanding instalments are included in creditors and the interest element is charged against profits over the period of the contract.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account evenly over the period of the lease.
Where there are rent free periods in property leases, the cost of the lease is spread evenly up to the period of the first rent review.
56 AMLIN PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 2 ANALYSIS OF CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Continuing operations The events of 11 September 2001 had a significant impact on the Groups 2001 results.
As such, the continuing operations in the technical account have been split between 11 September related and underlying items.
Discontinued operations During 1999, the Group disposed of its remaining participations on non-aligned syndicates.
The results deriving from this activity are disclosed as discontinued operations.

Development of these losses during the year has been broadly in line with expectations and the incurred loss position has stabilised.
Settlements of property losses have begun to be made and there is now greater certainty over these losses.
The gross loss estimate by class of business, and the net loss estimates by year of account, compared with the estimated positions at 31 December 2001, are summarised below: 2002 2001 CLASS OF BUSINESS US$m US$m Direct and facultative property 72.4 94.6 Property reinsurance and risk excess of loss 303.7 273.3 Direct airline operators and other aviation risks 179.5 253.0 Reinsurance of aviation risks 26.3 30.8 Other 29.8 15.6 Total gross loss 611.7 667.3 Reinsurance recoveries 454.3 527.8 Total net loss 157.4 139.5 Allocated by year of account: 2000 year of account 32.0 27.7 2001 year of account 125.4 111.8 157.4 139.5 Amlin Group share 105.6 93.3 The overall improvement in our gross loss estimate is due to a reduction in our estimate for aviation losses following an internal review of the legal position.
This has been partially offset by an increase in notifications from reinsured clients on our property reinsurance account.
The increased loss net of reinsurance is due to these higher property reinsurance claims, which are not recoverable from reinsurers, while most of the benefit of the improvement in the estimated aviation loss falls to the syndicates reinsurers.
In terms of timing most of the changes were experienced in the first half of 2002 with a relatively stable position in the second half.
Key assumptions made in estimating the losses from 11 September 2001 include: the terrorist attacks leading to the collapse of the World Trade Center towers in New York were one occurrence: the Washington and Pittsburgh losses were two further distinct occurrences: there will be no material failures of reinsurance security: all reinsurers will reinstate reinsurance cover in accordance with the relevant contract provision: there will be no material contractual disputes with any reinsurers: there will be no subrogation recoveries or financial support from third parties, including the US government or associated agencies: war exclusions on policies do not apply and all of the occurrences were caused by terrorist action: and recoveries under a number of reinsurance contracts are triggered by the overall market property insured loss reaching certain levels.
The property market loss assumed is US$25 billion or greater.
63.9 million of the estimated loss was charged to the technical account in 2001 and the balance of 1.5 million at 31 December 2002 exchange rates has been charged to the technical account in 2002.
The estimates, and the assumptions and methodology from which they are derived, do not, and may not be taken to constitute an admission that the Group is liable either in respect of a particular class of business or under a particular contract of insurance or reinsurance.
A number of insurance companies and Lloyds syndicates, including syndicate 2001, are currently in dispute with the leaseholder of the World Trade Center, Silverstein Holdings, as to whether the terrorist attack and destruction of the buildings constitutes one or two insured occurrences.
We believe the attacks on the World Trade Center are one occurrence.
We have legal guidance that supports this belief.
However there is potential for additional loss.
In the event that the World Trade Center losses were judged to be two occurrences and two total losses to the excess layers underwritten, it is estimated that the Groups loss could increase by up to approximately 22 million.
However, given our legal advice and the high excess point of the layer which we insured, we believe that this is unlikely.
AMLIN PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 59 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 3 IMPACT OF TERRORIST ATTACKS OF 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 CONTINUED The remaining reinsurance recoveries of the Syndicates have been analysed by grade of reinsurer, as rated by Standard & Poors in March 2003, as follows: Grade of reinsurer % US$m AAA 15.7 47.4 AA 33.6 101.3 A 20.6 62.2 Lloyds 21.8 65.8 Other 8.3 25.1 100.0 301.8 Amlin Group Share 210.1 Provisions of US$7.2 million have been made for bad debts.
Letters of credit amounting to $34.9 million Amlin Group Share: $24.3 million have been received from reinsurers securing future recoveries due on 11 September 2001 losses.
Last year we disclosed that the syndicates were owed an estimated US$125 million from companies which underwrote through Fortress Re Inc, and that this agency had ceased to trade.
At 31 December 2002, US$29.5 million of the debt remained outstanding.
During January 2003, a letter of credit was received to reduce the debt to US$7.8 million.

The total pension cost for the Group in the year was 4.7 million 2001: 2.5 million, of which 3.4 million 2001: 1.3 million related to the defined benefit schemes and 1.3 million 2001: 1.2 million related to the defined contribution and personal pension schemes.
a The Amlin plc funded defined benefit scheme The scheme is a multi-employer scheme, operated by the Lloyds Superannuation fund, which maintains separate notional funds for the active members from each employer.
However, the deferred and pensioner members funds are held in a combined fund irrespective of their previous employer.
For this reason, it is not possible to identify the assets and liabilities of the Amlin Group members, and the scheme is treated as a multi-employer scheme for the purposes of Financial Reporting Standard No.
The Group is in discussion with the operators of the scheme with a view to sectionalising the assets between ongoing employers of the scheme and orphaned deferred members where the former employer has ceased to trade.
This process will, if pursued, lead to a segregated, independent Amlin scheme, but would require the consent of Court.
It is not yet possible to say what the outcome may be.
This scheme is valued every three years by an independent qualified actuary.
Contributions are made at the funding rates recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the scheme.
The recommended rates reflect an adjustment to amortise any small surplus or deficit over the average remaining lifetimes of the current active membership.
The latest actuarial assessment of the scheme, at 31 March 2001, used the projected unit actuarial method and was based on the principal assumption that long-term returns on investments would be, on average, 1.8% higher than increases in earnings.
The valuation showed that the assets of the active members of the scheme were 18.8 million, being 5.1 million less than the members accrued liabilities, resulting in a deficit of 21%.
To rectify this deficit, and the subsequent further deteriorations on the stock markets, a payment of 2 million was made in 2002.
Additionally, a further payment of 2 million was made in January 2003 and an estimated 2.3 million will be paid in 2004.
In 2002, funding rates and charges to the profit and loss account were as recommended by the 2001 valuation and ranged between 18.3% and 39.3% of pensionable salaries, and totalled 1.2 million, which in combination with the additional payment noted above, gives a total charge to the profit and loss account of 3.2 million.
Funding rates remain unchanged in 2003. b The Angerstein Underwriting Limited funded defined benefit scheme SSAP 24 disclosures The scheme consists of a closed funded defined benefit scheme for past employees of Angerstein Underwriting Limited.
Contributions to the scheme are determined by an independent qualified actuary, based upon triennial valuations, using the attained age actuarial method.
The most recent valuation was at 1 July 2001, when the market value of the scheme assets was 1.4 million representing 89% of the benefits accrued to the members, allowing for future earnings increases.
Group contributions made to this scheme in respect of the year ended 31 December 2002 were 0.2 million 2001: 0.3 million, and the agreed contribution rate for future years is 22.5% of pensionable salaries.
A 1.5% per annum differential between investment returns and salary increases is assumed.
FRS 17 disclosures During the year, the full implementation of FRS 17 was delayed indefinitely.
Although the Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24, the following FRS 17 transitional disclosures are still required.
The 1 July 2001 valuation has been reviewed and updated to 31 December 2002.
The members of this scheme are all employed for the benefit of the managed syndicates.
The FRS 17 disclosures are based upon the following annual financial assumptions: 2002 2001 Inflation 2.25% 2.50% Increase in salaries 4.25% 4.50% Increase in pensions in payment 2.25% 2.50% Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.50% 6.00% Return on equities 6.50% 7.00% AMLIN PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 63 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 12 PENSIONS CONTINUED Under these assumptions the valuation of the scheme at 31 December would have been: 2002 2001 m m Assets Equities 0.8 1.9 Liabilities Present value of scheme liabilities 1.8 2.2 Scheme deficit 1.0 0.3 Scheme deficit attributable to the Group 0.9 0.2 Related deferred tax asset 0.3 0.1 Net scheme deficit 0.6 0.1 The members of the scheme are, or were, employed for the benefit of Syndicate 2001 or its predecessors.
Because of the varying ownership of the years of account to which the contributions are charged, the following amounts which would have been recognised in the performance statements for the year ended 31 December 2002 under FRS 17, are shown both as a scheme total and amounts attributable to the Group, on the assumption that any charges would be taken to the 2003 year of account.

Contributions made by the Group vary by age and by the level of contribution that employees voluntarily make to the scheme.
Contributions range from 4% to 26% and are fully expensed to the profit and loss account when due and payable.
Amounts charged to the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2002 were 1.1 million 2001: 1.0 million.
Outstanding contributions at 31 December 2002 were 0.1 million 2001: 0.1 million.
d Other arrangements Other pension arrangements include a small self-administered scheme, an occupational money purchase scheme and personal pension arrangements.
Regular contributions, expressed as a percentage of employees earnings, are paid into these schemes and are allocated to accounts in the names of the individual members which are independent of the Groups finances.

34 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES a Funds at Lloyds deeds of covenant and letters of credit The Group has entered into various deeds of covenant in respect of certain corporate member subsidiaries to meet each such subsidiarys obligations to Lloyds.
At 31 December 2002, the total guarantee given by the Group under these deeds of covenant subject to limited exceptions amounted to approximately 222.8 million 2001: 162.0 million.
The obligations under the deeds of covenant are secured by a fixed charge of the same amount over investments, and a floating charge over the investments and other assets of the Group, in favour of Lloyds.
Lloyds has the right to retain the income on the charged investments, although it is not expected to exercise this right unless it considers there to be a risk that one or more of the covenants might need to be called and, if called, might not be honoured in full.
As liability under each deed of covenant is limited to a fixed monetary amount, the enforcement by Lloyds of any deed of covenant in the event of a default by a corporate member, where the total value of investments has fallen below the total of all amounts covenanted, may result in the appropriation of a share of the Groups Funds at Lloyds that is greater than the proportion which that subsidiarys overall premium limit bears to the total overall premium limit of the Group.
The Group has also entered into Lloyds deposit trust deeds for Funds at Lloyds by which letters of credit LOCs for total amounts of 70.0 million and US$130 million have been deposited.
Of these LOCs, all of the US$ denominated LOCs were procured in 2001 by agreement with the Companys 12.7% shareholder State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, and the sterling LOCs were deposited at Lloyds for the first time in late 2002, replacing previous LOCs totalling 39.3 million.
The rise was to support increased underwriting for the 2003 year of account.
b Reinsurance to close on spread portfolio A reinsurance to close RITC is a particular type of reinsurance contract entered into by Lloyds syndicates whereby the members of a syndicate for a particular year of account the closing year agree with the members of that or another syndicate for a later year of account the reinsuring members that the reinsuring members will indemnify, discharge or procure the discharge of all the known and unknown liabilities of the closing year arising out of insurance business underwritten by the syndicate in the closing year of account.
AMLIN PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 75 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 34 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED In the event that a corporate member resigns from a syndicate or reduces its participation relative to the other members of the syndicate, it will make a net payment of a RITC premium.
The payment of the RITC premium does not release members from ultimate responsibility for claims payable on risks they have written and in the event that the reinsuring members were unable to pay and the other elements in the Lloyds chain of security fail, the members would remain liable for the payment of any outstanding claims.
Payment of a RITC premium is conventionally treated as settling a members outstanding claims for the closing year and this convention has been adopted in these accounts.
There is no mechanism for the Group to account for the gross claims payments and recoveries made from the reinsuring members or to quantify the ongoing exposure in respect of closed years of account.
The directors consider that the possibility of the corporate members having to assume these liabilities is remote.
c Loan stock The Company has given a guarantee to Lloyds TSB Bank plc for the principal sum of 9.8 million to secure the obligations of its subsidiary, Amlin Underwriting Group plc, in respect of the issue of loan stock as detailed in note 28.
