Financial Review Accounting policies During the year, the Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard FRS 19 Deferred tax.
This requires full provision to be made for deferred tax arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the computation of tax.
Under the previous policy, timing differences were recognised on a partial provision basis.
The impact of adopting FRS 19 is set out in Note 31 to the financial statements on page 76.
There is no effect on the current year, but the cumulative impact of the prior year adjustment is an increase in the deferred tax provision of 9.1 million, which has been charged to the profit and loss account reserve brought forward.
The adoption of UITF 34 issued in May 2002, has resulted in a change in accounting policy in respect of pre-contract costs.
These costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is Finance Director, Chris Girling appointed as preferred bidder.
Where these costs are recovered at financial close, they are initially applied against the relevant asset included in stocks.
Any surplus is then treated as deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the period of the contract to which they relate.
Costs incurred post our appointment as preferred bidder are included in stocks, provided the asset recognition criteria are met.
The effect of adopting UITF 34 was to reduce reported profit before tax by 1.1 million in 2002 and by 0.3 million in 2001.
It had no impact on the Groups cash flows.
Full details of the Groups accounting policy for bid costs is given in Note 1 to the financial statements on page 53 and the effect of the change is set out in Note 31 on page 76.
Details of the Groups other key accounting policies can also be found in Note 1 to the financial statements on pages 51 to 53. International Accounting Standards In June 2002 the European Council of Ministers finalised the legislation that requires listed European Union companies to adopt International Accounting Standards IAS by 2005.
UK accounting standards are based on similar principles to IAS but there are some differences, which may ultimately require adjustments to reported results, presentation and disclosure.
