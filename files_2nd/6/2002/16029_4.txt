13 TRA V IS PERKINS PLC Treasury risk management Treasury activities are managed centrally under a framework of policies and procedures approved and monitored by the board.
The objectives are to protect the assets of the group and to identify and then manage financial risk.
In applying its policies, the group will utilise derivative instruments, but only for risk management purposes.
The principal risk facing the group is an exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange risk as most purchases are invoiced in sterling.
These risks are described further below: Interest rate risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and loan notes.
The group borrows at floating rates and uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates see note 20 to generate the preferred interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Currency risk The group usually buys currency at spot rates.
While this was the situation during 2002, forward contracts may be purchased where appropriate.
Liquidity risk he groups policy has been to ensure that it has committed borrowing facilities in place in excess of its peak forecast gross borrowings for at least the next twelve months.
