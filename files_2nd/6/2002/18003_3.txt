Operating and Financial Review 08: Operating and Financial Review Central London Office Market Overview Supply and Demand The last twelve months have been challenging for the Central London Office market with take up reducing by approximately 46% on the previous year to just over 10.4 million sq ft.
This compares to a 10 year average of approximately 13.0 million sq ft Source: Knight Frank.
The Canary Wharf district accounted for approximately 1.8 million sq ft of take up over the year.
Canary Wharf has the The overall vacancy rate for Central London has increased in that period from 5.2% to 9.2%, lowest vacancy rate of with the City experiencing the largest increase in vacancy rates Source: Knight Frank.
any Central London However, the composition of the supply dynamic and the key quantitative and qualitative submarket variations are important to identify, including: A large proportion of overall supply is in small, fragmented, second-hand units: 88% of all available units 40% of available space are of less than 15,000 sq ft Source: Knight Frank.
The majority of supply is refurbished and or second-hand: only 15% of all available accommodation in Central London is new Source: Knight Frank.
The Canary Wharf district, however, whilst having the lowest vacancy rate of any Central London submarket 4.5%, has the highest proportion of available and completed new accommodation albeit all the vacant accommodation is high quality, Grade A space, typically in units of 18,000 sq ft or larger.
Of the available vacant space, only one fifth is attributable to Canary Wharf Group, the remainder being tenant disposals.

This is largely due to the continued uncertainty regarding the general macro-economic recovery, particularly in the US and this has continued to impact on take up across Central London.
In addition, as occupier requirements have been satisfied, they have not been fully replaced by new requirements.
However, there has still been significant pre-letting activity during the last 12 months, including Paddington Central Kingfisher and Visa, Plantation Place Accenture and Paternoster Square Goldman Sachs.
Major pre-lets have also been secured at Canary Wharf Barclays, Bank of America, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Allen & Overy.
These pre-let transactions at Canary Wharf reflect the continuing desire of occupiers for highly specified, flexible and customised new Grade A buildings and, importantly, an increasing focus on 'value for money'.
Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Operating and Financial Review :09 There is currently 6.8 million sq ft of speculative construction underway across Central London, of which 4.4 million sq ft is due to be delivered during 2003.
The majority of speculative development is focused on the City, accounting for over 56% of the Central London total Source: Jones Lang LaSalle.
Canary Wharf Group will be delivering approximately 590,000 sq ft of new, speculative Grade A accommodation in the second quarter of next year in 40 Bank Street and 20 Canada Square.
However, as a result of the challenging market conditions and a cautious approach from funders and developers, there have been limited eight significant starts of new buildings in excess of 100,000 sq ft during the course of the last 12 months with none occurring in, or since the end of, the last quarter Source: Knight Frank.
This, therefore, is likely to limit the delivery of new accommodation in 2004 and 2005.
Rents At Canary Wharf The continued slowdown in take up and increased levels of availability has led to a reduction top rents of and continued downward pressure on rents in most submarkets of Central London, approximately 45 psf particularly in the West End.
DTZ report prime rents in the West End have reduced from achieved in open market 82.50 psf to 72.50 psf and from 62.50 psf to 60 psf in the City.
Knight Frank report that lettings over the last Docklands excluding Canary Wharf prime rents are currently 30 psf.
The reduction in rents, 6 months particularly in the West End, largely occurred in the latter part of 2001.
However, in the last two quarters, whilst the prime rents remain under pressure, they are reported to have maintained their level, although this may also be due to a lack of transactional evidence Source: Knight Frank.
At Canary Wharf, the top rents achieved in open market lettings over the last six months are approximately 45 psf on accommodation which is to be completed by the middle of next year.
As mentioned before, a key factor of the market is the supply dynamic, with limited availability of new accommodation and a large proportion of small, fragmented units being key features of the Central London Office Market at present.
Therefore, to date, downward rental pressure is perceived to have been greater in the fragmented, second-hand sector.
There is also a greater focus from occupiers on cost and value for money in these more demanding and stringent economic times.
This we believe will benefit locations such as Canary Wharf that can offer high quality new accommodation on competitive financial terms.

In January 2002, The Northern Trust Company exercised an option over 18,000 sq ft in 50 Bank Street, bringing their total occupation to 151,400 sq ft. Also in January 2002, EMEA exercised an option over 15,700 sq ft in 7 Westferry Circus, bringing their total occupancy on the estate to approximately 100,000 sq ft.
In April 2002, Clifford Chance exercised their option over 209,000 sq ft being the remainder of 10 Upper Bank Street.
In June 2002 the group exchanged contracts with Allen & Overy to lease 78,200 sq ft in parcel HQ3.
On the retail front, Waitrose increased their space requirement by 20,000 sq ft to 100,000 sq ft in the Canada Place retail extension and over 95% of the space was committed or under offer in the new Jubilee Place Mall, which is scheduled to open in September 2003.
In November 2001 the group announced that it had reached agreement with British Waterways Board BWB relating to the removal of a restrictive covenant affecting the remaining development sites within Canary Wharf.
The agreement with BWB relates to 1.7 million sq ft of potential development with existing planning permission and, when added to the total space already built or under construction of 14.0 million sq ft, raises the total development of Canary Wharf to 15.7 million sq ft.
In addition the development sites which were acquired during 2000 at North Quay and Riverside allow development of 2.1 million sq ft net based on existing planning permissions.
Application will be made in due course to modify and increase the existing planning permissions applicable to these sites by up to a further 2 million sq ft. Construction of new buildings will commence as and when market conditions allow and subject to planning.

Only tenants which 18% of the square footage under lease will expire or be capable of being terminated by provide a diversified tenants during the next ten years.
As a result of the expiry of rent free periods, stepped rents, income stream rent reviews and the completion of new buildings, the groups aggregate rental income is expected to increase significantly over the next three years.
Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Operating and Financial Review :13 Valuations The net assets of the group, as stated in its consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2002, were 1,860.3 million.
In arriving at this total: i properties held as investments were carried at 3,268.1 million, which represents the Open Market Value of those properties of 3,278.8 million at that date as determined by the groups external valuers, FPDSavills or CB Hillier Parker, adjusted by 10.7 million for tenant incentives as required by Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 28 Operating Lease Incentives UITF 28 and ii properties under construction and properties held for development, shown as fixed assets, were carried at 936.6 million and 178.7 million respectively, representing their cost to the group.
Properties completed The valuation of the investment portfolio includes those properties which were completed during the period were during the year.
For those properties held throughout the year the valuation increased from revalued resulting in a 2,300.5 million at 30 June 2001 to 2,329.5 million at 30 June 2002, an increase of revaluation surplus 28.1 million net of additions, or 1.2%.
Properties completed during the period were also of 430.3 million revalued resulting in a revaluation surplus over their cost of 430.3 million.
As well as valuing the investment properties, FPDSavills or CB Hillier Parker have valued all properties under construction, comprising those properties set out in the table on page 12.
The Open Market Value of properties under construction at 30 June 2002 was 1,915.1 million in comparison with a carrying value for accounts purposes of 936.6 million.
In valuing the properties under construction, the valuers have allowed for estimated costs to complete, including fit-out.
In addition they have allowed for letting, disposal and marketing costs and financing costs.
As regards properties held for development, the valuers have provided joint opinions as at 30 June 2002 that the Open Market Value was 390.8 million in comparison with a carrying value for accounts purposes of 178.7 million.
In valuing the properties held for development, the valuers have allowed for estimated costs to complete, including an allowance for fit-out.
At the same time as providing their opinion of the Open Market Value of properties under construction or held for development, the valuers were also instructed to give their opinion of the present value of the Net Realisable Value of such properties.
Net Realisable Value is defined in SSAP 9 Stocks and Long-term Contracts as the actual or estimated selling price net of trade but before settlement discounts less: a all further costs to completion: and b all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distributing.
This same definition of Net Realisable Value is reproduced in Practice Statement 21 of the RICS Manual Valuations of Trading Stock and Work in Progress, including Land and Buildings.
The Net Realisable Value of the groups properties under construction and properties held for development comprises Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Operating and Financial Review 14: Operating and Financial Review an assessment of the total value to the group, arising from owning and developing those properties, being the aggregate of: a the Open Market Value of the land: b developers profit: c the effect on value of Enterprise Zone Allowances EZAs : and d finance holding costs on the site value and other minor items arising from the fact that the land is already in the ownership of the group.
Thus, Net Realisable Value allows consideration to be given to the enhancement in value to the group arising from b, c and d which do not form part of Open Market Value in the properties existing state.
The approach adopted by the valuers in arriving at the present value of the Net Realisable Value at 30 June 2002 is consistent with that adopted for the previous year end.
In summary this involves the following six steps: Step One Consider a phased development programme for the remaining sites on the estate, taking into account the amount of space to be developed and the rate of take-up.
Step Two Estimate the completed development value, with growth, of the buildings, but excluding EZAs.
Step Three Estimate the value enhancement resulting from EZAs.
Step Four Estimate the cost of development, with inflation.
Step Five Calculate the Net Realisable Value on completion of development by deducting the cost of the development, with inflation, from the total value with growth of the completed buildings.
Step Six Discount the Net Realisable Value at completion back to the date of assessment in recognition of the time cost of money, in order to arrive at the present value of the Net Realisable Value.
At 30 June 2002 the valuers adopted a discount rate of 7.15%, which represents a notional cost of borrowing equal to 2% above the 10 year gilt rate.
This compares with a rate adopted at the previous year end of 7.25%.
On the basis outlined above the valuers opinion of the present value of the Net Realisable Value of the properties under construction at 30 June 2002 was 2,586.6 million.
Their joint opinion of the present value of the Net Realisable Value of properties held for development at that date was 903.8 million.

Operating Results In the following review of operating results, references to 2002 and 2001 should be read as references to the years ended 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2001 respectively.
The results for 2002 reflect the implementation of Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Tax FRS 19 and Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 28 Operating Lease Incentives UITF 28 and the comparatives for 2001 have been restated accordingly.
Turnover increased from The groups turnover is generated primarily by the rents and service charges earned from 159.2 million in 2001 to its property interests at Canary Wharf.
Turnover increased from 159.2 million in 2001 to 206.8 million in 2002, 206.8 million in 2002, an increase of 47.6 million or 29.9% of which 15.5 million was an increase of 29.9% attributable to the adoption of UITF 28 Note 1.
Rental income increased from 121.7 million to 164.6 million, an increase of 42.9 million or 35.3%, due primarily to rent reviews and the commencement of rent on recently completed properties.
Service charge income increased from 28.4 million to 32.8 million, an increase of 4.4 million or 15.5%, due primarily to the increased level of occupancy on the estate.
Miscellaneous income, comprising ground rents, insurance recoveries and tenant service income increased from 9.1 million to 9.4 million, reflecting the increased provision of tenant services outside of the standard service charge as occupancy on the estate increases.
Rents payable and property management costs increased from 32.8 million to 39.2 million, an increase of 6.4 million or 19.5%, due primarily to the increase in occupancy on the estate.
After allowing for service charge and other recoveries included within turnover, there was a full service charge recovery for 2002.
Gross profits increased from 126.4 million in 2001 to 167.6 million in 2002, an increase of 41.2 million or 32.6% over the previous year, attributable to the increase in rental income.
Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Operating and Financial Review 16: Operating and Financial Review During 2001, the lease of a vacant leasehold property was assigned to a third party.
As a result of this assignment, the surplus provision relating to vacant leaseholds of 2.6 million was released to the profit and loss account and shown within cost of sales.
Administrative expenses for 2002 were 38.1 million in comparison with 36.6 million for the previous year.
During 2002 costs of 2.4 million were also incurred in association with the groups restructuring which have been treated as an exceptional item Note1.
The directors estimate that administrative expenses of 23.2 million or approximately 61% of the total for 2002 were attributable to the groups corporate and property investment activities.
For the previous year administrative expenses attributable to these activities were estimated at 16.4 million, or 44.8% of the total.
The remainder of the administrative expenses are attributable to unallocated overheads associated with the groups development programme which are expensed to the profit and loss account as opposed to costs directly attributable to and capitalised as part of the cost of construction of particular buildings.
For 2002 such unallocated development overheads totalled 14.9 million representing approximately 39% of administrative expenses.
For the previous year development overheads totalled 20.2 million or 55.2% of the total.
The reduction in development overheads over the previous year is largely attributable to letting costs.
The current year included letting costs of 5.3 million whereas for the previous year such costs totalled 10.9 million.
This was partially offset by an increase in development overheads associated with the increased pace of development on the estate.
The directors consider that these development overheads will in due course reduce to an insignificant level upon completion of the development programme.
Before exceptional For 2002 operating profit was 299.7 million, in comparison with a profit of 91.7 million for items operating profit 2001.
Included within the total for 2002 was a net profit of 169.5 million on the disposal of increased from 8 Canada Square which was sold under the terms of an agreement with HSBC entered 91.7 million in 2001 to into in October 1998.
Before this exceptional item the operating profit for the year of 130.2 million in 2002 130.2 million compares with 91.7 million for the previous year, an increase of 38.5 million an increase of 42% or 42.0%.
The improvement in underlying profit earned by the group is primarily attributable to the increase in turnover.
Net interest payable increased from 48.8 million in 2001 to 107.6 million in 2002.
The increase in net interest payable is partly attributable to the fact that the previous year included a net gain to the group of 4.5 million derived from the unwind of interest rate swaps relating to certain deposits that were released from security in the year Note 5.
In addition, net interest payable for the year to June 2002 included costs of 4.1 million attributable to the restructuring of certain of the groups finance leases Note 6.
After allowing for these items the increase in net interest payable was attributable to the securitisations completed in June 2001 and February 2002.
The long term financing of the seven properties in the securitisations enabled the return of capital programme to be accelerated whilst also providing funding for the completion of these properties.
The profit on ordinary activities after interest for the year was 203.1 million, in comparison with 42.5 million for 2001, an increase of 160.6 million, because of the inclusion in the current year of the net profit on the sale of 8 Canada Square of 169.5 million and deferred consideration on disposal of subsidiary undertakings of 13.4 million, partially offset by costs Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Operating and Financial Review :17 associated with the groups restructuring.
Before these exceptional items the profit on ordinary activities for the year of 22.6 million compares with 42.5 million for the previous year, a decrease of 19.9 million as a result of higher interest payable.
The profit on ordinary activities for the six months to 30 June 2002 was 176.9 million including the exceptional profit of 169.5 million on disposal of 8 Canada Square.
This compares with 26.2 million for the six months to 31 December 2001 which included the net cost of restructuring certain finance leases of 4.1 million, 13.4 million of deferred consideration on disposal of subsidiary undertakings and the 2.4 million cost of the group restructuring referred to above.
Operating profit increased in the second half of the year from 54.5 million to 75.7 million, excluding the exceptional profit on disposal, but this was offset by a higher net interest charge.
For 2002 and 2001 as restated taxation was entirely attributable to deferred tax following the adoption of FRS19.
This accounting standard has no effect on cashflow.
Moreover, the directors believe it does not reflect the actual tax which may become payable in the future.
The profit on ordinary activities after tax for 2002 was 193.0 million in comparison with 43.6 million restated for the previous year, an increase of 149.4 million, largely attributable to the exceptional items referred to above.
Balance Sheet On the basis of the groups statutory balance sheet, which does not reflect any revaluation of properties under construction or held for development, net asset value increased by 263.9 million from 1,596.4 million at 30 June 2001 as restated to 1,860.3 million at 30 June 2002.
The increase in net asset value was attributable to a revaluation surplus of 458.4 million together with the profit for the year of 193.0 million, partially offset by share buy-backs in the year totalling 392.4 million.
Net asset value per share at 30 June 2002 was 3.06 in comparison with 2.33 at 30 June 2001.
Allowing for the revaluation of properties under construction or held for development on the basis of the present value of Net Realisable Value summarised on page 15, net asset value per share at 30 June 2002 was as set out in the table below: Restated At 30 June 2002 At 30 June 2001 m m Adjusted net asset Net assets per statutory balance sheet 1,860.3 1,596.4 value per share Revaluation of properties under construction to NRV 1,650.0 2,080.2 Revaluation of properties held for development to NRV 725.1 1,065.2 increased from 6.97 to 7.05 4,235.4 4,741.8 Add: Discounted deferred tax provision 51.6 41.5 Adjusted net assets 4,287.0 4,783.3 Adjusted net assets per share 7.05 6.97 Fully diluted adjusted net assets per share 6.83 6.74 Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Operating and Financial Review 18: Operating and Financial Review In arriving at adjusted net asset value per share, the provision recognised in accordance with FRS19 Deferred Tax has been added back.
FRS 19 requires, inter alia, provision for deferred tax on capital allowances claimed notwithstanding that no tax would become payable unless the related properties were disposed of.
In contrast no provision is required for the tax which would become payable if the group were to dispose of its properties at their revalued amount.
This inconsistency in the standard has therefore been reversed in calculating the adjusted net asset value per share.
Treasury Objectives The principal objectives of the groups treasury function are to ensure the availability of finance to meet the groups current and anticipated requirements and to minimise the groups cost of capital.
The treasury function operates as a cost centre rather than a profit centre and does not engage in the trading of financial instruments.
The groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The group enters into derivatives transactions principally interest rate swaps, caps and collars only in order to manage the interest rate risk arising from the groups variable rate borrowings.
The Executive Committee of the board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks associated with the groups financial instruments and these policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year, are summarised below.
Interest Rate Risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of surplus cash, bank borrowings and debentures.
The group borrows principally in sterling at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps, caps or collars to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The groups policy is to keep the majority of its borrowings at fixed rates and at 30 June 2002 94.5% 2001 94.6% of the groups borrowings were fixed after taking account of interest rate hedging and cash deposits held as cash collateral see Note 17 11.
Liquidity Risk As regards liquidity, the groups policy is to ensure continuity of funding and to have the majority of its borrowings mature in 10 years or more.
At the year-end the average maturity of the groups debt was 18.6 years.
Shorter term flexibility is achieved by holding cash on deposit, through construction facilities with a term of typically 3 to 5 years arranged to fund the development of new properties, and by using the short term revolving notes of the June 2000 securitisation.
Exchange Rate Risk Although the groups policy is to maximise all financing in sterling, it currently has some borrowings in Euros and US Dollars.

Canary Wharf Group plc Report & Financial Statements 2002 Operating and Financial Review :19 Borrowings 1,257 million In February 2002 a further tap issue on the June 2000 second securitisation was securitisation completed, involving the issue of 1,257 million of AAA and AA rated notes at a premium of completed in 83.1 million.
The proceeds were used to repay 280.7 million drawn down under the February 2002 groups 1 billion construction loan facility at that time and in addition 348.8 million was set aside in certain reserves required to fund the completion of the four additional properties included in the tap issue.
The remainder of the proceeds was retained for general corporate purposes.
The combined pool of notes for the second securitisation is now 2,607.0 million, of which 2,517.0 million 97% is rated AAA or AA.
The balance of 90 million, rated A or BBB, has been repurchased by the group but will be available for resale following completion of the buildings on Heron Quays in mid 2003.
At 30 June 2002 22.7 million had been drawn down under the groups 1 billion construction loan facility.
In addition, 34.2 million had been drawn down under a separate 125 million loan facility.
The remainder of these facilities are available to fund future construction.
An analysis of net debt is given below.
The increase in gross borrowings from 2,650.1 million to 3,950.0 million reflects the tap issue of the second securitisation.
The increase in gross borrowings was accompanied by a reduction in cash and term deposits to 1,327.2 million from 1,458.4 million primarily as a result of development costs totalling 1,033.2 million and share buy-backs of 392.4 million.
At 30 June 2002 the groups weighted average cost of debt was 6.3% 2001 6.7%.
The group expects initially to fund its future construction activities either from existing resources or from its construction facilities.

Capital expenditure increased from 611.5 million in 2001 71.1 million in 2001 to to 987.2 million in 2002.
Expenditure in 2002 included development expenditure of 81.2 million in 2002 957.2 million and land purchases of 28.0 million, whilst expenditure in 2001 included development expenditure of 511.1 million and land purchases of 92.1 million.
Financing cashflows reduced from 1,018.7 million in 2001 to 902.5 million in 2002, a reduction of 116.2 million.

This increase in borrowings has also impacted the net cash expended on debt service which rose from 70.6 million in 2001 to 173.6 million in 2002.

For 2002, Canary I recorded a profit before tax of 207.7 million, including exceptional items totalling 180.5 million.
Canary II recorded a loss before tax of 4.6 million for 2002, attributable entirely to administrative expenses associated with working up proposals for its development sites.
The directors estimate that of the total development overheads of 14.9 million for 2002, 10.3 million was attributable to Canary I and the remaining 4.6 million was attributable to Canary II.
The directors consider that development overheads attributable to Canary I will in due course reduce to an insignificant level upon completion of the development programme.
Throughout 2002 Canary II was funded by way of an interest free inter-company loan.
