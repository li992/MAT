Operating and financial review REVIEW OF RESULTS FOR 2002 Overview Turnover for the Group was 461.1 million, an increase of 6.1% over the previous year at constant exchange rates.
At actual exchange rates, the increase was 2.1%.
Growth was strong in Asia and Europe but there was lower turnover in America where market conditions were weak in the oil and chemical sectors and in telecommunications testing, however, each of the four operating divisions reported increased turnover in the year, with Labtest delivering over 13% year on year growth at constant exchange rates.
Total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items improved by 10.2 million to 76.9 million which was 15.3% at constant exchange rates.
At actual exchange rates, the increase was 10.2%.
Labtest, ETL SEMKO and FTS all delivered strong year on year growth while Caleb Brett reported a small decline due to depressed oil and chemical markets.
The Group made some small acquisitions in the year, costing 0.4 million in total, which did not have a significant effect on the results.
Group profit margins after central overheads increased by 1.3% to 16.7%.

Review of 2002 divisional performance Operating profit referred to in the discussion below is total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
Labtest Labtest continued to perform strongly.
At constant exchange rates, Labtests turnover increased by 13.3% to 123.8 million and operating profit increased by 22.4% to 41.5 million.
At actual exchange rates, reported turnover and operating profit growth was 8.2% and 16.6% respectively.
Most of the growth came from Asia where textile testing, toy testing, inspection and social compliance audit continued to perform well as a result of increasing demand for quality by consumers, more safety standards, growing numbers of product variants, shorter product life cycles and the continuing migration of manufacturing from developed countries to Asia.
Turnover in China grew strongly in the established operations in Shanghai and Shenzhen, the new hardlines laboratory in Shanghai and the new textile testing facility in Guangzhou.
The divisions operating margin at constant exchange rates, increased from 31.0% to 33.5% principally due to continued improvement in operating procedures in Hong Kong and growth in China where operating costs are lower than in Hong Kong.

com Operating and financial review Caleb Brett At constant exchange rates, turnover increased by 2.6% to 172.8 million but operating profit declined by 1.2% to 16.3 million.
At actual exchange rates, reported turnover and operating profit declined 1.8% and 6.3% respectively.
The cargo inspection and testing market accounted for 77% of the business.
This part of the business operated in a competitive market.
The oil market was slow with a decline in fuel oil shipments in the United States at the start of the year due to the relatively warm winter and reduced oil shipments to power stations during the year because of low natural gas prices.
Oil shipments generally were low due to stock levels being kept at a minimum.
Caleb Bretts operating margin at constant exchange rates reduced from 9.8% to 9.4%.
The decline in turnover in the traditional inspection business was more than offset by growth in the testing outsourced to Caleb Brett by oil and chemical companies.
This segment showed modest growth, accounting for 23% of Caleb Bretts turnover.
The number of customers interested in outsourcing continues to increase and the outlook for growth is positive.
ETL SEMKO At constant exchange rates, ETL SEMKOs turnover increased by 4.8% to 104.7 million and operating profit increased by 12.9% to 14.0 million.
At actual exchange rates, reported turnover and operating profit increased by 1.6% and 9.4% respectively.
Growth was mainly due to there being more safety testing of household appliances manufactured in Asia for export to North America and Europe, increased safety and electrical testing in Sweden and increased testing of building products and HVAC equipment in North America.
Telecom testing in the US and Europe, which together represented some 8% of the divisions turnover, declined due to the lack of product development and therefore testing.
This trend started in mid 2001 and continued for the rest of that year but which stabilised mid 2002.
The divisions operating margin at constant exchange rates, increased from 12.4% to 13.4%, mainly due to cost reductions in 2002 in the United States.
Foreign Trade Standards FTS had a good year with strong growth in operating profit and improved margins.
At constant exchange rates, turnover increased by 5.3% to 59.8 million and operating profit increased by 24.2% to 11.3 million.
At actual exchange rates, reported turnover and operating profit increased by 3.3% and 18.9% respectively.
The operating margin at constant exchange rates, increased from 16.0% to 18.9%.
The increase in operating profit was primarily driven by the expansion of the pre-shipment inspection programme in Nigeria in the latter part of 2001.
The Nigerian programme in its present form was due to terminate in June 2002 but has been extended.
Turnover from the standards testing programme in Saudi Arabia grew due to the addition of new products to the programme, but there were increased operating costs.
On 29 May 2002, the Group announced that it had received notification from SASO that the programme may cease at the end of August 2002, but this proved not to be the case.
The programme is well established and contractually it runs until at least August 2003.
The pre-shipment inspection programmes in Kenya, Iran and Uzbekistan generated growth in operating profit but closure costs were incurred in connection with discontinued programmes in Uganda and Argentina.
Central overheads Central overheads at constant exchange rates, increased by 19.2% to 6.2 million in the year, primarily due to additional costs involved in strengthening compliance and increased rent at the Groups head office in London.
Operating exceptional items The Group reported an exceptional operating credit of 15.6 million in 2002 compared to exceptional costs of 23.1 million in 2001.
The credit comprised cash received from Inchcape plc in connection with indemnified claims arising on the sale of Inchcape Testing Services in 1996, cash received from the Groups insurers in respect of costs provided in earlier years relating to litigation in respect of the discontinued Environmental Testing division and the recovery of certain FTS government debts previously provided against.

com Interest The Groups net interest charge before exceptional items for the year was 22.5 million compared to 39.2 million a year ago.
The pre-flotation debt was repaid and new banking facilities were put in place in June and July 2002 which reduced the Groups interest charge in the second half of the year.
Had this refinancing occurred on 1 January 2002 the interest charge for the year would have been approximately 10.5 million.
The Group incurred an exceptional finance charge of 15.5 million in 2002.
This comprised bond redemption fees of 7.3 million and accelerated fee amortisation on repaid loans and share warrants of 8.2 million.
Profit before tax Profit before tax was 53.9 million compared to 6.4 million in 2001.
Taxation Tax on profit before exceptional items was 16.0 million, 0.7 million lower than last year and the effective tax rate before exceptional items reduced from 56.6% to 29.7%.
The main reason for the reduction in the effective tax rate was the reduced interest expense which resulted from the reorganisation of the Groups capital structure following the IPO.
The effective tax rate is expected to remain close to 30% in the foreseeable future.
There was no tax impact from the exceptional items.
The exceptional income is either permanently non taxable, or is offset by brought forward losses.
The exceptional expense is generally deductible but is not absorbed by current year taxable income.
Net profit Net profit after tax and exceptional items was 37.9 million compared to a loss last year of 10.3 million.
Earnings per share As set out in note 9 to the financial statements, basic earnings per share in the year before exceptional items were 27.1p.
After exceptional items this increased to 27.2p.
An underlying earnings per share calculation is also shown which removes the impact of exceptional items and goodwill amortisation to give an underlying earnings per share of 27.8p.
The Groups new capital and debt structure was put in place part way through the year which impacted the interest and tax charges and the weighted average number of shares in issue.
If the new capital and debt structure had been in place for the whole year, the pro-forma basic earnings per share would have been 27.1p.
This provides a more reliable comparison of the underlying results of the Group when comparing with future periods.
Dividend No interim dividend was paid for the six months to 30 June 2002.
A final dividend of 5.2p per share has been proposed, which subject to shareholder approval will be paid on 18 June 2003, to shareholders on the register at 6 June 2003.
Going forward, the Group expects to recommend to shareholders, the payment of both an interim and a final dividend.
Shareholders funds The net profit after minority interests for 2002 of 33.6 million was reduced by a provision for the final dividend of 8.0 million and an actuarial loss on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes of 6.5 million, and was increased by foreign exchange movements of 6.5 million to reduce shareholders deficit by 25.6 million.
The issue of new shares in the year increased shareholders funds by 232.3 million.
Preference shares of 105.5 million were redeemed during the year.
At the end of 2002, shareholders funds were in deficit by 90.5 million compared to a deficit of 242.9 million at 31 December 2001.
The deficit arises principally from the write-off of goodwill in 1996 when the Group was purchased from its former owners.
This amounted to 264.7 million at 31 December 2002.
Excluding this historic goodwill write-off, shareholders funds would show a surplus of 174.2 million at 31 December 2002.

com Operating and financial review Cash flow Total operating cash inflow was 97.4 million in the year, up 27.4 million on last year.
The increase is impacted by exceptional cash inflow in 2002 and exceptional cash outflow in 2001.
The cash inflow in the year included exceptional net cash inflow of 13.6 million relating to income from the settlement of claims against the Groups former parent, insurance refunds and debts collected from foreign governments which had previously been written off offset by restructuring costs, legal fees and other costs.
In 2001, there was exceptional net cash outflow of 8.7 million related to fines and legal costs, net of insurance recoveries, and restructuring costs.
Excluding exceptional cash flows, cash generated by operations was 83.8 million 2001: 78.7 million.
In May 2002, the Group raised 232.7 million, net of issue costs, from shareholders by floating on the London Stock Exchange.
Shortly afterwards, new banking facilities were made available and existing debt, debentures and preference shares were repaid.
Accounting policies The accounting policies of the Group remain unchanged from last year.
The Group elected to adopt FRS 17: Retirement benefits and FRS 19: Deferred tax in its 2001 accounts, ahead of the mandatory deadlines.
There were net actuarial losses of 6.5 million on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes in the year and the net liabilities increased to 7.4 million.
The actuarial pension losses are charged to shareholders funds through the statement of recognised gains and losses and the pension liabilities are included in the Group balance sheet.
Treasury controls Policy The Groups treasury and funding activities are undertaken by a centralized treasury function.
Its primary activities are to manage the Groups liquidity, funding and financial risk, principally arising from movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to ensure that adequate liquidity and finance resource is available to support the Groups growth and development while managing these risks.
The Groups policy is not to engage in speculative transactions.
Group Treasury operates as a service centre within clearly defined objectives and controls and is subject to periodic review by internal audit.
Foreign currency exposure Translation exposure: the results of the Groups overseas activities are translated into sterling using the cumulative average exchange rates for the period concerned.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated at closing exchange rates.
The Groups borrowings are principally held in US dollars.
Exposures arising from the translation of balance sheet net assets in foreign currencies are mainly matched using currency borrowings.
Transaction exposure: the Groups policy requires overseas subsidiaries to hedge all significant transaction exposures with Group Treasury where they are managed centrally.
Subsidiaries transaction exposures include committed foreign currency sales and purchases together with the anticipated transactions reasonably expected to occur during future periods.
The Groups policy is also to hedge transaction exposures arising from the remittance of overseas dividends and interest as soon as they are committed.
Committed transaction exposures are hedged forward using forward currency contracts.
Interest rate risk and exposure The Groups policy is to maintain an appropriate balance of fixed and variable rate debt to minimize interest expenses while managing interest rate exposure.
This balance will be periodically adjusted on the basis of prevailing and anticipated market conditions and the Groups gearing and interest cover, which are monitored by Group Treasury.
Approximately 31% of the Groups principal borrowings have been fixed for up to three years through interest rate swaps.
16 Intertek Annual Report and Accounts 2002 www.
com Liquidity risk Group policy is to ensure that projected financing needs are supported by adequate committed facilities.
The Group has 300 million committed multi-currency facilities available to it extending to June 2007.
At 31 December 2002, drawings under these committed facilities totalled 250 million excluding the impact of foreign exchange adjustments, providing the Group with adequate facility head-room to support the Groups medium term funding requirements.
Surplus cash is placed on deposit with short term maturities providing liquidity when required.
Counterparty credit risk The Group monitors the distribution of cash deposits, borrowings and hedging instruments which are assigned to each of the Groups counterparties and which are subject to periodic review.
Litigation From time to time the Group is involved in claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of the business, including claims for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing and disputes from former employees.
The following procedures are adopted to minimise both the potential and actual cost to the Group as follows: rigorous compliance policies and procedures: a zero tolerance policy: thorough investigation of all claims: adequate insurance policies are maintained to cover certain claims from customers should any claims be successful.
