chief executives review From Xstratas side, we have not stood still.
Since July: we have established a high-level Transformation Committee, which I chair, comprising the chief executives of our South African businesses, a senior historically disadvantaged South African HDSA, who drives the process within the Group, four other senior executives and an external advisor: we have developed a broad transformation strategy, which claries the current status of our South African businesses and sets out how we propose to achieve the targets specified in the Charter.
This is now being rened into a comprehensive and detailed plan, which will be submitted to the DME in order to secure the transfer of our rights, as provided for under the legislation.
We are confident that the Company already meets many of the social and employee targets set by the Charter: we have met the Minister and her advisors on several occasions to advance specic issues and to keep her informed of our progress.
In addition, we have presented an overview of our transformation plan to the Minister and members of the DME team, and we have been encouraged by the positive response we have received, and by the congruence of our approaches and ultimate objectives: and we have entered into substantive discussions with a number of credible Black Empowerment Groups, regarding their potential participation in our assets.
As part of this process, we have devised transaction structures at the asset level, which embrace meaningful ownership or partnerships, providing genuine and comprehensive participation in the business, and which include realistic options for facilitating appropriate nancing that preserve Xstratas access to cashows and advantageous financial and tax structure.
In all of this, Xstrata enjoys a number of structural and other advantages, which provide further protection for our assets and earnings.
The provisions of the Act, Charter and Money Bill which will deal with the issue of royalties do not apply to all our South African assets.
Our non-mining chrome and vanadium plants are excluded, as is our shareholding in Richards Bay Coal Terminal.
In addition, as we already pay royalties on the supply of ore into our alloys business, we do not anticipate that the Money Bill will have any material impact on our alloys business.
A number of issues remain to be resolved, including practical questions associated with the application of the scorecard, and the critical matter of the royalty fee to be paid to government in respect of the mineral rights now leased from the State.
The process is taking longer than some commentators have expected.
I believe this reects the seriousness with which all parties are engaging on this issue, the complexities associated with balancing commercial and political imperatives as well as the sheer scope of work involved in policy change of this magnitude and importance.
This was clearly anticipated in the creation of the five-year period of grace for the transfer of rights, which is provided for in the legislation.
Based on the significant progress we have already made, I remain confident that Xstrata will secure the transfer of its rights, with shareholder value intact, in a much shorter time-frame.
There is a strong and genuine commitment by all stakeholders the government, the Black Empowerment Groups, the unions and the mining companies to achieve a satisfactory outcome, which transforms the industry without destroying its existing strengths or South Africas investment appeal.
Equity Capital Management Programme The Group has given considerable thought to implementing a share repurchase programme and has developed and put in place an innovative equity capital management programme ECMP that secures all the economic benets of a share buyback, while conferring all the advantages of a conventional treasury stock programme.
12 Xstrata plc The ECMP, which enables the purchase of up to 10% of Xstratas shares in the market, is expected to deliver a number of significant benets to the Xstrata Group.
These include: providing economic exposure of up to 10% of the issued share capital of the Group, without cancelling the shares in Xstrata plc: enhancing earnings per share in a tax efficient manner: providing additional exibility in nancing future acquisitions: and improving balance sheet efficiency.
I believe that the ECMP will be an important, strategic tool for the Group in these volatile markets.
Further details on its structure and application are set out in the Financial Review.
Write-downs: Windimurra and Magnesium Plant Two projects, initiated by the old Xstrata AG prior to the IPO, have failed to deliver their promise.
In the case of the Windimurra Vanadium plant, in Western Australia, managements outstanding achievement in cutting costs by over 56% in the last two years was defeated by the chronic oversupply and consequent low prices in the Vanadium industry and by the plants debilitating exposure to a strengthening Australian Dollar.
The Magnesium Recycling Facility, in Indiana, which came on stream last year, has not been able to source adequate quantities of magnesium scrap or to penetrate the vital US automobile market a situation exacerbated by the exceptionally depressed prices for magnesium alloys.
Following the IPO, the Executive initiated a process, not complete at the time of the interim results in July, to assess the on-going viability of these projects, and their appropriateness to the Groups strategy.
Having reviewed the results, the Directors of Xstrata have decided to write off the carrying value of both assets in the financial statements of the Group at 31 December 2002, giving rise to impairment charges, totalling US$50.8 million in the 2002 accounts.
Production will cease and operations be suspended at Windimurra, and options will be pursued to divest the Magnesium recycling facility.
Outlook It would be brave and perhaps foolish to predict the development of the global economy in 2003.
Much will depend on renewed growth in the United States, the continued strength of the Chinese economy, the resolution of the impasse in Iraq and decisively a return of investor confidence and trust.
However, as I noted at the half-year, great opportunities to create value are often to be found in times, like these, of complexity and market weakness.
I have set out our thrust in this regard and I am confident of our ability to deliver.
In the meantime, Xstratas operations are in excellent shape and we will benefit from the investments made in 2002, a growing demand for ferrochrome and a more stable coal market.
While we do not believe that 2003 will herald a recovery of the Zinc price, we expect to place all our product at satisfactory, if not heroic, margins.
In sum, 2003 holds greater challenges and greater opportunities than 2002.
Xstrata is well positioned to meet the challenges and to seize the opportunities of the year ahead.
Michael Davis Xstrata plc 13 financial review Basis of presentation of financial information The financial information is presented in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
The majority of the Groups commodities are sold in US Dollars.
The reporting currency is US Dollars however the financial statements of subsidiaries are maintained in their functional local currencies and converted to US Dollars on consolidation of the Group results.
The statutory merger of Xstrata AG with Xstrata plc has been accounted for using the merger method of accounting under which the results and cash ows of Xstrata AG are included in the financial statements from 1 January 2002 and its assets and liabilities are included at the amounts at which they were previously recorded, after adjusting to the Groups accounting policies.
The comparatives for the Group balance sheet, profit and loss account and statement of cash ows have been restated to take account of the merger despite the fact that the holding company was incorporated on 31 December 2001 and the merger was not completed until March 2002 in order to compare meaningfully the performance of the underlying Group.
As per the acquisition agreement, the cash ow from the coal business is to the benefit of Xstrata as from 1 January 2002.
However, under UK GAAP FRS 2, the results of operations of an acquired business may be reected in the income statement only from the date on which control is transferred.
As control over the coal business was transferred during March, the results of operations of the coal business are reected in the Group statutory income statement from 1 March 2002.
The attributable profit from operations of the coal business from 1 January 2002 to 28 February 2002 was accounted as an adjustment to the consideration paid for the coal business in the statutory financial statements.
The Groups 20.9% interest in the Richards Bay Coal Terminal has been recorded in accordance with FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures as a Joint Arrangement not creating an Entity, on the basis that it is an extension of Xstrata Coals own business, providing coal shipping and export services to the participants.
As such, Xstrata Coals share of Richards Bay Coal Terminals assets and liabilities is included in the consolidated balance sheet and the excess of the fair value is included in intangible assets.
The intangible asset is carried at cost subject to an annual impairment test and is not amortised, as management regard it as having an indefinite useful economic life.
The Coal turnover increased US$74.7 million or 7% primarily due to increased production capacity in Australia from acquisitions and expansions.
However, a comparison between the periods is impacted by two factors which affect the 2001 pro forma gure in coal.
Coal South Africas ATC and ATCOM operations were accounted for as joint ventures and Douglas Tavistock was accounted for as an associate for 11 months in 2001.
Had these entities been reported as joint arrangements not creating an entity JANES in 2001, as they are in 2002, reported turnover for 2001 would have been higher by US$138.2 million.
In addition, comparison between the two years is affected by the unusually large revenue generated in 2001 from third party purchased coal US$153.6 million in 2001 compared to US$98.8 million in this year.
If the turnover numbers for Coal are amended to remove the impact of both these factors, then the US$1,120.5 million coal turnover from own production for 2002 is in line with the adjusted US$1,129.2 million turnover for the corresponding period in 2001.
Increased sales volume of coal in 2002 compared to 2001 has been offset by lower realised coal prices.
Despite a decline in ferrochrome average prices, Alloys turnover increased US$45.4 million, or 14%, due to a 25% increase in ferrochrome sales volume from the abnormally low sales in 2001 and to 20% higher ferrovanadium sales volumes, following the commissioning of the Rhovan production facility.
Zinc turnover increased by US$16.7 million or 4%, despite a 12% decline in the LME zinc price, due to the expansion at the San Juan fide Nieva smelter, which increased production by 69,223 tonnes to over 460,000 tonnes in 2002.
Other turnover decreased by US$20.4 million due to the disposal of the forestry trading business in 2001.
EBITDA decreased US$95.8 million or 17% to US$481.7 million.
Coal decreased by US$69.3 million or 17% due to the reduced thermal export coal prices, particularly in the second half of the year, offset in part by the increased sales volumes and reduced US Dollar unit operating costs of 2% in Australia and 9% in South Africa.
Alloys maintained EBITDA at US$73 million despite the reduced ferrochrome and ferrovanadium prices through increased sales volumes and lower US Dollar operating costs of 9% for ferrochrome.
Zinc decreased US$13.1 million or 13% due to the decline in LME zinc prices, partially mitigated by increased sales volumes and a combination of cost efficiency programmes, productivity improvements and expansion projects.
EBIT before exceptional items decreased US$109.9 million or 26% to US$314.9 million.
Coals depreciation and amortisation, both of which are linked to rates of production, rose on the back of higher production levels and a stronger Australian Dollar.

The volume variance relates in the main to increased production in zinc from the 120,000 tonne annual capacity expansion of the San Juan fide Nieva zinc smelter, commissioned in July 2001, the 25% improvement in sales volumes of ferrochrome and increased production from the Australian coal business unit.
As set out in the Chief Executives report, cost efficiency programmes and productivity improvements across the operations reduced costs in real terms by US$79.1 million, equivalent to 4.7% of the operating cost base.
Ination increased costs by US$58.1 million, US$53.1 million of which reected the impact of the 14% increase in South Africas 2002 producer price index.
The major constituent in the positive exchange rate variance was the South African Rand, which weakened 22% against the US Dollar from an average rate of ZAR8.6 in 2001 to ZAR10.5 in 2002, whereas the Australian Dollar and Euro both strengthened by 5%.
The significant strengthening of the South African Rand during the last quarter of 2002 resulted in a negative translation impact on Alloys EBIT of US$21.3 million, due to foreign exchange losses arising from US Dollar denominated trade debtors.
The positive impact of the weakening currencies on operating costs, stripped of this translation impact, was therefore US$51.8 million.
Other variances of US$17.9 million include an increase in costs at the corporate centre of US$11.8 million, mainly relating to a new London office associated with the listing on the London Stock Exchange, implementation of the Combined Code and new business development activities.
The balance of US$6.1 million mainly relates to a one-off increase in costs in the zinc business associated with a breakdown in a tank house transformer and lower production of acid and germanium.

An impairment of US$45.5 million had previously been recorded for the Windimurra operation in 2001.
There is no tax effect in relation to these impairment provisions.
Net interest and similar items decreased from US$60.8 million to US$39.7 million primarily due to lower debt levels compared to the 2001 pro forma gures.
This is mainly due to the successful outcome of the London IPO in March 2002 where an additional 25 million shares were issued as a result of the exercise of the Managers Option.
On a pro forma basis, the EBITDA net interest cover improved from a multiple of 9.5x in 2001 to 12.1x in 2002, and the pre-exceptional items EBIT net interest cover improved from a multiple of 7.0x to 7.9x.
The tax charge at US$42.6 million represents an effective tax rate, pre-exceptionals, of 15.5% against 20.8% for the corresponding period in 2001.
The 2002 tax charge includes a US$27.3 million net benefit arising from the new Australian scal consolidation regime which came into effect in late 2002.
Minority interest share of profits decreased following reductions in the minority shareholdings in zinc and lower earnings from the Oakbridge Group Xstrata Coal Australia in 2002.
Attributable profit pre-exceptional items decreased US$47.4 million or 17% to US$225.4 million.
Basic pre-exceptional attributable earnings per share decreased from US$1.08 to US$0.90.
The Groups return on capital employed, based on average exchange rates for the period, was 8.4%, reecting the lower earnings for the year.
18 Xstrata plc Dividends The Directors have declared a dividend of 20 US cents per share, which will be presented for shareholder approval at the AGM on 8 May 2003.
The key dates are set out in the table below.

The foreign exchange adjustment is due to the impact of strengthening local currencies against the US Dollar on local currency denominated loans and finance leases.
Cash ow before capital expenditure was US$453.2 million, 18% lower than the estimate of US$555.1 million in Part VI of the IPO Listing Particulars.
This variance is principally due to reduced coal prices partially offset by operating cost savings, lower cost of borrowing and lower taxation.
Net capital expenditure, including the acquisition of Ravensworth and Narama coal operations in Australia, was US$230.8 million, some US$30.8 million lower than the estimate of US$261.6 million in the Listing Particulars.
The cash component of the coal acquisition excluding transaction costs is US$1,121 million.
This includes US$20 million prepaid to the vendors by the Duiker Group in January 2002.
The cost of the acquisition as set out in the Listing Particulars of US$1,351 million excluded the impact of Glencore International AGs share of the Managers Option US$124 million but included transaction expenses of US$113 million, resulting in a net US$1,114 million.
The remaining difference of US$7 million is due to reallocation of acquisition costs.

Net debt at 31 December 2002 was US$573.9 million, with US$804 million undrawn within the facility.
Arrangement fees of US$27 million, relating mainly to the US$1.4 billion loan facility, are capitalised and classied within external borrowings as required by UK GAAP.
Free cash ow for 2002 represents 63% of net debt at 31 December 2002.
The Gross debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA ratio under the Groups loan facility continues to be below 1.5 times resulting in a reduced drawn margin and commitment fee payable under this facility to the lowest applicable rate.
The increase in the South African Rand denominated debt from 2001 relates to the coal acquisition in March 2002 and the strengthening of the South African Rand against the US Dollar at year end.
As a result of the success of the IPO, robust operating cash ows and a strengthened balance sheet, the net debt to equity percentage improved from 84.7% on a statutory basis at 31 December 2001 to 16.1% at 31 December 2002.

Asturiana fide Zinc SA was acquired in May 2001.
In January 2003, Coal Australia purchased a further 11.5% in Oakbridge Pty Ltd from Tomen Corporation for US$58 million to take its shareholding to 78%.
Equity Capital Management Programme The Xstrata Group has put in place an equity capital management programme ECMP.
Under the ECMP up to 10% of the issued share capital of Xstrata plc can be purchased in the market by Batiss Investments Batiss, a Guernsey registered entity owned by a charitable trust, which is independent of the Xstrata Group.
Purchasing Activity Under the proposed structure, Batiss will enter into an option agreement with Xstrata Capital Corporation A. V. V. Xstrata Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary within the Xstrata Group, whereby Batiss grants to Xstrata Capital a right to require Batiss to sell the Xstrata shares purchased to a third party other than a subsidiary of Xstrata plc, as nominated by Xstrata Capital, at an exercise price of 1p per share.
Under the option agreement, Xstrata Capital will pay Batiss a premium for this right, the premium being the equivalent of the market price paid by Batiss for the shares plus associated costs less the 1p exercise price.
This premium payment, together with funds from a subscription by Xstrata Capital for non-voting redeemable preference shares in Batiss, will provide the funding for Batiss to acquire the shares in the market.
These payments will be sourced from the existing and future cash resources of Xstrata Capital.
Xstrata Capital will be able to exercise its right under the option agreement for a period of six years from the date of each purchase.
Batiss will waive its right to receive dividends on the shares which it holds.
