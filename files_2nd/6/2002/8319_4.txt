The principal drivers include strong operating profit performance, an increase in dividend receipts from joint ventures and associates and the resumption of dividends from KAPCO.
Capital expenditure on projects designed to maintain the operating capacity of our power stations was in line with the expenditure incurred in the previous year, reflecting the recurring and on-going nature of this expenditure.
Capital expenditure to increase our operating capacity amounted to 98 million as compared to 358 million for the year ended 31 December 2001.
This programmed reduction in our capital expenditure reflects the progressive completion of our new build capacity in Massachusetts and Texas.
Net interest of 88 million 2001: 105 million was paid in the year reflecting a small reduction in average debt levels over the course of the year, together with a slightly lower average cost of debt.
