As outlined in the Chairmans Statement and the Chief Executives Review, on 20 March 2002 the Company made a 75 million cash investment in a new company, The Unique Pub Company Limited Unique, formed to acquire the Unique Pub Company and the Voyager Pub Group.
This investment equates to 16.8% of the equity in Unique, and Enterprises share of Uniques loss from 20 March to 30 September 2002 has been separately identified in the Group Profit and Loss Account.

8 ENTERPRISE INNS ANNUAL REPORT 2002 FINANCE DIRECTORS REPORT This long-term debt facility complements previous debenture and secured bond issues made between 1999 and 2001.
As a result of these arrangements a total of 585 million of long-term debt facilities are in place at a weighted average interest cost of 6.55% per annum.
It is likely that the Company will issue further secured bonds in 2003.
The acquisition of 1,860 pubs from Laurel Pub Holdings in May for a consideration of 881 million was financed by means of additional syndicated debt facilities and the proceeds of a rights issue.
Syndicated debt facilities of 1,280 million were arranged in May, which included a 280 million bridge facility which has since been repaid by the proceeds of the rights issue.
At the year end, 55 million of the revolving facility was undrawn and available for drawdown.
The rights issue of three new shares for every four existing shares was made at 4.12 per share and represented a discount of 49% to the closing middle market price of 8.14 per share on 11 April 2002, the day prior to the announcement.
The rights issue raised 292 million, net of fees and expenses.
The net assets of the Group at year end were 693.5 million, which compares with 323.1 million as at 30 September 2001.
Interest Excluding the contribution in the year from Unique, net interest payable was 75.1 million, which was covered 2.5 times.
Under the terms of the acquisition of 1,860 pubs through the purchase of Laurel Pub Holdings, 800 million of interest rate swap contracts swaps were novated to a subsidiary of Enterprise.
On 1 September 2002, 250 million of these swaps were terminated and Enterprise assumed a 10 year swap for the balance of the contracts with a notional amount of 550 million at an interest rate payable of 5.75% until 30 November 2004, and at a rate of 6.66% thereafter, until termination on 1 June 2012.
This swap, along with interest rates fixed through the issue of debentures and secured bonds referred to above, results in 74% of the Groups debt at year end being fixed at a blended rate of less than 7% for a weighted average life of 17 years.
The Board reviews levels of interest rate hedging on a regular basis.
Cash Flow Net cash inflow from operating activities of 193.1 million represents an increase of 92% on prior year.
Free cash inflow increased from 24.9 million to 60.9 million: Year ended 30 September 2002 2001 m m Operating cash inflow 193.1 100.5 Interest 84.4 37.6 Tax 8.3 6.0 Capital expenditure 27.1 22.8 Dividends 12.4 9.2 Free cash flow 60.9 24.9 9 ENTERPRISE INNS ANNUAL REPORT 2002 FINANCE DIRECTORS REPORT Tax Charge The tax charge of 28.9 million, prior to the inclusion of Unique, includes a charge for deferred tax of 5.9 million.
The underlying corporation tax charge of 23.0 million represents an effective corporation tax rate of 24%.
Dividend Payment The Directors are recommending the payment of a final dividend of 9.4 pence per share, to be paid on 24th January 2003.
This will result in a full year dividend of 14.1 pence per share, an increase of 14.6% on prior year.
The dividend is covered 3.1 times, and 4.2 times before exceptional items.
The final dividend payment of 9.4 pence per share represents a 42% increase on the prior year payment of 8.2 pence per share when restated at 6.6 pence per share to take account of the bonus element of the rights issue.
Financial Reporting Standards FRS From the start of the financial year the Group has adopted FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
This standard requires full provision to be made for deferred tax arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation.
Where appropriate, comparative figures for 2001 have been restated to reflect the impact of FRS 19.
