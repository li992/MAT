Set out in Table 2 are the principal exchange rates used to translate the Groups overseas profits and net assets.
Treasury Role of group treasury The Groups treasury function is managed centrally to support the operating activities of the Group.
Its primary role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise and that financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identied and managed.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments nor does it enter into any leveraged derivative transactions.
Management of foreign exchange risk The Group manages its currency ows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate to hedge net currency ows.
In order to reduce the currency risk arising on its net investments the Group uses direct borrowings in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are currently drawn down in the principal currencies affecting the Group, namely US dollar, sterling and euro.
Management of interest rate risk The Groups borrowings of 124.7 million at 31 December 2002 were principally drawn under bank facilities at oating rates.
In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group uses interest rate swaps where appropriate to vary the mix of xed and oating rates.
At 31 December 2002 debt of 63.2 million, after interest rate hedging activity, was at xed rates of interest.
This results in a xed to oating rate net debt ratio of 54:46.
Management of funding and liquidity risk The Group maintains sufficient facilities to meet its normal funding requirements over the medium term.
These facilities are primarily in the form of bank borrowings arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of international banks.
The Group does not consider that the financial covenants contained in the facilities are restrictive to its operations.

The Group manages this risk by limiting the aggregate amount and duration based on the credit rating of the relevant counterparty.
Financial Indicators The financial indicators, which when taken together are a measure of performance and the efficiency of the finance and risk management structures in place, are shown in Table 3.
Taxation The Groups taxation charge of 20.1 million comprises taxation payable on the Groups profit on ordinary activities.
The Groups effective taxation rate for 2002 was 36.5% 2001 37.0% reecting the geographic mix of profit generation.
The Group has adopted FRS19 in these Accounts.
Previously provision for deferred tax was only required to the extent that it was probable that a liability would crystallise in the foreseeable future, whereas FRS19 requires full provision for deferred tax.
Accordingly, the net assets of the Group have been adjusted as at 31 December 2001.
There has been no effect on prior period or current period results and the Groups cash position is not affected by the deferred tax element.
Pensions The UK dened benefit pension scheme was closed to new employees joining the Group after 1 April 2002.
A Group Personal Pension Plan is now being offered to UK employees joining the Group.
