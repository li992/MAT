Financial review Integration progress and cost savings The integration process continues to progress according to the detailed plan that was in place prior to the completion of the merger.
We have established a demanding pace and the two cultures are gelling together well with a strong sense of common purpose and approach.
Customer reaction has been very positive and we already have projects underway combining the skills and experience of individuals from both companies.
A significant number of crossselling opportunities have been identified and are being pursued across the enhanced customer base.
Our budgeting process for the combined company has enabled us to more accurately assess the potential merger cost savings and their timing.
Our current expectation is to achieve savings of 80 million on an annualised basis, with approximately 40 million coming through in 2003, mainly impacting the second half.
This objective is clearly appropriate given continued weak demand in the market.
Our revised view of the total cost of achieving these savings is 100 million, of which 80 million is in respect of an expected total headcount reduction of 2,200, representing some 9.5% of the total workforce.

Seamus Keating Group finance director Funding of pension schemes The group has three significant pension schemes based on defined benefits, one originating from CMG UK: one from CMG Netherlands: and a smaller scheme from Logica Netherlands.
All have been closed to new members but have ongoing commitments to their existing members.
A full triennial actuarial valuation of the ex-CMG UK scheme is being undertaken to determine the appropriate funding rate for the next three years.
On completion of this exercise, a detailed SSAP 24 review will be performed to finalise the accounting impact of the new valuation.
Initial indications from the actuary suggest that the funding rates will increase but that no one-off injection will be required.
