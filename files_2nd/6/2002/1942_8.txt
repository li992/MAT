Treasury Policy and Liquidity Risk The Groups treasury policy has as its principal objective the maintenance of flexible bank facilities in order to cover anticipated borrowing requirements.
A sophisticated cash forecasting system enables the Group to plan and assess its future treasury needs.
Short term cash surpluses are placed on deposit.
Other than mentioned above, there are no financial instruments, derivatives or commodity contracts used.
Interest Rate Risk The Groups attitude to interest rate risk is influenced by the existing and forecast conditions prevailing at the time that each new interest-bearing instrument is entered into.
This will determine, amongst other things, the term and whether a fixed or floating interest rate is obtained.
The Group is able to make arrangements to convert floating rates to fixed.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group has a foreign currency risk arising from the annual retranslation of the investment in its Australian subsidiary.
The maximum potential exposure arising from this is insignificant.
Fair Value The fair values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 July 2002 are disclosed in note 21.
This states that the fair values are not materially different to their book values except that, for the 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares and the long term fixed rate bank loan, the fair value exceeds book value by 4.9 million and 395,000 respectively.
This reflects the movement in long term interest rates since these financial instruments were entered into.
