Earnings per share before exceptional items of 19.9p was 21% ahead of last year, and 65% ahead after exceptional items.
This improvement reflects strong growth in Gaming and Deluxe, lower interest charges and a substantially reduced tax charge.
Group turnover was up 7% after including a 61.7m benefit from acquisitions, in particular the Ritek transaction within Deluxe Media Services.
Turnover from existing operations was up 3%, reecting strong growth in Gaming and Deluxe Film, offset by a weaker performance by Hard Rock and adverse currency movements.
The effect of the movement in exchange rates between 2001 and 2002 was to reduce turnover by 37.8m.
Group operating profit before exceptional items was up 5%.
Gaming had another excellent year with profit 13% ahead of 2001, before accounting for a 5.0m loss at Rank Interactive Gaming.
This result reects both strong turnover growth and further improvement in operating margins in both Mecca Bingo and Grosvenor Casinos.
Deluxe Film profit was up 16% due to an exceptional release schedule and a first full year of contribution from the new laboratory in Rome.
Deluxe Media Services profit was up 31%, helped by a first time contribution of 4.3m from the venture with Ritek and an improved result from distribution, which more than compensated for the decline in VHS volumes and margins.
As expected, Hard Rock experienced a difficult year in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001.
Operating profit was down to 27.6m from 38.0m in 2001 with low levels of travel and tourism having a direct impact on the cafe estate, particularly on merchandise sales.
Net interest payable before exceptional items was 1.7m lower than last year at 22.6m, despite higher average debt levels.
This reflects a substantial reduction in the average rate of interest.
Net debt at the year end was 399.1m compared to 248.1m in 2001.
The following table sets out the divisional results and profit before tax after exceptional items.

The divisions momentum for revenue growth was maintained during the year and, accompanied by a keen focus on cost control, resulted in increased operating margins at each of Mecca Bingo, Grosvenor Casinos and Rank Leisure Machine Services.
Mecca Bingo 2002 2001 Change In the UK, Mecca Bingo continued the well-established trend of growth in both turnover and profit margins.
During the year, UK Bingo statistics turnover increased by 3% and operating profit by 7%.
The number Admissions 000s 22,678 23,879 -5.0% of registered members increased by 4% to nearly 1.1m and although Spend per head 10.22 9.45 8.0% admissions fell by 5%, this was more than compensated for by an 8% increase in spend per head, continuing the pattern experienced over the last few years.
Mecca has been successful in attracting younger, higher yielding customers, with 45% of the membership now aged below 44.
These players tend to visit less frequently but spend more per visit, especially on interval games, such as cashline bingo, and on machines, both of which attract high margins.
The split of revenue by activity is shown below.

At the year end, 210 jackpot machines had been installed with plans for a total of 350 by the middle of 2003.
Meccas operating profit margin increased by a further 1% to 31% in 2002 despite an additional 3.5m in promotional costs, reflecting the growth in interval games and machines and underlining the strength of cost controls within the business.
In Spain, Meccas bingo operations produced a strong year-on-year performance reflecting the inclusion for the first time of the three additional clubs which were acquired during the first half for net cash consideration of 15.0m, of which 9.2m was paid in 2002.
The clubs contributed 1.5m of operating profit in the year and have benefited from the introduction of Meccas UK expertise.

Turnover was up 16% and operating profit increased 28%.
This was despite a reduction in win percentage that for the estate as a whole fell from 17.8% in 2001 to 17.2% in 2002.
In London, the Groups two upper end casinos the Clermont and the Park Tower increased revenue by 23%, due largely to a much higher win percentage, and doubled operating profit to 6.0m.
The Park Tower is currently undergoing a major refurbishment that will extend its gaming space by 40%.
At the other London casinos the Victoria, Gloucester and Connoisseur while admissions were up 3%, handle per head up 15% and turnover up 7%, operating profit was flat, partly reflecting increased costs associated with the introduction of later opening.
The provincial casinos delivered another impressive result in 2002.
Admissions were up 6%, handle per head increased by 18% and turnover was up by 19%, despite a lower win percentage of 16.6%.
Operating profits increased by 38% to 22.7m.
The Brighton casino was relocated successfully and opened in August 2002.
The two new Hard Rock casinos opened during the second half of 2002 and incurred an operating loss of 2.1m, including pre-opening costs of 1.4m.
The first Hard Rock Casino opened in central Manchester in July, followed by the second casino which opened in November, just off Leicester Square in the West End of London.
Both casinos have enjoyed a strong start with impressive growth in both membership, now over 15,000 each, and also admissions, which for both casinos combined has reached over 6,000 per week.
The continued roll-out of electronic roulette is proving particularly successful and there are now a total of 420 machines across the Grosvenor estate.
Progressive Stud Poker, which links across Grosvenor casinos and was the first of its type in the UK, was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2002 and has proved popular to date.
Rank Leisure Machine Services Operating profit at Rank Leisure Machine Services increased during the year to 3.1m 2001 2.3m.
Rank Interactive Gaming Rank Interactive Gaming, comprising rank.
com, continued to build its customer base in 2002.
As at December 2002, the business had over 75,000 registered customers and total stakes were running at an annualised rate of approximately 90m.
The investment in building market share together with start-up costs associated with hardrockcasino.
com, which was launched in July 2002, resulted in an operating loss of 5.0m for the year.
On 27 January 2003, the Group completed the acquisition of Blue Square Limited, one of the UKs leading internet and telephone betting businesses.
The integration of Blue Square and Rank Interactive Gaming will create a substantial business with annualised stakes currently running at approximately 400m.
Annualised cost savings of approximately 5m per annum have already been identied as well as a number of opportunities to cross-sell a variety of the games and betting products now available.

The impact was particularly severe at some of the company-owned cafes where reduced levels of tourism contributed to a substantial reduction in higher margin merchandise sales.
In addition, pre-opening expenses were 1.9m higher than last year, reflecting the opening of a further six cafes Munich, Austin, Pittsburgh, Nottingham, Minneapolis and Leeds.
During 2003, new cafes will open in Lisbon, Cologne and Cardiff.
Like for like sales for the year as a whole were down 2.4% with food and beverage sales up 2.1%, a creditable result in the circumstances.
Hard Rock like for like sales 2002 First 8 weeks half Q3 Q4 Total to 21.2.
Total sales were up 5.2% with food and beverage up 8.1%.
Since the year end, after a good performance in January 2003, up 5.1%, like for like sales during February were impacted by terrorist alerts in both the UK and the US, and by severe weather conditions in the northern states of the US.
Overall, for the eight weeks to 21 February 2003 like for like sales were down 0.5%.
Hotel franchise and other income contributed 3.8m in 2002, including a dividend of 1.4m from the Groups 25% interest in the partnership which owns three hotels in Orlando, including the Hard Rock Hotel.
The development of new revenue streams from licensing the Hard Rock brand to other leisure-related activities has made good progress.
Following the completion of its financing arrangements in May 2002, the Seminole Indian Nation development in Florida, comprising two new hotel and casino resorts, is now in-build and expected to open, at least partially, by the year end.
An arrangement with the Choctaw Indians for a beach club in Mississippi is now in place and is expected to open later this year.
In the longer term there is also a plan for a Hard Rock Hotel development on the same site.
The new Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is scheduled to open at the end of 2003.
These transactions demonstrate the value of the brand and we will continue to search for other attractive opportunities.
Despite the receipt of a one-off site fee of 1.0m relating to the Choctaw development, territory fees fell by 1.9m during the year.
26 The Rank Group Plc Film processing Film processing had an exceptional year in 2002.
A number of major blockbuster films were processed including Spider-Man, Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones, Lord of the Rings The Two Towers, and James Bond Die Another Day, contributing to a record year for the business.
Film footage was up 16%, turnover 8% and operating profit 16%, helped by a full years contribution from the Rome laboratory and the relocation of the Toronto laboratory which became fully operational in April 2002.
The programme for 2003 looks strong and includes Daredevil and Lord of the Rings The Return of the King.
During 2002 Deluxe Film expanded its geographic coverage with the purchase of a new laboratory in Barcelona, acquired for 5.5m in November 2002, and in Australia through a technical and marketing joint venture with Atlab, the largest lm processing business in Australasia.
These developments have further enhanced the position of the film business in Europe and also provided an entry point into the attractive Asian market.
Deluxe also extended its range of services to studios through the acquisition of Capital FX and a 20% shareholding in EFILM.
Capital FX was acquired in November 2002 for 9.0m of which 6.0m is deferred and is a leading player in the UK laser sub-titling and digital effects market.
The 20% interest in EFILM, which is engaged in the digital production of film elements necessary for bulk film processing, was acquired in July 2002.
The results of Atlab and EFILM are recorded within Deluxe associates and joint ventures.
On 31 December 2002, the Group acquired the remaining 50% equity of ETS that it did not already own.
ETS is a distributor of release prints and trailers based in Los Angeles.
The total consideration payable is up to 14.2m, of which 7.4m was paid in January 2003 and 6.8m is deferred until later years.
Of the deferred consideration, up to 1.6m is contingent upon the future performance of ETS.
This brings the total investment in ETS to 17.5m for 100% ownership.
The decision during the first half to renew the majority of Deluxes major lm contracts has lengthened the average life of existing contracts such that some 71% of 2002 actual volumes are now secure until 2005 and 63% until 2006.
As stated at the time of the interim results, the loss of the contract with Universal Studios will have an adverse impact on Films profits in the current year.
However, we expect that underlying growth in film footage, the effect of new acquisitions and a continuing drive to reduce costs, will mitigate the impact of the contract loss on the results for 2003.
After a number of years of declining turnover and profit, Deluxe Media Services recorded a 31% growth in operating profit in 2002.
The Group has made excellent progress in repositioning this business for the future, in particular through the formation of a new DVD replication venture with Ritek Corporation of Taiwan.
This venture combines the DVD assets of Deluxe and Ritek in North America and Europe and creates a major force in the DVD market.
Deluxe will pay a total of 33.8m to Ritek, spread over three years, for an 80% interest in the new venture which contributed 4.3m to Deluxe operating profit in 2002.
The move into DVD, together with the continuing importance of distribution services and the entry into digital services, means that, over time, Deluxe will become much less dependent upon the declining video duplication market.
The worldwide replication market for DVD was estimated at approximately 1.74bn units at the end of 2002, an increase of over 60% compared with the previous year.
The timing of the Ritek transaction meant that Deluxe was able to benefit from the inclusion of its share of the profits during the busiest time of the year in the run up to Christmas.
Deluxe replicated 69m DVDs in 2002 2001 6m, including Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and Spider-Man.
DVD revenues increased to 55.7m and the combined business produced an operating profit of 2.3m.
The market for VHS continues to be difficult as consumers switch to using DVD as their primary home entertainment platform.
Total volumes were down by 10% while revenues were down by 16%, reecting the continued price erosion being suffered as demand declines.
During 2002, Deluxe duplicated approximately 224m VHS cassettes 2001 250m.
While this performance was better than the market as a whole, it was not sufficient to prevent a fall in operating margin to 10.1% 2001 11.1%.
The steady decline in VHS is expected to continue during 2003 and whilst we expect DVD volumes to grow strongly, the relative margins are such that overall profit for Deluxe Media Services is expected to decline in 2003.
With a capability to distribute both DVD and VHS, Deluxe has seen substantial volume growth within its distribution services business with the number of DVDs distributed having increased by 90% to 171m 2001 90m.
While the volume of VHS distributed declined by 20% to 272m, both revenue and profit from distribution activities increased substantially.
The Rank Group Plc 27 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Digital services was formed in February 2002 following the acquisition of Vision Entertainment and the establishment of Deluxe Media Asset Management.
Having invested in some of the most sophisticated technologies in the industry, as well as the development of bespoke software, the business has already secured a number of sizeable contracts to manage both physical as well as digital studio assets which are being securely delivered to entertainment industry customers around the world.
Deluxe associates and joint ventures These comprise the Groups interests in EFILM, Atlab, The Lab, a front-end laboratory based in Toronto, and ETS which became a 100% subsidiary on 31 December 2002.
US Holidays The US Holidays business suffered from the reduced level of tourism but still managed a satisfactory result in the circumstances with operating profit of 8.1m 2001 9.5m.

During 2002, the Group made a number of acquisitions.
A summary of their respective cost and contribution to the Groups operating profit in 2002 is set out below: Consideration 2002 Operating Date 2002 Deferred profit acquired m m m Gaming Spanish bingo clubs Q2 9.2 5.8 1.5 Deluxe Film Capital FX November 3.0 6.0 0.2 Image December 5.1 0.4 0.1 Deluxe Media Services Ritek Corporation 80% July 14.2 19.6 4.3 Other 3.8 0.1 35.3 31.8 6.0 before minority interests.
On 31 December 2002, the Group agreed to acquire the remaining 50% of ETS that it did not already own.
The total consideration was 14.2m of which 7.4m was paid in January 2003.
On 27 January 2003, the Group completed its acquisition of Blue Square for a total consideration of 65m in unlisted, unsecured convertible loan stock.
The loan stock, which is redeemable from the end of July 2003, is convertible into Rank ordinary shares at a price of 282p per 1 of loan stock held.
Full conversion of the loan stock would result in the issue of 23m new Rank ordinary shares.
30 The Rank Group Plc Disposals Disposals during the year comprise payments and receipts in connection with the disposals of the UK Holidays division in 2000 and the Butlins Hotels in 1999 as well as the disposal of properties on ending the British Land joint venture and sale and leaseback transactions.
Net debt Net debt at 31 December 2002 was 399.1m compared with 248.1m at 31 December 2001.
Net debt as a percentage of shareholders funds was 53% compared to 34% at 31 December 2001 as restated for the effect of FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Pensions An actuarial valuation of the Groups dened benefit scheme for UK employees was conducted at 5 April 2001.
At the valuation date the market value of the assets of 589.9m exceeded the market value of the liabilities by 9%, giving a surplus of 49.2m.
At 31 December 2002, the deficit on the pension fund would be 90.9m calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benets 2001 surplus 36.9m.
Borrowings The Companys articles of association provide that borrowings shall not exceed one and a half times the adjusted share capital and consolidated reserves of Rank.
As at 31 December 2002, this limit was 1,044.5m compared with relevant borrowings of 463.1m.
Treasury policy Rank seeks to achieve certainty of value on its foreign currency purchases and sales by buying or selling forward a portion of its estimated net currency requirements up to a year ahead, or longer where an external currency exposure exists, or is forecast to exist.
At 31 December 2002, at least 80% of anticipated core currency transaction exposures for the following 12 months had been hedged.
Balance sheet currency exposure in respect of investments in overseas subsidiaries is minimised by hedging the underlying asset position with currency borrowings or through the use of currency swaps.
Rank seeks to protect itself against material adverse movements in interest rates by undertaking controlled management of the interest rate structure on Group investments and borrowings.
This exposure is managed by fixing interest rates on a portion of the Groups borrowings dependent on the level of gearing.
The directors review and agree the broad policies and guidelines for all significant areas of treasury activity, including key ratios, funding and risk management.
Implementation of these policies is carried out by the Group treasury department, under close management direction.
The treasury function is not operated as a profit centre.
Rank uses off-balance sheet financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps, in its management of exchange rate and interest rate exposures.
Off-balance sheet financial instruments are only used to hedge underlying commercial exposures.
Therefore, while these instruments are subject to the risk of loss from changes in exchange rates and interest rates, such losses would be offset by gains in the related exposures.
Rank does not speculate in derivative financial instruments.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts that hedge firm third party commitments are recognised in income in the same period as the underlying transaction.
Net interest paid or received on interest rate swap contracts is included in net interest expense.
Further information on borrowings and financial instruments is contained in notes 18 and 19 to the accounts.
Shareholders funds Shareholders funds were 748.6m at the end of 2002 compared with 728.7m as restated at the end of 2001.
