OPERATING AND ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FINANCIAL REVIEW The accounts reflect the adoption of two new accounting requirements in the year and these have resulted in the restatement of prior year profit and loss accounts and balance sheets.
Firstly, the group adopted UITF Abstract 34 Pre-contract costs.
As a result of applying the new requirements, cumulative costs of 3.1 million net of tax that had been incurred in the pre-preferred bidder stage and subsequently reinstated over the five years ended 31 December 2001, have been written-off in the period in which they arose.
The income received has and will be credited to the profit and loss account in line with the period of the relevant construction, development or concession contract to which it relates.
Secondly, the group adopted FRS 19 Deferred tax, which has resulted in a requirement for a deferred tax provision of 17.7 million as at 31 December 2001.
This principally relates to timing differences in the treatment of pension costs for taxation and accounting purposes and has increased the tax charge in both 2002 and 2001.
A year ago, AMEC indicated that it expected to fully implement the new accounting standard for retirement benefits, FRS 17, in its 2003 accounts.
As a result of the Accounting Standards Board announcing a delay in the full implementation of the standard, so as to achieve an orderly transfer to the international accounting standard in 2005, AMEC, in line with a number of other companies, decided to continue accounting for pension costs in line with its existing policy, which conforms with the requirements of SSAP 24.
TRADING ANNOUNCEMENTS On 5 December 2002, AMEC issued a trading update referring to the following significant matters: A reduction of 15 million in the boards expectations for pre-tax profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, for the year ended 31 December 2002: A maximum adjustment of 30 million to the carrying value of goodwill relating to the disposal or closure of a number of non-core or under-performing businesses in North America: and A reduction in the boards overall expectations for the year ending 31 December 2003.
Stuart Siddall Finance Director AMECs circular to shareholders on 17 January 2003 outlined the proposal to acquire the outstanding 54 per cent interest in SPIE S. A.
Within that document was a further trading update which reaffirmed the information given on 5 December 2002 and additionally, confirmed that net debt as at 31 December 2002 would be below 75 million and that the weekly average net debt had fallen from 210 million in 2001 to 195 million in 2002.
Comments in the following review are made with reference to these updates.
PRE-TAX PROFIT AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE BOTH IN LINE WITH THE COMPANYS DECEMBER STATEMENT.
AMEC IS IN SOUND FINANCIAL SHAPE.
30 AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 TOTAL TURNOVER AND GROSS MARGIN Total turnover was broadly in line with that reported in 2001.
Growth in Client Support Services was more than offset by the largely anticipated decline in Capital Projects activities, FINANCIAL SUMMARY where certain industrial clients either reduced, delayed or cancelled their capital expenditure 2002 2001 programmes.
In addition, the reduction also reflected the further strategic repositioning of the million million US Construction Management business.
Total turnover 4,331.6 4,467.5 Pre-tax profit 105.2 116.7 The gross profit margin before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, was 10.1 per cent 2001 10.4 per cent.
This reflected, in part, the under recovery of direct overheads Included above: arising from reductions in industrial activities and also costs of approximately 6.0 million E-commerce costs 1.9 4.9 associated with AMECs ongoing dispute with the General Services Administration in the US.
Corporate costs 20.4 19.3 22.3 24.2 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Administrative expenses before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, were 7.4 per Pre-tax profit was in line with the companys cent of group turnover 2001 7.6 per cent.
The level of costs reflects some of the benefits December statement.
of the UK and North American restructuring undertaken in 2002 and also businesses with Pre-tax profit stated above is before goodwill proportionately higher overheads which have been disposed of or closed in the last two years.
amortisation of 13.1 million, exceptional reorganisation, disposal and closure costs E-commerce costs declined in 2002 as some products were deployed within the businesses of 24.9 million and an exceptional write-off and the development of others ceased.
No further costs will be reported in this category in of goodwill of 28.0 million.
Corporate costs, which represent the costs of operating the head office of AMEC and certain regional overheads, were in line with those incurred in 2001.
Following the acquisition of the outstanding 54 per cent interest in SPIE, and it becoming a wholly owned subsidiary, this cost caption will be expanded in 2003 to include certain regional overheads incurred in continental Europe which are not directly related to the business segments.
It is estimated that these costs will amount to approximately 6.0 million in 2003.
Previously, when gross equity accounting for the SPIE investment, AMECs share of these costs has been contained within the total operating profit included within the Services and Capital Projects segments.
INTEREST Net interest payable was close to the 2001 charge after taking into account the credit to interest in 2001 that arose from the disposal of a PPP subordinated debt investment.
Whilst the level of weekly average net debt was reduced year on year, the interest saving was offset by increased levels of fixed rate borrowing in 2002, following the decision to increase the NET INTEREST PAYABLE percentage of net debt swapped into fixed interest rates.
2002 2001 million million The increase in the share of interest from property development joint ventures reflects Group 12.8 6.7 AMECs more extensive participation in urban regeneration activities.
Share of joint ventures: PPP 6.0 6.0 Property development 1.6 0.8 Despite SPIE having net cash throughout 2002, AMECs share of SPIEs interest charge SPIE 0.6 0.3 reflects the cost of leasing its Paris head office, its debtors securitisation programme and 21.0 13.8 the Eurobond notes, due for repayment in January 2004.
Improvements in the level of weekly average net Interest was covered almost eight times by total operating profit on what AMEC regards as debt and a high level of interest cover demonstrate the most meaningful basis.
This is before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, but financial strength and flexibility.
excluding the contribution from PPP concessions, as compared with net interest payable, excluding the share of interest from PPP concessions.
TAXA TION The tax charge before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items amounted to 32.6 million 2001 37.5 million.
An attributable tax credit of 4.0 million arose on the exceptional items.
The effective rate, which was 31.0 per cent in 2002 2001 32.1 per cent, is expected to remain above 30.0 per cent due to the underlying corporation tax rates in continental Europe being higher than the UK standard rate.
AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 31 OPERATING AND GOODWILL AMORTISATION AND EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS FINANCIAL REVIEW Goodwill amortisation increased in the year to 13.1 million 2001 11.1 million.
The continued increased charge reflects the aggregate adjustments of 25.6 million made in 2001 when determining the final fair value of the net assets acquired through the purchase of AGRA.
AMECs share of SPIEs goodwill amortisation increased as a result of the full year impact of acquisitions made in 2001, notably the Matra Nortel Communications and the Foraid oil and gas businesses.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Exceptional items amounted to 24.9 million and were in line with the boards expectations.
million Reorganisation costs of 8.3 million were incurred in restructuring the UK and North Reorganisation 8.3 American regional businesses.
In SPIE, the international contracting activities were Downsizing SPIEs international contracting 4.6 substantially downsized and AMECs share of the exceptional cost arising from the actions 12.9 taken amounted to 4.6 million.
Further business disposals and closures in 2002 resulted Business disposals closures 12.0 in a net exceptional cost of 12.0 million.
These businesses were predominantly in the 24.9 Construction and e-commerce segments and represented either non-core or under performing activities.
Goodwill of 28.0 million was carried in the balance sheet in respect Associated goodwill 28.0 of the North American businesses that were disposed of or closed and this has been All costs were in line with the companys written-off to the profit and loss account.
Reorganisation plans are complete and the businesses are more focused In view of the disposal or closure of several of the North American businesses and the on their core activities.
resulting loss that arose from the write-off of the attributable goodwill, AMEC, in line with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, undertook an impairment review of the net assets relating to the remaining businesses acquired through the purchase of AGRA Inc.
This was done by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their recoverable amounts represented by their value in use to the group.
The value in use of the income generating units was determined by reference to the groups annual budget prepared in October 2002 as subsequently approved by the board.
The calculation was undertaken using a pre-tax discount rate of 12.5 per cent and assumed no growth in the projections beyond 2004.
The review confirmed that the carrying value of the remaining net assets was reasonably stated.
DIVIDENDS PER ORDINARY SHARE The recommended final dividend is 6.6 pence which, together with the interim dividend of 3.4 pence, results in a total dividend of 10.0 pence per ordinary share, an increase of 5.3 per cent.
DIVIDEND COVER The 2002 total dividend was covered 2.4 times 2001 2.8 times by earnings on a diluted basis and before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
The healthy level of dividend cover has provided the board with the flexibility to increase the recommended dividend in 2002.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Diluted earnings per share for 2001 have been restated following the adoption of FRS 19, but continue to be presented on the basis that the enhanced and mandatory conversion of 98 99 00 01 02 preference shares to ordinary shares took place on 1 January 2001.
Without the pro forma calculation it is difficult to compare earnings in any meaningful way.
Whilst reported cover reduced in 2002, the level 2.90 was 2.9 times with the pro forma inclusion of SPIE Diluted earnings per share were 24.3 pence in 2002 2001 26.5 pence and the reduction at 100 per cent.
year on year principally reflects the change in the reported post-tax profit performance of the group.
2.53 32 AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 2.7 2.5 2.8 2.8 2.9 INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AMECs investments in SPIE, most PPP and several property development projects are accounted for using the gross equity method.
These joint ventures are all stand-alone businesses, where AMEC is in partnership with others, and are independently funded with only limited support from the shareholders.
PPP PORTFOLIO SPIEs net cash as at 31 December 2002 as adjusted for UK GAAP requirements, was Non- 107.4 million 2001 114.0 million.
Two adjustments have been made to SPIEs reported Operational operational concessions concessions net cash.
Firstly, the debtors securitisation programme, where cash advances would be Transport: treated as a loan under UK GAAP.
Secondly, funds held in joint venture contracts where A1 M Peterborough SPIE consolidates all of the cash when it is the project manager and none of the cash when A417 419 it is not, but where proportionate consolidation is required under UK GAAP.
A13 Cross Israel In total, AMECs share of net debt in PPP joint ventures is around 281 million.
Of this Docklands Light Rail A1 M Darrington amount, approximately 200 million relates to the operational concession companies.
In 2002, AMECs share of the operating profit of these concessions was 8.1 million and Infrastructure: Carlisle after taking into account the share of interest, resulted in a net contribution.
UCLH Longbenton In addition, AMEC has an 11 per cent interest in the Cross Israel Highway Concession Ayrshire where the share of its net debt at 31 December 2002 was 58.9 million.
The portfolio was increased to ten projects after achieving financial close on Docklands Light Rail The debt in PPP joint ventures is without recourse to AMEC.
As at 31 December 2002, and A1 M Darrington in February 2003.
AMEC financial support is limited to equity commitments of 24.2 million, contingent equity is bidding for a further five projects principally of 10 million and in the unlikely event that AMECs partners fail, their share of equity in the transport sector, some of which are outside of 27 million.
As a result of reaching financial close on Docklands Light Rail and A1 M of the UK.
Darrington in February 2003, equity commitments have increased by 12.0 million.
AMEC believes that its PPP projects are financially sound.
CASH FLOW AND CURRENT LIQUIDITY After reporting an outflow of 126.2 million from trading activities in the first half of 2002, AMEC generated an inflow of 216.9 million in the second half of the year.
This represented an inflow for the year of 90.7 million.
In both 2002 and 2001 the second half inflow was greatly assisted by good cash collections in December and the high level of payments received in advance.
The level of payments in advance is volatile, as can be seen by the amounts disclosed at the last three external reporting dates: 199.6 million at 31 December 2001: 135.6 million at 30 June 2002: and 165.8 million at 31 December 2002.
The level of payments in advance CASH FLOW is more usually approximately 120 million.
2002 2001 million million The profit retained in joint ventures largely relates to SPIE.
This element will be eliminated Opening net debt 44.6 211.8 following SPIE becoming wholly owned on 5 March 2003.
Cashflow from trading activities 90.7 170.0 Profit retained in joint ventures 14.6 19.9 Acquisitions and disposals 0.8 67.9 Interest, tax and dividends increased in 2002 reflecting the special preference dividend paid Share issues 0.9 2.6 earlier in the year.
Interest, tax and dividends 62.9 56.9 Currency and other adjustments 7.6 3.5 In line with prior years, a significant cash outflow is expected in the first half of 2003 followed Closing net debt 37.3 44.6 by an inflow in the second half of the year.

In addition, drawings are Weekly average net debt fell in 2002 reflecting made to match the underlying business requirements, usually for periods of between one improvements in AMECs management of and focus on cash flow.
Uncommitted and overdraft facilities are used to manage day to day liquidity requirements.
Drawings are usually made in sterling, and swapped into other currencies as required.
At the end of the year, about 250 million was drawn on committed lines.
Over the past seven years, AMECs cumulative cash flow excluding acquisitions, disposals and share transactions is in line with retained profit before taking into account goodwill expensed in the profit and loss account.
AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 33 OPERATING AND SPIE FINANCIAL REVIEW SPIE made a very strong contribution to AMECs results in 2002.
The growth in total turnover continued of 11 per cent mainly arose from the full year impact of the acquisitions referred to above and was tempered by a softening in the industrial market in eastern France.
Total operating profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, increased by 32 per cent, as a result of the following: a strong performance in the Trindel Operations Support Services SPIE FINANCIAL SUMMARY business: a significantly increased contribution from a number of pipeline contracts, where 2002 2001 good progress was made in the year: and an increased contribution from the Enertrans million million power business, which benefited from some reorganisation undertaken in 2001.

Subject to some minor accounting policy differences approximately 1 million on an after tax basis the share of profit included in AMECs accounts was close In 2002, 54 per cent of SPIEs total turnover and 65 per cent of total operating profit was generated to the estimate provided in the circular.
from Operations Support Services activities.
SPIE, along with other major French corporates, has for some time sought to adopt accounting policies that are more in line with those used internationally.
As French GAAP increasingly moves towards more international norms, differences, which have existed between SPIEs reported numbers and those reported by AMEC, are expected to be relatively insignificant.
On 5 March 2003, AMEC acquired the outstanding 54 per cent interest in SPIE.
The purchase consideration in respect of the remaining shares was paid at completion, with payment for most of the outstanding share options being expected to be made later in March.
ENLARGED GROUP The aggregate cost, net of the option proceeds, is expected to be 1270 million.

GROUP TREASURY POLICIES The groups treasury department manages the liquidity, funding and exposure to foreign exchange risk in a manner which ensures the most effective financing of the groups operations.
It aims to reduce financial risks arising from these operations to levels acceptable to the board and manage the residual risk, by the use of agreed procedures and instruments.
The treasury department is a cost centre, and its activity is aimed at preventing an increase in financial risk above the levels inherent in the underlying businesses.
The significant financial risks and exposures to the group are in respect of liquidity, interest rates and foreign currency.
These are managed by the treasury department within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the board.
34 AMEC plc ANNUAL REPORT 2002 LIQUIDITY RISK Other than derivatives, the groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
COMMITTED BANK FACILITIES The groups funding policy aims to ensure the availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet current requirements as well as future growth anticipated Final maturity date million within the groups budget and strategic plan.
Accordingly, the group aims to keep committed January 2005 116.0 facilities to a minimum of 125 per cent of peak gross debt.
The board has approved targets April 2005 180.0 January 2007 330.0 for minimum interest cover of four times and a net debt to EBITDA not exceeding two times as being appropriate for managing the operations of the group.
626.0 The average maturity of the facilities in place at 31 December 2002 was about 38 months, which The group has put in place a further 60 million of multicurrency facilities expiring in January 2005 compares with the boards target of a minimum of 30 months.
All these facilities are unsecured, subsequent to the year end, bringing the total of and the principal covenants relate to interest cover and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
In addition, the group has a number of uncommitted facilities available which are used to fund short-term requirements.
INTEREST RATE RISK The group finances its operations through a mixture of equity, retained profit, cash and debt facilities.
The objective of the interest rate policy for the group is to ensure a suitable match of its interest rate characteristics to its underlying assets, revenues and expenditures whilst ensuring adequate interest cover is maintained in line with board approved targets and banking covenants.
Most borrowings are on a floating rate basis, however, recognising the need to link interest rate risk to the underlying businesses.
The group has used interest rate swaps, both during the year and subsequent to the year end, to convert a proportion of its floating rate debt to fixed rate.
The group now has approximately 75 million Sterling equivalent of interest rate swaps, in a mixture of Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, with an effective rate of 4.36 per cent, and with an average of 45 months to maturity.
Using average net debt of 195 million, a one per cent change in interest rates would have an impact of around 2 million on reported profit, reduced to about 1 million based on the interest rate swaps.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK The group is exposed to both transaction and translation of foreign exchange risk.
TRANSACTION EXPOSURES A significant proportion of trading activity is denominated in the relevant local currency of the businesses matching the currency of its cost base.
Where contracts are awarded, or involve costs in non local currency, the group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk arising through the use of forward currency arrangements, which may include the purchase of currency options.
TRANSLATION EXPOSURES The group has various assets denominated in foreign currency.
The policy is to hedge a proportion of the assets and unamortised goodwill.
Such hedging activity is predominantly performed through foreign exchange swaps, complemented by some foreign currency borrowings.
At 31 December 2002, the principal exposure was to assets denominated in US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At that date, balance sheet hedges totalled approximately 180 million including the hedging of short-term working capital fluctuations.
The book value of the assets, including unamortised goodwill was approximately 270 million as at 31 December 2002.
