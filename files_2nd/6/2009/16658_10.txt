As at 31 December 2009, the estimated funding position incorporating the UK Plans economic liabilities showed a funding ratio of 85%, but the IAS 19 valuation reflected a funding ratio of 95%.
This represents a valuation difference of around 50m, of which some 30m is due to the use of the stronger Long Cohort mortality assumption for funding purposes and the rest is largely due to the difference in the discount rates used in each valuation methodology.
The Group continues to fund the UK Plan with reference to its economic funding position.
