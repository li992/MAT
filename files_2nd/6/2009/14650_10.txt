Revenue Revenue in sterling terms was up 6 per cent compared with 2008.
Excluding the benefits of exchange rates, the change was a decrease of 10 per cent which was a solid performance in a challenging economic environment.
During 2009 we have increased our market share in our key Performance Analysis division and have seen increased demand for our products in growing and emerging markets.
Spirents revenues are predominantly denominated in US dollars and therefore the lower average US dollar:sterling exchange rate this year has had a marked positive effect on these results, increasing reported revenue by 38.9 million compared with 2008.

Order intake for the year Eric Hutchinson at constant currencies was down 6 per cent compared with the prior year.
For Chief Financial Officer the fourth quarter there was growth of 18 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 2008.
Operating profit Reported operating profit was 55.3 million compared with 48.7 million in 2008, an increase of 14 per cent in sterling terms.
Operating profit before share-based payment and acquired intangible amortisation, which is the measure of profit used by the Group to evaluate performance, improved by 11 per cent to 56.6 million compared with 18 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2009 BUSINESS REVIEW 50.9 million in 2008.
Exchange benefited this result by 9.7 million, compared to 2008: at constant currencies operating profit is down 8 per cent.
Spirents ability to adapt to changing market dynamics has been key in 2009 in enabling profitability to be maintained and allowing the funding of innovation in products and solutions to be preserved.
In 2009 we realised annualised cost reductions of 11.3 million, announced at the interim stage, at a cost of 1.0 million which was expensed in the year.
We have improved our return on sales from 19.7 per cent in 2008 to 20.8 per cent in 2009.
The Groups returns are some of the best in our industry.
Currency impact As previously mentioned the weakening of sterling in the latter part of 2008 against all the major currencies resulted in a significant change to the average US dollar:sterling exchange rate used to translate Spirents results in 2009 compared with that for 2008.
The average exchange rate decreased from 1.85 for 2008 to 1.57 for 2009.
This increased reported revenue by 32.9 million and operating profit by 7.5 million on translation.
The Group has reduced its exposure to transactional currency risk in some of its businesses as it had hedged its full year expected US dollar exposures at the end Return on sales of 2008 at an average rate of $1.76:1.
Transactional currency exposures resulted in an increase in reported revenue of 6.0 million and in operating profit of 2.2 million.
For 2010 approximately half of the forecast transactional exposures have been hedged at an average rate of $1.57:1.
20.8% At an exchange rate of $1.60:1, and based on 2009 results, revenue would be lower 2008 19.7% by approximately 4 million and operating profit by 1 million.
For each $0.01 change in the $: rate earnings per share changes by approximately 0.03 pence.
Cost of sales and operating expenses We have seen a further improvement in gross margin during 2009, an increase of 1.7 percentage points, to 66.3 per cent, and in the second half of 2009 we achieved 67.5 per cent.
There has been an improving trend over a number of years achieved through cost reduction and outsourcing activities.
Gross margin has also been positively affected by an increasing proportion of software revenue.
The development of new innovative test solutions is critical to the success of our business and product development forms a substantial amount of our overall costs.
We work closely with our customers and remain focused on their requirements and are investing in areas that represent their future.
Product development expense in 2009 increased from 45.3 million in 2008 to 47.5 million, but was lower in US dollar terms and marginally lower as a percentage of revenue, dropping to 17.5 per cent from 17.6 per cent of sales in 2008.
The majority of this spend, 38.7 million 2008 37.8 million, is for our Performance Analysis division.
Other operating expenses, which includes share-based payment and acquired intangible amortisation, were higher at 77.7 million in 2009 compared with 72.6 million in 2008, being 28.6 per cent and 28.2 per cent of sales, respectively.
The absolute increase is principally a result of exchange rate translation effect on US dollar operating expenses of 8.4 million, plus the losses on exchange rate hedging of 3.2 million.
This increase has been offset by a lower expense for share-based payment in 2009 and by cost control.
Exceptional items There were no exceptional items in 2009.
In 2008 0.8 million of exceptional finance income was reported in relation to interest received on tax refunds for prior periods.
An exceptional interest expense of 2.6 million was charged for interest paid on the agreement of prior year tax positions with the relevant tax authorities, and a related exceptional tax credit of 25.6 million was also recorded.
Intangible amortisation Operating expense includes a charge of 0.9 million for the amortisation of acquired intangibles in 2009, compared to 0.7 million in 2008.
There will be a comparable charge in 2010.

This compares with a total surplus for both plans of 2.6 million at 31 December 2008.
The market value of the pension plans assets has increased in 2009, largely due to a recovery in global markets, but this was offset by increases in the liabilities resulting from changes to the assumptions used to value the liabilities.
