Exceptional items The results for the period include a number of items which we have identified as exceptional, being those items which we believe need to be disclosed in order to provide greater visibility of the underlying results of the business, which the Board believes to be a more meaningful indication of ongoing operational performance.
To a large extent the exceptional items arise from the refocusing of the Group on to its services businesses and our intention to exit BVT Surface Fleet.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 9 An analysis of exceptional items incurred is as follows: Underlying profit growth of m 41% has been achieved though Profit arising from disposal of surplus properties 4.4 a combination of Increase in industrial injury provision 8.0 organic expansion Restructuring costs 24.7 and acquisitions.
Total pre-tax exceptional charges 28.3 Upon formation of BVT Surface Fleet we agreed that VT Group would remain responsible for all retrospective asbestos claims from former VT employees.
A reassessment of the provision for asbestos exposures has been made using specialist advisors adopting current assumptions in relation to recent claims experience and mortality data.
As a result, the Board decided to increase this provision by 8.0m.
The new structure referred to in the Chief Executives report and the programme of reduction of employee numbers gives rise to total restructuring costs of 24.7m.
Taxation The underlying effective tax rate excluding exceptional items increased to 27.1 per cent 2008: 26.5 per cent as a result of changes in the mix of UK and overseas profits.
This underlying rate has been calculated by including the Groups share of taxation from equity accounted investments within the tax charge rather than as a deduction from its share of attributable earnings.
Underlying profit The Group uses underlying profit before taxation as a key measure of performance, which is defined as follows: Continuing operations 2009 2008 Change m m % Profit before tax as reported 32.2 45.5 29 Amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations 23.0 9.9 Taxation charge relating to equity accounted investments 2.3 5.0 Fair value movements on derivative financial instruments recorded in the income statement 0.8 1.2 Exceptional charges 28.3 - Underlying profit before tax 86.6 61.6 41 Underlying profit growth of 41 per cent has been achieved from a combination of organic expansion and acquisitions.
The Group has revised the measure of underlying profit to exclude fair value mark to market gains or losses on derivative financial instruments.
IAS 39 provides a set of criteria that must be met before hedge accounting can be used which, if not met, can introduce volatility into the Groups income statement.
The Group does not trade in these derivatives and therefore we believe that such fair value gains or losses do not reflect the underlying economics of the arrangements and create volatility in the income statement which can make an assessment of underlying performance more difficult.
Further acquisitions contributed to the increase in the intangible amortisation charge of 23.0m 2008: 9.9m.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 0 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Financial review continued An analysis of underlying profit before tax by business division is as follows: An adjusted earnings per Continuing operations 2009 2008 Change share increase m m % of 41% was VT Communications 19.8 16.9 17 driven by strong VT Education & Skills 23.6 13.5 75 performance VT Services Inc 14.1 8.6 64 from continuing businesses.
VT Support Services 35.9 26.6 35 Underlying operating profit 93.4 65.6 42 Net financing costs 6.8 4.0 Underlying profit before tax 86.6 61.6 41 VT Communications saw organic growth of 17 per cent in the year due to the operational efficiencies on its mature contracts combined with the new contracts for UKMFTS and FSTA projects making their initial contributions.
VT Education & Skills has benefited from the VT Flagship acquisition which contributed 7.9m to its growth, the remainder of 2.2m arising from organic activities, representing organic growth of 16 per cent.
Both the VT Training and the education support businesses performed well as a result of contract wins and the training businesss greater focus on engineering capabilities.
Our US business continues to grow its profits following the prior year acquisition of VT Aepco, with margin increasing to 4.6 per cent 2008: 3.6 per cent.
The profit benefited from foreign exchange translation in the year of approximately 1.5m as compared to the prior year.
VT Support Services experienced strong profit growth in the year.
Activities in aerospace were boosted by commencement of delivery on the UKMFTS and FSTA programmes.
We continue to invest in expansion of our waste management activities, having invested a further 3.0m during the current year in pursuit of identified opportunities.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on profit before amortisation of intangible assets arising from business combinations, exceptional items and fair value movements in derivative financial instruments.
For the year ended 31 March 2009 the adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations was 33.9p 2008: 24.1p, an increase of 41 per cent, based on an average number of shares in issue during the year of 177.3m 2008: 176.5m.
Discontinued operations Discontinued operations comprise the Groups BVT Naval segment.
BVT Naval includes the businesses constituting the VT Shipbuilding segment in the Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008.
This includes those businesses transferred to BVT Surface Fleet Ltd BVT on 1 July 2008, the Groups interest in BVT and the business of VT Motion Control Group, which was primarily involved in the provision of stabilizers to the shipbuilding industry, and was disposed of during the year.
Discontinued operations contributed 83.5m 2008: 20.9m to our total reported profit, principally as a result of the accounting gain of 100.8m recognised on the formation of BVT, offset by the loss on the disposal of the Motion Control business, the results of shipbuilding prior to transfer to BVT and our share of the results of BVT.
The Groups share of BVTs results subsequent to its creation includes a charge of 24m, representing the Groups share of additional costs on certain export contracts contributed to the joint venture by VT.
The Directors estimate that these contracts will result in an overall loss to BVT of 54m based on the Boards experience of shipbuilding together with independent reviews performed by specialist consultants.
Inevitably there is a range of possible outcomes and the overall loss represents the Directors best estimate of losses based on information currently available.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 The Directors have noted that our BVT partner BAE Systems plc BAE, in its annual report for At 31 March 2009, the year ended 31 December 2008 reported loss provisions of 96m 53m at BAEs 55 per cent the Group had share through its fair value accounting, consistent with estimates provided by BVT management.

injection of capital by VT into the BVT business in a form which will not impact the existing equity holdings or management rights.
Any such injection of capital would, however, result in an exceptional charge being recorded within discontinued operations in the period in which made.
Whilst it is possible that an injection of capital may be made, the Directors do not believe it appropriate to make any provision for such injection at this stage, nor, given the circumstances, is it practicable to estimate reliably the amount of any such contribution.
Further details regarding discontinued operations can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Capital management and treasury The Groups treasury function is responsible for managing the Groups capital, including its exposure to financial risks and operates in line with policies set by the Board.
The primary objectives are to: Maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital and safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern Provide cash management Ensure the availability of cost-effective facilities to finance new investment, working capital and guarantees Manage interest rate and foreign currency exposure The Board has a conservative policy towards the investment of cash.
Treasury instruments are used only to reduce risk and speculation is not permitted.
Cash and net debt The Groups operating cash conversion as a percentage of underlying operating profit from continuing operations was 105 per cent 2008: 98 per cent.
The Groups net debt at 31 March 2009 was 186.4m 2008: 144.9m as set out in the following table.
The increase in the year was largely due to the acquisition of VT Flagship in July 2008, for an initial deferred consideration of 65m.
2009 2008 m m Recourse net debt Cash 51.5 60.1 Loans receivable 5.8 0.3 Interest-bearing loans 155.4 185.3 VT Flagship deferred consideration 68.1 - 166.2 124.9 Non-recourse net debt 20.2 20.0 Total net debt 186.4 144.9 The Groups principal source of funding is 305.0m of revolving credit facilities of which 225.0m is available to the Group until November 2011 and 80.0m which was renewed during the year for a further two years and will be available until March 2011.
At 31 March 2009, a total of 129.9m was drawn down under these facilities, leaving available headroom of 175.1m.
The Group continues to operate well within the financial covenants applicable to these borrowing facilities.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 2 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Financial review continued The movement in net debt during the year is summarised as follows: The proposed final dividend of 10.5p 2009 2008 plus the interim m m dividend of 3.9p Cash flow from operating activities - continuing operations 97.9 64.3 represents a total Cash flow from operating activities - discontinued operations 33.4 1.4 dividend increase Tax paid 20.8 11.4 of 10% on 2008.

Pensions The Group participates in six defined benefit pension schemes with a cumulative deficit, net of deferred tax, amounting to 43.6m 2008: 7.0m which is recognised within the Group balance sheet.
The increase in the reported deficit during the year was largely due to a fall in the value of investments held within the pension schemes.
In addition, the Group has committed to make additional payments of 20m over the three years to March 2011, of which 5m was paid during the current year.
The next actuarial review of this scheme is not due until March 2011.
The Board continues to monitor the ongoing funding position.
Dividend The proposed final dividend of 10.5p per share, together with the interim dividend of 3.9p per share paid in January 2009, gives a cumulative dividend for 2009 of 14.4p 2008: 13.1p, an increase of 10 per cent on the prior year.
The increase in dividend reflects the Boards confidence in the future prospects of the Group as well as its strong financial position.
The total dividend was covered 2.3 times by earnings before intangible amortisation arising from business combinations and exceptional items 2008: 1.9 times.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the proposed final dividend of 10.5p per share will be paid on 13 August 2009 to shareholders on the register at 10 July 2009.
Critical accounting policies The Groups accounting policies are set out on pages 73 to 81.
In order to prepare our financial statements in accordance with these policies, management has used various judgements and assumptions to estimate the amounts at which certain items are recorded.
Actual results may therefore differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions.
The following are the policies considered to be critical, as the judgements and assumptions made could have a significant impact on the Groups results and financial condition.
VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 3 Retirement benefits Accounting for pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves judgement about certain events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, rates of return on plan assets and determination of discount rates for measuring plan obligations.
Determination of the projected benefit obligations for the Groups defined benefit pension plans impacts on the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement.
The assumptions used may vary from year to year, which will affect future results.
Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome may also affect future results.
Pension benefit assumptions are discussed and agreed with independent actuaries in March each year and are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end, hence the deficits recorded on the Groups balance sheet, and the pension expense for the following year.
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying value will be recovered through disposal rather than continuing use within the business and the asset is available for sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable.
The Group has determined that the transfer of our shipbuilding business in the year to BVT and the planned exercise of the put option held over its interest in that joint venture results in that interest meeting the criteria to be treated as an asset held for sale and the BVT Naval segment meeting the criteria of a discontinued operation.
In reaching that conclusion management has exercised a judgement that there are no significant matters at 31 March 2009 which would prevent the option being exercised in accordance with its terms.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and that revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue recognised is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable for services delivered.
In assessing the amount of revenue to be recognised, management makes judgements and assumptions regarding the percentage of completion of a project in respect of an infrastructure or long-term capital project and assesses the fair value of different service elements of a contract so that an appropriate amount of revenue can be recognised during the different phases.
Taxation Provisions for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures.
Amounts provided are based on managements interpretation of country-specific law and the likelihood of settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions are likely to be sustained.
Goodwill and other intangible assets The Group has capitalised goodwill included on the balance sheet of 303m at 31 March 2009.
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate potential impairment exists.
The Group uses the present value of future cash flows to determine implied fair value.
In calculating the implied fair value, significant management judgement is required in forecasting cash flows of the reporting unit, in estimating terminal growth values and in selecting an appropriate discount rate.
If different management judgements were adopted, then different impairment outcomes could result.
No impairment resulted from the annual impairment test in 2009.
