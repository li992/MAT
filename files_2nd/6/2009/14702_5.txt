On 8 October 2008 KSF went into administration and we are in dispute with the administrators concerning the ownership of the shares they hold.
We have now concluded that, while we continue to maintain that the shares are ours and should be delivered to us, we may not control the shares for accounting purposes.
We have therefore treated them in the accounts as having been derecognised.
Doing so has no impact on net assets as the value of the shares 26.1m has been replaced by a reduction in creditors 20.3m owed to KSF and the creation of a 5.9m debtor.
It has however, had a significant impact on reported profit as the loss in value of the Blacks shareholding which was previously charged to the statement of recognised income and expense has now been taken to the Income Statement.
The respective shareholdings at 26 April 2009 and 27 April 2008 not reflecting the derecognition for accounting purposes were as follows: At 26 April 2009 At 27 April 2008 Shares Shares m Holding m Holding Blacks Leisure Group 12.728 29.85% 12.728 29.85% Amer Sports Corporation 1.066 1.48% 1.066 1.48% JD Sports Fashion 6.475 13.31% 5.955 12.34 adidas AG - - 0.398 0.02% JJB Sports 11.944 4.76% - - Other - - - - Cash flow and net deBt In addition to the amounts invested in capital expenditure and acquisitions, the Group received a net 8.9m cash inflow from the purchase and disposal of strategic investments.
20.3m of the reduction in Net Debt resulted from the derecognition of the loan used to finance strategic investments held by KSF.
