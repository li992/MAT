Financial Review Introduction and summary I am pleased to report results for the year that in overall terms demonstrate that the Group has made a great deal of progress on a number of the specific operational and financial priorities set out at the start of this year, despite a backdrop of uncertain and difficult economic and financial markets.
Steve Hare Chief Financial Officer In terms of KPIs, highlights for the year include a cash conversion in excess of 120%, a free cash flow of 296 million and net cash and deposits at 31 March 2009 of 309 million.
From a financial perspective, my priorities this year have centred on strengthening the Groups balance sheet and cash position.
These priorities have become increasingly critical as the year has progressed due to the economic environment, and they support the Groups strategy of building a strong foundation for growth.
The key achievements in the year to 31 March 2009 in respect of this are as follows: In July 2008, we successfully completed a new five year 400 million banking facility.
This replaced the banking facilities put in place during the 2006 Refinancing and meets our anticipated financing requirements for the foreseeable future.
We generated operating cash flow of 298 million in the year, resulting in cash conversion in excess of 120%.
As noted in my report last year, my criterion for strong cash conversion is 90% : however, this year we have increased My priorities this year have centred on our focus on working capital management, both by driving strengthening the Groups balance significant process improvements and by consistently exercising greater rigour in this area.
This has helped us to sheet and cash position, which has achieve what I believe is a superior level of cash conversion.
become increasingly critical in the The high level of operating cash flow has greatly contributed to the free cash flow of 296 million.
key contributing items are the 95 million we received in Highlights for the year include the settlement from Bombardier in April 2008 with respect to Invensys Rails PPP contract and 27 million of income from 2008 Refinancing, a cash conversion the sale of our shareholding in CompAir Holdings Ltd.
In in excess of 120%, a free cash flow of addition, there has been an absence of finance costs as a result of the Group becoming debt free following the 2008 296 million and net cash and deposits Refinancing.
As noted above, we ended the year with net at 31 March 2009 of 309 million.
cash and deposits of 309 million.
We successfully concluded the triennial valuation of our UK Main Pension Scheme with a funding plan that is not materially different from our previous plan.
This has provided us with certainty in respect of funding requirements for the next three years, and we continue to have a scheme that is managed in a way that minimises the level of volatility within it.
There have been a number of additional key developments in the year.
We have been responsive to the market conditions impacting our businesses through implementation of a number of major restructuring programmes in our Process Systems and Invensys Controls businesses to improve the efficiency of our cost base in several areas, including manufacturing.
Despite an increase in restructuring activity, we still generated an absolute level of profit for continuing operations of 142 million and an underlying EPS of 14.1p.
Further initiatives are under way and contingency plans have been developed to help us mitigate against potential risks in this difficult environment.
Finally, we fulfilled our promise to take the necessary actions to enable the Board to recommend a dividend.

Invensys plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2009 | 15 Financial Review continued Under the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004, the UK Main Pension Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial review with a valuation date of 31 March 2008.
The valuation disclosed a funding shortfall of 285 million using assumptions agreed between the Company and the Trustee of the UK Main Pension Scheme.
The updated funding valuation has made no significant change to the annual cash flows arising under the funding plan for the next three years, which amount to 37 million per annum in the next financial year, rising approximately 1 million per annum thereafter.
The plan extends to March 2017.
The investment strategy determined by the Trustee continues to reflect the mature nature of the UK Main Pension Scheme, with the assets predominantly invested in bond or bond like instruments.
Dividend The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.5p per share 2008: nil.
The proposed dividend is covered 9.4 times by underlying earnings.
Summary and conclusions As noted in the introduction to this Financial Review, I am pleased with the progress and achievements made in the year to 31 March 2009, particularly given the difficult nature of the markets and financial environment.
The strong focus on cash and the balance sheet has resulted in the delivery of some excellent results in this area, including ending the year with a net cash and deposits balance in excess of 300 million.
This is a strong foundation on which to move forward into the new fiscal year, when we will continue to focus on the themes from this year, including a drive for strong cash generation, higher levels of productivity and efficiency and successful management of our pension liabilities.
I am pleased to hand this position over to my successor, Wayne Edmunds, and wish him every success.
