We have our largest In construction services excluding the Middle East, we ever pipeline of contract renewal and new contract opportunities, expect the contribution to revenue from the UK to continue to and currently only some 15 per cent of expected revenue in 2010 decline in 2010, in line with our expectations, by applying strict is not already covered by our order book and probable orders.
In Canada, we expect further growth The level of new contract opportunities refl ects the pressure on in 2010 partially to offset the reduction in UK revenue.
Through both public and private sector organisations to reduce costs and contract selectivity we will continue to ensure that the size of our increase effi ciency through outsourcing non-core services.
We construction business is appropriate to support the delivery of expect this trend to continue and in the public sector to accelerate, PPP projects, the needs of our support services business and our following the UK General Election in 2010, as both central and expectations for reduced demand in our other UK construction local government are expected to step up their efforts to reduce markets.
We have already made signifi cant progress in this regard the costs of delivering better public services.

Having increased our operating support our objective of moving the combined operating margin margin in this segment to 4.9 per cent in 2009 2008: 4.6 per for all our construction activities, including the Middle East, cent, we are targeting a margin of around fi five per cent in 2010. towards three per cent in 2010.
In Public Private Partnership PPP projects, we have a good pipeline of concession contracts for which we are either the preferred bidder or shortlisted.
This refl ects the strong positions we have in our target market sectors in the UK and in Canada, where John McDonough we expect continuing opportunities for new projects, notably in Group Chief Executive the education sector in the UK and in the health sector in Canada.
3 March 2010 Consequently, we expect to continue adding new PPP projects to our portfolio.
We also expect to continue to explore opportunities for selling equity investments in mature projects, namely once construction of the asset has been completed and the project has moved successfully into the operational phase with the support services contract fully established.
Therefore, we expect to continue generating signifi cant value for the Group through our PPP equity investments.
In Middle East construction services, currently some 85 per cent of expected revenue in 2010 is already covered by our order book and probable orders.
In addition, we have a strong pipeline of contract opportunities that is currently worth over 4 billion, the largest elements of which are in Abu Dhabi and Oman.
Given our reputation for delivering projects to the highest standards of quality and reliability, we expect to continue benefi ting from the regions major investment programmes, notably in Abu Dhabi and Oman, and also in Qatar where we have recently established a new business.
Following the global economic downturn, rather than negotiating contracts we are now tendering competitively for contracts in this region.
As a result, we expect our operating margin to reduce from the very high level we achieved in 2009 of 8.5 per cent 2008: 7.4 per cent.
However, we are still targeting a healthy margin of over six per cent in 2010.
Furthermore, given the scale of opportunities we have in the region, we believe that the medium to long-term outlook also continues to be positive, with margins expected to stabilise in the medium term at between fi five and six per cent.

The reduction in revenue refl ected the sale of non-core businesses, the loss of a contract to manage insurance claims for Aviva, following a strategic decision by Aviva to take in-house services that involve direct contact with their customers, and the effect of being fi nancially disciplined and selective in respect of contract bids and re-bids.
In 2009, we continued to strengthen our position as one of the UKs leading support services companies through our ability to combine our extensive skills and nationwide resources to provide innovative cost-effective service solutions tailored to meet the needs of our customers.
In particular, having the skills and resources to provide all the services needed to manage and maintain large, complex property estates and infrastructure helps to differentiate Carillion from its competitors.

Cash fl ow has also remained strong with receipts from customers in 2009 of some 555 million, which supported an increase in the dividend received from our Middle East businesses.
We have continued to deliver substantial growth in the Middle East, despite the slowdown of construction activity in Dubai, through our strategy of geographical diversifi cation and of focusing on a small number of fi nancially robust customers with whom we have strong long-term relationships.
We commenced operations in Abu Dhabi in early 2008, since when its contribution to Middle East revenue has increased from 20 per cent in 2008 to 55 per cent in 2009, while the contribution from Dubai has reduced as expected from 55 per cent in 2008 to 20 per cent in 2009.
Revenue in Oman has also grown signifi cantly to leave its contribution broadly unchanged at 23 per cent, with the balance of two per cent coming from Egypt.
The successful completion in October 2009 of the 350 million Yas Hotel, the centre piece of Abu Dhabis new Formula 1 Grand Prix circuit, for developer ALDAR, has further reinforced the reputation of Al Futtaim Carillion as one of the regions leading contractors, well positioned to continue winning high-quality work.
For example, during 2009, Al Futtaim Carillion secured a number of Revenue new orders in Abu Dhabi, including a 550 million contract for ALDAR to build the Al Muneera development and a 150 million contract to build a new headquarters for the Abu Dhabi Investment 0.6bn Council, together with further infrastructure works for Emirates Aluminium and the Qasr Al Muwaiji museum for the Authority for Culture and Heritage, together worth some 50 million.

The UK contribution to revenue reduced slightly as a result of continuing to apply strict contract selectivity and risk management criteria, in order to secure high-quality projects for long-term customers in our chosen sectors of the non-housing, new-build market.
As a result, we have continued to adjust the scope and scale of our construction capability to ensure it has the critical mass necessary to support the delivery of Public Private Partnership PPP projects and the needs of our support services business, while taking account of our expectations for reduced future demand in other UK construction markets.
The intake of new orders has remained healthy.
Notable successes in the UK included contracts for the Building Schools for the Future BSF programme worth 800 million, a 209 million contract to upgrade the A1 trunk road to motorway standard in Yorkshire, a 130 million contract for a luxury residential development for Grosvenor on Londons South Bank and a 116 million contract for HM Prison Low Moss in Scotland.
In Canada and the Caribbean, we have had a very successful year.
The acquisition of the Vanbots Group further strengthened our construction capability and leadership position in the growing PPP Revenue projects market in Canada, as evidenced by a number of major contract wins in 2009. Notable successes in Canada included two PPP projects in the health sector the 144 million Royal Victoria 2.2bn Hospital in Barrie, Ontario, and the 107 million Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto and a 360 million contract for the revitalisation of Union Station in Toronto.
