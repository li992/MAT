Invested capital is defined as non-current assets plus current assets less current liabilities, excluding all balances relating to interest bearing liabilities and all other assets or liabilities associated with the financing and capital structure of the group and excluding any deferred tax balances and effective hedges relating to interest-bearing liabilities.
Our previous definition of ROIC included within assets the impact of cross currency interest rate swaps.
This has now been adjusted to align with our adjusted net debt definition, giving a more accurate reflection of the true position.
This change does not significantly impact on the trends we have seen previously.
