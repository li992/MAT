Going Concern The directors have reviewed the current and projected financial position of the Group making reasonable assumptions about future trading performance.
The key areas of sensitivity are: timing and value of property sales availability of loan finance and related cash flows future property valuation and its impact on covenants and potential loan repayments committed future expenditure future rental income and potential bad debts repayment timing and value of trade receivables The forecast cashflows have been sensitised to eliminate those cash inflows which are less certain and to take account of a further deterioration of property valuations.
From their review the directors believe that the Group have adequate resources to continue to be operational as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
Placing On 28 January 2009 the Group placed 9,735,100 ordinary 1p shares the Placing Shares at a price of 285 pence per share, raising net proceeds of 26.4m.
These Placing Shares represented 9.99% of the Groups issued ordinary share capital prior to the Placing and were admitted to trading on 2 February 2009.
