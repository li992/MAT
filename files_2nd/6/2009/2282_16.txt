To deal with the changed circumstances an impairment charge of 31.5m was made and a wide ranging restructuring of the Groups activities, aimed at better aligning the cost base with these lower demand levels, resulted in an exceptional charge for facility closures of 25.4m.
In 2010 these restructuring initiatives, begun in 2008 and extended in 2009, can be expected to generate annualised savings of 43.0m for the Group, of which 36.2m are cash savings.
