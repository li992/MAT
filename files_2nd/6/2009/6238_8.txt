FINANCE REVIEW Construction of the San Carlos shaft at the Fresnillo mine 34 FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT The Consolidated Financial Statements of Fresnillo plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
This review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to facilitate understanding of the Groups financial statements.
Management recommends reading this review in conjunction with the Financial Statements and their accompanying notes on pages 90 to 134.
COMMENTARY ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Despite the global economic crisis, the volatility in commodity prices and significant cost pressures experienced in 2009, Fresnillo plc generated strong financial results.
The effective execution of our strategy, including cost control efforts, combined with favourable external factors such as higher metal prices and a weakening Mexican peso against US dollar helped drive the increase in total revenues, gross profit, EBITDA and operating profit in 2009.
These positive factors were partially offset by higher average unit costs from a number of key mining inputs such as reagents, tyres and steel for drilling, which contrary to expectations, did not decline until late in the year.
Key line items of the Income Statement are shown below: INCOME STATEMENT KEY LINE ITEMS US$ millions 2009 2008 % Change Revenues 849.94 720.48 18.0 Cost of sales 321.63 299.87 7.2 Gross profit 528.32 420.61 25.6 Exploration expenses 49.06 53.48 8.3 EBITDA 496.62 337.36 47.2 profit from continuing operations before income tax 457.42 267.36 71.1 Income tax expense 99.15 114.58 13.5 profit for the year 358.27 152.78 134.5 profit for the year, excluding post-tax Silverstream revaluation effects 344.30 152.78 125.4 Attributable profit 322.01 127.95 151.7 1 Basic and diluted earnings per share US$ share 0.449 0.186 141.3 Adjusted basic and diluted earnings 2 per share US$ share 0.430 0.186 131.2 1 The weighted average number of ordinary shares for 2009 was 717,160,159.

Fresnillos financial results are highly dependent on the performance of our operating assets and thus managements decision-making and execution capabilities.
However, there are certain variables which are beyond the Groups control that have a material impact on its financial statements.
A description of these external factors and their impact on results is provided below.
Precious metal prices Silver and gold prices are the most significant variable impacting the financial statements, as approximately 94% of Fresnillos revenues come from these metals.
The average realised price of silver in 2009 was US$15.27 per ounce, an increase of 3.8% year-over-year.
The average realised gold price increased by 12.5% year-on-year to US$988.94 per ounce.
These increases benefited the Groups annual financial results.
The Group remains fully exposed to movements in the underlying metals prices as a result of our strategy of not hedging silver and gold production.
Foreign exchange rates The average spot exchange rate for 2009 was MXN13.52 per US dollar, compared with MXN11.14 per US dollar in 2008, representing an average devaluation of 21.4%.
As a result, 35 FINANCE REVIEW LEADERSHIP.
the Groups production costs decreased when compared to 2008, as costs denominated in Mexican pesos approximately 70% of total costs were lower when converted to US dollars.
The Mexican peso-US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2009 was MXN13.06 per US dollar, compared to the exchange rate at the beginning of the year of MXN13.54 per US dollar, a revaluation of 3.5% that had an aggregate adverse effect on pesodenominated monetary assets and liabilities which are valued at the year-end spot rate.
Additionally, the US dollar devalued against sterling by 9.1%, generating a foreign exchange gain from our cash position in sterling.
The net foreign exchange gain in the year compared favourably against the significant foreign exchange loss incurred in 2008, which was generated as a result of the strengthening of the US dollar against both MXN and sterling.
Under Mexican tax legislation, Fresnillo pays taxes on the basis of results prepared in accordance with Mexican accounting standards GAAS which are denominated in Mexican pesos.
This results in different exchange effects for tax purposes to those reported under IFRS and can therefore cause significant differences between the effective tax rate under IFRS and the statutory Mexican tax rate.
Ination of key operating materials The average unit price of key operating materials remained high throughout the year, limiting profit margin growth.
The unit prices for some key inputs such as steel balls for milling and explosives decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2009 following record levels in the second half of 2008.
However, the average unit prices of these inputs in 2009 continued to be at higher levels than in the previous year and it was not until the last two months of 2009 when input prices began to decline year-on-year.
As a result, the net increase in the weighted average input cost over the year was 1.0%.
YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE Steel balls for milling 14.7% Steel for drilling 4.8% Explosives 5.8% Tyres 6.2% Reagents 10.6% Weighted Average 1.0% Electricity The Groups average cost of electricity decreased by 14.9% when compared to 2008.

Treatment and rening charges Treatment and rening charges are determined annually using international benchmarks.
The treatment charge per tonne of lead and zinc concentrates, including the escalator, decreased by 29.7% and 20.8% respectively when compared to 2008.
However, these reductions were partially offset by a 23.5% increase in the rening charges per ounce of silver, which represented 52.2% of total treatment and rening charges.
As a result, treatment and rening charges, which are deducted from adjusted revenues for the purposes of revenues as disclosed in the income statement, decreased by 5.8% in 2009 compared to 2008.

Adjusted revenue increased by 12.4% to US$944.0 million in 2009.
The higher average realised silver and gold prices contributed 60% of the favourable US$104.4 million movement, whilst the remaining 40% was explained by the increase in the volumes of silver and gold sold.

financial instruments were terminated in 2007.
However, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 39 IAS 39, the Group has deferred in equity, hedging losses that arose on these hedging instruments prior to termination, and recycles them to the income statement in line with the occurrence of the transactions to which they related.
In 2009, a final non-cash charge of US$25.0 million was deducted from revenues, decreasing hedging losses from the previous year by 45.1%, and as at 31 December 2009 there are no remaining deferred losses related to the terminated gold and silver derivatives.
The Group has not entered into any new silver or gold hedging contracts and does not intend to do so.
However, it has entered derivative contracts related to the price of lead and zinc to mitigate the risks associated with the sale of these by-products.

COST OF SALES Cost of sales increased by 7.2% compared to 2008, while adjusted production costs, calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and the effects of exchange rate hedging, decreased by 6.1%.

The exchange-related decrease in adjusted production costs was equivalent to US$25.5 million.
"By factoring out the impact of the exchange rate on the peso-denominated components for each cost category, the changes explained below gZZXi i]Z Zhi bViZY jcYZgan c deZgVi dcVa VcY YdaaVg""YZcdb cViZY jc i Xdhih X]Vc Zh# Other positive aspects were: Operating efficiencies offset the small increase in the average unit cost of key operating materials, which resulted in a US$1.4 million benefit: and The cost of energy decreased by US$0.5 million, due to a 14.9% reduction in the unit cost of electricity, which more than offset the 9.5% increase in consumption at the mines related to production increases and the higher cost of diesel."
The benefit of the peso devaluation, operating efficiencies and decrease in energy costs was partially offset by the following factors: The cost of contractors increased by US$5.1 million mainly due to: i an increase in development works at our operating mines, which is a key factor to ensure future production: ii additional civil works: iii increased volumes of ore and waste hauled: iv rock bolting and shotcreting activities carried out with the aim of ensuring our workers safety: and v an average wage increase of 6.0%, in line with the increase given to union workers.
Personnel costs, excluding profit sharing, increased by US$4.4 million as a result of an increase of 8.0% in salaries at our three mines, productivity bonuses, training, and an increase in the number of workers at Cinega.
Maintenance and repair costs increased by US$2.8 million primarily due to higher utilisation of equipment and the consumption of additional spare parts to service the increase in equipment.
Other costs increased by US$1.4 million, which resulted from the combination of increases in insurance, security, maintenance of workers camps and mining rights, and the reduction in freight costs.

i]Z VkZgV Z hedi exchange rate was MXN10.64 per dollar.
Given the high volatility environment prevailing at that time, the Group entered into exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to meet its commitments contracted in Mexican pesos, such as the payment of wages and taxes, and to guarantee a xed exchange rate should the US dollar weaken.
As a result, Fresnillo plc sold forward US$60.0 million at an average rate of MXN11.17 per US dollar.
However, the average spot exchange rate at maturity dates was MXN13.25 per US dollar, thus generating an exchange rate hedging loss of US$9.5 million.
In 2009, the Group sold forward an additional US$16.0 million at an average rate of MXN14.68 per US dollar, which matured throughout 2009 and generated an exchange rate hedging gain of US$2.4 million as the average spot exchange rate was MXN12.81 per US dollar.
The combination of the aforementioned positions resulted in a final exchange rate loss of US$7.1 million.
Additionally, in 2009, the Group sold forward US$29.0 million at an average rate of MXN13.70 per US dollar with maturity dates throughout 2010.
In order to assure a minimum exchange rate and at the same time benefit from a possible devaluation of the peso against the US dollar, four put options were purchased totalling US$10.0 million, at an average strike of MXN11.75 per US dollar with maturity dates in 2010.
COST PER TONNE AND CASH COST PER OUNCE A key measure to evaluate the performance at our mines is the adjusted production cost per tonne.
In 2009, cost per tonne milled at Fresnillo and Cinega decreased by 11.4% and 6.8% respectively, whilst at Herradura cost per tonne deposited, excluding ore deposited from the Valles area, decreased by 9.8% when compared to 2008.
COST PER TONNE Year ended 31 December 2009 2008 % Change Fresnillo US$ tonne milled 36.49 41.19 11.4% Cinega US$ tonne milled 59.21 63.53 6.8% Herradura US$ tonne deposited 5.44 6.03 9.8% Cost per tonne is calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects The principal driver of cost reduction across the Group was the higher MXN US$ exchange rate, which benefited costs denominated in Mexican pesos when converted to US dollars and, to a lesser extent, the increase in volumes milled deposited at the mines.
Notwithstanding, these aspects were partially offset by increases in personnel, contractor and maintenance costs, as further described below.
Cost per tonne at the Fresnillo mine, excluding the effects of foreign exchange was negatively impacted by: i higher contractor costs due mainly to a 14% increase in metres developed in order to prepare a larger number of production stopes, higher volumes approximately 7% of ore hauled through longer distances, and a 126.6% increase in shotcreting activities for safety purposes: ii an 8.0% increase in wages and fringe benets as a result of the negotiations with the union: iii increase in maintenance and repair costs derived principally from the intensive use of equipment: and iv a 17.0% increase in insurance fees and mining concessions.
These increases were offset by the devaluation effect, higher ore milled and the lower cost of electricity and operating materials, which resulted from the decrease in the unit price of steel balls for the mill 3 and explosives.
Fresnillos cash cost decreased by 10.6% from US$3.77 per silver ounce in 2008 to US$3.37 in 2009.
Cost per tonne at Cinega, excluding the effects of foreign exchange was affected by: i higher personnel costs due to a 6.4% increase in the number of workers and the 8.0% increase in wages and fringe benets: ii increased maintenance costs of scoops and loaders, as a result of the intensive use of equipment that supported the increase in production: iii higher contractor costs due to an increase of 67.5% in development 10,000 additional metres, aiming to prepare a larger number of production stopes, and civil works carried out at the plant and mining village.
These increases were offset by the devaluation effect and the increased ore milled.
Cine- 3 gas cash cost decreased by 28.1% US$190.6 per gold ounce in 2009 vs US$264.9 per gold ounce in 2008, which was achieved as a result of the increased silver revenues credited to the total cash cost.
The higher revenues of this by-product were obtained due to both the increased price of silver and volume sold during 2009.
Cost per tonne at Herradura, excluding the effects of foreign exchange was impacted by the following factors: i an 8.0% increase in wages and fringe benets and training: ii higher costs of operating materials principally resulting from the increase in unit price and consumption of sodium cyanide used to improve recovery rates, and the increased consumption of tyres at higher unit costs derived from the more intensive use of equipment and the acquisition of bigger trucks: and iii increase in maintenance costs as a result of additional equipment and purchase of spare parts.
These increases were offset mainly 3 by the devaluation effect and the higher ore deposited.
In 2009, Herraduras cash cost decreased from US$397.5 per gold ounce in 2008 to US$358.9 per gold ounce in 2009, a reduction of 9.8%.
GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, before hedging gains and losses for each mine, is an important financial indicator continuously monitored by management to measure the performance of each business unit and the Group as a whole.
In 2009, gross profit, adjusted to exclude hedging gains and losses, increased by 20.2% compared to the previous year mainly due to steady results obtained at Cinega and record profits achieved at Fresnillo and Herradura.
Specically, the Cinega mine maintained its contribution to the Groups gross profit excluding hedging effects as a result of the higher ore milled and the significant increase in silver ore grade, which compensated for the lower gold ore grade extracted.
Although in 2009 the Fresnillo mine reduced its contribution to the gross profit excluding hedging effects, it remained the largest contributor to the increase in the year.
Finally, Herraduras contribution increased from 18.9% in 2008 to 22.9% in 2009 due to higher production of gold resulting from the increase in ore deposited and better recovery rates, which led to a record gross profit.

40 FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT reduction in administrative expenses of US$31.8 million.
The aforementioned decrease was partially offset by the increase in legal and advisory fees related to evaluations of potential acquisitions.
EXPLORATION EXPENSES Exploration expenses for 2009 totalled US$49.1 million, which were mainly incurred in exploration programmes aimed at increasing resources and reserves at our three operating mines, conrming and increasing resource estimates at the Soledad-Dipolos, Noche Buena and Saucito projects, and continuing drilling at the San Julin and Orisyvo prospects.
However, exploration expenses decreased by 8.3% compared to the US$53.5 million incurred in 2008 mainly due to the more intensive exploration phase which took place at the Soledad-Dipolos project in the previous year.

In 2009, EBITDA achieved a new record level of US$496.6 million, representing an increase of 47.2% year-on-year.
Similarly, the EBITDA margin rose from 46.8% in 2008 to 58.4% in 2009.

In 2009, the fair value of this instrument increased by US$19.4 million, with a corresponding non-cash gain recognised in the income statement.
Further information related to the Silverstream Contract is provided in the Balance Sheet and in the note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 117.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE The foreign exchange result is caused by the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
A foreign exchange gain of US$9.5 million was recognised in the income statement mainly as a result of the weakening of the US dollar against the UK pound sterling, which affected the cash position denominated in sterling.
In contrast, a loss of US$14.6 million was recorded during 2008 mainly as a result of the devaluation of the sterling against the US dollar.
TAXATION Income tax expense for 2009 was US$99.1 million, 13.5% lower compared to the previous year.
The effective tax rate was 21.7%.
A significant factor in the reduction from 2008 was that Minera Fresnillo purchased the San Julin project from the subsidiary exploration company Exploraciones Minera Parrea at market value.
In accordance with Mexican tax legislation, the acquisition of a project can be deducted from the companys income, which thus signicantly decreased the taxable profit of Minera Fresnillo, whilst Exploraciones Minera Parrea was able to utilise tax losses brought forward from previous years which were previously not recognised as a deferred asset.
Other factors l] X] Xdcig WjiZY id i]Z adlZg cXdbZ iVm ZmeZchZ lZgZ i]Z cVi dcVgn VY jhibZcih and certain tax credits.
In addition, a foreign exchange loss was recorded in the income statement under Mexican GAAS as set out above, which lowered the Groups taxable profits.
This loss was caused by the 3.5% revaluation of the Mexican peso-US dollar exchange rate which affected the Groups cash and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars, the most significant of which being the Silverstream Contract, cash and cash equivalents.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR profit for the year increased signicantly from US$152.8 million to US$358.3 million, a 134.5% increase year-on-year.
Despite the 46.0% increase in minority interest, profit attributable to the shareholders of the Group increased by 151.7% from US$128.0 to US$322.0 million in 2009.
Adjusted profit for the year, being profit for the year adjusted to exclude the effects of the revaluation of the Silverstream Contract, increased by 125.4% from US$152.8 in 2008 to US$344.3 million in 2009.

Another important source of funds was the US$39.0 million received in proceeds under the Silverstream Contract.
The use of these funds included the purchase of property, plant and equipment US$250.4 million.
Investments in these items are further described below: 42 FRESNILLO PLC 2009 ANNUAL REPORT PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT US$ millions 2009 Herradura mine 64.8 Expansion of the Centauro pit, purchase of hydraulic shovel and high-volume trucks, construction of leaching pads and acquisition of surface land Cinega mine 41.7 Mine development, mining works, optimisation of the leaching circuit, sinking of the shaft and purchase of land Fresnillo mine 34.6 Mine development and construction of the San Carlos shaft and the sewage water treatment plant SoledadDipolos 57.7 Pre-production stripping activities, construction of the mine and of the first leaching pad Saucito project 39.1 Equipment for the shafts and mining works San Julin project 5.0 Construction of exploration ramp Juanicipio project 3.5 Diamond drilling expenses Others 4.0 La Parrea Exploration and SAFSA Total purchase of property, plant and equipment 250.4 Additionally, dividends paid in 2009 totalled US$93.6 million, of which US$55.8 million corresponded to the final dividend of 2008, and the remaining US$37.8 million to the payment of the 2009 interim dividend.
After considering all the sources and uses of funds, there was a net increase of US$92.6 million in cash and cash equivalents during the year which, when combined with the US$212.0 million balance at the beginning of the year and the favourable effect of the exchange rate of US$7.6 million, resulted in a net cash position of US$312.2 million as at 31 December 2009.
