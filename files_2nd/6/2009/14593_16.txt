Financial Review Reported sales were flat at 787.3 million.
On a constant currency basis, sales decreased by approximately 10%.

Introduction Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items which, consistent with prior years, for 2009 management has defined as amortisation and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, profits or losses on the termination or disposal of businesses, unrealised changes in the fair value of financial instruments, gains or losses on retranslation of short-term inter-company loan balances, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate.
In view of the changes to IFRS 3, applicable for 2010 onwards, the definition of non-operational items will be changed for 2010 to include costs of acquisition and deferred and contingent fair value adjustments which management has concluded are non-operational in nature.
This change, when applied, will have no impact on 2009 or prior year reported adjusted earnings.
Unless otherwise stated, all profit and earnings figures referred to below are adjusted measures.

Favourable movements in foreign currency exchange rates had an impact of approximately 81.4 million, meaning that sales decreased by approximately 10% on a constant currency basis.
The year-onyear impact on sales from acquisitions was approximately 47.5 million or 6% of sales 2008: 28.1 million.
Therefore, on an organic constant currency basis, sales declined by 16% year-on-year.
Adjusted operating profit decreased by 39.1 million, or 33%, from 118.3 million in 2008 to 79.2 million in 2009.
Movements in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive effect on operating profit of approximately 3.3 million or 3% and acquisitions 79.2m contributed an additional 1.4 million to the operating profit before post-acquisition integration charges.
Volume reductions had a negative gross margin impact of Adjusted operating profit 71.4 million, which was partially offset by overhead cost reductions of 40.4 million.
The year-on-year increase in restructuring and post-acquisition integration charges was 12.8 million 2009: 14.0 million, 2008: 1.2 million.
Operating margins including restructuring and post-acquisition integration charges declined from 15.0% to 10.1%.
The year-on-year increase in interest costs was 2.8 million from 8.2 million to 11.0 million.
This includes 1.3 million relating to foreign exchange and the balance is due to the extra cost of additional borrowing in the year, partially offset by a reduction in interest rates.
Adjusted profit before tax decreased by 38% from 110.1 million to 68.2 million.
Statutory operating profit, after including acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation of 10.7 million 2008: 4.6 million, decreased by 40% from 113.7 million to 68.5 million.
Statutory profit before tax decreased by 49% from 106.1 million to 54.2 million.
