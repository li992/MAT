Business review The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 16 Financial review Assets Liabilities Net assets Goodwill Capital structure m m m At 30 September 2009 goodwill was 2,030.8m 2008: 1,825.5m.
As described Goodwill and intangible assets 2,246.8 2,246.8 in note 7, the carrying value of goodwill has been subjected to testing for impairment.
The assumptions used for these purposes are described in note 7.
Following this Property, plant and equipment 144.5 144.5 assessment, the Board concluded that no impairment of goodwill had arisen in the year.
Current assets and liabilities 280.3 689.2 408.9 Capital structure Retirement benefit obligations 11.8 11.8 Our balance sheet at 30 September 2009 is summarised as set out in the table on the left.
The main movements in the balance sheet items were in goodwill Total before net debt 2,679.1 742.2 1,936.9 and intangible fixed assets relating principally to the impact of foreign currency retranslation and the change in net debt see further Net debt and Cash flow below.
The balance sheet remains strong with net debt to EBITDA of 1.3 times.
There has been a significant change in the closing exchange rates used to 439.4m translate the debt at 30 September 2009 compared to 30 September 2008 as explained Net debt balance at above, which has resulted in a foreign exchange translation movement of 72.1m on the 30 September 2009 debt drawings.
Over the year, strong cash generation reduced net debt by 167.4m on a 2008: 541.0m constant currency basis.
The Group continues to be able to borrow at competitive rates and currently deems this to be the most effective means of raising finance.
Cash outflows to fund acquisitions of 13.8m have therefore been funded by debt financing.
112% Operating cash flow Cash flow represents 112% of EBITA The Group remains highly cash generative with operating cash flow of 357.6m, representing 2008: 114% 112% of EBITA 2008: 114%.
After interest, tax and net capital expenditure, free cash flow was 259.2m.
The net cost of acquisitions and disposals completed in the period was 1.8m.
After dividends of 95.1m and other movements of 60.7m, including exchange movements, net debt stood at 439.4m at 30 September 2009 2008: 541.0m.
Facilities, cash management and gearing The Group is funded through retained earnings and multi-currency revolving credit facilities totalling 815.1m, which expire in 2011.
At 30 September 2009, 460.6m had been drawn under these facilities.
The Group continues to explore opportunities to enhance and diversify its funding sources in the current capital market conditions.
A rigorous counterparty evaluation process is maintained.
Treasury and risk management The Groups Treasury function seeks to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group, to invest cash assets safely and profitably and reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups Treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
The Groups exposure to and management of capital, liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risk are summarised below.
Further detail can be found in note 16 of the accounts.
Capital risk The Groups objectives when managing capital defined as net debt plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising return to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
The Group manages its capital structure with respect to changes in economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group.
Business review The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 17 Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Group has committed bank facilities which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
The Groups Treasury function has a policy of optimising the level of cash in the businesses in order to minimise external borrowings.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables.
The Group has a very low credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Continued strong credit control ensured that in the year ended 30 September 2009 we did not see a deterioration in days sales outstanding.
The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be low, as the Audit Committee approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be invested with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
All counterparties must meet minimum credit rating requirements.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings.
At 30 September 2009, the Group had drawn down 460.6m 2008: 575.4m from its committed revolving credit facilities.
The Group regularly reviews forecast debt and interest rates to monitor this risk.
Interest rates on a portion of debt are fixed when management decide this is appropriate.
During the year 93.8m of debt was fixed at an average interest rate of 1.70% excluding margin until 30 April 2012.
At 30 September 2009, all remaining outstanding debt was held at variable rates.
Foreign currency risk Although a substantial proportion of the Groups revenue and profit is earned outside the UK, subsidiaries generally only trade in their own currency.
The Group is therefore not subject to any significant foreign exchange transactional exposure.
The Groups principal exposure to foreign currency, therefore, lies in the translation of overseas profits into Sterling.
This exposure is partly hedged to the extent that these profits are offset by interest charges in the same currency arising from the financing of the investment cost of overseas acquisitions by borrowings in the same currency.
Surplus cash generated by the Groups principal overseas subsidiaries is used to repay debt in the same currencies to provide a further natural hedge.
The Group has US Dollar, Euro and Swiss Franc denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries in the US, France, Spain, Germany and Switzerland.
The foreign exchange on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in exchange reserves.
The Groups other currency exposures comprise only those exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures reflect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 30 September 2009 and 30 September 2008, these exposures were immaterial to the Group.
Going concern Based on normal business planning and control procedures, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
