Operating profit was 66 million 2008: 86 million mainly as a result of higher exceptional items of 117 million 2008: 92 million.
An 11 million increase in exceptional restructuring costs was due to the continuing implementation of our Programme for Growth 2008: 84 million.
Exceptional costs on disposals of 22 million were also higher 2008: 8 million.
Following the decision to exit the lower margin payroll processing business in the Benelux region, the results of this business and the revaluation of the related assets to fair value less disposal costs have been classified as exceptional.
As a result of this, we have incurred a 19 million charge on the planned disposal.
Amortisation of intangible assets from acquisitions was 89 million 2008: 89 million.

23 Business Review Financial review Outsourcing Services continued As expected, strong growth in Outsourcing Services continued to compensate for the lower revenue in consulting and professional services.
Outsourcing revenue was up 9% to 1,380 million and represented 37% of Group revenue, well ahead of the Group target of 35%.
Outsourcing revenue accounted for more than 20% of revenue in all geographies in 2009, with the UK continuing to be the geography with the highest percentage of revenue from Outsourcing.
Our strongest growth was in AM and BPO, up 10% and 70% respectively on the back of good wins in 2008.
BPO accounted for 9% of total Outsourcing revenue, up from 6% in 2008.
Adjusted operating profit was 96 million 2008: 84 million, giving an adjusted operating margin of 6.9% 2008: 6.7%.
The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to tight control of the cost base, increased efficiency and further transition of activities offshore.
Book to bill for the period was 124% 2008: 112%.
Continued investments in sales and marketing resulted in an increased order backlog, up 16%.
In the Nordics, orders were up 8%, with our first half win at TeliaSonera being the most significant contributor to 2009 growth.
Major wins with the Police National Database in the first half and with the Crown Prosecution Service in the second half contributed to order growth of 16% in the UK in 2009.
France had the strongest performance on orders in the second half, with Q3 wins at the French Ministry of Finance ONP build and run of payroll services and the European Parliament.
Other new orders signed in the second half of the year included a BPO win with Nordic pensions manager SPP as well as extensions of AM work with a number of existing clients.
We also recorded a 29 million, 13-year BPO win with the Slovakia National Highways Authority for performance evaluation and auditing of a new national road pricing system, building on our Intelligent Transport Systems expertise.
Since the end of 2009, we have signed a five-year deal to be a strategic outsourcing partner to communications and logistics provider Posten Norden formed through the merger of Post Danmark A S and Posten AB.
We will be providing application management and development for SAP and other applications for 47,500 users in the Posten Norden group.
Under the terms of the contract, around 280 of Posten Norden employees in Sweden and Denmark will transfer to Logica.
Logica will also take over the responsibility for subcontractors equal to about 150 full-time consultants.

Revenue was down 2% on a pro forma basis to 1,032 million.
Sweden represented 49% of Nordic revenue in 2009 2008: 54%.
Adjusted operating profit was 84 million, giving an adjusted operating margin of 8.2%.
The Finnish business delivered another strong performance on revenue, with revenue up 3% outperforming a weak GDP.
This was offset by the continued weakness in Sweden where continued pricing pressure and reduced investments by clients in consulting and professional services projects resulted in an overall revenue decline of 6%.
The TeliaSonera win recorded in the first half contributed to strong growth in the Telecoms and Media sector.
The percentage of revenue from Outsourcing increased across all geographies in the Nordics.
Despite a difficult Swedish market, cost control on discretionary spend and headcount reductions contributed to improvements in Swedish margin in the second half.
A good performance in Finland and Denmark contributed to the margin in the Nordics continuing to be over 8%.
Book to bill for the period was 120% 2008: 112%.
Orders were up 4%, with the strongest order growth in Sweden.
In addition to several new wins in the Telecoms sector, we were also selected by SPP, one of the leading companies in the occupational pensions market in Sweden to introduce a new pension management system for Swedish municipalities combined with a 10-year BPO contract.
Despite a tough comparative, the backlog in Finland continues to be healthy with good wins across a number of sectors in 2009.
In Norway, we announced a win for a clinical portal for four Oslo hospitals with South-Eastern Norwegian Regional Health Authority Helse Srst.
We have seen growth in the pipeline in all countries in the Nordics.

Revenue was down 2% on a pro forma basis to 791 million.
Adjusted operating profit was 60 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 7.5%.
The French business continued to deliver strong growth in Outsourcing, with Outsourcing revenue up 19% over 2008.
This has offset weakness in consulting as clients postponed discretionary projects.
The revenue decrease in Financial Services and IDT was partially offset by 4% growth in our other sectors, driven by good demand in Energy and Utilities as well as the Public Sector.
Public Sector wins with the European Parliament and ONP contributed to particularly good fourth quarter growth.
The actions taken in the first half to improve utilisation, focus on cost management and reduce the level of subcontractors led to a stabilisation in the adjusted operating margin for the year.
Book to bill for the period was 140% 2008: 104%.
Order intake was strong, up 32% over 2008, with new orders signed with two of our key accounts in the fourth quarter.
We began to see an increase in opportunities in the Industry sector in the second half.
We won an outsourcing project for an SAP transformation at a luxury retailer and extensions of work with existing clients.
We increased our recruiting efforts through the fourth quarter to meet an increased backlog coming into 2010.

The UK business had the strongest revenue growth of all our businesses in 2009, with revenue up 6% on a pro forma basis to 750 million.
Adjusted operating profit for the year was 64 million, resulting in a significant improvement in adjusted operating margin to 8.5%.
Revenue from Outsourcing continues to grow as a proportion of the UK business, and accounts for just under half of total UK revenue.
The Public Sector was up 13% and accounted for 62% of UK revenue in 2009.
Energy and Utilities was down in the second half following a strong first half and a tough 2008 comparative.
Revenue in the commercial sectors overall declined as a result of continued pressure on mid-sized project and consulting work, despite a significant increase in Telecoms and Media.
The strong improvement in adjusted operating margin was due to the annualised savings delivered from the Programme for Growth, continued tight control on discretionary spend as well as direct costs, including a reduction in the number of subcontractors.
Book to bill for the period was 100% 2008: 99%.
Order intake has increased by 6%, with particularly strong Outsourcing order growth in the Public Sector.
We have increased the volume of work with existing clients such as Polaris in the commercial sector and clients such as the Crown Prosecution Service in the Public Sector.
We also secured an important transport win in the third quarter to design, build and support major components of Transport for Londons cycle hire scheme in conjunction with Serco.
The pipeline at the beginning of 2010 is up 20% on the beginning of 2009, with significant increases in the pipeline of opportunities in transport as well as utilities.
New capital spending programmes at utilities are expected to drive opportunities through the second half of 2010.

Revenue was down 18% on a pro forma basis to 574 million.
Adjusted operating profit was 24 million, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 4.2%.
2009 was a very disappointing year for our Benelux business.
This market is heavily weighted towards short-term consulting and professional services assignments which were affected by the economic downturn.
We saw a revenue decline across all sectors, with Financial Services and IDT the weakest performers on the back of volume and price reductions agreed in the first half.
We have taken further action to scale back our direct costs in order to create a stronger organisation and to align with lower demand.
We have also commenced the process of divesting of part of our Dutch payroll processing business which had been incurring losses.
We enter 2010 with a significantly lower cost base, as a result of a reduction in overall headcount down by 15% over 2008 as well as in the level of subcontractors.
We have also started to see modest improvements in the utilisation levels.

In the Rest of World, Australia was the strongest performer.
Market deregulation and compliance programmes around advanced metering contributed to growth in the Energy and Utilities sector while our win with Australian Government criminal justice agency, CrimTrac, to deliver, operate and manage the organisations ICT infrastructure contributed to growth in the Public Sector.
The strong improvement in adjusted operating margin was due to the continued actions to reduce costs including the use of shortterm working.
Book to bill for the period was 107% 2008: 102%, with the larger countries within the International cluster all having delivered book to bill above 100%.
Orders were up significantly in the fourth quarter and the pipeline outside Europe remains particularly strong.
