First, we try to get to know a target managed by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any company, often working in joint venture, to understand the one institution by reference to their credit rating and by regular operational and cultural differences and potential synergies.
This is followed by a robust due diligence process, most of which is undertaken by our own managers, and we then develop a clear integration plan which takes account of the James Hind unique character of the target company.

Technical risk It is in the nature of our business that we continually assess and manage technical, and other operational, risks.
The controls we have in place, particularly at the crucial stage of bidding for contracts, is set out in the Internal Control section of our Corporate Governance Report.
Given the Groups relatively small average contract value less than 200,000, it is unlikely that any one contract is able to materially affect the results of the Group.
Our ability to manage technical risks will generally be reflected in our profitability.
People The risk of losing, or not being able to attract, good people is key.
We pride ourselves in having some of the best professional and skilled people in the industry, who are motivated by our culture and the opportunities for career growth.
The approach to training and developing employees is discussed in our Social Responsibility Report.
