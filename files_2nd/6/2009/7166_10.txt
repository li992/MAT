Directors Report Business Review Financial Review The performance of the Group has been impacted by deteriorating conditions in all our markets, particularly in the second half of the year.
Group turnover decreased by 4%, net fees decreased by 15% declining by 18% on a like-for-like basis, and operating profit decreased by 38% 40% on a like-for-like basis.
The results benefited from exchange rate movements, principally the Euro and Australian Dollar, which increased net fees by 34.7 million and operating profit by 9.5 million.
The Group experienced much tougher market conditions in the second half of the year compared to the first half.
As a result, net fees fell from 383.7 million in the first half to 287.1 million in the second half and operating profit fell from 105.1 million to 52.9 million.
Net fees in the permanent business, representing 44% of Group net fees, declined by 29%, with permanent placement volumes decreasing by 35% as a result of difficult market conditions across all of our permanent placement markets.
Average fees per placement increased by 8% compared to last year, due to a favourable change in mix.
The temporary placement business, representing 56% of Group net fees, was more resilient with net fees decreasing by 7%.
This represented a volume decrease of 6%, and a 10 basis point decrease in the underlying temporary margin to 16.8% 2008: Paul Venables 16.9%.
The temporary placement business achieved growth Group Finance Director in the first half of the year, but volumes fell in the second half as demand weakened.
The relative resilience of the temporary placement business, against such a difficult economic backdrop, highlights the advantage of having leading positions in both permanent and temporary placement markets.
