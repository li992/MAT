Premiums Gross premiums written have increased in 2009 by 27% to 1,115.5m.
A number of factors have contributed to this increase: primarily the deployment of new capital enabling organic growth at constant currency rates and the impact of the acquisitions of First State and Momentum Underwriting 12%, with the remaining 15% of growth arising as a result of a relatively strong US dollar in 2009.
As anticipated, premium rates were up overall by 3% in 2009 driven by increases in our catastrophe exposed accounts following the 2008 hurricane activity.

Our accident and life business has made a strong start writing 43.2m and First State, now part of our US commercial property team, wrote $93.9m.
In 2009 we also took advantage of the rating environment in a number of catastrophe lines of business such that overall, our short tail lines premium increased from 46% to 52%.
Locally underwritten US business has continued to grow from $269.1m in 2008 to $370.7m in 2009.
Beazleys geographic reach has been further extended following the first full year of trading for our Munich and Brisbane offices, alongside the successful establishment of Beazley Re in Dublin.
Diversification and maintaining a balanced portfolio of business by risk type, size and source remains an important approach to the continued delivery of consistent underwriting profit.
The charts above highlight how we achieve diversification by product mix, geography and type of business.
Premium retention rates Retention of business from existing brokers and clients is a key feature of Beazleys strategy.
It not only enables us to maintain a deep understanding of our clients businesses and requirements it also provides greater insight into the risks involved in each policy we write, enabling us to price risk most accurately to achieve profit.
The table below shows our retention rates by division compared to 2008.
Retention rates 2009 2008 Marine 74% 82% Political risks and contingency 64% 63% Property 76% 72% Reinsurance 90% 90% Specialty lines 83% 88% Overall 80% 79% based on premiums due for renewal in each calendar year Beazley Annual Report 2009 33 Financial review | group performance continued Cumulative renewal rate changes since 2001 % 220 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 Underwriting year Marine Political risk and contingency Property Reinsurance Specialty lines All departments Rating environment Overall rates charged for business we renewed increased by 3% during 2009 2008: a reduction of 6%.
Significant rate increases were achieved by our catastrophe exposed lines of business following the hurricane activity of 2008.
This is particularly evident for rates within our energy business 27% increase, catastrophe reinsurance business 8% increase and commercial property business 9% increase.
The benign catastrophe claims environment of 2009 and the increased capacity of reinsurers arising from retained profits is expected to cause a modest reduction in rates for these lines of business in 2010.
Our specialty lines division has seen rates reduce overall by 1% in 2009 and has been subject to a number of conflicting market pressures.
At the beginning of the year the expectation was that low investment returns and a reduction in available capital along with an active attempt by policyholders to diversify their exposure would create a positive rating environment.
However, an aggressive pricing strategy by large US casualty carriers in an attempt to defend their portfolios countered the upward pressure on premium rates.
This was coupled with a strong recovery in investment markets to some extent relieving the pressure on underwriting margins.
Looking forward we believe there is still significant downside risk within investment markets with interest rates set to remain low in the short term and this, alongside reduced or negative underwriting margins for aggressively priced business by market participants, will lead to a rating improvement in 2010.
Reinsurance purchased The group increased the amount it spent on reinsurance in 2009 to 267.5m 2008: 135.3m.
Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: to enable the group to write large or lead lines on risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
The value of reinsurance purchased in 2009 has increased due to three main factors: the devaluation of sterling against the US dollar.
A large proportion of our reinsurance programme is in US dollars and we estimate the impact of retranslating 2008 reinsurance premium at 2009 exchange rates would result in an uplift of 13.2%: the inclusion of the First State reinsurance programme estimated impact 25.6m : and additional reinsurance cover in our specialty lines surplus reinsurance programme where we have increased cover by lowering the amount of any loss retained by Beazley.
Looking ahead to 2010 our initial experience based on 1st January renewals is that market conditions have improved slightly, both in terms of moderate rate reductions, and in the terms and conditions available.
com Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a common measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims to total premium income.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a laudable aim for an insurer and Beazleys combined ratio has held steady at 90% for the fourth consecutive financial year.
It is worth pointing out that the calculation of the combined ratio for Beazley includes all claims and other costs to the group but excludes foreign exchange effects.
We believe this represents the most transparent and useful measure of operating performance as it ensures that all of the costs of being in business are captured, whether directly linked to underwriting activity or not.
Claims On the whole 2009 has been a relatively benign year for claims.
There were no significant catastrophe losses occurring in the year.
In keeping with Beazleys reserving philosophy we will not start to release catastrophe margins for the 2009 underwriting year until mid 2010.
The high volumes of claims within liability classes of business that many people predicted would occur as a result of the global recession have not materialised.
Initially, 2009 saw claims frequency increase in a small number of specialty classes, notably EPL.
Underwriting actions were taken to address this increase and we continue to monitor the impact of the recession and the economic downturn on our reserves.
Overall, the cost of claims remains within our expectations and this is testament to the diverse nature of Beazleys risk portfolio alongside the dedicated claims management capability within underwriting teams.
Political risk losses As noted in our 2009 interim report and Q3 interim management statement, the business environment for our political risks team has been challenging.
Throughout the course of the year we continued to see an increased number of claims on the political risks portfolio, resulting from exposure to trade finance losses and failed financial institutions in developing economies.
The impact on profit of these losses in 2009 has been 33m.
Beazley Annual Report 2009 35 Financial review | group performance continued Surplus in net reserves 10 5 0 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 Financial year 2008 hurricanes Losses arising from the 2008 US hurricanes developed much as expected in 2009.
Of the reserves we established at 31 December 2008 for hurricanes Ike and Gustav we released 1.0m during the year.
Reserve releases Beazley has a conservative reserving philosophy with initial reserves being set to include prudent margins which may be released consistently over time as and when the uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range 5-10% above the actuarial best estimate.
Reserve monitoring is performed on a quarterly basis and involves a consultative process between the underwriters who take a detailed claim by claim view, and the actuarial team who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
The overall reserve strength has increased moderately due to the prudent position taken on the political risks and contingency account.
During 2009 we were able to make the following prior year reserve adjustments across divisions, with the overall net impact being a release to the group.
2009 2008 m m Marine 15.9 12.8 Political risks and contingency 2.2 11.6 Property 4.2 3.8 Reinsurance 16.5 16.6 Specialty lines 36.8 28.0 Total 67.2 72.8 Releases as a percentage of net earned premiums 8.0% 10.7% Reserve releases increased on specialty lines reflecting the continuing satisfactory development of the significant volumes of business underwritten between 2003-2006.
The releases in 2009 came mainly from the 2004 and 2005 underwriting years, which seem, at this stage, to be following the profitable outcomes already experienced in the 2002 and 2003 years.
The property account was affected by an adverse development on a large engineering claim and, as we have highlighted, the political risk and contingency releases were lower than previous years, as part of the increased claims provision on our trade credit book impacts prior years.
Expenses Total expenses, including business acquisition and administrative costs, increased to 300.9m from 237.3m in 2008.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2009 2008 m m Brokerage costs 171.2 148.9 Other acquisition costs 47.0 33.7 Total acquisition costs 218.2 182.6 Administrative costs 82.7 54.7 Total costs 300.9 237.3 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premium they are down slightly from 22% to 20%.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with accounting guidelines.
com % above actuarial best estimate Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity e. g. underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
They have increased in 2009 due to the addition of new underwriting teams First State, accident and life.
Administrative costs comprise primarily IT costs, facilities costs, Lloyds central costs and other support costs.
These increased in 2009 primarily as a result of the increase in staff bonus costs in line with increased profitability, an increase in charges levied by Lloyds arising from increased premiums, and non-capitalised transaction costs associated with the rights issue, acquisition of First State and redomiciliation to Ireland.
Investment performance Following a tumultuous 2008 and a difficult first quarter, global financial markets stabilised and rallied during the subsequent part of 2009, resulting in the group achieving an investment profit for the year of 56.1m, or a return of 2.7%.
The Falcon leadership team has worked during 2009 to establish Falcon Money Management Ltd Falcon, an associate firm providing investment management services.
Falcon is an FSA authorised investment management firm, comprising 12 highly experienced investment professionals.
Falcon is aiming to enhance our investment returns whilst at the same time minimising risk.
Initially, investment management and advisory services will be offered solely to Beazley and only at a later stage to third party institutional investors.
Falcons approach to managing the assets will be to hold the bulk 80-90%, in a core portfolio of sovereign fixed income assets, or very short duration high quality credit.
The mean duration of the portfolio is restricted to that of Beazleys insurance liabilities.
The balance will be invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative assets.
Falcons benchmark is to deliver an absolute return equal to T-bills plus a margin which depends upon the capital growth asset allocation.
During April 2009, Beazley commenced a fide-risking programme to reduce the credit exposure in its portfolios and to increase the share of highly liquid and  investments.
Towards the end of the year, we selectively increased our allocation to capital growth strategies, via investments in alternative assets.
At 31 December 2009 the weighted average duration of our core portfolio was 8 months 31 December 2008: 9 months.
The weighted average yield to maturity of our overall portfolio was 0.7% 31 December 2008: 3.4%.
Our portfolio duration is currently short to protect against a sudden rise in interest rates.
As a result, the outlook for next year remains challenging with interest rates close to all time lows.

This volatility is impossible to hedge, causing significant impact on the headline profit before tax.
At the reporting date unearned premiums and deferred acquisition costs the non-monetary items are held on the groups balance sheet and will be earned over the life of the policy extending into future reporting periods.
Around 90% of the groups premium is non-sterling denominated and the non-monetary items arising on this premium are required to be reflected at historic exchange rates, while the corresponding monetary items associated with the same risks such as cash received and claims reserves held are held at the closing exchange rate.
To the extent that the historic and closing exchange rates differ when applied to these balances, an exchange gain or loss will be reflected in the income statement.
This gain or loss will unwind in the subsequent accounting period as the non-monetary balances earn through to the income statement.
The net impact of this effect over time is nil, but the income statements of two adjacent accounting periods can be distorted, as reflected by the large swings in foreign exchange gains losses in 2008 and 2009.
The loss of 46.6m recorded in 2009 is largely due to the unwinding of the 46.2m profit which arose in 2008 when the US dollar strengthened 28% and is not materially impacted by exchange rate movements during 2009.
For this reason the group has, since the introduction of IFRS in 2005, sought to report this effect in as transparent a manner as possible by splitting out the impact on the face of the income statement.
The underlying profit after the notional adjustment for the effect of FX on non-monetary items is a better reflection of performance.
Tax As announced early in 2009, the group has established a new parent company Beazley plc and reinsurer Beazley Re that are tax resident in the Republic of Ireland.
This is expected to reduce the ongoing tax rate incurred by the group to around 18%.
The tax rate for 2009 was 12% which is lower than 18% due to the one off revaluation of deferred tax balances that were previously provided for at the higher UK rate of 28%.
