Group Finance Directors report Results Against a difficult macro economic backdrop the Group has recorded another very satisfactory set of financial results.
Total Group revenues increased by 4.6% to 435.7m.
Although underlying like-for-like sales were down 2% for the year, this was more than offset by the full year impact of openings in 2008 and a part year effect of the 19 new sites opened in 2009.
Group adjusted EBITDA was 79.6m, an increase of 2.8% on the prior year.
After adding back the non-cash share-based Adjusted post tax profits payment charge of 2.1m 2008: 1.9m, total EBITDA in the year was 81.7m 2008: 79.4m.
After depreciation charges of 34.5m were up 5% on in the year totalling 26.3m 2008: 23.3m, Group adjusted the prior year resulting in operating profit for the year was 53.4m 2008: 54.2m.
This represents a slightly reduced operating margin of 12.2% an adjusted EPS of 17.48p, 2008: 13.0%.
However, this outcome was considerably better than anticipated earlier in the year, and has resulted a 5% increase.
from a diligent focus on costs and efficiencies across the business throughout the year.
Adjusted net interest costs in the year were 3.3m, a 37% reduction compared to 2008.
This reflects lower average debt during the year and lower interest rates on the unhedged portion of the Groups debt.
Total adjusted Group profit before tax was 50.0m, a 2.3% increase on the prior year.
After taking into account a lower average tax rate as discussed later in this report, adjusted post tax profits of 34.5m were up 5% on the prior year resulting in an adjusted EPS of 17.48p, a 5% increase.
Cost Inflation During 2009 the Group successfully absorbed significant upward cost pressure on wages, food and beverage input costs, and utility costs.
Wage costs in particular were affected by the October 2008 increase of 3.8% in national minimum wage, as well as changes to the statutory holiday pay regime which came into effect in April 2009.
The outlook for 2010 in terms of cost inflation is significantly more benign: national minimum wage only increased by 1.2% in October 2009: we expect overall food and beverage cost inflation to be less in 2010 than in 2009: rent increases are running at much lower levels than we have seen historically: utility costs are currently running at about the same level as last year and we expect these to reduce with effect from the final quarter of the year.
We estimate that total sales growth of 2% to 3% would be sufficient to offset these cost increases.
After nine weeks 12 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements Year end Year end total sales were up over 6%, more than double the level 2008 Opened Closed 2009 of growth necessary to cover the expected levels of cost inflation outlined above.
