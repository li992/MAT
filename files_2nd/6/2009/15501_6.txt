BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW OVERVIEW Revenues of 278.3m 2008: 186.5m were 49% higher than in the previous financial year to 31 March 2008.
The pre-tax profit was 22.5m 2008: 16.8m, and we saw a net cash inflow from operating activities of 9.1m.
Overall, our year-end net cash position reduced slightly to 25.4m.
The increase in turnover to 278.3m was primarily due to the 34% increase in the number of services we are providing compared with the previous year, combined with the impact of higher retail energy prices.
This was partially offset by a reduction in our fixed monthly line rental charges last autumn.
The overall gross profit margin fell slightly during the year to 18.6% 2008: 19.3%, reflecting the increasing proportion of our turnover which now derives from supplying energy, partially offset by higher margins from each of the individual services we provide.
The increase at the operating profit level was primarily due to the rise in the number of services we are providing, combined with the impact of higher energy prices and improving economies of scale, although our bad debt charge rose to 7.2m 2008: 3.1m due to a combination of significantly higher turnover and a more difficult economic climate.
Earnings per share increased by 37% to 24.2p 2008: 17.7p and the Company is therefore proposing a final dividend of 12.5p 2008: 10p per share, making a total dividend of 17.5p 2008: 14p per share for the year: a 25% increase.
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS Our customer management business experienced significant growth during the year, with the rate accelerating with each passing quarter: Net growth in number of services provided Quarter to 30 06 08 26,339 Quarter to 30 09 08 41,204 Quarter to 31 12 08 64,902 Quarter to 31 03 09 69,692 This growth has been driven by the significant increase in new Distributor recruitment over the last 12 months, mainly due to the attractiveness of this predominantly part-time income opportunity in a recessionary economic climate, supported by rising confidence in the financial strength of the Company, the value we offer, and the quality of our customer service.
We saw particularly strong growth in the number of gas and electricity services we supply.
This was largely responsible for the increase of almost 50% in our revenues for the year, although we also experienced high levels of demand from new customers for our broadband and fixed telephony services on the back of our Best Buy recommendation in Which?

This is mainly due to the costs associated with the significant increase in the number of new customers, such as third-party connection charges, Distributor bonuses and the provision of hardware e. g. mobile handsets and broadband routers.
31.9 29.7 Between October 2007 and February 2009 we offered a BroadCall Laptop tariff, under which customers were provided with a free laptop in return for entering into a two-year service agreement on a premium tariff.
The cost of supplying these laptops has been capitalised and is being amortised against the profits we earn from supplying their 12.9 10.6 10.8 10.2 broadband service over the minimum contract term.
The amount included on the balance sheet at 31 March 2009 in 9.2 7.8 respect of these laptops was 1.3m 2008: 0.6m : all other customer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Although this tariff is no longer available for new customers, those already benefiting from it are able to continue using this service for as long as they choose.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution costs, which primarily represent the share of our revenues which we pay as commission to Distributors, increased by 3.1m to 11.7m 2008: 8.6m : this reflects the substantial growth in turnover during the year.
Administration expenses have remained constant at around 7.2% of turnover, notwithstanding an increase in bad debts due to a combination of higher revenues and a more difficult economic climate.
Personnel expenses increased to 11.6m 2008: 8.9m as we continue to build our customer service and administration resources to support the significant increase in the number of services we are providing.
Property costs have also increased following our acquisition of additional freehold office premises at the end of September and our move to new leasehold warehouse premises in November.
SHARE OPTION COSTS The operating profit is stated after share option expenses of 454,000 2008: 54,000.
These expenses relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 'Share based payments'.
18 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS BUSINESS TAXATION The amount of corporation tax payable in respect of the year is 7.0m 2008: 5.1m.
The effective tax rate for the year is 28.0% 2008: 28.7%.
TREASURY SHARES At the start of the year, the Company held 2,879,868 shares in treasury following the successful share repurchase programme which had been in operation the previous year.
During the year, 586,093 of these shares were used to satisfy exercises under the Companys two share option plans, and 1,500,000 were issued for cash in February 2009 to provide additional working capital, leaving a balance in treasury of 793,775 shares at 31 March 2009.
CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET Underlying cash flow remains strong, with net cash generated from operating activities of 9.1m 2008: 15.3m notwithstanding the significant organic growth we achieved during the year.
The primary reason for this reduction of 6.2m compared with last year is the impact on customer Budget Plan balances of the exceptionally cold weather this winter.
Overall cash outflows were partially offset by the 4.7m proceeds from the sale of Treasury Shares in February 2009.
Budget Plan customers spread the cost of their expected annual energy consumption into 12 equal monthly instalments.
As a high proportion of each customers annual energy consumption is used during the winter period, this means that our energy debtors reach a peak at the end of each winter before falling as we move through the spring and summer months.
Winter this year was much colder than usual following average winter temperatures in 2008, which has led to an increase in the gross energy Budget Plan debtor balance of 14.1m included within prepayments and accrued income compared with the position at the end of March 2008.
This adverse movement was exacerbated by the higher retail energy prices which applied this winter, compared with the corresponding period the previous year.
We purchased a freehold office building during the year at a cost including refurbishment of around 10m, which has been funded from our existing cash resources.
The Group does not have a policy with respect to interest rate management as it currently has no debt funding requirements.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank plc at money market rates to maximise returns, after allowing for the Companys working capital requirements.
