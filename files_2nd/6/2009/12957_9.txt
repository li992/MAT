01-20 Achievements R 3 25 10 8:38 AM Page 13 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K FINANCIAL REVIEW Profit increased by 79% Dividend increased for the fourth year in a row Substantial capital appreciation for shareholders Total revenue for the group of US$432.8 million increased by 28% on the previous year on the back of a 14% increase in attributable production of 488 255 ounces and a 12% higher average gold price received of US$886 per ounce.
Profit for the year was US$84.3 million, an increase of 79% compared to the previous year.
Higher revenues were partially offset by higher mining costs at Loulo, primarily due to increased open pit mining costs resulting from deepening pits, revised mining rates and the introduction of a second mining contractor at the site, necessitated in part by the slower build up in tonnes from the underground mine.
Costs at both operations were also impacted by the increased royalties payable resulting from the higher average gold price received and general cost increases in reagents, other consumables and duties, following the end of the exoneration period at Loulo in November 2008.
Profit was also impacted by a further provision of US$9.6 million against investments in auction rate securities.
Basic earnings per share of 86 cents increased by 59% from the previous year, not withstanding an increase in the number of shares outstanding.
Cash operating costs for the group were US$458 per ounce, up from US$421 per ounce in 2008.
Total cash costs for the group, which include royalties, were US$510 per ounce for the year compared to US$467 per ounce in 2008.
Cash operating costs per ounce remained in line at Loulo, following increased grades and production.
At Morila the mine was converted to a stockpile treatment operation in April.
The consequent impact of processing lower grade ore and adverse stockpile adjustments had a material impact on the mines reported cash costs, which increased by 22%.
Grades at Morila decreased from 3.4g t in 2008 to 2.7g t, while Loulos grade increased to 4.2g t 2008: 3.23g t. Expenditure on exploration and corporate costs increased by US$6.0 million.
Extensive drilling programmes were undertaken on the groups exploration targets, especially at the Massawa prefeasibility project in Senegal now at feasibility stage and the Gounkoto prefeasibility project in Mali.
Since the company was listed in 1997, it has discovered over 23 million reserve ounces which, when divided by the exploration and corporate costs over this period, equates to less than US$14 per ounce of gold.
This calculation does not include the Kibali reserve ounces as stated at the date of the Moto acquisition.
Morilas five year corporate tax holiday ended in November 2005 and the accounts include a charge of US$21.5 million for the tax payable compared to RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 14 Composite 01-20 Achievements R 3 25 10 8:38 AM Page 14 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K US$24.6 million the previous year.
Loulo continues to benefit from exoneration from corporate tax for five years from the date of first commercial production, which was 8 November 2005, as should Tongon upon commencement of production.
Graham Shuttleworth - Financial director and chief financial officer The companys cash position is very healthy with US$589.7 million of cash 2008: US$257.6 million on the balance sheet, and borrowings of US$4.2 million 2007: US$5.8 million, boosted by strong operating cashflows and the successful equity placing and Moto Goldmines Limited Moto transactions described below.
Net cash has remained at a significant level despite the substantial expenditure on capital, exploration and corporate costs.
US$196.7 million was spent on capital projects, US$74 million at Loulo, primarily on the development of the underground project, including the development of the twin declines, as well as upgrades to the crushing plant and expenditure on the overland conveyor and power plant expansion.
Expenditure related to the Tongon project amounted to US$120 million and consists primarily of payments for the mills, crushers and fleet, as well as site establishment costs, infrastructure improvements, earthworks, design and engineering and advanced grade drilling.
As reported in the 2008 accounts, the company is invested in a portfolio of auction rate securities ARS which, following a further provision of US$9.6 million during the year, now has a carrying value of US$29.0 million and is disclosed in non-current available for sale financial assets.
The provisions have been made as a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit ratings of the collateral of certain of the ARS, and management estimates the fair value of these investments at each reporting period using a mark to model valuation method.
As previously indicated, the company has started arbitration proceedings against the individual brokers and the investment bank who sold these products, on the grounds of what it believes to be fraud through material misrepresentation of the nature of these investments.
Arbitration of these proceedings is expected to be concluded by the middle of 2010.
There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its actions against the individual brokers or the investment bank, and consequently it has not relied upon this for the determination of the provision.
Property, plant and equipment increased significantly year on year as highlighted above.
The decrease in the deferred tax asset US$1.3 million, as well as the decrease in long term ore stockpiles US$14.7 million over the year, is due to the decrease in stockpiles at Morila following the conversion from open pit mining to stockpile processing.
The decrease in non-current receivables from December 2008 to December 2009 US$4.1 million is the result of the continued decrease in TVA and fuel duty balances at Morila.
Mineral properties of US$405.8 million at 31 December 2009 reflect the acquisition of 50% of Moto in October 2009 and the subsequent acquisition of an effective 10% of the issued share capital in Kibali Goldmines SPRL, resulting in an effective interest in the Kibali project of 45%.
Non-current available-for-sale financial assets consist of the ARS as discussed above.
Current available-for-sale financial assets represent an investment in 20 million Volta Resources Inc shares valued at US$16 million and our 50% share of 7.9 million shares in Kilo Goldmines Ltd valued at US$1.8 million.
RANDGOLD RESOURCES | ANNUAL REPORT 2009 15 Composite 01-20 Achievements R 3 25 10 8:38 AM Page 15 C M Y CM MY CY CMY K The shares in Volta Resources were acquired as part of the consideration received for the sale of the Kiaka project in Burkina Faso to Volta Resources while the shares in Kilo Goldmines were acquired as part of the Moto acquisition.
The increase in current inventories and ore stockpiles of US$27.3 million is due to an increase in supplies and insurance spares at Loulo, due to increased demand for mining strategic stocks, reagents and grinding media resulting from the development of the underground mines, as well as an increase in stockpiles at Loulo during the year in line with the mine plan.
The increase in short term receivables of US$74.3 million from 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2009 is primarily due to an increase in TVA balances at Loulo following the end of the exoneration period on 8 November 2008 US$36.8 million increase, as well as advances made to contractors at Loulo.
The gold receivable at Loulo at 31 December 2009 also increased by US$8.5 million from the previous year, due to the timing of the receipt of funds from the sale of gold.
The increase in receivables also include an amount owed by AngloGold Ashanti Limited of US$5 million at year end following the Moto acquisition and subsequent additional 20% Kibali acquisition.
US$3.7 million of deferred cash consideration in respect of the sale of the Kiaka project is also included in receivables.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents US$332.1 million is the result of the successful equity raising in August 2009 where 5.75 million shares were issued to shareholders, raising US$329.7 million after underwriting commission and expenses.
The acquisition of the Moto group in October 2009 lead to a net cash increase of US$171 million Refer to note 30 of the financial statements for disclosure on the acquisitions made.
The acquisition of a further effective 10% of the issued share capital in Kibali partially offset these with a net cash outflow of TOP 10 STOXX EUROPE 600 PRICE INDEX US$57 million.
The group also produced strong MEMBERS OVER 10 YEARS cashflows from operations US$63.7 million which were offset by significant investments in 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2009 property, plant and equipment, mostly related to % the development of the Loulo underground and 5 000 Tongon mines, as previously reported.

Accounts payable also include an amount of US$5 million relating to our share of the new joint venture asset leasing companys payables as at 31 December 2009.
The current tax payable balance of US$3.6 million at 31 December 2009 is lower than the balance at 31 December 2008 as a result of the lower profits from mining at Morila during the current year, following the conversion of the mine to a stockpile treatment operation.
Looking forward to 2010, notwithstanding the additional non-cash adjustments relating to the Morila stockpiles, total cash costs per ounce for the group are forecast to be less than US$500 per ounce, depending on the actual oil price and euro dollar exchange rates, which movements have a significant impact on operating costs.
Capital expenditure at Loulo for this year is estimated at US$65 million, the largest part being expended on the development of the Gara underground mine.
The development of the Tongon project is now well underway and capital expenditure in this regard is anticipated to be US$155 million in 2010, including preproduction expenses but excluding the fleet.
The group also anticipates significant capital expenditure at its Kibali project US$20 million, Massawa project US$10 million and Gounkoto project US$10 million assuming a successful prefeasibility study is completed at this project by the end of the first quarter.
Based on current forecasts, the group has sufficient cash resources to fund all its existing capital projects and ongoing exploration programmes.
In view of the significant profit increase, strong cash flows from operations and the companys robust balance sheet, the board again decided to declare an increased annual dividend of 17 cents per share US$15 million representing a 30% increase on the previous year.
Shareholders have also enjoyed substantial capital appreciation in the year with the share price rising 80% from US$43.92 to US$79.14.
