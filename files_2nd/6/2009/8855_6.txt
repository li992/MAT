BUSINESS REVIEW John Sheldrick Group Finance Director Financial Review Introduction In the financial year to 31st March 2009, Johnson Mattheys revenue rose by 5% to 7.8 billion and sales excluding the value of precious metals increased by 3% to 1.8 billion.
Underlying profit before tax before amortisation of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges was up 1% at 267.9 million.
Underlying earnings per share increased by 0.1 pence to 89.6 pence.
Market conditions changed significantly during the year.
In the first six months revenue increased by 24% and underlying profit before tax rose by 20%.
Environmental Technologies Division and Precious Metal Products Division both achieved double digit growth in sales and operating profit.
Although the recession had already started in North America, global car production for the first six months was unchanged from the same period in 2007 08.
Emission Control Technologies, which supplies catalysts to the automotive market, performed well with growth in new products and a good contribution from Argillon, which was acquired in February 2008.
Prices for platinum group metals were also very strong in the early part of the year, with platinum averaging $1,795 oz for the six months to 30th September 2008.
In the late summer and early autumn of 2008 car sales in many of the worlds major economies fell dramatically and have remained low since then.
Global car production in the second half of Johnson Mattheys financial year was 26% down on the same period in 2007 08.
With car producers taking action to reduce stocks, sales of autocatalysts fell by more than 30%.
Platinum group metal prices were also significantly lower with platinum averaging $952 oz for the six months to 31st March 2009.
Not all of Johnson Mattheys businesses experienced lower demand in the second half.
Process Technologies in particular achieved good growth.
Although the oil price has fallen substantially from its peak, concerns over energy security and environmental issues continued to drive demand for syngas catalysts and purification products.
The groups reported results have also benefited from sterlings weakness, particularly against the US dollar which averaged $1.50 in the second half compared with $1.93 in the first half.
