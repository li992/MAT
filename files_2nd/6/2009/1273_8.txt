Financial review... the groups financial performance and capital structure have been resilient, absorbing increased fuel costs and the recessionary impact on passenger revenue growth, whilst allowing the group to continue to win business and invest in the future.
Financial review Building a stronger base Following the groups record financial results and substantial Revenue growth in 2008, the trading environment entering 2009 was m one of general economic uncertainty, financial volatility and distress in the banking markets.
Against that backdrop, the groups financial performance and capital structure have been resilient, absorbing increased fuel costs and the recessionary 2009 3% impact on passenger revenue growth, whilst allowing the group to continue to win business and invest in the future.

We agreed a 100 million euro facility expiring in 2008 August 2012 with a new lender, to supplement the 615 million revolving credit facility expiring on the same date, and raised 3,042.2 218 million in asset-backed finance in the year.

In December 2009, agreement was reached to cap future benefit 54.5 2008 accrual in the Arriva Passenger Services Pension Plan, the largest of the groups defined benefit schemes.
The change in 52.6 benefits is required to be treated as a curtailment, resulting in the recognition of a 46.8 million exceptional credit in the income statement in 2009.
The ongoing saving to the groups pension charge will be around 5 million per annum.
The group has made an impairment charge of 32.9 million 2008: 2.5 million against the carrying value of goodwill.
The increase primarily relates to a 24 million charge in respect of our operations in Portugal, which, in light of the conditions affecting the Portuguese bus market and the likely continued abstraction of revenue by the recently extended light rail systems south of Lisbon, have been fide-scaled to a level commensurate with the changed environment.
Operating profit before goodwill impairment, intangible asset amortisation and exceptional items, our preferred internal measure, was 158.3 million 2008: 183.8 million, the reduction primarily reflecting increased fuel costs of approximately 60 million compared to 2008, and the impact of the challenging economic conditions on the CrossCountry franchise.
Operating profit in mainland Europe benefited from a stronger average euro to sterling exchange rate of 0.89 to the euro compared to 0.81 to the euro last year.
Net finance costs increased to 43.8 million from 26.2 million, Operating due to the full year impact of increased debt levels since July 2008, and higher margins paid on new debt, partially mitigated profit by the benefit of lower interbank borrowing rates.
After taking into account the profit from associates of 5.2 million 2008: 4.4 million, profit before tax decreased to 121.7 million 2008: 150.0 million.

The remaining 46 million relating to this settlement is expected to be recognised over the next few years.
The total taxation charge also includes the 13.1 million impact on deferred tax of the exceptional credit arising on changes to pension benefits noted above.
The resulting tax charge is 2.5 million, a decrease of 36.3 million compared with 2008.

This was supplemented in August 2009 by an additional 100 million facility, on similar terms, expiring on the same date, and 100 million of new loan notes in February 2010.
Much of the group's bus fleet is financed on medium-term hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, typically three to five years in length.
As part of the UK rail franchising arrangements, the group has provided guarantees of 48 million.
The rolling stock of the UK, Netherlands, Danish and German rail businesses that is provided through operating leases have annual commitments of approximately 122 million.
All material commitments will cease on expiry of the franchises.
Bonds amounting to 31 million have been provided in respect of the Netherlands, Danish and German rail businesses.

Historically, the principal sources of credit to the group have been the banking markets of the UK and mainland Europe.
Whilst this remains an important source, the group has diversified its funding sources by re-entering the US private placement market with 100 million of loan notes repayable in 2017.
The borrowings, agreed in February 2010, carry a fixed interest rate of 5.25 per cent and, significantly, enable the group to continue to access the flexible and competitively priced asset-backed finance market.
The terms of the borrowing are similar to the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility, with the addition of a priority debt covenant which sets a maximum limit on the level of priority debt compared to total assets of 30 per cent.
Priority debt encompasses asset-backed debt and unsecured net borrowings of subsidiaries that are not obligors under the revolving credit facility.
