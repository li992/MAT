18 Financial review Overview Martin Greenslade discusses this years results Martin Greenslade As we all know, this has been an exceptionally turbulent year for the global Finance Director economy and the business environment as a whole.
The UK commercial property market has certainly endured its share of very tough conditions and our financial results have been impacted signi cantly as a result, with a loss after tax of 5.2bn largely due to a revaluation fide cit of 4.7bn.
With property values suffering sharp falls, we saw our adjusted net assets decline and our gearing rise.
We ended the year with adjusted diluted net assets NAV per share of 593p, down 66.4%.
While our numbers demonstrate the challenging year we have had, they also re ect a strong and decisive response from management.
Rapidly deteriorating market conditions required us to take tough decisions, and by acting quickly we mitigated the very worst effects of the current market.
These actions included: the drawing down of our bank facilities, which ensured that funds remained available to us even if property values continued to fall: the disposal of Trillium, which, although at a loss, raised additional cash at a critical time: and the rebasing of our quarterly dividend from 14.9p per share restated to a final proposed dividend of 7.0p per share, re ecting a realistic view of the pressure on income ahead.
Through these and other actions we have achieved a substantial reduction in net debt, down 27% over the year.
The numbers also re ect the support provided by our shareholders, with the 755.7m of cash generated from the Rights Issue helping to strengthen our balance sheet.
Despite very dif cult operating conditions, we increased revenue pro t by 10.6% in the year.
This is a positive achievement, but it is unlikely to be maintained.
This years gure was driven, in part, by lower interest rates on our oating rate debt.
Interest rates will not remain at current levels inde nitely and margins will rise as and when we renew our banking facilities.
Rental income is also likely to come under downward pressure from falling rental values and voids from tenant insolvencies, lease expiries, partially let developments and pre-development properties.
And some of our actions to maintain liquidity and a sound capital base may also have a negative impact on our income statement.
An example of this might be the sale of properties to fund our existing committed capital expenditure.
Nevertheless, ensuring we have suf cient capital and liquidity will enable us to capitalise on opportunities which will undoubtedly arise in the coming years.
The pages that follow provide you with a detailed review of our gures.
Given the scale of events during the year, I hope this overview helps put the results in context and conveys a clear picture of current financial dynamics.

The transaction included all of Trilliums operations with the exception of the Accor hotel portfolio, which is now included within our Retail Portfolio.
As Trillium represented a separate major line of business for the Group, it has been treated as a discontinued operation for the year ended 31 March 2009.
The income statement and the relevant notes for the prior period have been restated to assist comparison.
Additionally, all financial information on a per share basis including last years comparatives has been adjusted to reflect the Rights Issue which completed in March 2009.

Headline results The Groups loss before tax from continuing activities was 4,773.2m, compared to a loss of 988.0m for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Revenue profit, our measure of underlying profit before tax, increased by 10.6% from 284.8m to 314.9m.

The loss from discontinued operations for the year all relates to Trillium and amounted to 420.9m, which reflects the loss for the current year of 87.3m and a loss on disposal of 333.6m.
The loss for the current year included a goodwill impairment charge of 148.6m and a deficit on revaluation of investment properties of 10.0m, partially offset by underlying profit from the Trillium business.
The combined investment portfolio including joint ventures decreased in value from 14.1bn to 9.4bn on the back of a valuation deficit of 4,743.7m or 34.2%.
Net assets per share decreased by 1223p from 1862p at the end of March 2008 restated for the Rights Issue to 639p in March 2009, with adjusted diluted net assets per share decreasing from 1763p at March 2008 to 593p at March 2009.
Loss before tax The main drivers of our loss before tax from continuing activities were the change in value of our investment portfolio including any profits or losses on disposal of properties, impairment of our trading properties and the impact of interest rate swaps.
The degree to which movement on these and other items led to the increase in our loss before tax from 988.0m last year to a loss of 4,773.2m this year, is explained in Table 12 below.

The 34.2% reduction in the market values of our properties is driven by a number of external factors including the overall economic environment and investor demand.
Impairment of trading properties Our trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In accordance with our normal practice, a valuation exercise was undertaken by Knight Frank LLP at 31 March 2009 to review the net realisable values of our trading properties and this resulted in a 92.3m impairment 104.6m including joint ventures.
The impairment primarily applied to development land and infrastructure programmes, mainly at Ebbsfleet Valley in Kent.
Interest rate swaps We use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure as described in the paragraph on hedging below.
The significant fall in interest rates this year has resulted in a charge to the income statement of 102.1m, representing the change in market value of these swaps over the year 117.5m including joint ventures.
Revenue profit Revenue profit is our measure of the underlying pre-tax profit of the Group, which we use internally to assess our performance.
It includes the pre-tax results of our joint ventures but excludes capital and other one-off items.
Table 13 shows the composition of our revenue profit including the contributions from London and Retail.
Gross rental income increased by 14.3m over last year, which was mainly due to purchases since 1 April 2007 and development properties, such as our schemes at Exeter, Bristol, Bankside and New Street Square.
This was Chart 14 partially offset by a reduction in rental income from the net sales of investment properties.
The increase in Dividends and adjusted diluted net service charge and property costs of 17.5m reflected the tougher climate facing our retail customers, earnings per share p with higher void costs and empty rates as well as an increase in our bad debt provisions and write off of pre-development costs.
70 Net interest expense was 32.6m lower than last year, reflecting lower average net debt over the period 60 following disposals and lower interest rates particularly in the second half of the year.
50 40 Loss earnings per share 30 The basic loss per share from continuing activities was 918.0p, compared to a loss per share of 188.4p last year, 20 the change being predominantly due to the revaluation deficit on the investment property portfolio 791.7p 10 per share.
0 In the same way that we adjust profit before tax to remove capital and one-off items to give revenue profit, we also report an adjusted earnings per share figure.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing 05 06 07 08 09 1 activities increased by 2.9% from 60.8p per share for the year ended 31 March 2008 to 62.6p per share in the Dividends per share restated 2 3 Adjusted diluted earnings per share current period Chart 14.
This increase was largely attributable to reduced interest on borrowings but was lower than the increase in revenue profit due to a prior year tax benefit in last years results.
The restated total dividend payable represents the theoretical dividend per share that would have been paid had the bonus shares inherent in the Rights Issue been in existence at the relevant dividend dates.
The earnings per share for the years ended 31 March 2008, 31 March 2007, 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005 have been adjusted for the bonus element inherent in the Rights Issue that was approved on 9 March 2009.
The earnings per share for 2005 to 2007 includes the operating results of Trillium.
2008 and 2009 exclude the operating results of Trillium as these have been reclassified as discontinued operations.

Taken together with the three quarterly Who can claim exemption from dividends of 14.9p, our full year dividend will be 51.6p per share 2008: 57.8p which represents a 10.5% deduction of withholding tax on reduction.
These amounts have been restated to include the bonus factor inherent in the Rights Issue.

Our final proposed dividend of 7.0p is the amount we indicated at the time of our Rights Issue, when we UK companies explained that we were resetting our dividend to a lower base.
It is also the amount we anticipate paying as our Charities quarterly dividend throughout the next financial year.
On an annualised basis, this will reduce our dividend from Local Authorities around 307m to 212m.

The reduction in our net assets was primarily driven by the lower value of our investment property portfolio, the impairment of trading properties and the loss on disposal of Trillium.
In common with other property companies, we calculate an adjusted measure of net assets which we believe better reflects the underlying net assets attributable to shareholders.
Our adjusted net assets are lower than our reported net assets primarily due to an adjustment to our debt.
Under IFRS we do not show our debt at its nominal value, although we believe it would be more appropriate to do so, and we therefore adjust our net assets accordingly.
At 31 March 2009, adjusted diluted net assets per share were 593p per share, a decrease of 1170p or 66.4% from 31 March 2008.
Table 16 summarises the main differences between net assets and our adjusted measure together with the key movements over the year.

Land Securities Annual Report 2009 Fixed and floating charges over Security Group assets to secure all secured debt 22 Financial review Net pension surplus The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which is closed to new members.
At 31 March 2009 the net surplus was 3.0m.
This was 8.0m lower than the surplus recognised at 31 March 2008, primarily due to lower than expected returns on scheme assets.
The key assumptions behind this surplus are shown in note 33 to the accounts, together with related sensitivities.
Cash flow, net debt and gearing During the year, net debt decreased by 1,460.9m to 3,923.6m.
This was primarily driven by proceeds from the disposal of investment properties 823.0m, the disposal of Trillium 492.6m and proceeds of 755.7m from the Rights Issue.
Capital expenditure in the year was 515.9m, which was 895.9m below last year, reflecting a decrease in expenditure on developments and very few investment property acquisitions following the slowdown in the commercial property market.
We invested a net 117.0m in our joint ventures, mainly on shopping centre developments in Bristol and Cardiff.
The development in Bristol was completed and opened in September 2008.
The Cardiff development is scheduled to complete in October 2009.

As calculated under the REIT regulations, our interest cover of the exempt business for the year to 31 March 2009 was 1.62 times.
Other lenders Secured lenders Although net debt has decreased, gearing has increased, principally due to the impact of falling property values on our equity.
Details of the Groups gearing are set out in Table 18, which also shows the impact of joint Asset transfers and venture debt, although the lenders to our joint ventures have no recourse to the Group for repayment.
inter-company funding Adjusted gearing, which recognises the nominal value of our debt, increased from 64.9% at 31 March permitted 2008 to 96.4% at 31 March 2009.
Adjusted gearing including our share of joint ventures increased from 67.6% to 105.9% over the same period.
In common with other property companies, we also show our Group LTV ratio.
Non-restricted Group Financing strategy The Group monitors and adjusts its capital structure with a view to promoting the long-term success of the Joint ventures business and maintaining sustainable returns for shareholders.
A key element of the Groups capital structure and other assets is that the majority of its borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets the Security Group Chart 19.
Our secured debt structure provides for different operating environments which apply in tiers determined by levels of LTV and Interest Cover Ratios ICR, although it is LTV which is the more likely Dedicated third party funding determinant of which operating environment applies.
These ratios do not trigger an event of default until LTV or loan from Secured Group exceeds 100% or historic or projected ICR is less than 1.0 times.
However, our operating environment becomes more restrictive at higher levels of LTV lower levels of ICR.

Furthermore, none of the Groups credit facilities permit the drawing of additional funds if the Group is in Initial Tier 3.
As there was a risk of our moving into Initial Tier 3 if property values continued to decline rapidly, we took the decision to draw down our available facilities in early 2009 as outlined in more detail below.
The last two years have seen an unprecedented period of instability in the financial markets which has severely impacted investor confidence, the availability and pricing of credit, and the pricing of property investments.
During the last quarter of 2008, the pace of valuation decline exceeded the pace at which assets could be sold to counteract the impact of falling values on the Groups balance sheet position.
This deterioration had an adverse effect on the Groups LTV ratios and lay behind the decision to raise 755.7m through a Rights Issue.
Rights Issue On 19 February 2009, the Group announced its intention to raise 755.7m net of expenses by way of a Rights Issue of 290,773,925 new ordinary shares at 270 pence per share on the basis of five new ordinary shares for every eight existing ordinary shares.
The Rights Issue was approved by shareholders in a General Meeting on 9 March 2009, nil-paid rights began trading the following day and proceeds were received shortly before the year end.
As the Land Securities closing share price on 9 March 380p exceeded the subscription price of 270p, Read more about the Rights Issue.
p27 the Rights Issue is deemed to include a bonus element of 11.0%.
As a result, all per share information which pre-dates the Rights Issue is reduced by 9.0% ignoring the restatement of the 2008 results due to the disposal of Trillium.
Financing and capital Over the last 12 months, we continued to focus on our cash flows, the level of available bank credit facilities and Chart 20 the maturity of our debt Chart 20.
During the year, we refinanced and extended our three existing committed bilateral facilities totalling 825m and established three new committed bilateral facilities totalling 115m.
All Expected debt maturities nominal m the bilateral facilities, with the exception of a 40m facility, mature in the period from July to December 2010, 2,500 with an option to extend the maturity for a further year.
The ability to refinance existing facilities and negotiate new facilities against the current financial and economic backdrop, owes much to the quality and level of assets 2,000 within the Security Group against which these facilities and Group bonds are secured, as well as the importance 1,500 we place on our bank relationships.
The average duration of the Groups debt is 9.7 years with a weighted average cost of debt of 4.1%.
1,000 In January 2009 the Group drew down 1.1bn of available credit facilities to ensure liquidity and provide 500 operational flexibility by holding the funds outside the Security Group.
At 31 March 2009 our net borrowings including joint ventures amounted to 4,732.6m, of which 2,298.6m was drawn under our syndicated and 0 bilateral bank facilities and 57.8m related to finance leases.
Committed but undrawn facilities amounted to 489.2m of which 300m cannot be drawn if we are operating in Initial Tier 3.
In the Security Group, 5,720m year ending March years of debt was secured against 7,453.3m of assets, giving a Security Group LTV ratio of 76.7%, up from 50.5% Joint ventures Security Group at 31 March 2008 Chart 21.
As a result, we will enter Initial Tier 3 when the Security Group valuation report Non-restricted Group for 31 March 2009 is submitted.
Although the March valuation report shows a sharp decline in property values, it was the decision to draw down existing bank facilities and to hold high levels of cash outside the Security Group for liquidity reasons, which Chart 21 will result in this tier change.
At 31 March 2009, the Group had cash and short-term instruments of 1,596.5m outside the Security Group.
This cash is available to be injected into the Security Group to maintain its LTV at less Security Group LTV history % than 80% to prevent it entering Final Tier 3.
Our current cash holding provides the Group with protection against 90 further valuation declines and the option to deploy capital should suitable opportunities arise.
If all our cash and cash equivalents at 31 March 2009 had been injected into the Security Group, the Security Group LTV would 75 have been 55.3% Tier 2 regime.
It is our intention to migrate back to a Tier 1 or 2 covenant regime in the 60 medium term.
45 30 Hedging 15 We use derivative products to manage our interest rate exposure, and have a hedging policy which requires at least 80% of our existing debt plus our net committed capital expenditure to be at fixed interest rates for the 0 coming five years.
Specific hedges are also used in geared developments or joint ventures to fix the interest Mar 07 Sept 07 Mar 08 Sept 08 Mar 09 exposure on limited-recourse debt.
At 31 March 2009, we had 2,672.0m of hedges in place.
Our debt net of Underlying LTV cash and cash equivalents and including joint ventures was 107% fixed.
The slightly over-hedged position at the Effect of holding cash outside the Security Group year end arose due to the receipt in March 2009 of the Rights Issue proceeds of 755.7m.
Without the Rights Issue proceeds, we would have been 93.0% hedged.
Taxation As a consequence of the Groups conversion to REIT status, income and capital gains from our qualifying property rental business are now exempt from UK corporation tax.
The tax charge for the year of 0.5m 2008: 15.1m credit comprises a prior year corporation tax charge of 0.3m and a net deferred tax charge of 0.2m.
The tax loss arising on the write-down of trading properties below cost has eliminated taxable profits on all residual taxable activities in the period.
No tax charge arose in respect of the disposal of Trillium.
