37 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Financial review & risk Financial review continued Exceptional items Exceptional items totalled $44.7 million after tax 2008: $42.0 million.
This mainly includes: Positive exceptional items principally include: $ million Description of main items Impact of the Groups 39.6 In November 2009, Lake Shore Gold acquired all of the outstanding common shares investments in joint ventures of WTM creating a new large-scale, wholly-owned Timmins West Gold Mine Complex.
and associates As a consequence of this all-share transaction, Hochschilds 40.0% stake in Lake Shore Gold was diluted to approximately 26.1%.
Upon completion of the business combination between Lake Shore Gold and WTM, Lake Shore Golds equity value increased by $386 million.
As a result, Hochschild recognised an exceptional gain of $42.3 million in 2009, reflecting its share of the increased equity value of Lake Shore Gold, net of the loss on the dilution of Hochschilds interest in Lake Shore Gold.
In December, after the Group acquired an additional interest in Lake Shore Gold of 3.9%, Lake Shore Gold issued a package of shares, options and warrants.
As a result, Hochschilds stake of 36.1% was diluted to 35.7% and the Group recognised an exceptional loss of $4.5 million.
Finance Income 22.3 The Company reported finance income of $28.7 million 2008: $13.3 million due to the $12.1 million gain generated from the exchange of shares held in West Timmins Mining for shares in Lake Shore Gold and the $7.4 million gain realised from the exercise of options held in GRC.
See note 13 for further details.
Other income 8.8 Other income increased to $13.3 million 2008: $5.3 million.
This was mainly generated due to a gain of $7.7 million arising from the acquisition of Southwestern Resources as a result of the difference between the total acquisition cost of $19.3 million and the fair value of the net assets of $26.9 million on the acquisition date.
Negative exceptional items principally include: $ million Description of main items 1 Impairment of fixed assets 26.7 In 2009, Hochschild has recorded a total impairment charge before tax of $26.7 million, mainly as a result of: Ares The Group has impaired the carrying amount of the assets related to the Ares mine by $15.3 million, due to the mines expected closure in the second half of 2010 and the resulting revision to the remaining recoverable reserves and resources.
Liam In the first half of 2009, the Liam property was written down by $10.0 million following a reassessment of the value of the property which was acquired in August 2008 for a total consideration of $33.3 million.
Selene As a result of the closure of the Selene mine in June 2009, the Company has written down the remaining net book value of assets of $4.8 million.
Reversal of impairment In June 2009, the Company reported an impairment charge of $5.7 million for Moris due to the small reserve and resource base at the operation.
However, following the positive price environment during the year, this impairment has been reversed and the Company is therefore reporting an exceptional gain of $3.4 million.
After tax, the total impairment charge was $17.7 million representing an impact of $0.06 on EPS.
Cost of sales 6.9 One-off bonus paid to workers at the Peruvian mines as a result of the negotiations with workers which were successfully resolved in March 2009.
1 Impairment testing should be performed at an individual asset or cash-generating unit level.
As required by IFRS, the Group conducts an impairment review on an annual basis every time any goodwill was allocated to an asset and every time indicators of impairment exist.
Impairment indicators include: declines in metal prices: increases in costs, royalties or taxes: falling grades: lower reserves: production cut backs and significant project development over-runs.
The presence of one or more indicators does not necessarily mean that the asset would be impaired but that it must be tested for impairment.
