OVERVIEW BUSINESS FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY BOARD EXECUTIVE CORPORATE FINANCIAL REVIEW REVIEW COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS 13 Vedanta Resources plc Annual report 2009 Sales Case study We improved our penetration of the domestic market, selling 353,000 tonnes in FY 2009, up 17.1% compared with FY 2008.
Domestic sales represented 77% of total sales, which provided a bene t vis-a-vis exports due to import tariffs.
Financial Performance Despite an increase in annual volumes and lower input costs in H2 FY 2009, EBITDA in FY 2009 was US$196.1 million, down 48.5% compared with FY 2008, primarily due to the 14.8% reduction in LME prices and higher input costs for the full year which negatively impacted EBITDA by US$120.4 million and US$105.1 million respectively, partially offset by the sale of surplus power commercially which contributed US$15.9 million to EBITDA in FY 2009.
Projects Jharsuguda I Aluminium Smelter The first 250,000 tpa phase of the 500,000 tpa Jharsuguda I aluminium smelter is progressing well and is expected to be fully operational by the first quarter of FY 2010, six months ahead of the original schedule.
Work on the second 250,000 tpa phase is on Balco Fuse Technology schedule with phased commissioning expected to commence from June 2009 and full operations by end FY 2010.
Aluminium is produced through ten minutes.
As the fuse operation Jharsuguda II Aluminium Smelter electrolysis process.
In Balco, all the depends on the self-generation of The new 1.25 mtpa Jharsuguda II pots in the pot line are connected in heat under conditions of excessive aluminium smelter project is progressing a series and 320 KA current is passed current by means of the fuses own well with civil construction activities in through each pot using risers and electrical resistance, it is designed progress in all major areas of the four shorted joints, to produce aluminium to withstand ten minutes of the pot lines and associated plants.
To put pots online, insulation shortened riser current safely.
During major packages have been ordered and plates are inserted at the shorted this period the pot was brought into the project is on schedule for phased joints of the riser to avoid any bypass the circuit by inserting insulation commissing from March 2010 and of current to the next pot.
So, to take plates between the shorted joints full operations by September 2012. any pot into line, the power of whole and after ten minutes the fuse melts pot line was to be switched off to 0 and the pot is put on power.
