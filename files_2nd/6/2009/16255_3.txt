These exposures are hedged under a policy of denominating short notice and at competitive rates.

In our funding strategy, our objective is to maintain a balance Derivatives, in the form of cross currency swaps and forward currency between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of capital contracts, can be used to maximise the hedging by increasing debt in markets, bank loans and overdrafts.
To facilitate access to these sources these currencies.
In accordance with this policy the recent sterling bond of funds we seek to maintain a long term investment grade credit rating issue has been wholly swapped into US dollars.
At the end of 2009 with both Moodys current rating: Baa3 stable outlook and Standard approximately 68% of UBMs US dollar assets were hedged in this way.

In November 2009, UBM issued 250m of seven-year sterling Interest rate risk bonds with a coupon of 6.5% to lengthen debt maturity and diversify funding sources.
We maintain a 325m multi-currency revolving credit Our policy is to manage our cost of borrowing using a mix of fixed and facility from key relationship banks.

UBMs business activities, together with the factors likely to impact its future growth Interest and operating performance are set out in the Business Review on pages 04 to 21 and 28 to 31.
Net interest paid in 2009 was 14.5m, compared with 4.2m in 2008.
This is mainly as a result of a higher average debt for the year and higher margins on floating rate debt and lower returns on cash balances.
The 250m bond issue in November 2009 has increased the total debt facilities available to the Company and has significantly lengthened the average maturity of these facilities.
This will have an impact on the level of future interest payments, with the average cost of the new debt being forecast at 4.8% in 2010, compared with 3.3% for drawings under the 2012 facility.
Net interest paid represents interest payments on UBMs bonds and bank loans, reduced by receipts due on our cash holdings.
