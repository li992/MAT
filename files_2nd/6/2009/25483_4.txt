We are organised as a network comprising five principal business divisions: Private Client Activities, Capital Markets Investment Banking, Asset Management and Property Activities.
In addition, our head of ce provides certain group-wide integrating functions such as Risk Management, Information Technology Finance, Investor Relations, Marketing, Human Resources and Organisational Development.
It is also responsible for our central funding and other activities, such as our Trade Finance operations.
There are therefore a number of key income drivers for our business which are discussed below.

Due to the nature of our businesses, we have been and will continue to be affected by changes in a number of macro-economic fundamentals.
These include the condition of worldwide financial markets, general economic cycles, levels of exchange and interest rates, and in ation, in particular in the UK, South Africa and Australia, where the group derives most of its pro t as well as, to a lesser extent, the US and Europe.
Fluctuations in exchange rates Our reporting currency is Pounds Sterling.
Certain of our operations are conducted by entities outside the UK.
The results of operations and the financial condition of our individual companies are reported in the local currencies of the countries in which they are domiciled including Rands, Australian Dollars, Euros and US Dollars.
These results are then translated into Pounds Sterling at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our combined consolidated financial results.
In the case of the income statement, the weighted average rate for the relevant period is applied and, in the case of the balance sheet, the relevant closing rate is used.
The following table sets out the movements in certain relevant exchange rates against Pounds Sterling over the period.
Currency per 1.00 31 March 2009 31 March 2008 Period end Average Period end Average South African Rand 13.58 14.83 16.17 14.31 Australian Dollar 2.07 2.19 2.18 2.32 Euro 1.08 1.21 1.25 1.42 US Dollar 1.43 1.73 1.99 2.01 Exchange rates between local currencies and Pounds Sterling have uctuated over the period.
The most signi cant impact arises from the volatility of the Rand.
The average Rand: Pounds Sterling exchange rate over the year has depreciated by 3.6% and the closing rate has appreciated by 16.0% since 31 March 2008.
The following table provides an analysis of the impact of the Rand depreciation appreciation on our reported numbers.

For income statement items we have used the average Rand: Pounds Sterling exchange rate that was applied in the prior period, i. e. 14.31 Fluctuations in interest rates The shape of the yield curve, the time lag between changes in interest rates applicable to assets and liabilities, and the volatility of interest rates in each of our principal geographic markets can affect our net interest income, principal transactions generated by the Interest Rate and Forex desks and fees in our Capital Markets division.
As a matter of policy, we do not take on material unhedged, long-dated interest rate positions.
The table on page 88 sets out movements in certain interest rates, affecting our businesses over the reporting period.
Annual report 2009 17 Overview of the year Financial review Salient features of our results during the year under review A number of signi cant corporate actions were undertaken during the prior year which have a bearing on our relative performance and these are highlighted below: The sale of the South African property fund management and property administration business to Growthpoint Properties Limited Growthpoint, as approved by the Competition Tribunal of South Africa on 18 October 2007.
A non-operating exceptional gain of 72.9 million pre-taxation was made on the sale of this business.
The purchase consideration was satis ed by the issue of new Growthpoint linked units.
Furthermore, as announced on 6 November 2007, Investec disposed of 152 473 544 Growthpoint linked units representing its entire shareholding in Growthpoint, inter alia, monetising the proceeds on the disposal of the property fund management and property administration business.
Investec Bank Australia Limited acquired Experien Pty Ltd Experien as of 1 October 2007.

The business was acquired for 216.3 million, via the issue of 36.8 million Investec plc shares, with a net asset value at date of acquisition of 100.2 million after a special dividend of 13.7 million.

Other operating loss The consolidation of the operating results of certain investments held within the groups Private Equity portfolio resulted in an operating loss of 30.2 million 2008: income of 50 million.
Impairment losses on loans and advances As a result of the weaker credit cycle we have seen a decline in the performance of the loan portfolio resulting in an increase in impairment losses on loans and advances from 58.8 million to 162.9 million excluding Kensington.
The credit loss charge as a percentage of average gross core loans and advances has increased from 0.5% to 1.1% since 31 March 2008.

24 Annual report 2009 Overview of the year Financial review Balance sheet analysis Since 31 March 2008: Total shareholders equity including minority interests increased by 18.6% to 2.6 billion largely as a result of retained earnings and foreign currency translation gains.
Net asset value per share increased from 260.6 pence to 308.8 pence and net tangible asset value per share which excludes goodwill and intangible assets increased from 215.0 pence to 266.3 pence.
Total assets increased from 34.1 billion to 37.1 billion largely as a result of foreign currency adjustments.
The return on adjusted average shareholders equity decreased from 23.6% to 14.8%.
The compulsorily convertible debentures that were outstanding at 31 March 2008 were converted to shares on 31 July 2008.
This resulted in an increase in share capital and share premium with no impact on total equity.

Under IFRS, however, a portion of these CCDs are treated as debt and not included in shareholders equity.
As a result, adjustments must be made to the shareholder base which would be more appropriately re ect their permanent capital nature.

Accordingly, as announced in November 2008, the group has adjusted its capital adequacy targets and is focusing on increasing its capital base, targeting a minimum tier one capital ratio of 11% and a total capital adequacy ratio of 14% to 17% on a consolidated basis for Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively.
Investec has made good progress in this regard and intends meeting these targets by the end of calendar year 2010.
Further information is provided on pages 160 and 161.
ROE - assessment of economic capital utilised In order to assess the return on economic capital utilised, the group believes that certain adjustments as detailed in the tables below should be made to the income statement analysis and balance sheet analysis as re ected under IFRS.
The group believes that these adjustments are necessary as they re ect the actual utilisation of capital and return thereon, notwithstanding accounting conventions.
Return on capital by segment The methodology applied in accessing the utilisation of the groups economic capital is as follows: - A notional return on capital net of the cost of subordinated debt which is managed and borne in the centre is allocated from Group Services and Other Activities GSO to the business segments based on their total capital utilisation.
- Shareholders equity is increased to re ect permanent capital which is re ected under subordinated debt applicable prior to March 2009.
