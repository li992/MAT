Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business review.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities and details of its financial risk management are described in the Financial review.
The majority of the Groups revenue is derived from long-term contracts, which provide the Group with a strong future workload and good forward revenue visibility.
The Group has access to committed debt facilities totalling 250 million until at least May 2011.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
