These are an important component of the Groups sources of funding and are used to service borrowings, pay dividends and, importantly, provide funding for the rapid growth in our developing businesses.
As the developing businesses of Mexico and Romania mature, profits will grow, they will become self-funding and will begin to generate surplus cash to support growth in future new markets.
We do not plan to enter any new markets in 2010 and, given that new market pilots typically run for a period of 12 to 18 months, these will not have a significant impact on our operating cash flows before 2013 at the earliest.

The business model generates strong returns Return on capital employed We have a profitable business model and generated a pre-tax profit of 61.7 million during 2009, which represented earnings per share EPS of 17.78 pence, a profit margin of 8.3% and a return on capital employed ROCE of 17.6%.

compared with a profit of 76.3 million in 2008.
We were particularly pleased that our Mexican business reported its first profit and the Romanian business reported much reduced losses.
The Central European markets of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia returned to profit growth for the second half of the year.
This was tempered by the performance of the Hungarian business which reported a loss of 7.2 million for the year as a whole compared with a 2008 profit of 16.1 million, although we were encouraged by the fact that it returned to profit in the second half of the year before one-off restructuring costs.
Revenue was broadly flat year on year, but we experienced an increase in impairment charges that was partly offset by reductions in our cost base.
Margin analysis 2009 2008 Group revenue m 550.2 557.1 As a % of revenue Impairment 29.9% 22.8% Agents commission 11.6% 12.9% Operating expenses 41.7% 45.4% Finance costs 5.6% 5.2% Profit margin 11.2% 13.7% The combination of early management action to tighten credit controls in the second half of 2008, and the short-term nature of our loan book meant that the increase in impairment costs was controlled, with impairment remaining below 30%, although increasing by 7.1% to 29.9%.
This increase reflected the impact of the recession primarily on the first quarter, when customer repayment rates fell sharply.
Because we employ a prudent provisioning methodology, with impairment recognised as soon as a customer misses any part of a contractual repayment, this drop in collections performance resulted in an immediate increase in impairment charges.
Agent commission costs are predominantly based on amounts collected and are largely variable in nature.
As part of our preparations for the global downturn in the second half of 2008 we made considerable efforts to reduce costs.
These included the renegotiation of significant third party contracts, a reduction in our marketing spend alongside the credit tightening, and a measured reduction in field costs.
These efforts were successful in improving efficiency ratios significantly, thereby offsetting the impact of increased impairment, with operating expenses reduced to 41.7% of revenue.
Importantly, at a time when lending margins have increased substantially as a result of the recession, finance costs represent only 5.6% of revenue.

The expected future cash flows are adjusted to take account of our expectation of future credit losses based on the age of the debt, the number of missed payments and the historical performance of similar loans.
Impairment charges are always calculated by reference to the customers original contractual repayment schedule, even when an extended repayment schedule has been agreed.
Funding Total Group borrowings have reduced by 101.7 million to 332.6 million, reflecting careful management of credit issued and costs, coupled with the cash generative nature of the business model.

At 31 December 2009 the scheme had assets of 30.9 million and liabilities of 38.4 million.
A detailed pension note is included in the financial statements.
Going concern The directors have reviewed the budget for the year to 31 December 2010 and the forecasts for the four years to 31 December 2014 which include projected profits, cash flows, borrowings and headroom against facilities.
The committed bank facilities of the Group are sufficient to fund the planned growth of our existing operations until October 2011.
Taking these factors into account the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
