of countries, particularly in Europe and North America.
The latest full actuarial assessments of the UK schemes were carried out at 31 March 2007 in respect of the Group 4 scheme approximately 8,000 members, at 5 April 2006 in respect of the Securicor scheme approximately Trevor Dighton 20,000 members and at 31 March 2005 in respect of the GSL scheme Chief financial officer approximately 2,000 members acquired during the prior year.
These assessments and those of the groups other schemes have been updated to 31 December 2009.
The groups funding shortfall on the valuation basis specified in IAS19 Employee Benefits was 328m before tax or 236m after tax 2008: 286m and 206m respectively.
The valuation of gross liabilities increased during 2009 largely due to a decrease in the appropriate AA corporate bond rate in the UK from 6.3% to 5.7%, and compounded by an increase in inflation from 3.1% to 3.6% in the UK.
However, the value of the assets held in the funds increased by 143m which helped to partly offset the increase in liabilities during 2009.
The group believes that the short-term volatility in reported retirement benefit obligations, in response to movements in asset prices and financial circumstances, is of limited relevance in the context of liabilities which are exceptionally long term in nature and furthermore that, over the long term, investment returns on the retirement benefit scheme assets will be sufficient to fund retirement benefit obligations.
However, in recognition of the regulatory obligation upon pension fund trustees to address reported deficits if they arise, the group anticipates that additional cash contributions will continue to be made at least at a level similar to that in 2009.
The three schemes in the UK have combined under one trustee body with effect from 1 January 2009 and will all be formally actuarially assessed at 5 April 2009.
The groups funding shortfall for its defined benefit retirement schemes was 236m after tax.
