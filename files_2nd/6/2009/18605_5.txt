Financial Review Performance overview Our key performance indicators are: 2009 2008 Gross net assets value per share pence 411p 535p Operating profit before valuation and goodwill adjustments 78.8m 106.0m 1 Return on capital employed 4.3% 11.4% 1 year 5 year 10 year 2 Return on shareholder equity 33.7% 4.5% 3.6% 1 Profit before financing costs together with all revaluation movements as a percentage of opening gross capital 2 Growth in NNNAV plus dividends paid per share as a percentage of opening NNNAV on an annualised basis Most of our properties are held as trading stock and are therefore shown in the statutory balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
This does not reflect the market value of the assets and so we set out below a summary of our net assets with the properties restated at market value.

The definitions of these measures are consistent with Gross NAV and Triple NAV as described and shown in the table above.
This definition of Gross NAV requires us to remove any balances for deferred tax on property revaluations and the fair value of derivatives as calculated under IFRS.
Triple NAV requires certain of these adjustments to be reinstated and, in addition, a deduction is made for contingent tax which is calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the full inherent gains at the balance sheet date.

We set out three measurements to better enable shareholders to compare our performance year on year and with our peers, whilst reflecting the unique nature of our business.
2009 2008 Movement Gross net assets per share NAV 411p 535p 23% - market value of net assets per share before deduction for deferred tax on property revaluations and before adjustments for the fair value of derivatives Triple net assets per share NNNAV 251p 385p 35% - gross NAV per share adjusted for deferred and contingent tax on revaluation gains and for mark to market adjustments Grainger NAV 360p 520p 31% - NNNAV adjusted for the discounted and taxed reversionary surplus the difference between vacant possession and current market value in our long term regulated and home reversion portfolios The major movements in NAV in the year are: m Pence per share Gross net assets 1 October 2008 688 535 Conversion of convertible bond 42 30 Results after tax net of adjustments see table below 92 66 Revaluation movements 23 17 Elimination of previously recognised surplus 44 31 Dividends paid 5 4 Other 4 36 Gross net assets 30 September 2009 570 411 The pence per share movement in other reflects the impact on the opening balance resulting from the increase in shares in issue.
Results after tax net of adjustments shown above can be reconciled to the loss after tax in the income statement as follows:- m Loss after tax from income statement 122 Pre-tax inducement cost on convertible 31 Net of tax charge on mark to market adjustments 28 Deferred tax credit on property revaluations 29 Results after tax net of adjustments see table above 92 17 Reconciliation of NAV measures m Pence per share Gross NAV 570 411 Deferred and contingent tax 137 99 Mark to market adjustments net of tax 84 61 NNNAV 349 251 Discounted reversionary surplus 209 151 Tax thereon 59 42 Grainger NAV 30 September 2009 499 360 The major assumptions used in calculating the base case Grainger NAV are set out below: - house price inflation taken as zero over the entire reversionary period - discount rate of 8.22% used to calculate the present value of the reversionary surplus weighted average cost of capital 3% 2008: discount rate 8.43% - no discounting of contingent tax on the revaluation surpluses - reversionary periods taken as 14 years for regulated properties and 10 years for home reversions.
co. uk sets out how these assumptions may be varied.
Financial performance in the year Operating profit before all revaluation movements, fair value, impairment and goodwill adjustments has decreased 27.2m 26% to 78.8m from 106.0m.
m 2008 operating profit 106.0 Increase in gross rents and other income 5.8 Increase in property expenses and overheads 4.9 Decrease in residential trading profits 26.3 Increase in development trading profits 6.9 Increase in interest expense from interest in financial asset 3.8 Other 4.9 2009 operating profit see accounts note 3 78.8 The major movement in operating profit is a reduction in trading profit from the core and retirement solutions business.
This reflects the lower margins achieved on sales resulting from the difficult market conditions existing during the year.
The increase in development trading profit arose from the sale of properties at Barnsbury, Hornsey Road, Kensington Church Street and Elder Street.
The increase in gross rents and other income reflects a full year of FRM results in Germany compared to six months in 2008, and this has also led to an increase in property expenses.
The run rate of our overhead costs excluding non-recurring costs at 30 September 2009 amounts to 29.4m 2008: 32.2m, a reduction of 8.7%.
18 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has fallen to a loss of 90p from a loss of 61p.
Pence m per share 2008 Loss per share 77.4 61.0 Movements in:- Operating profit 27.2 20.2 Contribution from joint ventures and associates 45.4 33.4 Fair value of derivatives and financial assets 27.2 20.1 Revaluation losses on investment properties 17.5 12.9 Provisions against trading stock values and loan balances 25.6 18.8 Goodwill impairment 6.2 4.6 Net interest payable 12.9 9.5 Convertible bond 31.1 22.9 Taxation and other 10.3 11.8 2009 Loss per share 122.0 89.8 Interest expense and similar charges Our net interest charge has increased by 12.9m from 89.0m to 101.9m, principally because of the write-off of certain unamortised loan costs brought forward, costs incurred in the refinancing of our banking facilities and a non-recurring interest charge relating to a potential tax liability.
As part of the early conversion of 87.1m of the 112m 2014 Convertible Bond holders accepted a cash payment of 35,000 per 100,000 nominal bond value to convert early.
This cash payment of 31.1m is shown in the income statement as an inducement cost.
The other effects of the early conversion have been to: - issue 10.08m ordinary shares - eliminate 57m of nominal debt - increase net assets by 42.0m and decrease net assets per share by 1.6% Financial resources The business has produced 235m of cash from its operating activities being net rents and other income, property sales and other working capital movements net of overheads.
The largest outflow of cash is 76m on net interest.
At the year end, our net debt levels before unamortised finance costs had reduced from 1,621m in 2008 to 1,561m, despite a deterioration in the sterling euro exchange rate which increased overall Group debt by 69m.
The debt was 93% hedged 2008: 85% of which 16% was subject to caps.
At the year end, the Group had headroom of 171m 2008: 370m.
On 30 September 2009, we announced the finalisation of two new forward start credit facilities totalling 615m which will provide the Group with extended liquidity at a time when certain of our existing facilities will expire.
The facilities comprise a 250m committed term loan available from June 2010 and a 365m committed term loan available in June 2011.
On these dates they will be used to refinance facilities of 400m and 475m that mature on those dates.
These facilities have been reduced to 250m and 445m respectively by using excess short-term committed but undrawn facilities.
The two new forward start facilities will mature in December 2012.
The other facilities under Grainger s core banking facilities are a 228m revolving credit facility maturing in December 2012 and 425m of term loans maturing in June 2013.
The average maturity of all of the Group s debt is 4.4 years 2008: 4.5 years.
19 As a result of the above, the Group has no core banking facilities maturing in its financial year to 2010, with only 109m maturing in the year to September 2011 and 57m in the year to September 2012.
A total of 872m of the core banking facilities will mature in December 2012.
Our effective average interest rate on the Group s bank loans in the year ended 30 September 2009 was 5.7% 2008: 6.2%.
Immediately post the refinancing Grainger s effective average interest rate on the Group s bank loans was 5.5% but this would reduce to 5.2% under an interest ratchet mechanism should the loan to value ratio on the core facilities fall below 60%.
Our core banking facilities have two covenants covering loan to value LTV and interest cover.
The method of calculation and limits of these covenants remain unchanged by the new facilities.
Under the LTV covenant, an LTV of 80% could lead to default of the agreement and, at 70%, LTV purchasing restrictions and a cash sweep mechanism apply.
At 30 September 2009, V was 1,820m 2008: 1,971m and L was 1,206m 2008: 1,308m in each case for purposes of the LTV covenant and accordingly the LTV on the core facility was 66% 2008: 66%.
Under the interest cover covenant, our interest cost must be covered 1.25 times by net cash flow before interest.
As at 30 September 2009, the ratio stood at 2.7 times 2008: 2.2 times.
