3183415 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial Commentary In a year of economic turbulence St. Jamess Place has demonstrated both resilience as markets fell and strength as markets recovered.
Despite the difficult economic environment and turbulent world stock markets new business for the year was up 5% whilst retention of existing clients investments improved further from an already very strong position.
The combination of both the new business and retention led to net inflows of funds under management of 2.3 billion, which was 35% higher than the prior year.
Overall net inflows amounted to some 14% of opening funds.

3183415 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial Commentary continued The cash result for the year was 23.5 million 2008: 24.1 million and the tables and commentary below provides an indicative analysis of the sources of this cash result: arising from Business arising from In-force at New Business 1 January in Year Total 2009 Note Million Million Million Net annual management fee 1 119.9 13.2 133.1 Unwind of surrender penalties 2 40.8 4.4 45.2 Margin arising from new business 3 12.0 12.0 Establishment expenses 4 6.9 62.1 69.0 Shareholder interest regulated companies 5 3.0 3.0 Shareholder interest non-regulated companies 5 1.7 1.7 Miscellaneous 6 11.9 11.9 Post tax cash flow 88.8 65.3 23.5 Arising from Business Arising from In-force at New Business 1 January in Year Total 2008 Note Million Million Million Net annual management fee 1 111.2 11.0 122.2 Unwind of surrender penalties 2 41.1 3.3 44.4 Margin arising from new business 3 10.0 10.0 Establishment expenses 4 7.2 65.0 72.2 Shareholder interest regulated companies 5 10.1 10.1 Shareholder interest non-regulated companies 5 6.9 6.9 Miscellaneous 6 11.5 11.5 Post tax cash flow 91.4 67.3 24.1 Notes The cash result is unaudited and differs from the IFRS result as it removes the non-cash items such as the DAC, DIR and the cost of expensing share options.
T he net annual management fee is the income on the funds under management that the Group retains after payment of the associated costs.
Broadly speaking the Group retains around 1% pre-tax of funds under management and therefore the net annual management fee will increase or decrease in line with funds under management.
Over the course of 2009 funds under management have benefited from the new money invested by clients and the strong recovery in the level of the world stock markets.
The income for the year at 133.1 million was up 9% over the prior year.
U nwind of surrender penalty relates to the reserving methodology applied to the surrender penalties within the charging structure of the single premium life and pension plans.
At the outset of these plans we establish a liability net of the outstanding surrender penalty which would apply if the policy were to be encashed.
As the surrender penalty reduces to zero, so the liability to the policyholder is enhanced by increasing their funds by 1% per annum over the first six years of the product life, to correspond to this unwind of the surrender penalty.
In other words there is a cash transfer from the shareholder to the policyholder.
This cash outflow has increased from 44.4 million to 45.2 million due to net inflows and the increase in the level of the stock markets.
T he margin arising from new business reflects the net cash impact of the new business contribution less the associated directly attributable expenses.
The negative cash flow increased in the year to 12.0 million 2008: 10.0 million as a result of higher pension business in the year.
Establishment expenses are the post tax expenses of running the Groups infrastructure.
During 2009 these expenses were 4% lower than the prior year at 69.0 million 2008: 72.2 million.
S hareholder interest is the income accruing on the investments and cash held by the Group and is shown separately for both the regulated and non-regulated companies.
Given the lower prevailing interest rates in the year the combined level of income has fallen from 17.0 million to 4.7 million.
Miscellaneous represents the cash result of the business not covered in any of the other categories.
It will include miscellaneous product charges, reserving changes, experience variances and the income excluding interest and expenses included within the other operations of the business.
The miscellaneous cash result for the current year at 11.9 million was at a similar level to the prior year.
As noted last year, 2008 benefited from a number of one-offs, including a 7.4 million positive tax impact.
2009 has also benefited from one-offs, including a positive 2.5 million reduction in insurance reserves due to stock market increases, and a positive 4.0 million emerging from an internal reassurance company that we established during 2008.
Ordinarily shareholders should expect a small positive miscellaneous cash result.

The expected maturities have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Surrenders and part surrenders are those amounts where clients have chosen to withdraw money from their plan.
Surrenders are assumed to occur in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit based on actual experience, updated on an annual basis, by plan duration and the age of the client.
The implied surrender rate shown in the table above is very much a simple average and it should not be assumed that small movements in this rate will result in a change to the embedded value assumptions.
Net Inflow of Funds under Management The table below shows the net inflow of funds under management and the inflow as a percentage of opening funds under management.

After reading this statement I hope shareholders will agree with my opening remark that the business demonstrated both resilience in the first half of the year whilst in the second half of the year our business recovered strongly.
