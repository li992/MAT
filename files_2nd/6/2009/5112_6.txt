20 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 q FINANCIAL REVIEW Reported profit before tax for the year ended 30 September 2009 was The business continues to 54.7 million including 11.0 million profit on the disposal of three Airbus A321 aircraft, acquired as part of the GB Airways acquisition and sold during generate strong operating the year.
Excluding this profit on sale, the underlying profit before tax for the year was 43.7 million: this compares to an underlying profit before tax in cash flow and ends the year 2008, excluding the one-off costs associated with the integration of GB Airways, of 123.1 million.
GB Airways is now fully integrated into the easyJet with over 1 billion in liquid business and therefore its results are not separately identifiable.
However, it should be noted that the comparative period to these results includes only funds, a strong balance sheet eight months of GB Airways activity.
Results this year have been significantly impacted by the following factors: and significant undrawn q Fuel prices and hedging financing in place.
q US dollar and euro exchange rates q Reduction in aircraft utilisation Fuel prices and hedging Total fuel cost amounted to 807.2 million in 2009, an increase of 13.9% compared to 2008, equating to a cost per seat of 15.28, up 1.63 per seat or 11.9%.
The average market price for jet fuel during 2009 was $595 per metric tonne excluding fees and taxes compared to $1,070 in 2008, driven by the extraordinary spike in fuel prices during that year.
However, after taking account of hedging taken out in 2008 during the period of high fuel prices, easyJets effective price for 2009 was $951 per metric tonne compared to $948 in 2008.
With the effective US dollar price broadly flat for 2009 compared to 2008, the increase in fuel cost per seat is largely driven by the strengthening of the US dollar against sterling, partly mitigated by US dollar hedging.
Despite the introduction of additional heavier A320 aircraft into the fleet and an increase in the average load factor of 1.4ppt, average fuel burn for the year was 715 US gallons per block hour compared to 717 in 2008, principally reflecting the implementation of fuel conservation initiatives.
US dollar and euro exchange rates The market rate for the US dollar strengthened by 22% from an average rate of 1.99 in 2008 to 1.56 in 2009: after taking account of hedging, easyJets effective rate strengthened from an average of 1.96 in 2008 to 1.78 in 2009.
The business has no US dollar revenues but significant US dollar costs for fuel, aircraft leases, maintenance and some loan interest and consequently the 9% movement in the effective dollar rate had a significant impact on financial performance.
The euro has strengthened by 12% from an average rate of 1.32 in 2008 to 1.16 in 2009.
Approximately 42% of revenues and 31% of costs principally ground handling, airport and navigation charges and some crew costs are denominated in euro resulting in a net long position: the strengthening of the euro, therefore, delivers a positive impact to the results.
For the first time this year some hedging of the euro surplus has also been undertaken.

22 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 q FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Total revenue Costs Total revenue in 2009 grew by 12.9% to 2,666.8 million which equates 2009 2009 2008 2008 to 50.47 per seat, representing a growth of 4.96 per seat or 10.9%.

Despite the Merchant fees and 16.0% increase in average aircraft during the period, capacity in terms of seats commissions 33.5 0.64 33.7 0.65 flown increased by only 1.8% as a result of the decision to reduce flying activity Aircraft and passenger particularly through the winter.

Passenger revenue per seat increased by 5.9% to 40.70 but on a constant Total costs currency basis fell by 1.9%.
This reduction in revenue per seat in the current economic environment, taking into account the expected dilution from an Total cost per seat excluding fuel was up 16.5% or 4.87 per seat to 34.36 in increase in the checked bag charge, is testament to the strength of the 2009, compared to 2008.

cost base is denominated in these currencies, this has had a significant impact on unit costs.
Excluding the impact of exchange rates, cost per seat excluding fuel was up 6.2% or 1.83 per seat compared to last year.
Ancillary revenue Ancillary revenue increased by 40.6% to 516.3 million in 2009, driven mainly The impact of the reduction in global interest rates has had a significant impact by increases in the checked bag charge.
Bag charge revenue delivered on interest income in the year: interest income in 2009 at 18.4 million was 238.1 million in 2009, an increase of 94.0 million or 65.2% compared 30.5 million lower than the 48.9 million reported in 2008.
These changes in to the previous year.
As expected, this has been accompanied by a small interest rates are largely out of easyJets control so, excluding the impact of this yield dilution, but with approximately 70% of passengers having checked reduction, operating cost per seat excluding fuel and at constant currency baggage, the net result is positive.
Speedy Boarding continues to deliver was up 3.9% compared to 2008.
On a cost per ASK basis, excluding fuel, a strong performance.
costs increased by 13.6% but on a constant currency basis by just 3.5%.
Again, excluding the impact of interest income, this figure falls to 1.3%.
As a result of the reduction in winter flying activity and utilisation, unit cost measures are adversely impacted as non-variable costs are spread over relatively fewer units of production.
23 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Overview Business review q Governance Accounts Other information Ground handling Maintenance Ground handling cost per seat at constant currency was up 0.27 or 6.6% Maintenance cost per seat at constant currency was down 0.12 or 4.1% compared to 2008.
Approximately 61% of ground handling costs are now compared to 2008.
The net reduction in unit cost mainly reflects the benefit denominated in euro, up 6ppt from 2008.
The drivers of this increase include of the reduction in the number of leased aircraft as the Boeing 737-700s airport mix, as presence continues to be increased in the top European have started to leave the fleet partly offset by the full year costs of the airports estimated impact 0.14 per seat, the full year effect of PRM new in-house maintenance planning function.
During the year, 12 leased Passengers with Reduced Mobility charges and increased adverse weather Boeing 737-700s and four leased ex GB A320s were returned to lessors.
Approximately 35% of maintenance costs are denominated in US dollar and 21% in euro.
Airport charges At the end of the year, negotiations were completed with SR Technics Airport cost per seat at constant currency was up 0.59 or 7.8% compared on a new maintenance contract which will deliver savings of around to 2008.
Approximately 58% of these costs are denominated in euro, 175 million over the 11 year life of the contract.
The key driver of this increase has been over-inflation price rises in airport passenger related charges at a number of Insurance and other costs locations across the network, increasing costs by approximately 30 million.
Other costs per seat at constant currency were up 0.17 or 9.3% compared Significant increases have occurred at Gatwick, Luton, Amsterdam and to 2008.
The main drivers of this per seat increase were reduced utilisation at all Spanish and Italian airports.
Mix continues to impact as we increase and an increase in disruption costs driven by bad weather in the winter our presence in the top European airports.
In a specific response to the partially offset by the profit on the Boeing spares optimisation project, uneconomic level of charges at Luton, easyJet announced in September as reported in the first half of the financial year.
2009 that it would remove some flying for 2010 and redeploy aircraft to more profitable activity elsewhere.
Crew Crew cost per seat at constant currency was up 0.44 or 8.7% compared to 2008.
An increasing proportion of these costs are denominated in non-sterling currencies as more overseas contracts are introduced and approximately 25% of these costs are now denominated in euro and 9% in Swiss franc.
The increase in unit costs has been driven by last years crew pay deal which was linked to August 2008 RPI, the increased costs associated with the introduction of overseas contracts a necessary part of the expansion strategy into continental Europe and maintaining higher than required crew numbers over the winter, whilst there was reduced aircraft utilisation, as these crew were required for the summer activity.
Crew costs continue to be a key area of management focus with significant opportunities for efficiency improvement in the medium term.

The average number of aircraft during the year was 174.1, up 16.0% compared to the previous year.
The number per seat of non-operational aircraft increased by nine compared to last year principally 1.19 1.85 due to aircraft held for sale and an increase in aircraft in maintenance as easyJet prepared aircraft for return to lessors.
There were 35 additions during the year, 31 debt financed and four cash financed: 12 Boeing 737-700s and four ex-GB A320s were returned to lessors and three ex-GB A321s 0.64 were sold.
0.07 1.63 2.37 Net ownership costs include interest income which has fallen from 48.9 million in 2008 to 18.4 million in 2009, a fall of 30.5 million due to the dramatic drop in market interest rates and despite cash balances and money market deposits rising from 863 million at 30 September 2008 to 0.83 1,075 million at 30 September 2009.

Profit after tax and return on equity At the end of 2009, favourable resolution was reached with HMRC on a prior year tax matter resulting in the release of a provision.
This release has contributed to an effective tax credit rate for the year of 30.2% compared to an effective tax charge rate of 24.5% in 2008.
For 2010 the effective tax rate is expected to be a charge of 25%.
The tax provision release also had a significant impact on the return on equity in 2009.
For the year it was 5.5% compared to 6.8% in 2008, a fall of 1.3 percentage points.
Although underlying profit before tax fell by 64.5%, retained profit, significantly impacted by the tax provision release, fell by only 14.4%.
With shareholders funds broadly flat year on year, the resultant return on equity is therefore only down by 1.3 percentage points.
Basic earnings per share, at 16.9 pence, is down 14.6% compared to 2008, reflecting the significant drop in retained profit, being offset, to a large extent, by the tax provision release.
In line with established policy, no dividends have been paid or proposed in the year ended 30 September 2009 or during the comparative accounting period.
