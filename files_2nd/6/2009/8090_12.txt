All of our businesses were impacted to a lesser or greater extent, As well as the increase in adjusted so we are pleased with these financial results which operating profit, we are pleased by the demonstrate the strength of a balanced portfolio and way the Group has continued to convert an ability to manage costs proactively when demand profit into cash.
Free cash flow generated is reduced.
Adjusted operating profit increased to 309.5m Adam Walker, Finance Director 2008: 305.8m driven by an increase in the adjusted operating margin from 23.9% to 25.3%.
The increase in adjusted operating profit and margin demonstrates the benefits of our early actions to adapt our cost base to the very challenging trading conditions.
These actions offset a 4% reduction in 2009 revenues to 1,222m 2008: 1,278m.
As well as the increase in adjusted operating profit, we are pleased by the way the Group has continued to convert profit into cash.
Free cash flow generated by the Group was 223.8m up 7%.
adjusted and statutory Results In this Financial Review we refer to adjusted and statutory results.
Adjusted results are prepared to provide a more comparable indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
translation Impact The Group generates the majority of its revenue overseas, and with most currencies strengthening against sterling over the year, there was a benefit to the 2009 revenue and adjusted operating profits over 2008 of approximately 120m and 40m respectively.
The largest exposure is to US dollars with approximately 45% of Group revenue generated in USD and currencies pegged to the USD.
Each 1 cent movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa 3.5m impact on revenue and a circa 1.1m impact on operating profits.
Offsetting any negative impact on operating profits are decreases to interest payable and tax payable.
For bank debt covenant testing purposes, profit and debt translation is calculated at the average rate of exchange throughout the relevant period.
Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 19 the Year in Review FInancIal RevIew continued Business segments Revenue and adjusted operating profit by division are set out below together with the respective actual and organic growth rates.
As highlighted last year we have simplified the financial reporting of divisions in 2009 to represent better the way the Group is managed, namely around its publishing and events and training revenue streams.

There were no material acquisitions made during 2009.
Organic revenue declined by 14% reflecting a strong performance in our publishing businesses, up 2%, but emphasising the tough trading environment for Events and Training businesses, where revenues declined by 27%.
We proactively removed around a quarter of events, principally training courses and similar local language conferences, from our portfolio due to reduced levels of demand.
Large scale events held up well.
20 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 operating Profit Adjusted operating profit increased marginally to 309.5m 2008: 305.8m.
Organic adjusted operating profit declined by 12%, with an increase of 8% by the publishing businesses offset by a 41% fall at events and training.
The events and training businesses have a significant element of variable cost, including profit share, which for some people is the largest part of their remuneration.
This has ensured that business unit heads are focused on cost containment at all times, ensuring a swift response to the dramatic fall in business demand.
Consequently, although their revenue declined by 108.8m, by reducing the cost base the fall in profits was restricted to 40.4m.
This shows the operational gearing within events and training where we anticipate an opposite effect when economic conditions improve.
Statutory operating profit declined by 11% to 145.7m 2008: 164.6m, resulting principally from the decline in revenue and the 16.8m increase in restructuring and reorganisation costs.
Restructuring and Reorganisation costs Restructuring and reorganisation costs for the year of 34.1m 2008: 17.3m largely reflect the cost to the businesses of responding to changing market conditions and of the corporate redomicile.
These include redundancy costs of 18.0m 2008: 9.9m, vacant property provisions of 4.7m 2008: 3.6m, reorganisation costs of 5.0m 2008: 1.4m, and aborted acquisition costs of 2.1m 2008: 0.6m.
In addition, we incurred 4.3m 2008: nil of professional fees in connection with the redomicile of the ultimate parent company.
The 27.7m of restructuring costs are expected to deliver annualised savings of approximately 40m.
net Finance costs Finance costs net of interest receivable, decreased by 24.2m to 48.2m mainly as a result of the decline in market interest rates and the reduction in debt resulting from the net proceeds of the rights issue 242m received in May 2009.
Around 75% of our borrowings are hedged through fixed interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2009 the weighted average life of the swaps was 1.5 years with a weighted average interest rate of 4.93%.
Profit Before tax Adjusted profit before tax increased by 12% to 261.3m 2008: 233.4m and adjusted profit for the year also increased by 12% to 193.1m 2008: 172.5m.
taxation Across the Group, tax has been provided on adjusted profits at an adjusted tax rate of 26.1% 2008: 26.1%.
This adjusted tax rate benefits from profits generated in low tax jurisdictions.
The Group tax credit on statutory profit before tax was 10.4% 2008: charge 21.1%.
The restructuring of the group has resulted in the release of a 34.3m deferred tax liability for the difference between the accounting and tax value of certain group assets.
earnings and Dividend Statutory diluted EPS of 18.83p 2008: 16.79p restated is 12% ahead of 2008 and adjusted diluted EPS of 34.27p 2008: 33.92p restated is 1% ahead of 2008.
The Board has proposed a second interim dividend of 7.85p per share 2008: 3.28p per share restated, in line with the Groups existing dividend policy.
This dividend will be paid on 19 May 2010 to ordinary shareholders registered as of the close of business on 16 April 2010.
This will result in a total dividend for the year of 11.45p per share 2008: 8.41p per share restated.
Dividend cover will be 3 times on an adjusted earnings basis.
The 2008 comparative per share earnings and dividend numbers have been restated to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue.

In addition, a number of smaller bolt on acquisitions have also been completed.

The return on capital employed over this period is 8.9%, ahead of the Groups current weighted average cost of capital.
cash Flow The Group continues to generate strong cash flows and this is reflected in a cash conversion rate, expressed as a ratio of operating cash flow as calculated below to adjusted operating profit, of 105% 2008: 110%.
2009 2008 m m Adjusted operating profit 309.5 305.8 Depreciation of PP&E 9.2 10.8 Software amortisation 13.5 5.2 Impairment of available-for-sale investments 0.2 Share-based payments 0.6 0.5 EBITDA 332.8 322.5 Net capital expenditure 22.0 34.9 Working capital movement net of restructuring and reorganisation accruals 13.0 48.6 Operating cash flow 323.8 336.2 Restructuring and reorganisation cash flow 26.3 19.2 Net interest 46.4 67.8 Taxation 27.3 39.2 Free cash flow 223.8 210.0 Acquisitions less disposals 38.5 13.6 Dividends 38.2 73.9 Net issue of shares 252.3 0.7 Net funds flow 399.4 149.0 Opening net debt 1,341.8 1,244.9 Non-cash items 2.0 1.5 Foreign exchange 71.8 244.4 Closing net debt 872.6 1,341.8 In the year ended 31 December 2009, before taking into account financing activities, spend on acquisitions or proceeds from the sale of assets, the Group generated free cash flow of 223.8m 2008: 210.0m.
This demonstrates the ability of the Group to deleverage quickly.
22 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 The change to net debt arising from acquisitions net of disposals was a 38.5m outflow 2008: 13.6m inflow which comprises current year acquisitions of 13.2m 2008: 5.7m and consideration in respect of acquisitions completed in prior years of 25.3m 2008: 10.6m.
There were no material disposals during the year 2008: 29.9m.
In the prior year the Group disposed of its interest in Map of Medicine for net cash consideration of 33.6m generating a gain on disposal of 17.8m profit on disposal.
We have robust criteria for assessing acquisitions and we target acquisitions and alliances that accelerate our strategic development and meet our financial criteria.
Net debt decreased by 469.2m from 1,341.8m to 872.6m reflecting cash flow of 399.4m, including the rights issue net proceeds of 242m, and favourable exchange movements of 71.8m.
During the year the Group paid 38.2m in relation to the 2008 final and the 2009 first interim dividends.
Financing and Bank covenants The Group has in place a single credit agreement which comprises an amortising term loan facility, fully drawn in three currency tranches, and a non-amortising 500m multicurrency revolving credit facility.
The rights issue proceeds were used to prepay the scheduled 2009 and 2010 term loan repayments, leaving term loan balances at 31 December 2009 of 828m drawn in US dollar 630m, Euro 135m, and Sterling 316m.
The term loan and revolving credit facilities mature in May 2012 and we expect there to be comfortable headroom on our facilities through to that date.
The principal financial covenant ratios under these facilities are maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually.
At 31 December 2009 both financial covenants were comfortably achieved, with the ratio of net debt using average exchange rates to EBITDA reduced from 3.8 times at 31 December 2008 to 2.7 times at 31 December 2009.

The rights issue raised 242m, net of expenses of 13m.
Balance sheet Deferred income, which represents income received in advance, was down 2% on a constant currency basis at 31 December 2009 compared to the same date in 2008.
Deferred income arises primarily from advance subscriptions or forward bookings for trade shows, exhibitions or conferences.
Subscriptions generated by our academic journal business renew annually a year in advance and many trade shows and exhibitions, because of their market leading status, receive commitments up to a year in advance.

The revised funding schedule extends over the next nine years, requiring the Group to pay into the pension fund an additional 1m in 2010, rising annually by 1m to an additional 4m per annum in 2013 through to 2018.
Revised deficit funding plans have also been agreed for the two smaller defined benefit schemes.
The Group will pay additional pension contributions of 0.4m in 2010 rising to 0.9m per annum in 2013 through to 2018. adam walker Finance Director Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 23
