The factors listed below are among those that the Group thinks could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.
Risk management is an important element of the system of internal control.
This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute assurance against material loss.
The risk management process involves making all managers within the Group responsible for risk management and for ensuring that a full assessment of risks, both financial and non-financial has been completed.
This is achieved by a bottom-up and top-down review of risks throughout the Group, from which, a Group Risk Matrix the Matrix has been developed.
This process has embedded risk management within the operational and executive management throughout the Group.
The Matrix is reviewed twice a year.
Overall responsibility for the risk management process lies with the Executive Committee, which consists of the Executive Directors and certain other senior Executives who report to the Chief Executive.
Details of the Executive Directors and the other members of the Executive Committee are given on pages 34 to 36.
An overview of the process is presented below.
The latest review of risks was undertaken in the light of the current economic outlook.
The Matrix includes an assessment of the impact of the economy on risks identified by the Group.
