ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 29 Financial Review Group Performance The Groups financial results for the year ended 31 December 2009, whilst weaker than 2008, nonetheless reflected a resilient performance.
The Groups Underlying EBITDA for 2009 of US$1,462 million 2008: US$4,161 million was significantly impacted by lower commodity prices in 2009 and fell 64.9%.
The decline in revenue was partially offset by managements cost control initiatives, lower distribution costs, and the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge against the US dollar.
Revenue for 2009 decreased 43.9%, or US$2,992 million, to US$3,831 million 2008: US$6,823 million whilst like-for-like revenue decreased 41.9% to US$3,507 million 2008: US$6,040 million.
Lower average commodity prices accounted for nearly all of the decline in revenue, with the Ferroalloys Division accounting for more than 75% of the decline in Group revenue, the Iron Ore Division 14% and the Alumina and Aluminium Division 10%.
Cost of sales decreased 6.8%, or US$141 million, to US$1,947 million 2008: US$2,088 million, whilst like-for-like Cost of sales declined 13.1%, or $232 million, to US$1,539 million 2008: US$1,771 million.
Managements cost control initiatives and lower prices led to a fall in the costs of materials used, as well as savings on energy, labour, repair and maintenance costs.
In addition, the Cost of sales decrease was enhanced by the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge against the US dollar, in which some 75% of the Groups Cost of sales are denominated.
These reductions were partially offset by the destocking of inventory with a higher inventory cost carried over from 2008 and foreign currency hedging losses of US$61 million.
Included in cost of sales for the first time was MET of US$166 million Royalties 2008: US$48 million.
Distribution costs decreased 15.1%, or US$65 million, to US$366 million 2008: US$431 million.
The decrease was mainly due to a fall in transportation costs as a result of the Ferroalloys Division selling greater quantities to neighbouring China, instead of the Groups traditional and more distant markets such as North America and Western Europe, coupled with the Energy Divisions lower third-party coal sales volumes.
Partially offsetting these reductions were increased transportation costs in the Iron Ore Division, driven by sales to China and the change in delivery terms from Delivered at Frontier DAF to First Carrier FCA.
The devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge and the weakening of the Russian rouble had a favourable effect on the Groups Distribution costs reducing Kazakhstan and Russian railway tariffs in US dollar terms.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 14.9%, or US$63 million, to US$359 million 2008: US$422 million.
This was principally due to savings in taxes other than income tax, professional and other services as well as lower provisioning for impairment of trade and other receivables.
Other operating income included a one-off foreign exchange gain resulting from the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge, amounting to US$210 million for 2009.
The Groups Operating profit decreased 64.3% or US$2,476 million, to US$1,374 million 2008: US$3,850 million realising an operating profit margin of 35.9% 2008: 56.4%.
The Ferroalloys Division contributed 77% of this fall, US$1,908 million: the Iron Ore Division 15%, US$382 million: and the Alumina and Aluminium Division 9%, US$213 million.

Capital expenditure equates to additions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, which differs from the Capital expenditure spend, which represents the cash outflows to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
We have enhanced the presentation of capital expenditure, designating it as either expansionary or sustaining.
Expansionary capital expenditure refers to investments made to drive future growth through increasing production capacities, and may include the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment or the upgrade or expansion of existing facilities.
Sustaining capital expenditure refers to investments designed to keep existing operations running at their current levels and may include major cyclical capital repairs or the replacement of existing property, plant and equipment.

Deferred projects amount to US$0.5 billion.
For the full year 2010, total capital expenditure is expected to be approximately US$1.5 billion, including sustaining capital expenditure of around US$0.4 billion.
Capital expenditure on BML remains contingent on the project proceeding.
This is dependent upon certain outstanding approvals and the Government of Brazil proceeding with the construction of a rail link.
With the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Chambishi Metals PLC, a Zambian copper and cobalt producer, the Group stated its plans for capital expenditure of about US$80 million.
The capital expenditure would be for new and upgraded production facilities, scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011, and increase Chambishis copper production capacity to 55 kt per annum of LME Grade A copper cathode.
Contractual obligations Long-term supply agreements The Group has the following key long-term supply agreements: Alumina ENRC has a contract with UC RUSAL, a large aluminium producer, to supply a minimum of 1.2 million tonnes of alumina per annum.
The contract expires on 31 December 2016.
Pricing is determined by a formula linked to the LME aluminium price: and Iron ore ENRC has a contract with MMK, a large Russian steel producer to supply up to 15 million tonnes per annum of saleable iron ore concentrate and pellet.
Pricing is determined by reference to published price indices for iron ore concentrates and pellets.
Across a number of customer contracts some reduction in contractual volumes has taken place to date, and this may continue depending on market conditions.
