14 John Zimmerman Finance Director During the difficult economic conditions of 2009, we took a number of actions to protect the business by reducing the cost base and strengthening the balance sheet.
These actions have positioned us well to capitalise on profitable growth opportunities and generate higher operating margins.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW Operating results Introduction During 2009, changes were made to the Groups internal reporting structure to assist the Board in focusing on the performance of the Groups ongoing businesses.
Distinction is now drawn between those of the Groups continuing operations that are ongoing and those that have been exited but do not meet the conditions to be classified as discontinued operations.
An explanation of the changes is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Comparative information for 2008 and 2007 has been re-presented to reflect these changes.
At the beginning of 2009, we adopted an amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Comparative figures presented throughout the Operating and Financial Review have been restated to reflect the retrospective application of the amendment, which had the effect of reducing the Groups operating profit by $0.5 million in 2008 and by $0.3 million in 2007.
We assess the financial performance of our businesses using a variety of measures.
Certain of these measures are particularly important and we have termed them key performance measures.
We refer to these key performance measures, which include non-GAAP measures, throughout the Operating and Financial Review.
An explanation of each key performance measure is provided on pages 151 to 153.
Reconciliations of operating profit to adjusted operating profit for the Group as a whole and for each ongoing segment, and an analysis identifying the underlying change in sales and adjusted operating profit for each ongoing segment are presented on pages 154 to 158.

Taxation The Groups central tax function is responsible for planning and managing the tax affairs of the Group efficiently within the various local tax jurisdictions in which we operate, so as to achieve the lowest cash tax charge in compliance with local tax regulations.
At the end of 2009, the Group recognised income tax liabilities amounting to $94.7 million 2008: $81.4 million, including a provision for uncertain tax positions of $79.5 million 2008: $63.5 million.
Income tax recoverable was $49.0 million 2008: $47.6 million.
At the end of 2009, the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset of $57.6 million, including $21.7 million in respect of tax losses and tax credits.
Deferred tax assets of $783.7 million were not recognised in respect of tax losses and tax credits carried forward because it is not considered probable that taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities were not recognised on retained profits of foreign subsidiaries and associates amounting to $3,225.7 million because the Group is able to control the remittance of those profits to the UK and it is probable that they will not be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Income tax may be payable on these amounts if there is a change in circumstances.

4 Post-employment benefit obligations represent the Groups expected cash contributions to its defined benefit plans in 2010.
It is not practicable to present expected cash contributions for subsequent years because they are determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits.
5 A purchase obligation is an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally-binding on the Group and that specifies all significant terms, including: the fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased: fixed, minimum or variable price provisions: and the approximate timing of the transaction.
6 We have not included in the table the Groups provision for uncertain tax positions of $79.5 million because it is not practicable to reliably estimate the timing of the related cash outflows in future years as these cash flows will only be determined after final audit by the tax authorities of previously-filed tax returns.
Off-balance sheet arrangements The Group has not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement that is considered to be an off-balance sheet arrangement that is required to be disclosed under applicable regulations, other than operating lease commitments that are analysed in note 44 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Companys and the Groups financial statements.

We publish an interim management statement during the first and second half of the financial year that describes the Groups performance during the relevant period, its financial position at the end of the period and the effect of any material events or transactions that have taken place.
We also publish a half-yearly report that includes an interim management report and condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Statements.
