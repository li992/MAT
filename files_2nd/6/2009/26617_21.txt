Financial Performance Man Group plc Annual Report 2009 67 Financial Review Key performance indicators and financial objectives To measure our progress against our strategy we selected four Key Performance Indicators KPIs in 2008: growth in funds under management: growth in revenue: growth in diluted earnings per share: and post-tax return on equity.
These KPIs are shown on pages 4 and 5 in the Strategy and KPIs overview section, together with two further KPIs, which we have added in 2009, being the excess shortfall of our fund product performance compared to appropriate benchmarks for private investor products and institutional products.
Growing earnings per share and maintaining a high level of post-tax return on equity continue to be the basis for the Groups financial objectives and are also the performance criteria used for the Groups long-term incentive schemes, as the Board believes that long-term shareholder value will be achieved through continued delivery of these objectives.
Earnings per share is a measure that encapsulates the primary drivers of financial performance for the Group.
The earnings metric includes management and other fee income which is the measure of revenue that results from growing funds under management and performance fee income from the investment performance of the funds.
The management of pre-tax margins as we grow demonstrates our ability to control our expense base.
The denominator of average shares outstanding reflects our policy of share repurchases and cancellation.
Return on equity is the measure to enable us to assess whether we are utilising shareholders equity efficiently.
Earnings per share Adjusted diluted earnings per share on continuing operations for the year decreased 37% to 57.0 cents, compared to 90.2 cents for the prior year.
Adjusting items in 2009 include the accelerated amortisation of MGS sales commissions recorded in the first half, restructuring costs and impairment provisions relating to Ore Hill investments and the residual holding in MF Global.
Further details can be found in Note 2 to the financial statements.
Statutory diluted earnings per share on continuing operations declined 69% in the year to 28.4 cents.
As part of the Companys distribution policy shares are repurchased and cancelled using excess reserves.
During the year 30.5 million shares were repurchased and cancelled at a total cost of $280 million.
This was earnings enhancing, resulting in a 0.9% accretion to diluted earnings per share.
Return on equity ROE The Groups post-tax return on shareholders equity for continuing operations for the year was 13.5% 2008: 41.6%.
This excludes the loss arising on the residual interest in brokerage assets in 2009 and the earnings, and the profit on sale, of MF Global in 2008, and the equity base excludes the residual investment in MF Global and the proceeds from the sale in 2008.
The average equity for the year was $4.4 billion 2008: $4.1 billion.
The decrease in ROE is primarily the result of lower average FUM resulting in lower management fee income and lower performance fee income compared to the prior year.
The ROE for 2009 is 20% higher than the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 11.2%.
The performance criteria for the Performance Share Plan PSP awards to executive directors and senior management are based on the Groups average ROE over a three year period, with no award vesting unless the Group maintains an average annual ROE of at least 20% with full vesting only achieved if the average annual ROE reaches 30%.
As a result of the lower ROE achieved in 2009, the 2006 PSP awards will vest below 100% and the 2007 and 2008 awards are likely to vest at lower levels than achieved historically.
Funds Under Management FUM FUM is a key driver behind the Groups results and prospects, as it forms the basis from which the Groups revenue is generated.
Movements in FUM during the year are shown below: Private Investor 2009 2008 Guaranteed Open-ended Total Institutional Total Total $bn $bn $bn $bn $bn $bn Opening FUM 1 April 2008 31.0 12.5 43.5 31.1 74.6 61.7 Sales 6.1 5.2 11.3 3.6 14.9 15.9 Redemptions 4.6 4.5 9.1 7.9 17.0 10.7 Net sales 1.5 0.7 2.2 4.3 2.1 5.2 Investment movement 1.8 0.3 1.5 5.1 6.6 5.6 FX 1.7 0.3 2.0 2.2 4.2 4.0 fide-risking 12.1 12.1 12.1 Other 0.5 1.8 2.3 0.5 2.8 1.9 Closing FUM 31 March 2009 16.4 11.4 27.8 19.0 46.8 74.6 Man Group plc 68 Annual Report 2009 Financial Review continued Sales and redemptions A further analysis of sales and redemptions by half year is given below, together with redemption rates: Private investor H2 2009 H1 2009 H2 2008 H1 2008 Sales $bn : Guaranteed 2.4 3.7 1.3 3.2 Open-ended 1.8 3.4 2.3 1.0 4.2 7.1 3.6 4.2 Redemptions $bn : Guaranteed 2.6 2.0 1.9 1.3 Open-ended 3.5 1.0 1.2 0.8 6.1 3.0 3.1 2.1 Annualised redemptions average FUM % : Guaranteed 24.2 13.9 12.4 9.0 Open-ended 54.7 15.0 21.0 16.5 Institutional H2 2009 H1 2009 H2 2008 H1 2008 Sales $bn 0.5 3.1 4.3 3.8 Redemptions $bn 4.9 3.0 3.2 2.3 Annualised redemptions average FUM % 42.8 20.7 21.7 17.3 The increase in private investor open-ended redemptions in the second half of 2009 followed strong sales in the first half and strong performance from AHL, which returned 8% in the financial year.
This is a pattern that has often been seen in the past.
Although the increase in private investor guaranteed redemptions was higher in the second half of 2009, the redemption rate increased significantly as a result of the decline in guaranteed FUM following the MGS fide-risking exercise.
Institutional redemptions also increased significantly in the second half of 2009 as investors looked to balance their portfolios and took liquidity where it was available.
Investment movement The investment performance of our investment managers is described in the Investment Management section starting on page 30.

This has also had an impact on our non-US dollar fee income in the year, which has been lower by approximately $23 million in US dollar terms as a result of movements in average exchange rates for 2009 compared to 2008, primarily in relation to the weakening of the Australian dollar.
This impact has been offset by favourable exchange rate movements in relation to our operating costs, a significant proportion of which are denominated in sterling and Swiss francs.
The weakening of sterling against the US dollar during the year, partly offset by the strengthening of Swiss francs, has reduced our costs in 2009 in US dollar terms by approximately $18 million.
fide-risking The reduction of investment exposure across the MGS product range to protect investor capital and the associated product rebalancing, which was primarily undertaken in the third quarter of the financial year, has now been completed.
This reduced FUM by $12.1 billion.
Certain MGS products retain an ability to increase their investment exposure, and these will do so progressively from 1 April 2009.
Further details on the MGS fide-risking can be found on page 31.
Other movements These include: the net effect in the change of leverage relating to redemptions and prior year sales of $2.0 billion: maturities of $0.7 billion: return of capital of the China Methane Recovery Fund of $0.5 billion: restructuring of an Ore Hill fund of $0.4 billion: partially offset by the acquisition of our share of Ore Hill FUM of $0.8 billion.

the decrease in FUM, this cost-saving initiative was designed to reduce the Groups fixed cost base by $60 million on an annual run-rate basis.
Excluding the restructuring costs discussed in the section on Adjusted earnings below, compensation costs have decreased by $176 million to $463 million from $639 million in the comparable period, reflecting the decrease in discretionary employee bonus compensation partly offset by the impact of a higher headcount.
Compensation as a percentage of revenue was 20.8% compared to 20.2% last year.
We continue to maintain tight controls and significant cost flexibility Man Group plc 70 Annual Report 2009 Financial Review continued Review of Group Income Statement continued Following the transfer of a 50% interest in Pemba to Ore Hills principals as part of the acquisition of a 50% interest in Ore Hill, a book gain of $48 million was recognised.
Since this disposal, the credit markets have continued to deteriorate, which has severely affected the Pemba business.
Accordingly, Pemba has been restructured and as part of this exercise, in February 2009, the Group took back its 50% shareholding from the Ore Hill principals at nil cost, with no further profit or loss arising.
This is offset by the recognition of an impairment charge of $214 million against the carrying value of the Ore Hill investment, following a deterioration in market conditions since the acquisition, and $75 million against the carrying value of the Groups interest in Ore Hills Designated Investment portfolio.
Further details of the gain and these impairments are included in Note 2 to the financial statements.
In addition, the goodwill of $10 million relating to MTM was impaired.
Loss arising from residual interest in brokerage assets of $105 million primarily arose from the impairment of the Groups residual equity interest in MF Global further details are given in Note 2.
Group profit before tax from continuing operations was down 64% to $743 million, reflecting a 62% decrease in net performance fee income to $358 million, a 23% decrease in net management fee income to $885 million compared to last year and non-recurring costs adjusting items of $500 million as detailed above.
Adjusted Group profit before tax was down 40% to $1,243 million.
Adjusted pre-tax margin was 52% compared with 64% last year, reflecting reduced performance fees partly offset by reduced compensation expenses.
The tax charge for the year amounts to $240 million.
The effective tax rate on profits before the adjusting items is 20.3% tax charge of $253 million on profit before the adjusting items of $1,243 million, compared with 17.4% last year.
The prior year rate was lower principally as a result of favourable foreign exchange differences arising in the Groups Swiss entities, which did not recur in the current year.
Additionally, in the current year the tax rate increased as a result of losses on seed investments, which are generally subject to lower tax rates, and a reduction in tax relief on employee share schemes, as a result of the fall in the Groups share price impacting on the related deferred tax asset.
The effective tax rate for the year including the adjusting items is 32.3%.
The primary reason for this higher rate is that in respect of the majority of the adjusting items, tax relief is not available or has not been recognised given the uncertainty of recoverability of the potential deferred tax asset.
Revenue margins Gross management and other fees represent management fee income earned from funds under management, interest on loans to funds and other fees.
Gross margins, before interest income earned from funds, are negotiated directly with institutional investors and distributors of the private investor products.
These margins are also shown in the table below as this information is considered useful in analysing trends.
Loans to funds are made to facilitate rebalance and investing activities.
In the table below we have shown gross margins both including and excluding interest income earned on loans to funds.
Net margins are also shown to indicate the margin after deducting expenses as explained below.
The gross management and other fees margin before interest income for private investors was 420bp, compared to 429bp for the prior year.
The primary reasons for the reduction in the gross margin are: a switch in the relative proportion of total private investor FUM relating to guaranteed products relatively higher margin and open-ended products relatively lower margin such that the proportion of open-ended products has increased compared to the prior year impact: 7bp : and reduced fee loads on some MGS products prior to the MGS fide-risk exercise impact: 2bp.
The gross margin excluding interest income on guaranteed products is approximately 427bp and approximately 365bp on open-ended products.
The gross management and other fees margin for institutional investors was 94bp, compared with 100bp in the prior year.
The decrease in this margin is primarily a result of a reduction in management fee income as some of our larger, long-standing investors switched into new, lower fee earning products.
Excluding the margin impact of known redemptions from significant institutional investors, the gross management and other fees margin for institutional investors would have been slightly lower at 90bp.
Financial Performance Man Group plc Annual Report 2009 71 Review of Group Income Statement continued The net management fees margin excludes net finance income, which principally relates to interest income earned on free cash deposits less finance costs on the Groups debt, and also the adjusting items, which are deemed to be non-recurring.
The increase in compensation and other expenses has reduced net margins for private investors by around 11bp.
This is partly the result of: a higher proportion of variable compensation being allocated to management fee income in periods of reduced performance fee income: and the acceleration of the amortisation charge relating to previously issued share awards.
In addition, other expenses have increased, particularly in technology, to support the robustness of our infrastructure.
Sales commissions have reduced the net margins for private investors by around 10bp, reflecting the higher amortisation charge on upfront sales commissions.

Man Group plc 72 Annual Report 2009 Financial Review continued Review of Group Balance Sheet and Group Cash Flow Statement Cash balances increased $485 million in the year to $2,361 million.
Net of borrowings and issued debt the net cash position at year-end was $1,718 million, up from $1,474 million at the end of the prior year.
The movement of cash is analysed in the cash flow statement and our liquidity position is discussed further below.
Trade and other receivables primarily relates to fee income.
The decrease of $360 million from the prior year-end is largely offset by a decrease in trade and other payables, which primarily relate to commissions payments and accruals, including the compensation bonus accrual.
Investments in fund products comprises loans to fund products of $373 million up $4 million from 2008 and other investments in fund products, primarily relating to seeding investments, of $718 million down $561 million from 2008.
Loans to fund products are exposed to credit risk whereas other investments mainly seeding investments are primarily exposed to market risk.
An analysis of our seeding investments at the year-end is given in the table in the Group Income Statement section of this Financial Review on page 69.
The decrease reflects our strategy to reduce balance sheet exposure in the current volatile market conditions and also arises as a result of losses in the year.
In particular our exposure to MGS products is now significantly reduced.
The decrease in other investments to $184 million from $322 million at the end of the prior period is the result of the fall in value of our residual stake in MF Global and the sale of a large proportion of our remaining exchange shares, partly offset by the purchase of the Ore Hill DI portfolio.
The investment in joint ventures and associates relates to BlueCrest $217 million, Ore Hill $59 million and other smaller investments $41 million.
Goodwill of $774 million at the year-end primarily relates to RMF $621 million, with the remainder resulting from the acquisitions of Glenwood and our business in Australia.
Note 15 to the financial statements includes sensitivity analysis around the impairment of goodwill.
Although the FUM relating to RMF has declined significantly from last year-end to $16.1 billion, it is higher, and expected to remain so, than the $8.7 billion level at the time of our acquisition of RMF.
Other intangibles include upfront sales commissions now known as placement fees which have decreased to $317 million from $427 million at the prior year-end, although this decrease is primarily the result of the accelerated amortisation of upfront sales commissions on MGS products taken in the first half of the financial year.
At 31 March 2009, shareholders equity was $4.2 billion, compared to $4.7 billion at the prior year-end.
Major increases in shareholders equity during the period arose from the issue of $0.3 billion of perpetual capital securities and the retention of earnings during the year of $0.5 billion.
This was more than offset by the payment of ordinary dividends in the year of $0.7 billion, consideration paid for share repurchases of $0.3 billion and adverse foreign currency translation adjustments of $0.3 billion.
Equity capital is maintained to absorb losses and to provide the Group with capital flexibility to grow the business.
We calculate economic capital using a series of risk exposures and economic scenarios.
In addition the Group is subject to the regulatory capital regime of the Financial Services Authority in the UK, the Groups primary regulator.
