8 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Page t Financial re itle view The following review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related Notes on pages 64 to 118 of this Annual Report.
Overview Shire plc the Company and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as Shire or the Group has the mission to be the most valuable specialty biopharmaceutical company in the world that focuses on enabling people with life-altering conditions to lead better lives.
Shire focuses its business on ADHD, HGT and gastrointestinal GI diseases as well as opportunities in other therapeutic areas to the extent they arise through acquisitions.
Shires in-licensing, merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection and global rights.
Shire believes that a carefully selected and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively small-scale sales forces will deliver strong results.
Substantially all of the Groups revenues, expenditures and net assets are attributable to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two reporting segments: Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT.
The Group also earns royalties where Shire has outlicensed products to third-parties which are recorded as revenues.
Revenues are derived primarily from two sourcessales of the Groups own products and royalties: 90% 2008: 91% of total revenues are derived from product sales, of which 79% 2008: 83% are within Specialty Pharmaceuticals and 21% 2008: 17% are within HGT: and 9% of total revenues are derived from royalties 2008: 8%.
Shires strategic objectives are set using a balanced Scorecard approach.
Strategic and operational objectives are set at the corporate level and cascaded to the segment Specialty Pharmaceuticals HGT, therapeutic area and functional levels so that these objectives are aligned with the corporate objectives.
The Group therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management and uses key performance indicators KPIs to measure the achievement of these objectives.
For 2009, Shires corporate KPIs included certain financial and non financial measures.
The markets in which the Group conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated.
The healthcare industry is experiencing: pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs: increased research and development R&D costs as development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators: challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers: governments and healthcare systems favoring earlier entry of low-cost generic drugs: and higher marketing costs due to competition for market share.
Shires strategy to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry-wide competitive pressures.
This strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas.
Markets Historically, Shires portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the North American market.
The acquisition in 2005 of TKT and the consequent establishment of our HGT business and the acquisition of EQUASYM in 2009 which facilitated immediate access to the European ADHD market provided Shire with the platforms to increase its presence in Europe and the rest of the world RoW, thereby working towards diversifying the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market.
In 2009 the HGT business derived more than 75% of its revenues from outside of the US.
In addition to the marketed products and products in development obtained through the acquisition of TKT ELAPRASE, REPLAGAL and VPRIV, Shire has made significant progress on a path to geographic diversification with additional development and commercialization activities in 2009, including: continued roll-out of ELAPRASE in certain Latin American and RoW countries: continued roll-out of MEZAVANT, FOSRENOL and FIRAZYR in Europe: and the entering into a licensing arrangement for LIALDA MEZAVANT in Japan.
Shires long-term mission is to increase the proportion of its product sales from outside of the US and outside of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Canada by 2015.
Shire has late-stage development activities ongoing which are expected to further supplement the diversification of revenues in the future, including: VYVANSE launches in Canada and Latin American countries and the registration program for approval in the EU: VPRIV launches in the EU and certain Latin American countries: the continued roll out of FIRAZYR in certain European and Latin American countries: LIALDA MEZAVANT diverticulitis registration program: and the continued roll-out of FOSRENOL, LIALDA MEZAVANT and EQUASYM in EU and RoW countries.
R&D Over the last five years Shire has focused its R&D efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas, which meet the needs of the specialist physician, and has concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for later-stage pipeline products within these core therapeutic areas.
Evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the Groups development pipeline over the last five years.
Since January 2005, several products have received regulatory approval: in the US, DAYTRANA and ELAPRASE in 2006, LIALDA and VYVANSE in 2007, and INTUNIV in 2009: in the EU, FOSRENOL in 2005, ELAPRASE and MEZAVANT in 2007.
The Group had VPRIV in registration in the US and EU and filed a Biologics License Application BLA for REPLAGAL in the US at December 31, 2009.
In February 2010, Shire withdrew its December BLA filing for REPLAGAL, and, at the suggestion of the FDA, requested and received Fast Track designation.
Shire immediately initiated a rolling BLA submission in February.
Shires strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile.
R&D costs in 2010 will include expenditure on several pre-clinical to Phase 3 studies for products in development and Phase 3 b and Phase 4 studies to support recently launched products in the Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT businesses, together with the development of new projects in both the Specialty Pharmaceuticals and HGT businesses.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 9 Patents and market exclusivity The loss or expiration of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity with respect to any of the Groups major products could have a material adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations as generic manufacturers may enter the market.
Generic manufacturers often do not need to complete extensive clinical studies when they seek registration of a copy product and accordingly, they are generally able to sell the Groups drugs at a much lower price.
As expected, in 2009 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd Teva and Impax Laboratories, Inc. Impax commenced commercial shipments of their authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR.
During the year to December 31, 2009 the Groups sales of ADDERALL XR declined by 43% to $626.5 million, representing 21% of total revenues in 2009 2008: 36%.
In October 2005 the Group filed a Citizen Petition with the FDA requesting that the FDA require more rigorous bioequivalence testing or additional clinical testing for generic or follow-on drug products that reference ADDERALL XR before they can be approved.
The Group received correspondence from the FDA in April 2006 stating that, due to the complex issues raised, which require extensive review and analysis by the FDAs officials, a decision cannot yet be reached by the FDA.
The FDA has not yet reached a decision on this Citizen Petition and did not provide any guidance as to when that decision may be reached.
Shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its FOSRENOL and CARBATROL patents, as well as the patents for certain other products.
During 2009 Shire settled certain legal proceedings relating to ADDERALL XR and CARBATROL.
Shire has also intervened in a lawsuit brought by Actavis Elizabeth LLC against the FDA concerning FDAs decision to grant VYVANSE new chemical entity regulatory exclusivity.
For more detail of current patent litigation, see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Products under development SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS Treatments for ADHD VYVANSE for ADHD in EU VYVANSE for the treatment of ADHD in children aged six to 17 in the EU is in Phase 3 development.
Shire anticipates submission of the regulatory filing for VYVANSE in Europe in 2011.
INTUNIV for use in combination with other ADHD treatments Phase 3 trials in the US are ongoing to support the efficacy and safety of INTUNIV when combined with other approved ADHD treatments.
Treatments for GI diseases LIALDA for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis in the US Phase 3 trials investigating the use of the product to maintain remission in patients who have ulcerative colitis were initiated in 2006 for the US market and continued through 2009.
The product was indicated for the maintenance of remission in patients who have ulcerative colitis on approval in the EU.
LIALDA MEZAVANT for the treatment of diverticulitis Diverticulosis is among the most common diseases in developed countries and manifests as weaknesses or out-pouches of the bowel wall primarily in elderly populations.
Approximately 15-20% of people with diverticulosis go on to develop diverticulitis which is an acute inflammation, infection and micro or macro-perforation of these out-pouches.
The current standard of care requires treatment with antibiotics and depending on the frequency or severity of attacks, may require surgery.
LIALDA MEZAVANT is being investigated as a treatment to prevent recurrent attacks of diverticulitis.
Phase 3 worldwide clinical trials investigating the use of the product for the treatment of diverticulitis were initiated in 2007 and are ongoing.
Treatments for diseases in other therapeutic areas FOSRENOL for the treatment of pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease CKD Shire is continuing to explore the regulatory pathway required to secure a label extension for FOSRENOL to treat hyperphosphataemia in pre-dialysis CKD in the US.
JUVISTA for the improvement of scar appearance Renovo initiated its first pivotal European Phase 3 trial in scar revision in the fourth quarter of 2008 to support the filing of a European regulatory dossier.
If the outcome from Renovos multi-center, EU Phase 3 study is suitably positive, the data will be used to inform the strategy and design of Shires US development plan.
VYVANSE for the treatment of non-ADHD indications in adults Shire is conducting Phase 2 pilot clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of VYVANSE as adjunctive therapy in depression, for the treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, and for the treatment of cognitive impairment in depression.
SPD 535 for the treatment of arteriovenous grafts in hemodialysis patients SPD 535 is in development as a novel molecule with platelet lowering ability and without phosphodiesterase type III inhibition.
The initial proof of concept program will target prevention of thrombotic complications associated with arteriovenous grafts in hemodialysis patients.
Phase 1 development was initiated in the third quarter of 2009.
Projects in pre-clinical development A number of additional projects are underway in the early stages of pre-clinical development for the Specialty Pharmaceuticals area, including potential programs leveraging Carrierwave technology primarily focused in the areas of pain and ADHD.
More data on these programs is expected in the second half of 2010.
10 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial review HUMAN GENETIC THERAPIES Treatments for angioedema FIRAZYR in hereditary angioedema HAE in the US Prior to its acquisition by Shire, Jerini AG Jerini received a not approvable letter for FIRAZYR for use in the US from the FDA in April 2008.
In December 2008 Shire met with the FDA to discuss the development of FIRAZYR.
It was agreed that an additional clinical study would be required before approval could be considered and that a complete response to the not approvable letter would be filed after completion of this study.
In June 2009 Shire initiated a Phase 3 study in patients with acute attacks of HAE, known as the FAST-3 trial, which is designed to support filing of a New Drug Application NDA for FIRAZYR in the US.
Enzyme Replacement Therapy ERT REPLAGALfor the treatment of Fabry disease Shire has worked closely with the FDA to establish an early access program in response to the ongoing shortage of the currently marketed treatment for Fabry disease in the US.
REPLAGAL is currently available to US Fabry patients under an FDA-approved treatment protocol, and the Group is also supporting emergency Investigational New Drug IND requests.
REPLAGAL first received marketing authorization in the EU in 2001 and is approved for the treatment of Fabry disease in 45 countries.
On December 22, 2009, Shire submitted a BLA with the FDA for REPLAGAL, its enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease.
In February 2010, the FDA requested additional pharmacokinetic comparability data.
As a result, Shire withdrew its December BLA filing, and, at the suggestion of the FDA, requested and received Fast Track designation.
VPRIVfor the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease VPRIV is an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease.
Gaucher disease is the most common of the inherited lysosomal storage diseases and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.
On September 1, 2009 Shire completed its NDA submission to the FDA for VPRIV.
On November 4, 2009 Shire announced that the FDA granted Priority Review of this application, and issued an action date of February 28, 2010.
On November 24, 2009 Shire submitted a European Marketing Authorization Application MAA to the European Medicines Agency EMEA.
The submission has been granted accelerated review by EMEA.
VPRIV is available ahead of its commercial launch in the US via an FDA-accepted treatment protocol and elsewhere on a pre-approval basis using the fastest mechanisms available in each jurisdiction, in response to the ongoing shortage of a currently marketed treatment for Gaucher disease.
HGT-1111 and HGT-1110for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy MLD MLD is a lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency in the enzyme arylsulfatase-A.
HGT-1111 has completed a Phase 1b clinical trial in 12 MLD patients in Europe and an extension to this study is ongoing.
Based on additional long-term clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1b study in MLD, in the first quarter of 2010, Shire decided to suspend further development of an intravenous formulation of arylsulfatase-A derived from Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells, also known as HGT-1111.
Development of a formulation of HGT-1110, expressed from Shires human cell platform and suitable for direct delivery to the central nervous system CNS, is ongoing, and pre-clinical studies are planned for 2010.
The Shire platform for direct delivery of proteins to the CNS was advanced in the first quarter of 2010 with the initiation of intrathecal delivery of idursulfase in the Phase 1 2 study in Hunter syndrome.
HGT-2310Hunter syndrome with central nervous system symptoms, idursulfase-IT intrathecal delivery HGT 2310 is in development as an enzyme replacement therapy delivered intrathecally for Hunter syndrome for patients with central nervous system symptoms.
The Group initiated a Phase 1 2 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2010.
This product has been granted orphan designation in the US.
HGT-1410 for Sanfilippo syndrome  IIIA HGT-1410 is in development as an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome  IIIA, a lysosomal storage disorder.
Sanfilippo is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a deficiency of heparan-N-sulfatase, an enzyme that degrades heparan sulfate.
The accumulation of heparan sulfate in tissues causes a neurodegenerative disorder in children in which the central nervous system is primarily affected.
The product has been granted orphan drug designation in the US and in the EU.
The Group plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in mid-2010.
HGT-2610 for the treatment of globoid cell leukodystrophy GLD HGT 2610 is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of GLD, a lysosomal storage disorder.
GLD is a rare, inherited lysosomal disorder resulting from a deficiency in the enzyme .
This neurodegenerative disease primarily affects infants, but can occur in adolescents and adults.
GLD is caused by degradation of the myelin sheath that normally covers nerve fibers, which leads to rapid degeneration of mental and motor function in these patients.
This program is in early development and pre-clinical studies.
Early research products A number of additional projects are underway in the early stages of development for the HGT business area.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 11 DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS DISCONTINUED DURING 2009 During 2009 the Group discontinued the following development projects, which were included within Products under development in the Groups previous Annual Reports.
DAYTRANA for ADHD in EU and Canada In March 2009 and November 2009, Shire withdrew the MAA and Canadian New Drug Submission NDS, respectively for DAYTRANA for the treatment of ADHD.
The withdrawal of the European MAA and Canadian NDS does not impact Shires commitment to DAYTRANA in the US where the product has been used as a pediatric treatment for ADHD since 2006.
SPD 550 for the treatment of Celiac disease In December 2007 Shire acquired the worldwide rights to SPD 550 in markets outside of the US and Japan from Alba Therapeutics Corporation Alba.
Shire terminated the collaboration agreement with effect from November 15, 2009 and Shire returned all rights to Alba.
Pharmacological Chaperone Technology In November 2007 Shire entered into a license agreement with Amicus under which it received the rights to three compounds, PLICERA HGT-3410 for the treatment of Gaucher disease, AMIGAL HGT-3310 for the treatment Fabry disease and AT2220 HGT-3510 for the treatment of Pompe disease, in markets outside the US.
On October 29, 2009 Shire and Amicus mutually agreed to terminate the collaboration, with all rights returned to Amicus.
Business development As a result of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or loss of data exclusivity, Shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in-licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long-term patent protection and or data exclusivity.
During 2009, in addition to acquiring the worldwide rights excluding the US, Canada and Barbados to EQUASYM IR and XL from UCB and entering into a research collaboration with Santaris Pharma A S Santaris for the development of its Locked Nucleic Acid LNA drug platform technology, Shire also acquired the remaining interests in Jerini AG having acquired more than 98% of the voting interests of Jerini in 2008.
In 2008 Shire also acquired the global rights to METAZYM, a clinical candidate arylsulfatase-A, from Zymenex.
In 2007 the Group acquired New River Pharmaceuticals, Inc. New River and through the New River acquisition obtained control of the commercialization of VYVANSE.
Organization and structure During 2008, the Group undertook a court sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement, establishing Shire plc, a company incorporated in Jersey Channel Islands as the new Shire holding company.
For further details on the Scheme of Arrangement see Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
2009 outlook 1 The Groups previously announced guidance framework for Non GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for 2009 was in the range of $3.00 to $3.40.
Actual Non GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.49.
1 American Depositary Share Shire monitors its financial performance on a Non GAAP basis.
Non GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with US GAAP, and these Non GAAP measures exclude the effect of certain cash and non-cash items, both recurring and non-recurring, that Shires management believes are not related to the core performance of Shires business.

Sales achieved under early access programs.
The Groups management analyzes product sales growth for certain products sold in markets outside of the US on a constant exchange rate CER basis, so that product sales growth can be considered excluding movements in foreign exchange rates.
Product sales growth on a CER basis is a Non GAAP financial measure, computed by comparing 2009 product sales restated using 2008 average foreign exchange rates to 2008 actual product sales.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 15 SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS VYVANSEADHD The increase in VYVANSE product sales was driven by higher US prescription demand in 2009 compared to 2008, 9% growth in the US ADHD market and price increases.
Product sales growth was lower than prescription growth due to lower stocking in 2009 compared to 2008.
Litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE are ongoing.
Further information about this litigation can be found in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
INTUNIVADHD INTUNIV was launched in the US in November 2009.
In line with Shires revenue recognition policy for launch shipments, initial stocking shipments have been deferred and are being recognized into revenue in line with end-user prescription demand.
At December 31, 2009 deferred revenues on the balance sheet represented gross sales of $38.8 million.
ADDERALL XRADHD The launch by Teva and Impax of their authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR led to the expected decline in 2009 of branded ADDERALL XR prescription demand, and resulted in higher US sales deductions in 2009 compared to 2008.
These factors more than offset the positive impacts of price increases taken since the fourth quarter of 2008, and the inclusion in product sales of shipments of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax in 2009.
Sales deductions represented 47% of branded ADDERALL XR gross sales in the year to December 31, 2009 compared to 25% in the same period in 2008, following higher Medicaid and Managed Care rebates subsequent to the authorized generic launches.
As outlined in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, there are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments of authorized generic ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax should be included in the Medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to Medicaid rebate legislation, including the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 Medicaid rebate legislation.
As a result more than one unit rebate amount URA is calculable for the purpose of determining the Groups Medicaid rebate liability to States after the authorized generic launch.
During 2009 the Group highlighted the different interpretations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS and submitted data to the CMS for the purpose of computing the URA, based on the Groups reasonable interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance.
The State Medicaid agencies have invoiced the Group for Medicaid rebates, and the Group has paid these Medicaid rebate invoices, based on this URA.
Despite this CMS has the ability to subsequently challenge the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, and require an alternative interpretation to be applied both retrospectively and prospectively, which could result in a significantly higher Medicaid liability.
Throughout 2009 the Groups management has recorded its accrual for Medicaid rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable.
For the first three quarters of 2009, the Groups management based this best estimate on an amount that the Group could pay were CMS to challenge the Groups interpretation and require an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation to be applied.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Groups management lowered its best estimate of the Medicaid rebate payable down to be consistent with i the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, ii the Groups repeated and consistent submission of price reporting to CMS using the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, iii CMS calculating the URA based on that interpretation, iv States submitting Medicaid rebate invoices using this URA and v Shire paying these invoices.
This change of estimate increased ADDERALL XR product sales by $97.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 of which $73.6 million related to ADDERALL XR product sales recognized in the first three quarters of 2009.
In determining its best estimate of the Medicaid rebate liability at December 31, 2009 the Groups management has considered a number of factors taken in combination including the receipt of a further quarters invoices from the States with a URA based on the Groups interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance, and the Groups likely response were CMS to employ an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation.
Any future change in the Groups interpretation which results in a change of estimate could significantly decrease sales of ADDERALL XR in the period of any such change in estimate.
The Group strongly believes that its interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation is reasonable and correct.
However, CMS could disagree with the Groups interpretation, and require the Group to apply an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation and pay up to $210 million above the recorded liability.
This would represent a URA substantially in excess of the unit sales price of ADDERALL XR and accordingly be in excess of the approximate amount of the full cost to the States of reimbursement for Medicaid prescriptions of ADDERALL XR.
Should CMS take such an approach, the Group could seek to limit any additional payments to a level approximating the full, un-rebated cost to the States of ADDERALL XR, or $98 million above the recorded liability.
Further, the Group believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation, and that there would be a strong basis to initiate litigation to recover any amount paid in excess of its recorded liability.
The result of any such litigation cannot be predicted and could result in additional rebate liability above the Groups current best estimate.
LIALDA MEZAVANTUlcerative colitis Strong product sales of LIALDA MEZAVANT continued in the year to December 31, 2009 driven by an increase in market share over 2008, growth in the US oral mesalamine market and price increases taken during 2009.
PENTASAUlcerative colitis Product sales of PENTASA continued to grow despite a decrease in US prescription demand in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the impact of price increases taken during 2009.
 Product sales increased as FOSRENOL entered new countries and grew in existing markets outside the US.
In the US, FOSRENOL sales grew despite lower prescriptions due to a price increase in 2009.
Litigation proceedings regarding Shires FOSRENOL patents are ongoing.
16 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial review HUMAN GENETIC THERAPIES ELAPRASEHunter syndrome The growth in sales of ELAPRASE was driven by increased volumes across all regions where ELAPRASE is sold.
On a Non GAAP CER basis sales grew by 20% 66% of ELAPRASE sales are made outside of the US.
REPLAGALFabry disease The growth in REPLAGAL product sales in 2009 over 2008 was driven by a significant increase in demand in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to an acceleration of patients switching to REPLAGAL in the EU, attributable in part to supply shortages of a competitor product.
Sales increased 16% on a Non GAAP CER basis REPLAGAL is sold primarily in Euros and Pounds sterling.
Royalties Royalty revenue increased by 19% to $292.5 million for the year to December 31, 2009 2008: $245.5 million.

Generic drug companies have filed Abbreviated New Drug applications ANDAs seeking approval for COMBIVIR in the US.
GSK has filed lawsuits against both Teva and Lupin Ltd. Lupin, each of whom have filed ANDAs and Paragraph IV certifications for generic versions of COMBIVIR.
The lawsuit against Lupin has been stayed pending resolution of the Teva lawsuit.
Neither Teva nor Lupin have challenged the patents licensed by Shire to GSK.
The thirty month stay of approval for Tevas ANDA expires in March 2010.
No trial date has been set.
ADDERALL XRADHD Royalties were received on Tevas sales of an authorized generic version of ADDERALL XR between April 2009 and September 2009, and on Impaxs sales of an authorized generic version of ADDERALL XR from October 2009.
Other Other royalties are received primarily on worldwide excluding UK and Republic of Ireland sales of REMINYL and REMINYL XL known as RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER in the US.
Royalties on sales of these products decreased in the year to December 31, 2009 to $47.7 million 2008: $63.5 million due to generic competition in the US from August 2008.
Cost of product sales Cost of product sales decreased to $388.0 million for the year to December 31, 2009 14% of product sales, down from $408.0 million in the corresponding period in 2008 2008: 15% of product sales.
Cost of product sales in the year to December 31, 2008 included charges relating to DYNEPO exit costs of $48.8 million 2% of product sales.
Excluding this item, cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in 2009 compared to 2008 has increased by 1% to 14%.
This increase primarily resulted from changes in product mix following the launch by Teva and Impax of their authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR in 2009.
Higher sales deductions on Shires sales of branded ADDERALL XR, together with lower margin sales of the authorized generic version of ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax have both depressed gross margins in 2009.
For the year to December 31, 2009 cost of product sales included depreciation of $21.8 million 2008: $16.2 million.
Depreciation charged in 2009 is higher than 2008 due to accelerated depreciation of $12.0 million in 2009 following a change in the estimate of the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment at Shires Owings Mills facility as a result of the anticipated closure of the facility in 2011.
Research and development R&D R&D expenditure increased by 29% to $638.3 million in the year to December 31, 2009 24% of product sales, up from $494.3 million in the corresponding period in 2008 18% of product sales.

R&D in the year to December 31, 2008 included costs of $6.5 million for DYNEPO exit costs.
Excluding these items, R&D increased in the year to December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to continued investment in R&D programs, including the acceleration of investment in VPRIV and REPLAGAL in the US, and the inclusion within R&D of an upfront payment of $6.5 million to Santaris for technology access and R&D funding.
For the year to December 31, 2009 R&D included depreciation of $15.5 million 2008: $12.5 million.

Interest income for the year to December 31, 2009 is lower than the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower average interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008 and lower average cash and cash equivalent balances.
Interest expense For the year to December 31, 2009 the Group incurred interest expense of $39.8 million 2008: $139.0 million.
Interest expense in 2009 primarily related to interest expense on the Groups convertible bond totaling $33.3 million 2008: $33.3 million.
Interest expense in 2008 was higher than 2009 due to interest expense of $87.3 million recorded in respect of the TKT appraisal rights litigation, of which $73.0 million was additional interest arising from the settlement of the litigation in November 2008.
Other income expense, net For the year to December 31, 2009 the Group recognized Other income, net of $60.7 million.
Other income in 2009 includes a gain of $55.2 million on disposal of the Groups investment in Virochem Pharma Inc. Virochem to Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Vertex in a cash and stock transaction.

Taxation In the year to December 31, 2009 the effective tax rate was 22% 2008: 37%.
Excluding the impact of IPR&D charges of $263.1 million in 2008, which are either not tax deductible or for which no tax benefit is currently recognized, the effective tax rate in 2008 was 19%.
The effective rate of tax in 2009 was higher than 2008 excluding the impact of IPR&D charges due to increased profits in higher tax territories, and the recognition of valuation allowances against EU and US deferred tax assets.
These factors more than offset reductions to the effective rate of tax in 2009 due to: the decrease in valuation allowances relating to state tax credits and loss carry forwards following Massachusetts State tax changes in 2009: the benefit of the effect of the change in the effective state tax rate on the net state deferred tax balance: and higher R&D tax credits in the US, principally the acceleration of the VPRIV program.

Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 19 SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS US ADHD market share The continued growth in market share of VYVANSE helped Shire grow its average annual share of the US ADHD market to 32.6% for the year to December 31, 2008 compared to 29.4% in 2007.
Shire has the leading portfolio of products in the US ADHD market.
VYVANSE VYVANSE was launched in the US in July 2007 and product sales for the year to December 31, 2008 were $318.9 million 2007: $76.5 million.
Product sales growth was driven by the increase in average share of the US ADHD market 8.2% for the year to December 31, 2008 compared to 1.8% in 2007 and a price increase in April 2008.
ADDERALL XR ADDERALL XRs average share of the US ADHD market for 2008 fell to 22.6% 2007: 25.5%.
US prescriptions for ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2008 decreased by 5% compared to 2007 due to an 11% fall in average market share offset by a 7% growth in the US ADHD market.
Sales of ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2008 were $1,101.7 million, an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2007 2007: $1,030.9 million, with the decline in prescriptions being more than offset by price increases.
The United States Federal Trade Commission FTC informed Shire on October 3, 2006 that it was reviewing the ADDERALL XR patent litigation settlement agreement between Shire and Barr.
On June 22, 2007 the Group received a civil investigative demand requesting that it provide information to the FTC relating to its settlement with Barr and its earlier settlement with Impax.
The Group co-operated fully with this investigation and believes that the settlements are in compliance with all applicable laws.

The voluntary recalls were not due to safety issues.
US oral mesalamine market share Shires average annual market share of the US oral mesalamine market rose to 28.4% for the year to December 31, 2008 2007: 21.1%, driven by the growth of LIALDA since its launch in March 2007.
PENTASA US prescriptions of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2008 were down 1% compared to 2007 primarily due to a small decrease in PENTASAs average annual market share from 17.2% in 2007 to 16.7% in 2008, offset by a 2% increase in the US oral mesalamine prescription market.
Sales of PENTASA for the year to December 31, 2008 were $185.5 million, an increase of 5% compared to 2007 2007: $176.4 million.
Sales growth is higher than prescription growth primarily due to the impact of price increases.
LIALDA MEZAVANT US prescriptions of LIALDA for the year to December 31, 2008 were up 204% compared to the prior year and LIALDAs average market share for 2008 increased to 11.7% 2007: 3.9%.

This amount represented the value of those acquired development projects which, at the acquisition date, had not been approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including the adult indication of VYVANSE.
In 2008 the FDA approved the adult indication of VYVANSE and Shire launched VYVANSE for adult ADHD in the US in June 2008.
In March 2008 the Canadian new drug submission was accepted for filing for the treatment of ADHD in children and was approved by Health Canada in February 2009.
At December 31, 2009 management estimated that future R&D costs until regulatory approval for VYVANSE for ADHD in markets outside the US are approximately $110 million.
These estimates can be affected by various factors and are, in part, based on managements estimate and assumptions.
For these reasons, among others, the actual cash flows may vary from forecast future cash flows.
Integration and acquisition costs For the year to December 31, 2008 Shire incurred $10.3 million of costs associated with the integration of Jerini into the Group and acquisition related advisory fees incurred by Jerini 2007: $1.3 million relating to the New River acquisition.
Interest income For the year to December 31, 2008 Shire received interest income of $25.5 million 2007: $50.6 million.
Interest income primarily relates to interest received on cash and cash equivalents.
Interest income for the year to December 31, 2008 is lower than the same period in 2007 due to lower average cash balances and lower average US dollar interest rates.
Interest expense For the year to December 31, 2008 Shire incurred interest expense of $139.0 million 2007: $70.8 million.
Interest expense for the year to December 31, 2008 includes $87.3 million 2007: $28.0 million in respect to the TKT appraisal rights litigation.
On November 5, 2008 Shire successfully settled all aspects of this litigation with all parties.
Shire paid the same price of $37 per share originally offered to all TKT shareholders at the time of the July 2005 merger, plus interest.
The Delaware Chancery Court approved dismissal of the case and Shire made payment to the dissenting shareholders on November 7, 2008.
The settlement represented a total payment of $567.5 million, representing consideration at $37 per share of $419.9 million and an interest cost of $147.6 million.
Prior to reaching this settlement, the Group accrued interest based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that may be awarded by the Court to those former TKT shareholders who requested appraisal.
This estimate of interest was based on Shires cost of borrowing.
Between the close of the merger and November 5, 2008 the Group applied this interest rate on a quarterly compounding basis to the $419.9 million of consideration to calculate its provision for interest.
Upon reaching agreement in principle with all the dissenting shareholders, the Group determined that settlement had become the probable manner through which the appraisal rights litigation would be resolved.
Under current law although not applicable in this case because the merger was entered into before the relevant amendment to the law became effective the court presumptively awarded interest in appraisal rights cases at a statutory rate that is five percentage points above the Federal Reserve discount rate as it varies over the duration of the case.
In connection with the settlement, the Group agreed to an interest rate that approximates to this statutory rate.
Based on the settlement, the Group amended the method of determining its interest provision to reflect this revised manner of resolution, and upon reaching settlement with the dissenting shareholders recorded an additional interest expense of $73.0 million in its consolidated financial statements for the year to December 31, 2008.
22 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial review Other expense income, net 2008 2007 Year to December 31, $M $M Impairment of non-current investments 58.0 3.0 Gain on sale of available-for-sale security 9.4 0.1 1 Foreign exchange 14.1 0.8 Other 1.6 4.9 32.9 1.2 1 Includes gains and losses arising on translation of foreign currency transactions and balances and gains and losses on swap and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Other expense income, net for the year to December 31, 2008 included impairment charges in respect of available-for-sale securities totaling $58.0 million 2007: $3.0 million, including $44.3 million relating to the Groups investment in Renovo Group plc.
The impairment of the investment in Renovo Group plc was recognized at the end of the third quarter of 2008.
These amounts reflect unrealized holding losses that have been reclassified out of other comprehensive income into earnings in the period, as management concluded that the impairment is other-than-temporary.
The decline in the market value of the Groups investment in Renovo Group plc initially arose from the results of clinical trials for JUVISTA announced over 2007 and 2008.
During the third quarter of 2008, in considering whether the decline in value was temporary or other-than-temporary the Group considered the following factors: the severity of the decline from historical cost 87% and its duration eleven months : market analysts targets of Renovo Group plcs share price for the next 1824 months: and the revised expected filing date for JUVISTA due to the adoption of a sequential rather than parallel Phase 3 development plan.
These factors, together with the significant decline in global equity markets during the third quarter of 2008 meant that the Group was unable to reasonably estimate the period over which a full recovery in the value of its investment in Renovo Group plc could occur.
As such, the Group concluded that the decline in value was other-than-temporary.
Accordingly, the full difference between the book value of the investment and the fair market value was recognized as an other-than-temporary impairment and the Group recognized an impairment charge of $44.3 million for its investment in Renovo Group plc through the consolidated statements of operations in the third quarter of 2008.
For the purposes of computing the impairment charge fair value was assumed to be 0.26 per share, representing the closing price of Renovo Group plc securities on the London Stock Exchange LSE on September 30, 2008.
If in the future JUVISTAs Phase 3 trials report positively and Renovo Group plcs other products progress through development, Renovo Group plcs share price could react favorably and the Group may recover some or all of this impairment loss.
Any future potential increases in the value of Renovo Group plc will be recognized through other comprehensive income.
The closing price of Renovo Group plc securities on the LSE on December 31, 2008 was 0.20, and the carrying value of the Groups investment in Renovo Group plc was $3.6 million.
Other expense income, net also includes a gain of $9.4 million arising from the sale of Shires minority equity investment in Questcor.
Shire received cash consideration of $10.3 million in respect of the sale.
Income taxes The effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2008 was 37% 2007: -4%.
Excluding IPR&D charges of $263.1 million 2007: $1,866.4 million which are either not tax deductible or for which no tax benefit is currently recognized, the effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2008 has increased by 7% to 19% 2007: 12%.
This increase in 2008 over 2007 is primarily due to the combined effects of a in 2008, significant unfavorable rate impacts related to other-than-temporary impairment charges on available-for-sale securities for which a valuation allowance was recorded such that a net tax benefit was not recorded and an increase in the valuation allowance and, b in 2007, favorable impacts recognized related to non-taxable gains on the sale of non-core products rights which were partially offset by an increase in the provision for uncertain tax positions.
The 2008 effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by exchange losses recorded in continuing operations.
Discontinued operations Losses from discontinued operations in the year to December 31, 2008 totaled $17.6 million 2007: $nil, relating to those businesses acquired through the Jerini business combination that were deemed by Shire and Jerini to be non-core to the combined business.
The loss from discontinued operations in the year to December 31, 2008 included a charge of $12.9 million arising on the re-measurement of assets held-for-sale to their fair value less costs to sell at December 31, 2008.
At December 31, 2008 these assets held-for-sale had a carrying value of $14.9 million.
Financial condition at December 31, 2009 and 2008 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents have increased by $280.7 million to $498.9 million at December 31, 2009 2008: $218.2 million.
Cash generated by operating activities in 2009 of $626.9 million was partially offset by investment in property plant and equipment, the cash cost of acquiring EQUASYM from UCB and the dividend payment.
Accounts receivable Accounts receivable have increased by $202.5 million to $597.5 million at December 31, 2009 2008: $395.0 million.
Days sales outstanding on a monthly count back basis, calculated using gross revenues i. e. revenues before discounts, rebates and other deductions, adjusted for deferred revenues to be consistent with reported accounts receivable, were 51 days at December 31, 2009 2008: 43 days.
The increase in accounts receivable at December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 is due to: higher gross product revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 2008: the timing of cash receipts: an increase in royalties receivable to $92.4 million at December 31, 2009 2008: $38.4 million, principally royalties on Impaxs sales of authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2009: and receivables on INTUNIV launch shipments, the revenue from which has been deferred and recognized into product sales based on prescription demand.
Investments Investments have increased by $62.8 million to $105.7 million at December 31, 2009 2008: $42.9 million due to the acquisition and subsequent increase in fair value of the Groups available-for-sale investment in Vertex.
In the year to December 31, 2009 the Group obtained its investment in Vertex valued at $50.8 million at acquisition in part consideration for the disposal of the Groups minority equity investment in Virochem to Vertex in a cash and stock transaction.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 23 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment increased by $142.6 million in the year to December 31, 2009 to $676.8 million 2008: $534.2 million.
The increase principally resulted from capital investment at the Groups HGT campus in Lexington in 2009.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses Accounts payable and accrued expenses have increased by $220.5 million to $929.1 million 2008: $708.6 million.
This increase results from higher accrued Medicaid and Managed Care rebates on ADDERALL XR subsequent to authorized generic launch, and increases in deferred revenue following deferral of INTUNIV launch shipments.
Liquidity and capital resources General The Groups funding requirements depend on a number of factors, including the timing and number of its development programs: corporate, business and product acquisitions: the level of resources required for the expansion of manufacturing and marketing capabilities as the product base expands: increases in accounts receivable and inventory which may arise with any increase in product sales: competitive and technological developments: the timing and cost of obtaining required regulatory approvals for new products: the timing and quantum of milestone payments on collaborative projects: the timing and quantum of tax and dividend payments: the timing and quantum of purchases by the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT of Shire shares in the market to satisfy option exercises: the timing and quantum of any additional amounts payable to government bodies challenging previously settled liabilities, including CMS applying an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation inconsistent with the Groups calculation of ADDERALL XR Medicaid rebates: and the continuing cash generated from sales of Shires products and royalty receipts.
An important part of Shires business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available.
The Group intends to defend its intellectual property and as a result may need cash for funding the cost of litigation.
The Group finances its activities through cash generated from operating activities: credit facilities: private and public offerings of equity and debt securities: and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals.
Shires balance sheet includes $498.9 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009.
Shire has no debt maturing in the next two years and substantially all of Shires debt relates to its $1,100 million 2.75% convertible bond which matures in 2014, although these bonds include a put option which could require repayment of the bonds in 2012.
In addition, Shire has a committed facility until 2012 of $1,200 million, which is currently undrawn.
The current financial situation affecting the banking system and financial markets, together with the current uncertainty in global economic conditions, has resulted in tighter credit markets and a lower level of liquidity in many financial markets.
As a result, the Group may not be able to access new equity or debt finance at the same level or cost as it has done previously.
Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 On May 9, 2007 Shire issued $1,100 million in principal amount of 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 and convertible into fully paid Ordinary Shares of Shire plc the Bonds.
The net proceeds of issuing the Bonds, after deducting the commissions and other direct costs of issue, totaled $1,081.7 million.
In connection with the Scheme of Arrangement the Trust Deed was amended and restated in 2008 in order to provide that, following the substitution of Shire plc in place of Shire Biopharmaceuticals Holdings Old Shire as the principal obligor and issuer of the Convertible Bonds, the Bonds would be convertible into Ordinary Shares of Shire plc.
The Bonds were issued at 100% of their principal amount, and unless previously purchased and canceled, redeemed or converted, will be redeemed on May 9, 2014 the Final Maturity Date at their principal amount.
The Bonds bear interest at 2.75% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on November 9 and May 9.
The Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company, and rank pari passu and ratably, without any preference amongst themselves, and equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.
The Bonds may be redeemed at the option of the Company, the Call Option, at their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest if: i at any time after May 23, 2012 if on no less than 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days the value of the Companys Ordinary Shares underlying each Bond in the principal amount of $100,000 would exceed $130,000: or ii at any time conversion rights have been exercised, and or purchases and corresponding cancellations, and or redemptions effected in respect of 85% or more in principal amount of Bonds originally issued.
The Bonds may also be redeemed at the option of the Bond holder at their principal amount including accrued but unpaid interest on May 9, 2012 the Put Option, or following the occurrence of a change of control of Shire.
The Bonds are repayable in US dollars, but also contain provisions entitling the Company to settle redemption amounts in Pounds sterling, or in the case of the Final Maturity Date and following exercise of the Put Option, by delivery of the underlying Ordinary Shares and a cash top-up amount.
The Bonds are convertible into Ordinary Shares during the conversion period, being the period from June 18, 2007 until the earlier of: i the close of business on the date falling fourteen days prior to the Final Maturity Date: ii if the Bonds have been called for redemption by the Company, the close of business fourteen days before the date fixed for redemption: iii the close of business on the day prior to a Bond holder giving notice of redemption in accordance with the conditions: and iv the giving of notice by the trustee that the Bonds are accelerated by reason of the occurrence of an event of default.
Upon conversion, the Bond holder is entitled to receive Ordinary Shares at the conversion price of $33.17 per Ordinary Share subject to adjustment as outlined below.
The conversion price is subject to adjustment in respect of i any dividend or distribution by the Company, ii a change of control and iii customary anti-dilution adjustments for, inter alia, share consolidations, share splits, spin-off events, rights issues, bonus issues and reorganizations.
The initial conversion price of $33.5879 was adjusted to $33.17 with effect from March 11, 2009 as a result of cumulative dividend payments during the period from October 2007 to April 2009 inclusive The Ordinary Shares issued on conversion will be delivered credited as fully paid, and will rank pari passu in all respects with all fully paid Ordinary Shares in issue on the relevant conversion date.
24 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial review Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement Shire has a committed revolving credit facility the RCF in an aggregate amount of $1,200 million with ABN Amro Bank N. V. : Barclays Capital: Citigroup Global Markets Limited: The Royal Bank of Scotland plc: Lloyds TSB Bank plc: Bank of America N. A. : and Morgan Stanley Bank.
The RCF, which includes a $250 million swingline facility, may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on February 20, 2012.
There were no borrowings under the RCF as at December 31, 2009.
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the RCF for each interest period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin ranging from 0.40 to 0.80% per annum and LIBOR for the applicable currency and interest period.
Shire also pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at 35% per annum of the applicable margin.
Under the RCF it is required that i Shires ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as defined within the Multicurrency Term and Revolving Facilities Agreement the RCF Agreement does not exceed 3.5 to 1 for either the 12 month period ending December 31 or June 30 unless Shire has exercised its option which is subject to certain conditions to increase it to 4.0 to 1 for two consecutive testing dates: ii the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest as defined in the RCF Agreement must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for either the 12 month period ending December 31 or June 30, and iii additional limitations on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness, making of loans, giving of guarantees and granting security over assets.

Sources and uses of cash The following table provides an analysis of the Groups gross and net debt excluding restricted cash, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 December 31, $M $M Cash and cash equivalents 498.9 218.2 Shire 2.75% Convertible bonds 1,100.0 1,100.0 Building financing obligation 46.7 45.6 Total debt 1,146.7 1,145.6 Net debt 647.8 927.4 Cash flow activity Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to December 31, 2009 decreased by 22% to $626.9 million compared to $800.1 million for the year to December 31, 2008, a decrease of $173.2 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was lower in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower net sales receipts and higher cash tax payments in 2009 compared to 2008.
Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 also included cash inflows on forward foreign exchange contracts which were not repeated in 2009.
These factors more than offset the inclusion of interest paid on settlement of the TKT appraisal rights in cash flow from operating activities in 2008.
Net cash flow from operating activities for the year to December 31, 2008 increased by $325.4 million to $800.1 million 2007: $474.7 million.
The increased cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from higher revenues and cash collection in 2008 over 2007, together with cash inflows from forward foreign exchange contracts in 2008.
These cash inflows were partially offset by interest payments to the TKT dissenting shareholders $147.6 million, cash paid to Zymenex for METAZYM $135.0 million and higher cash tax payments in 2008 over 2007.
Net cash used in investing activities was $322.4 million in the year to December 31, 2009.
This included the cash cost of purchasing EQUASYM of $72.8 million and expenditure on property, plant and equipment of $254.4 million.
These cash outflows were partially offset by receipts of $19.2 million from the sale of non-current investments.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment included $127.0 million on construction work at the HGT campus in Lexington, Massachusetts, $18.4 million on construction work at the UK office in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and $19.9 million on infrastructure and capital management projects in the US.
This capital expenditure was funded from the Groups existing cash resources and operating cash flows, and the Group expects to fund 2010 capital expenditure which is committed at December 31, 2009 from operational cash flows generated in 2010.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1,154.5 million in the year to December 31, 2008 and includes the cash outflows associated with purchasing over a 98% interest in Jerini $499.4 million, net of cash acquired : the payment of $419.9 million at $37 per share on settlement of the TKT appraisal rights litigation: expenditure on purchases of property, plant and equipment of $236.0 million: the final sales milestone payment of $25.0 million for DAYTRANA to Noven: and purchases of long-term investments of $2.2 million.
These investing outflows which were partially offset by receipts of $10.3 million from the sale of long-term assets and $5.0 million received from the sale of product rights.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment included $136.0 million on construction work at Shires office and manufacturing facilities in Lexington, Massachusetts and $4.7 million on construction work at the Basingstoke, UK office.
Net cash used in financing activities was $28.7 million for the year to December 31, 2009 which relates to $54.4 million for the dividend payment partially offset by excess tax benefits of stock based compensation of $16.8 million and proceeds from exercise of options of $14.6 million.
Net cash used in financing activities was $178.1 million for the year to December 31, 2008 of which $146.6 million related to payments to acquire shares by the ESOT and $46.8 million to the dividend payment.
During the year to December 31, 2008 the Group additionally drew down $190.0 million of its revolving credit facility to part fund the TKT appraisal rights settlement this amount was subsequently repaid during 2008.
Outstanding letters of credit At December 31, 2009, the Group had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the amount of $9.6 million, including letters of credit with Barclays Bank plc in the amount of $4.0 million providing security on the recoverability of insurance claims, and with Citigroup in the amount of $5.6 million, providing security on the payment of lease obligations.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 25 Cash requirements At December 31, 2009 the Groups cash requirements for long-term liabilities reflected on the Balance Sheet and other contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period Less than More than Total 1 year 13 years 35 years 5 years $M $M $M $M $M 1 Long-term debt obligations 1,236.1 30.3 60.5 1,145.3 2 Building financing obligation 61.6 3.2 6.4 7.3 44.7 3 Operating leases obligation 213.3 31.1 43.2 37.8 101.2 4 Purchase obligations 405.9 243.8 135.3 26.8 5 Other long-term liabilities reflected on the Balance Sheet 245.0 17.0 228.0 Total  1 Shires $1,100 million principal amount of 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014 issued in May 2007 and the interest on the convertible bonds has been included based on the contractual payment dates.
The principal amount of $1,100 million has been included within payments due three to five years based on the Final Maturity Date of the convertible bonds.
The bondholders have the option to redeem the convertible bonds at the principal amount in May 2012 and the Group has the option to call the bonds subject to certain conditions after May 2012.
Further details are included within Liquidity and capital resources: Shire 2.75% Convertible Bonds due 2014 above.
2 The Group has entered into building financing arrangements for certain laboratory and office space for its HGT business unit in Massachusetts.
For further information see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
3 The Group leases certain land, facilities, motor vehicles and certain equipment under operating leases expiring through 2027.
4 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, investments or services including clinical trials, contract manufacturing and capital equipment that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
Shire expects to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations.
5 Unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties of $17.0 million and $174.6 million are included within payments due in less than one year and payments due in one to three years, respectively.
The contractual obligations table above does not include certain milestones and other contractual commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of events which are yet to occur and therefore payment is not yet due.
The most significant such milestone and contractual commitments are as follows: i Research Collaboration with Santaris on LNA Drug Platform On August 24, 2009 Shire announced that it had entered into a research collaboration with Santaris, to develop its proprietary LNA technology in a range of rare diseases.
LNA technology has the benefit of shortened target validation and proof of concept, potentially increasing the speed and lowering the cost of development.
As part of the joint research project Santaris will design, develop and deliver pre-clinical LNA oligonucleotides for Shire-selected orphan disease targets, and Shire will have the exclusive right to further develop and commercialize these candidate compounds on a worldwide basis.
In the year to December 31, 2009 Shire made an upfront payment of $6.5 million to Santaris, for technology access and R&D funding, which has been expensed to R&D.
Shire has remaining obligations to pay Santaris a further $13.5 million subject to certain success criteria, and development and sales milestones up to a maximum of $72 million for each indication.
Shire will also pay single or double digit tiered royalties on net sales of the product.
Shire and Santaris have formed a joint research committee to monitor R&D activities through pre-clinical Lead Candidate selection at which point all development and commercialization costs will be the responsibility of Shire.
ii JUVISTA On June 19, 2007 Shire signed an agreement with Renovo to develop and commercialize JUVISTA, Renovos novel drug candidate being investigated for the reduction of scarring in connection with surgery.
Renovo has commenced its first pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe.
Under the terms of the agreement, Shire has the exclusive right to commercialize JUVISTA worldwide, with the exception of the EU member states.
Shire has remaining obligations to pay Renovo $25 million on the filing of JUVISTA with the FDA: up to $150 million on FDA approval: royalties on net sales of JUVISTA: and up to $525 million on the achievement of very significant sales targets.
Shire will bear the cost of clinical trials designed specifically for obtaining US regulatory approval.
Renovo will bear the costs of clinical trials designed specifically for obtaining EU regulatory approval.
Shire and Renovo will share equally the costs of conducting global clinical trials that are designed for obtaining both US and EU regulatory approvals.
Business risk management The Group has adopted a risk management strategy designed to identify, assess and manage the significant risks that it faces.
While the Group aims to identify and manage such risks, no risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss.
Set out below are the key risk factors, associated with the business, that have been identified through the Groups approach to risk management.
Some of these risk factors are specific to the Group, and others are more generally applicable to the pharmaceutical industry in which the Group operates.
The Group considers that these risk factors apply equally and therefore all should be carefully considered before any investment is made in Shire.
26 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial review RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE SHIRES BUSINESS The Groups key products may not be a commercial success The commercial success of the Groups key productsELAPRASE, VYVANSE, LIALDA MEZAVANT, PENTASA, FOSRENOL, REPLAGAL, INTUNIV, as well as other new products that the Group may launch in the future, including VPRIV, will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians, patients and other key decision-makers, as well as the timing of the receipt of additional marketing approvals, the scope of marketing approvals as reflected in the products label, the countries in which such approvals are obtained, the authorization of price and reimbursement in those countries where price and reimbursement is negotiated, and safety, efficacy, convenience and cost-effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products.
The Group may not be able to grow its product revenues as quickly as anticipated if any or all of the following occur: if competitive products are genericized or if the prices of competitor products are otherwise reduced significantly, the prescribing of treatments for the indications that the Groups products treat could be adversely affected: if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the Groups products not seen in clinical trials that impact the physicians willingness to prescribe the Groups products: if issues arise from clinical trials being conducted for post marketing purposes or for registration in another country or if regulatory agencies in one country act in a way that raises concerns for regulatory agencies or for prescribers or patients in another country: if patients, payors or physicians favor other treatments over the Groups products: if government regulation is stricter for the Groups products than for other treatments: if the Groups products suffer a loss of patent protection or competitors successfully challenge or circumvent the Groups patents or regulatory exclusivity see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements : if planned geographical expansion into emerging markets is not successful: or if the size of the patient populations for the Groups products are less than expected or the Group fails to identify new patients for its products.
If the Group is unable to commercialize any of its key products successfully, there may be a material adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the Group derives significant revenues and earnings from mature portfolio products whether or not promoted including CARBATROL, DAYTRANA, CALCICHEW, REMINYL and XAGRID.
Sales of these products could decrease as a result of any or all of the following: if competitive products are genericized or if the prices of competitor products are otherwise reduced significantly, the prescribing of treatments for the indications that the Groups products treat could be adversely affected: if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the Groups products not seen in clinical trials that impact the physicians willingness to prescribe the Groups products: if patients, payers or physicians favor other treatments over the Groups products: if the Groups products suffer a loss of patent protection or competitors successfully challenge or circumvent the Groups patents or regulatory exclusivity see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements : and decreased consumer demand or acceptance.
Unanticipated decreases in revenues from ADDERALL XR could significantly reduce the Groups revenues and earnings In the year ended December 31, 2008 sales of ADDERALL XR were $1,101.7 million, representing approximately 36% of the Groups total revenues.
In the year to December 31, 2009 sales of ADDERALL XR declined 43% to $626.5 million, representing approximately 21% of the Groups total revenues.
This decline resulted directly from the launch by Teva and Impax of authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR in April and October 2009, respectively.
The Group sells the authorized generic version of ADDERALL XR to Teva and Impax and currently receives royalties from Impax on the sale of its authorized generic.
Shire continues to sell the branded version of ADDERALL XR.
Factors that could negatively impact total revenue from ADDERALL XR include, but are not limited to: faster than anticipated erosion of ADDERALL XR sales and elimination of the Impax royalty as a result of FDA approval of additional generic competitors: issues impacting the production of ADDERALL XR or the supply of amphetamine salts including, but not limited to, the ability to get sufficient quota from the US Drug Enforcement Administration DEA : changes in reimbursement policies of third-party payers: changes to the level of sales deductions for ADDERALL XR for private or public payers: and if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS disagree with the Groups interpretation as to how shipments of authorized generic ADDERALL XR should be included in the Medicaid rebate calculation and require the Group to apply an alternative interpretation of the Medicaid rebate legislation.
Any decrease in royalties derived from the sales of 3TC and ZEFFIX could significantly reduce earnings The Group receives royalties from GSK on the worldwide sales of 3TC and ZEFFIX.
In 2009, the Groups royalty income relating to 3TC and ZEFFIX sales was $164.0 million 2008: $180.5 million: 2007: $186.3 million.
Any factors that decrease sales of 3TC and ZEFFIX by GSK could significantly reduce the Groups royalty revenue, and results of operations.
These include: loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for details of current patent litigation : reduction in the production of 3TC and ZEFFIX: technological advances: government action intervention: public opinion towards AIDS treatments: and product liability claims.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 27 The failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, or an adequate level of reimbursement, by third-party payers in a timely manner for the Groups products may impact future revenues and earnings The Groups revenues are partly dependent on the level of reimbursement provided to the Group by governmental reimbursement schemes for pharmaceutical products.
Changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the reimbursement of treatment established by healthcare providers, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations are under downward pressure and this, in turn, could impact on the prices at which the Group can sell its products.
The market for pharmaceutical products could be significantly influenced by the following, which could result in lower prices for the Groups products and or a reduced demand for the Groups products: the ongoing trend toward managed healthcare, particularly in the US: legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs in many of the Groups markets: and price controls and non-reimbursement of new and highly priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established.
The prices for certain of the Groups products when commercialized, in particular products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases such as REPLAGAL, ELAPRASE and VPRIV, may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products.
The Group may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for its products, particularly those with a high cost of treatment.
The failure to obtain and maintain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
A disruption to the product supply chain may result in the Group being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the Group being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis The Group sources its products from third-party contract manufacturers, and for certain products has its own manufacturing capability.
In the event of either the Groups failure or the failure of any third-party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards often referred to as Current Good Manufacturing Standards or cGMP in the countries in which the Group sells or intends to sell or have its products sold, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
The Group dual-sources certain key products and or active ingredients.
However, the Group currently relies on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of DAYTRANA, FIRAZYR, LIALDA MEZAVANT, PENTASA, REMINYL and XAGRID and relies on a single active ingredient source for each of ELAPRASE, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, REMINYL, REPLAGAL and XAGRID.
In the event of financial failure of a third party contract manufacturer or the failure of the third-party manufacturer to comply with its contractual obligations, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
This could have a material adverse affect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
There is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms, or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements.
The Group is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements The development and approval of the Groups products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities.
As the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications, regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the marketing approval.
The need to qualify a new supplier could delay the Groups development and commercialization efforts.
The Group uses bovine-derived serum sourced from New Zealand and North America in the manufacturing process for ELAPRASE.
The discovery of additional cattle in North America or the discovery of cattle in New Zealand with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on these products, or prohibit the Group from using these products at all in such countries.
The actions of certain customers can affect the Groups ability to sell or market products profitably, as well as impact net sales and growth comparisons A small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the US and certain European markets.
In 2009, for example, 51% of the Groups product sales were attributable to two customers in the US: McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc.
In the event of financial failure of any of these customers, the Group may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues and earnings.
In addition, the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred.
Consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels, or otherwise reduce purchases of the Groups products.
Such actions could have an adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
A significant portion of the Groups Specialty Pharmaceuticals product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the US and Europe.
Consequently, product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers.
These fluctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions, or other factors.
In addition, a significant portion of the Groups revenues for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are concentrated with a small number of customers.
Changes in the buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
28 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial review Investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to the Groups activities in the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result in the distraction of senior management, significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines The Group engages in various marketing, promotional and educational activities pertaining to, as well as the sale of, pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and the operations of market participants, such as the Group, are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the FDA, the US Department of Justice and the DEA in the US.
Any inquiries or investigations into the operations of, or enforcement or other regulatory action against, the Group by such regulatory authorities could result in the distraction of senior management for prolonged periods of time, significant defence costs, substantial monetary penalties and require extensive government monitoring of Group activities in the future.
As an example on September 23, 2009 the Group received a subpoena from the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General in co-ordination with the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking production of documents related to the sales and marketing of ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA and VYVANSE.
Shire is co-operating and responding to this subpoena.
The out-sourcing of services can create a significant dependency on third-parties, the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate the Groups business and to develop and market products The Group has entered into many agreements with third-parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business.
If the third-party can no longer provide the service on the agreed basis, the Group may not be able to continue the development or commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis.
Additionally, it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships with the suppliers.
The Group has also entered into licensing and co-development agreements with a number of parties.
There is a risk that, upon expiration or termination of a third-party agreement, the Group may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third-party as commercial interests may no longer coincide.
In such circumstances, the Group may be unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and could be required to abandon or divest a product line.
RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN GENERAL The actions of governments, industry regulators and the economic environments in which the Group operates may adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products profitably Changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry, in any country in which the Group conducts its business, may adversely impact the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
In particular, changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation.
The introduction of new products by competitors may impact future revenues The manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive.
Many of the Groups competitors are large, well-known pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources.
Companies with more resources and larger R&D expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications.
They may also be more successful than the Group in acquiring or licensing new products for development and commercialization.
If any product that competes with one of the Groups principal drugs is approved, the Groups sales of that drug could fall.
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change.
The Groups products could, therefore, be rendered obsolete or uneconomic, through the development of new products, technological advances in manufacturing or production by its competitors.
The successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain and requires significant expenditures and time Products that appear promising in research or development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development or the market for several reasons, including: pre-clinical or clinical tests may show the product to lack safety or efficacy: delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies: additional clinical supplies requirements: extended length of time to achieve study endpoints: additional time requirements for data analysis or dossier preparation: discussions with regulatory agencies, including regulatory agency requests for additional pre-clinical or clinical data: delays at regulatory agencies due to staffing or resource limitations: analysis of or changes to study design: unexpected safety, efficacy, or manufacturing issues.
Delays may arise from shared control with collaborative partners in the planning and execution of the product development, scaling of the manufacturing process, or getting approval for manufacturing: manufacturing issues, pricing, reimbursement issues, or other factors may render the product economically unviable: the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies may prevent the product from being developed or commercialized: and failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals.
Success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large-scale clinical trials will be successful.
Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approvals.
The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be difficult to predict.
If the Groups largescale or late state clinical trials for a product are not successful, the Group will not recover its substantial investments in that product.
In addition, even if the products receive regulatory approval, they remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including, for example, obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other non-clinical testing, changes to the product label, new or revised requirements for manufacturing, written notifications to physicians, or product recalls or withdrawals.
Further, a number of the Groups products that treat ADHD contain controlled substances and are subject to regulation by the US DEA and equivalent agencies in other countries.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 29 The failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue The Group enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing.
In these partnerships, the Group is sometimes dependent on its partner to deliver results.
While these partnerships are supported by contracts, the Group may not exercise direct control.
If a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties, the Group may suffer a delay in the development, a delay in the approval or a reduction in sales or royalties of a product.
The failure to secure new products or compounds for development, either through in-licensing, acquisition or internal research and development efforts, may have an adverse impact on the Groups future results The Groups future results will depend, to a significant extent, upon its ability to in-license, acquire or develop new products or compounds.
The Group also expends significant resources on research and development.
The failure to in-license or acquire new products or compounds, on a commercially viable basis, could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
The failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
The Group may fail to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business The Groups success depends upon its ability and the ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights.
Where possible, the Groups strategy is to register intellectual property rights, such as patents and trademarks.
The Group also relies variously on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third-parties to maintain its competitive position.
Patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the Group have been granted, or are pending in various countries, including the US, Canada, major European countries and Japan.
The Group intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the Group.
However, patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the Groups products or technologies.
The Groups patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn.
The Group cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third-party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to protect the Groups products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by thirdparties.
In the regular course of business, the Group is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.
See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for details of current patent litigation.
Additionally, the Groups products, or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may now, or in the future, infringe the patent rights of third-parties.
It is also possible that third-parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or sale of the Groups products.
If third-parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology, it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the Group or its strategic partners from developing, manufacturing or selling its products.
The Group may need to obtain licenses for intellectual property rights from others to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
In addition, any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable.
The Group also relies on trade secrets and other un-patented proprietary information, which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors and partners.
These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the Group with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
If the Groups employees, scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the Groups products under development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the Groups property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers.
Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the Groups proprietary rights.
The failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection, for any reason, could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the Groups product sales.
The Group has filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with its products in various countries including the US and countries in Europe and Latin America and intends to trademark new product names as new products are developed.
In addition, with respect to certain products, the Group relies on the trademarks of third-parties.
These trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the Group or the third-parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks.
The Groups inability or the inability of these third-parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third-party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the Groups trademarks and dilute their value.
If a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side effects, this could result in damage to the Groups reputation, the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the Group Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity from complaints concerning any of the Groups products, or those of its competitors, could have an adverse effect on the Groups ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products.
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims, product recalls, litigation and associated adverse publicity.
The cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited.
A successful product liability claim against the Group could require the Group to pay a substantial monetary award.
If, in the absence of adequate insurance coverage, the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defense of such a claim, it could become insolvent.
Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms.
Although the Group carries product liability insurance when available, this coverage may not be adequate.
In addition, it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will be available.
Moreover, an adverse judgement in a product liability suit, even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal, could generate substantial negative publicity about the Groups products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products.
Loss of highly qualified management and scientific personnel could cause the Group subsequent financial loss The Group faces competition for highly qualified management and scientific personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.
It may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel.
The Group has agreements with a number of its key scientific and management personnel for periods of one year or less.
The loss of such personnel or the inability to attract and retain the additional, highly skilled employees required for its activities could have an adverse effect on the Groups business.
30 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Financial review Treasury policies and organization The Groups principal treasury operations are co-ordinated by its corporate treasury function.
All treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by the Board of Directors.
As a matter of policy, the Group does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange contracts on which interest is at floating rates.
This exposure is primarily to US dollar, Euro and Canadian dollar interest rates.
As the Group maintains all of its investments and foreign exchange contracts on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed.
In the year to December 31, 2009 the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was less than 1% per annum.
The largest proportion of investments was in US dollar money market and liquidity funds.
The Group incurs interest at a fixed rate of 2.75% on Shire plcs $1,100 million in principal convertible bonds due 2014.
The building financing obligation of $46.7 million is also subject to a fixed interest rate over the lease term on the amount outstanding.
No derivative instruments were entered into during the year to December 31, 2009 to manage interest rate exposure.
The Group continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place to manage the risk.
Foreign exchange risk The Group trades in numerous countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.
The main trading currencies of the Group are the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, Pounds sterling and the Euro.
It is the Groups policy that these exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the subsidiarys functional currency.
Where significant exposures remain, the Group uses foreign exchange contracts being spot, forward and swap contracts to manage the exposure in respect of balance sheet assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary.
These assets and liabilities relate predominantly to inter-company financing and accruals for royalty receipts.
The Group utilizes these derivative instruments to manage currency risk on balance sheet foreign exchange exposures but the foreign exchange contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation into US dollars of the financial statements of non-US dollar functional subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2009 the Group had 26 swap and forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding to manage currency risk.
The swaps and forward contracts mature within 90 days.
The Group did not have credit risk related contingent features or collateral linked to the derivatives.
At December 31, 2009 the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $4.2 million.
Further details are included below.
Foreign exchange risk sensitivity The table below provides information about the Groups swap and forward foreign exchange contracts by currency pair.
The table presents the net principal amounts and weighted average exchange rates of all outstanding contracts.
All contracts have a maturity date of less than three months.
Principal value of Weighted amount average Fair receivable exchange rate value December 31, 2009 $M $M Swap foreign exchange contracts Receive USD Pay EUR 286.8 1.46 5.0 Receive GBP Pay USD 50.1 1.62 0.2 Receive CAD Pay USD 141.3 1.05 0.2 Receive USD Pay SEK 27.3 7.27 0.4 Market risk of investments As at December 31, 2009 the Group has $105.7 million of investments comprising available-for-sale investments in publicly quoted companies $87.0 million, equity-method investments $14.8 million and cost method investments in private companies $3.9 million.
The investment in public quoted companies and equity investment funds for certain investment funds which contain a mixed portfolio of public and private investments are exposed to market risk.
No financial instruments or derivatives have been employed to hedge this risk.
Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 31 Credit risk Cash is invested in short-term money market instruments, including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits.
The money market and liquidity funds in which Shire invests are all triple A rated by both Standard and Poors and by Moodys credit rating agencies.
The Group is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative contracts.
The Group limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which require counterparties to have a long-term credit rating of A A2 or better from the major rating agencies.
The internal credit limits are approved by the Board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury function.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts are major international financial institutions.
The Group has entered into many agreements with third-parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business.
Off-balance sheet arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Groups financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Inflation Although at reduced levels in recent years, inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business.
However, the Group believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years.
Dividend policy A first interim dividend for the first half of 2009 of 2.147 US cents 1.302 pence per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 6.441 US cents per ADS, was paid in October 2009.
The Board has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 9.250 US cents 5.910 pence per Ordinary Share equivalent to 27.750 US cents per ADS for the six months to December 31, 2009.
A first interim dividend for the first half of 2008 of 2.147 US cents 1.085 pence per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 6.441 US cents per ADS, was paid in October 2008.
A second interim dividend for the second half of 2008 of 7.761 US cents 5.469 pence per Ordinary Share equivalent to 23.283 US cents per ADS was paid in April 2009.
This is consistent with Shires stated policy of paying a dividend semi-annually, set in US cents per Ordinary Share.
It is intended that the first interim payment each year should be the higher of the previous years first interim US dollar dividend and the US dollar equivalent of the previous years Pound sterling first interim dividend.
Dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by the Board when the second interim dividend is determined.
Any dividend growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year.
