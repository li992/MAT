Business and financial review financial review  A detailed review of the trading results for the year is set out in the Chairmans statement, Chief Executives statement and the business reviews of ESAB and Howden.
Exceptionalitems In order to help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance, Charter presents items that are both material and non-recurring as exceptional items and excludes them from adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share.
The results for the year to 31 December 2009 include exceptional costs of 26.8 million, comprising restructuring costs of 26.3 million, of which 24.3 million was incurred by ESAB and 2.0 million was incurred by Howden, and the loss on the disposal of a business of 0.5 million.
The restructuring costs relate to the measures being taken by ESAB and Howden to bring manned capacity into line with demand and, in the case of ESAB, to reduce distribution and administration costs.
Restructuring costs comprise headcount reductions of 13.8 million, impairment of intangibles, property plant and equipment, inventory and receivables of 9.2 million and closure and other costs of 3.3 million.
On 13 May, ESAB completed the disposal of HD Engineering Limited, a manufacturer of drilling equipment, consumables and accessories, for a cash consideration of 1.7 million.
The loss on disposal was 0.5 million, net of exchange gains transferred from reserves of 0.9 million.
Earningspershare Basic earnings per share were 38.1 pence 2008: 90.1 pence.
However, adjusted earnings per share are considered a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Adjusted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting basic earnings per share for items not relating to underlying business performance.
Previously, amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill, exceptional items and exchange gains and losses on retranslation of intercompany loans, including attributable tax and minority interests, were excluded from basic earnings in calculating adjusted earnings per share.
In 2009, acquisition costs and the non-cash net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations have also been excluded as these amounts are not considered to relate to underlying business performance.
The impact of excluding acquisition costs and the net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations from adjusted earnings per share for 2008 is not significant and therefore 2008 adjusted earnings per share have not been restated.
Adjusted earnings per share decreased by 44.6 per cent to 55.0 pence 2008: 99.2 pence and were derived from basic earnings per share as set out below: Pershare Totalearnings 2009 2008 2009 2008 pence pence m m Basicearnings 38.1 90.1 63.5 150.2 Items not relating to underlying business performance: Exceptional items 16.0 5.0 26.8 8.3 Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill 1.5 1.1 2.5 1.9 i i Acquisition costs 0.2 0.3 i i Net financing charge retirement benefit obligations 4.6 7.7 Gains losses on retranslation of intercompany loan balances 2.4 2.8 4.0 4.6 Taxation on items not relating to underlying business performance 2.9 0.3 4.8 0.5 Minority share of items not relating to underlying business performance 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2  55.0 99.2 91.8 165.3 i The impact of excluding acquisition costs and the net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations from adjusted earnings per share for 2008 is not significant and therefore these amounts have not been restated.
Netfinancingcharge The net financing charge, before taking into account the net finance charge attributable to retirement benefit obligations and the retranslation of intercompany loan balances, was 3.1 million 2008: 1.2 million and comprised interest payable of 2.7 million 2008: 5.4 million, fair value loss on derivative financial instruments of 1.5 million 2008: 1.0 million, exchange losses on cash and borrowings of 1.1 million 2008: nil, other charges of 2.0 million 2008: nil and the unwinding of discounts on provisions of 0.3 million 2008: 0.4 million, offset by interest and other financing credits of 4.5 million 2008: 5.6 million.
28 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses  Financialstatements Otherinformation Taxation In 2009, the total tax on profit on ordinary activities was 17.9 million 2008: 39.0 million, which comprised: 2009 2008 m m Current tax charge 48.9 54.0 26.2 Deferred tax credit 15.5 Tax charge on adjusted profit before tax, before share of post-tax profits of associates and joint ventures 22.7 38.5 Tax on exceptional items 4.2 1.5 Tax on amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill 0.7 0.4 Tax on net financing charge retirement benefit obligations 1.1 Taxation on net gains on retranslation of intercompany loan balances 1.2 2.4 Taxcharge 17.9 39.0 The tax charge of 17.9 million compares with tax paid in the year of 46.0 million.
The tax charge is lower than the actual tax paid in the year primarily due to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets in the US and the settlement of a number of prior year tax liabilities.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 18.5 per cent 2008: 18.4 per cent, calculated as follows: 2009 2008 m m Profitbeforetax 92.7 197.7 Add deduct adjustments: Exceptional items 26.8 8.3 i Aborted acquisition costs 0.3 Amortisation of acquired intangibles and goodwill 2.5 1.9 i Net financing charge retirement benefit obligations 7.7 Net losses on retranslation of intercompany loan balances 4.0 4.6 3.5 Share of post-tax profits of associates and joint ventures 3.2 Adjusted profit before tax, before share of post-tax profits of associates and joint ventures 122.5 209.3  22.7 38.5 i  18.5% 18.4% i The impact of excluding acquisition costs and the net financing costs attributable to retirement benefit obligations from the calculation of the adjusted effective tax rate for 2008 is not significant and therefore the adjusted effective tax rate has not been restated.
The Group continues to benefit from profits being generated in relatively low-tax jurisdictions, such as China and Eastern Europe, together with the recognition and utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses.
The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to remain at approximately the same level in the medium term.
Currency Charters results are sensitive to movements in exchange rates.
The translation impact of exchange rate movements on segmental sales and operating profits before exceptional items in 2009 is set out below: Underlying movement 2008 atconstant translatedat2009 Currency 2009 exchangerates exchangerates fluctuations 2008 m m m m m Sales ESAB 1,031.4 348.8 1,380.2 120.4 1,259.8 Howden 627.8 80.6 708.4 81.2 627.2 Total 1,659.2 429.4 2,088.6 201.6 1,887.0 Operatingprofit  ESAB 64.5 96.4 160.9 12.3 148.6 Howden 70.5 13.7 84.2 11.1 73.1 Central operations 12.2 0.2 12.4 12.4 Total 122.8 109.9 232.7 23.4 209.3 Currency movements had a favourable impact on the 2009 results, increasing sales and operating profits by 10.7 per cent and 11.2 per cent respectively, compared with the prior year.
However, this is only the translation impact of currency movements.
It excludes the impact of currency movements on transactions when products are manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another.
The transaction impact of currency movements is difficult to quantify but the overall impact on the 2009 results is not considered significant.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 29 Business and financial review financial review continued Trading results and cash flow of overseas operations have been converted into sterling at average rates of exchange whereas the balance sheets were converted at year-end rates.

The principal components of this decrease were the profit for the year attributable to Charter shareholders of 63.5 million and net after-tax gains on cash flow and net investment hedges of 13.7 million, offset by net after-tax actuarial losses on retirement benefit obligations of 37.0 million, net translation exchange losses of 33.8 million and dividends paid of 35.0 million.
As at 31 December 2009, the total equity attributable to minority interests increased by 1.4 million to 41.4 million 2008: 40.0 million, reflecting profit attributable to minority interests of 11.3 million, offset by net translation losses of 3.0 million and dividends payable of 6.9 million.
The significant minority interests are the 30 per cent interest in Howden Hua Engineering Co Limited, the 45 per cent interest in Howden Africa Holdings Limited and the 44 per cent interest in ESAB India Limited.
Working capital has reduced by 34.8 million to 262.5 million, a decrease of 11.7 per cent.
Included within Trade and other receivables are amounts receivable under construction contracts of 41.9 million 2008: 71.9 million.
Included within Trade and other payables are amounts payable within twelve months under construction contracts of 45.3 million 2008: 113.1 million.
The net liability in respect of construction contracts has therefore reduced by 40.2 million in the year, mainly in Howden, reflecting a lower level of payments on account from customers due to lower order intake.
Excluding construction contracts, working capital has reduced by 21.0 per cent.
 As shown in the table below, the net obligation in respect of pensions and other post-retirement benefits increased by 22.9 million in the year to 162.2 million.

This represents cash conversion after exceptional items of 178.6 per cent compared with 79.4 per cent in 2008.
Free cash flow for the year was 64.5 million compared with 40.2 million in 2008, and reflects a significant investment of 64.8 million 2008: 69.2 million on capital expenditure and development costs, net of disposal proceeds.

Capital expenditure reflects the acquisition of an existing ESAB manufacturing plant in North America for 9.5 million, which was previously leased, together with the continued investment in new manufacturing facilities, new equipment and new computer systems in both businesses.
Cashandborrowings As at 31 December 2009, cash balances were 75.6 million 2008: 95.7 million, of which the majority was held overseas for local working capital purposes or pending dividend payments.
Of the cash held overseas, 3.2 million 2008: 4.1 million is retained as cash collateral in connection with certain local trading practices or banking facilities.
The credit status of institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored accordingly.
As at 31 December 2009, gross borrowings were 24.7 million 2008: 43.9 million.
Goingconcern At 31 December 2009, in addition to net cash balances of 50.9 million, the Group had undrawn centrally held committed borrowing facilities of 170 million, which are due to expire unless otherwise extended or renewed between 2011 and 2013.
Whilst these facilities have certain financial and other covenants, the financial strength of the Charter Group means that the covenants attaching to these facilities are not expected to prevent the full utilisation of the facilities if required.
In addition, various other members of the Charter Group have uncommitted and committed bank facilities in place, some of which are secured, to meet local funding requirements.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had 257.5 million of uncommitted bonding facilities, of which 113.8 million were provided by its principal bankers.
Bonds and guarantees totalling 131.2 million had been issued under these facilities.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing both the consolidated financial statements for the Group and the financial statements of the Company.
In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have considered carefully the risks to the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the current global economic and financial environment.
The Directors have also had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for 2010 and have considered the principal risks to which the Group is exposed, including those summarised on page 34.
The Directors monitor the expected outturn for the full year on an ongoing basis both in terms of profit and cash and appropriate mitigating action would be taken if it became apparent that there was a risk that the Group might miss its previous forecasts.
 Details of contingent liabilities are set out in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the accounting policies set out in note 1.
Applying accounting policies requires the use of certain judgements, assumptions and estimates.
The following accounting policies have been identified as being the most significant and where there is most risk of a material adjustment to the carrying value of the Groups assets and liabilities within the next financial year: goodwill impairment construction contracts deferred tax warranty and legal liabilities retirement benefits.
Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 33 Business and financial review financial review continued  Charter, both directly and through ESAB and Howden, is exposed to a wide variety of markets and geographies and seeks to manage the risks and uncertainties that arise from this.
In certain instances, and where it is cost-effective to do so, exposures can be transferred to third parties, for example through insurance or through currency hedging.
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by Charter, and the ways in which they are being managed, are set out below.
Economic recession Many regions in which Charter companies operate entered recession in the second half of 2008 and remained in recession during 2009: these regions include in particular Europe and North America, which together account for well over half of Charters total revenue.
The consumption of steel, which is a key macro-economic indicator of demand for ESAB products, saw unprecedented falls in 2009 across all major economic regions apart from China.
Whilst there are presently a number of leading economic indicators that suggest that the world economy is through its low point and starting to recover, it remains unclear how strong or sustained any recovery will be.
ESAB experienced a sharp reduction in the demand for its products in late 2008 and 2009.
In response, it took significant steps to reduce output and manned capacity.
Whilst it believes that these steps were appropriate in the light of prevailing levels of demand, there can be no certainty that additional steps will not be required and that additional exceptional costs will not be incurred.
In 2009, Howdens revenue was broadly in line with that achieved in 2008.
However, during the year, order intake was down markedly and in response Howden implemented measures to reduce headcount in anticipation of lower sales of new equipment.
These measures are considered to be appropriate in the light of expected levels of demand for its products, but any further fall in the level of order intake could require additional steps to be taken which are likely to involve additional exceptional charges.
During 2009, Howden experienced only limited order cancellations and deferrals, but it is possible that the incidence of cancellations may increase in 2010: whilst Howdens position is protected by a number of measures, including customer deposits which Howden could use to offset any costs or losses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation, there could still be a detrimental impact on Howdens business should the incidence of cancellations increase.
Financing During the final quarter of 2008, there was a significant reduction across most regions in the availability of banking facilities and other forms of financing, and availability remained generally weak throughout 2009.
The direct impact on Charter was limited, as Charter had previously negotiated sufficient committed bank facilities for its requirements.
In the light of the prevailing financial conditions, Charter reviewed certain aspects of the ways in which it conducts its business, including the credit-worthiness of customers which was continuously monitored and, where necessary, changes were made to the way in which Charter companies conducted business with them.
If economic recession and weak conditions in financial markets remain, there may also be disruption to supplies of goods and services to Charter companies.
Additional steps have been taken to monitor the financial condition and performance of suppliers and to mitigate any risk of failure by identifying alternative suppliers where possible.
The reduced availability of financing facilities may also have the effect of causing the power station, refinery or major construction projects with which Howden is involved to be delayed or cancelled.
To date, it is not believed that this has had a significant impact on Howdens business, but it may become a factor in the future if financial conditions remain volatile.
Actions of competitors ESAB and Howden both operate in competitive markets and are exposed to market behaviour such as aggressive pricing by a competitor seeking to enter a new market, or to maintain or grow sales in a weakening market.
As set out in the Business review, both businesses have established strong market positions through measures such as technological leadership, strong brands and providing cost-effective solutions to their customers needs.
Throughout the economic downturn, both ESAB and Howden have maintained capital expenditure at levels well in excess of depreciation and continued to invest in research and development, product innovation and customer service.
These measures are considered the most effective means to prevent competitors from gaining market share at the expense of ESAB or Howden.
Competitor action may result initially in reductions in profit, although these are more likely to be specific to particular product areas or geographies.
To date, there has been no evidence of widespread price-cutting by competitors of either ESAB or Howden, although there remains the possibility that this might happen in the future, especially if market conditions do not improve.
Foreign exchange: transaction risk Transaction risk arises from product being manufactured in one currency zone and sold in another.
In ESAB, manufacturing tends to be relatively close to the end-user, which naturally reduces currency exposures.
The principal transactional exposures arising within ESAB do so on account of the manufacture of product in Central Europe and Sweden which is exported to the Eurozone and other parts of Europe and elsewhere.
ESABs general policy is not to hedge currency exposures unless they relate to a significant specific contract.
In 2009, ESAB benefitted from transactional gains resulting from the depreciation of most Central European currencies against the euro and most other currencies, which partly offset the downward pressure on margins caused by lower volumes passing through the factories.
34 Charter International plc Annual Report 2009 Ourbusinesses  Financialstatements Otherinformation In relation to Howden, exposure is principally in relation to the US dollar, the euro and the Chinese renminbi.
Howden substantially covers forward its committed trading exposures.
Foreign exchange: translation risk Translation risk arises from the profits and net assets of non-sterling businesses being translated into a sterling value which depends upon the exchange rate.
Charters operations in the UK are limited and principally comprise Howdens manufacturing operations in Scotland and Northern Ireland and various managerial and administrative functions in London.
Customers in the UK account for less than 5 per cent of Charters revenue.
The largest profit translation exposures are in relation to the US dollar and the euro.
Generally, it is Charters policy not to hedge profit translation exposures: this may give rise to unexpected fluctuations in Charters reported profit.
The Company has significant investments in operations outside the UK: as a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the consolidated balance sheet.
In 2009, exchange translation losses reduced equity shareholders funds by 33.8 million.
In certain circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet exposures.
Gains and losses arising on such hedges are recognised as required under IFRS in the consolidated statement of changes in equity until the items being hedged have impacted the income statement.
During 2009, Charter paid 13.7 million in respect of the cash settlement of US dollar and euro net investment hedges.
Certain liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies.
These include working capital items, which naturally offset corresponding working capital assets, and retirement benefit obligations.
Charter does not have any meaningful amounts of debt denominated in foreign currencies.
Movements in exchange rates can cause the sterling values of these liabilities to fluctuate.
Legal and regulatory Charter companies have contracts and operations in many parts of the world.
They are subject to the laws and regulations of many jurisdictions including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export controls, money-laundering, false accounting, anti-bribery and competition provisions.
From time to time, Charter companies may be subject to regulatory investigations relating to its operations.
Non-compliance with these laws, regulations and restrictions could expose them to fines, penalties, suspension or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of Charter.
Charter, ESAB and Howden are subject to litigation and other forms of legal actions in the ordinary course of their business: further details are contained in note 27.
Pension risk There are various post-retirement benefit schemes in place within Charter, ESAB and Howden.
The assets held by the various schemes are invested by the trustees primarily in equities and bonds.
During 2009, the values of equities have recovered a proportion of the falls suffered during 2008.
The liabilities of each scheme are subject to movements in variables such as corporate bond yields, changes in life expectancy and forecasts of future rates of inflation.
The net liability which appears on Charters balance sheet relating to overseas schemes is also subject to movements in exchange rates: any depreciation of sterling against the US dollar and against European currencies in general could result in an increase in the net liability.
The level of cash contributions by the Company to the schemes is determined through periodic negotiations between the pension trustees and the Company, and also potentially by changes in legislation.
To date, increases in the level of cash contributions have been relatively modest, but uplifts may be larger in the future.
Raw material prices Most products manufactured by ESAB and Howden contain steel or other metals whose prices are generally determined on world markets but subject to regional differences.
After significant increases in the prices of various commodities, including steel, during the first three quarters of 2008, prices generally eased during the first half of 2009 and generally stabilised in the second half of the year.
During this time, ESAB was able to protect itself against price fluctuations through forward purchase contracts and by increasing its stocks of raw materials.
Historically, ESAB has generally been able to pass through the higher steel prices to its customers, although any future increases in raw material prices may lead to pressure on its margins.
Howden may also make use of forward purchase contracts to lock in margin.
In times of raw material price inflation, it has the opportunity to include cost price accelerator clauses in its sale contracts.
Internal controls Charter has an established system of internal controls covering its own activities and those of ESAB and Howden, which are considered essential for the effective management of such geographically diverse businesses.
These controls have been and will be continuously developed to take into account changes in the trading environments which the businesses face, and include compliance and selfcertification programmes together with the ongoing reviews performed by the Charter internal audit function which reports its activities and findings to the Companys Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.
The Audit Committee has been delegated formal responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls.
Any system of internal controls is to some extent vulnerable to deliberate malfeasance by employees or others associated with the Company and cannot provide absolute assurance.
A failure of the Companys system of internal controls could have a material impact on its financial position and trading prospects.
