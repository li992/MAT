For reference, guidelines to show the net translation exchange risks that the Group currently carries and an indication of the unhedged transaction risk, are shown below: Sensitivity of profit to translation Increase in headline and unhedged transaction exchange risk operating profit Geoffrey Martin For every 10 cent strengthening of the 10 March 2010 US Dollar against Sterling 4 million For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro against Sterling 4 million As the translation risk is not a cash cost, no exchange instruments are used to protect against this risk.
However, when the Group has net debt, the hedge of having a multicurrency debt facility funding these foreign currency trading units protects against some of this risk.
The most significant exchange risk that the Group takes arises when a division that is predominantly based in a foreign currency is sold.
The proceeds for those divisions will most likely be received in a foreign currency and therefore an exchange risk arises if these proceeds are converted back to Sterling, for instance to pay a dividend to shareholders.
Protection against this risk is taken on a case-by-case basis.
