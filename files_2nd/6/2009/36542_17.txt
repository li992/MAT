result BefOre tAX There was a loss before tax of 453.1 million for the year ended 31 December 2009, compared with the loss of 1,611.5 million for 2008.
The reduction in the deficit reflects the slowing decline and, in the second half of the year, partial recovery in property values during 2009.
Accordingly, for the first six months of the year, the Group reported a loss of 818.5 million, but a profit of 365.4 million in the second half.
Development properties are now accounted for under IAS 40 Investment Property and revaluation changes for developments are recognised in the income statement alongside those for investment properties.
In note 2 to the accounts, we have reanalysed the income statement to separately identify recurring, or adjusted, income and expenditure from large one-off items and valuation changes, categorised as capital and other.
The table below reconciles the loss for the year to the adjusted profit before tax of 130.0 million.

Disposals and the cessation of capitalised interest at the recently completed developments reduced profit.
However, these effects were more than offset by the interest saved by using the rights issue proceeds to repay debt, lower interest rates, the movement in exchange rates, rental indexation in France and rent reviews in the UK.
Adjusted earnings per share were 19.7 pence for 2009, a reduction of 6.1 pence compared with 25.8 pence for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The comparative figure for 2008 has been restated to take account of the bonus share element of the rights issue in March 2009.
Note 10A to the accounts on page 86 provides detailed calculations for earnings per share.
The following table summarises the calculation of adjusted earnings per share in 2008 and 2009: 2009 2008 Change Adjusted profit for the year m 125.3 110.3 13.6% Average number of shares in issue million 637.2 426.9 49.3% Adjusted earnings per share pence 19.7 25.8 -23.6% net rentAl inCOme At 293.6 million, net rental income for 2009 was 6.2 million, or 2.1%, lower than in 2008.
The income lost from disposals was greater than that gained from recently completed developments, the effects of exchange and indexation in France.
The tables below compare net rental income for 2009 and 2008, analysing the portfolio between investment properties owned throughout both years and those properties which have been acquired, sold or been under development at any time during the two year period.
Included within net rental income in 2009 is net income from car parks of 8.6 million and rent related to tenants turnover, which amounted to 3.5 million.
The comparative figures for 2008 were 8.4 million and 3.0 million respectively.
There is a trend in advertising away from television and radio and towards other media.
This has worked to the advantage of retailing destinations such as shopping centres, so that Hammerson benefits from additional income through the sale of advertising and merchandising opportunities in its malls.
In total this income amounted to 5.4 million in 2009 2008: 6.0 million.
Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 33 finAnCiAl review continued Property outgoings were 52.5 million in 2009, up from 38.2 million in the previous year.
The increase principally reflected higher costs of vacancy, including unrecovered service charges, together with lease incentives written off and bad debt expense.
Our investment portfolio generated an increase in net rental income of 1.1% on a like-for-like basis, as the impact of lettings, indexation and rent reviews more than offset the increased cost of vacancy in the UK retail portfolio.
2009 2008 Analysis of net rental income m m Net rental income as reported in the income statement 293.6 299.8 Items included in net rental income Amortisation of lease incentives and other costs 5.3 3.1 Rent allocated to rent free periods 10.6 4.1 Net income receivable 288.3 298.8 The table above reconciles net rental income disclosed in the income statement to the net income receivable, which is a proxy for the net cash inflow from tenant leases.
The amortisation of lease incentives and rent allocated to rent free periods have both increased year on year, reflecting a full years adjustment for the developments completed in 2008 and 2009.
The increase in tenant incentives written off is principally a result of tenants going into administration.

Lower staff numbers following the reorganisation in 2008 and reduced performance related bonuses contributed 2.6 million to the reduction.
A charge of 0.8 million is included in administration expenses in 2009 in respect of John Richards retirement.
Management fees receivable were 1.6 million lower than in 2008 due to the completion of several joint venture developments late in 2008 and the reduction of asset management fees linked to property values.
net finAnCe COsts Excluding the change in fair value of derivatives, capitalised interest and one-off investment income, net finance costs were 133.5 million in 2009, some 46.2 million or 26% lower than the equivalent 2008 figure of 179.7 million.
The reduction reflected the use of the proceeds of the rights issue and disposals to reduce indebtedness, together with lower interest rates.
Interest capitalised in respect of developments was 10.0 million, virtually all of which related to Union Square, which completed in October.
In 2008, interest capitalised totalled 35.9 million.
The Groups average cost of borrowing in 2009 was 5.1%, slightly lower than the average cost of 5.4% for 2008. sHAre Of results Of AssOCiAte During 2009, we sold a 75% interest in Bishops Square.
Our remaining 25% investment in the company which owns the property and its related debt is accounted for as an associate.
The share of results of the associate includes 0.9 million in respect of Hammersons share of net rental income and interest costs.
tAX Due to its status as a UK REIT and French SIIC, the Group bears minimal current tax.
Until mid-2009, a deferred tax provision was made for the UK tax that could arise on dividends to be received by Hammerson plc from French subsidiaries under the SIIC rules.
However in July 2009, a corporation tax exemption for foreign dividends, introduced by the UK Government, was enacted.
The result of this is the release of virtually all of the opening deferred tax provision for 2009 of 108 million.
The tax case relating to capital gains incurred by Grantchester prior to its acquisition by Hammerson in 2002, for which the Group paid a total of 52.0 million in tax and interest in 2008, has been settled in favour of HM Revenue & Customs.
No further tax costs were incurred in 2009. DiviDenD The Board has approved a second interim dividend, in lieu of a 2009 final dividend, of 8.5 pence per share.
Together with the first interim dividend of 6.95 pence, this makes a total dividend of 15.45 pence per share for 2009.
The total dividend for 2008 was 27.9 pence and this years dividend reflects the increased number of shares in issue following the rights issue.
The second interim dividend, for which the record date is 5 March 2010, will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax if appropriate.
Following the success of 2009s first interim dividend scrip alternative, shareholders will be offered a similar arrangement for the second interim dividend and have until 19 March 2010 to elect for the scrip alternative.
Further details of the scheme are provided in a letter which is being sent to shareholders today.
Where shareholders elect for the scrip dividend alternative, this will not be treated as a PID and will not be subject to withholding tax.
Shareholders should note that, whilst the scrip dividend scheme enables the Directors to offer an alternative to the cash dividend, there is no guarantee that the Board will offer a scrip dividend alternative for any future dividends.
CAsH flOw Cash generated from operations was 239 million in 2009 compared with 346 million in the previous year.
The figure for 2008 was particularly high due to the effects of exchange, the timing of receipts from tenants for the December quarters of 2007 and 2008 and the timing of VAT receipts and other changes to working capital.
The cash generated from operations in 2009 also reflected disposals in 2008 and 2009.
The increase in the cash inflow from operating activities from 30 million in 2008 to 105 million in 2009 reflected lower interest payments as a result of the rights issue, property disposals, lower interest rates and large tax payments in 2008 in respect of the final instalment of the UK REIT entry charge, the settlement of prior year tax liabilities and overseas disposals.
Capital expenditure, including acquisitions, was 227 million in 2009, whilst 424 million was raised from disposals.
After taking account of the net cash outflow from financing activities of 204 million, including the 584 million proceeds from the rights issue, there was a net increase in cash and deposits of 68 million in 2009.
Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 35 finAnCiAl review continued BAlAnCe sHeet At 31 December 2009, equity shareholders funds were slightly up on the year at 2.9 billion, as the decline in property values was offset by the proceeds from the rights issue and retained profit.
After adjusting for deferred tax and other items, adjusted net asset value per share was 4.21.
Detailed calculations for net asset value per share are provided in note 10B to the accounts and the table below shows a reconciliation of the movement in net asset value over the year.

Changes to IFRS mean that developments are now accounted for under IAS 40 Investment Properties.
Properties on which development is ongoing have been separately identified within note 11 to the accounts.
Income generating properties which were acquired with the intention of being developed have been reclassified as investment properties within the note.
These properties will be categorised as developments in the event that a development commences.
36 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2009 Business AnD finAnCiAl review finAnCinG Our policy is to optimise the Groups weighted average cost of capital by using an appropriate mix of debt and equity.
The Groups financial structure is monitored with reference to guidelines approved by the Board which currently include a minimum interest cover of 2.0 times, gearing of no more than 85% for an extended period and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than ten times.
For 2009, these ratios were 2.2 times, 72% and 8.3 times respectively.
We manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations using appropriate hedging policies.
At 31 December 2009, borrowings were 2.3 billion and cash and deposits were 183 million so that net debt totalled 2.1 billion, compared with 3.3 billion at the beginning of the year.
Property disposals and the rights issue reduced net debt by approximately 1.4 billion.
Hammersons share of the debt secured on Bishops Square is included in the balance sheet within investment in associate.
At the year end, the Groups borrowings had a weighted average maturity of around eight years and 78% of gross debt was at fixed rates of interest.
The chart below shows the maturity profile of our debt portfolio.
MATURITY ANALYSIS OF GROSS DEBT AND UNDRAWN FACILITIES AT 31 DECEMBER 2009 m 900 Bank debt drawn Undrawn facilities Euro bonds Sterling bonds 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Undrawn committed facilities were 584 million at the end of 2009, which, together with cash and short-term deposits, provided liquidity of 767 million.
Just 97 million of the undrawn facilities mature by the end of 2011.
Committed expenditure at the end of 2009 amounted to 60 million.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing, broadly equivalent to the ratio of net debt to shareholders equity, should not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income divided by net interest payable, should be not less than 1.25 times.
Three of the Companys unsecured bonds contain a similar gearing covenant and two contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175%.
The bonds do not contain an interest cover covenant.
The substantial reduction from the figure of 118% at 31 December 2008 resulted from lower levels of net debt, partly offset by the reduction in shareholders equity arising from the decline in the value of the property portfolio.
At 31 December 2009, the market value of the Groups debt was 5 million lower than its book value.
The corresponding figure for 2008 was 614 million and the substantial reduction during the year is principally the result of narrower credit margins.
