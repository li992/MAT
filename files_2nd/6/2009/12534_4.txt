Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 14 FINANCIAL REVIEW Tony Durrant Finance Director Production Economic environment 2005-2009 The early part of 2009 was a turbulent period for the world economy, the global capital markets and for oil and gas prices.
Brent oil prices opened the year at US$35 bbl but kboepd recovered quickly, peaking at US$79 bbl in December and averaging US$62 bbl for the year.
45 The crisis in the financial services industry had more far-reaching consequences and access 40 to capital for many smaller companies in the oil and gas sector remained challenging.
35 Premier was able to take advantage of its strong balance sheet and continued access 30 to capital to conclude successfully two material acquisitions during this period.
25 20 The sharp deterioration in the oil price environment during the second half of 2008 led to reduced levels of activity in the industry and downward pressure on exploration and 15 development costs during 2009.
Premier was able to capture the benefits of falling costs 10 in rig rates and project construction costs, and cost levels have now stabilised.
5 0 Income statement 05 06 07 08 09 Production levels in 2009, on a working interest basis, averaged 44,200 boepd compared to 36,500 boepd in 2008, an increase of 21 per cent.
On an entitlement basis, which under the terms of our PSCs allows for additional government take at higher oil prices, production was 40,150 boepd 2008: 31,750 boepd.
Realised oil prices, before hedging, averaged US$66.3 bbl compared with US$94.5 bbl for 2008.
Gas production averaged 156 mmscfd 2008: 148 mmscfd during the year or approximately 61 per cent of total production.
Average gas prices for the group were US$5.18 per thousand standard cubic feet mscf 2008: US$6.57 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, which are linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil HSFO pricing, in turn closely linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$11.0 mscf 2008: US$15.2 mscf for the year.
Total sales revenue from all operations was US$621.1 million 2008: US$655.2 million with higher production largely offsetting the decline in commodity prices.
Cost of sales was US$361.4 million 2008: US$317.6 million.
Unit operating costs were higher at US$12.2 per barrel of oil equivalent boe 2008: US$9.5 boe reflecting the higher than average costs of production associated with the acquired assets in the UK North Sea.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 15 2P Reserves Amortisation includes the effect of an impairment charge, as a result of a reserves downgrade, 2005-2009 of US$24.0 million in respect of the Chinguetti field in Mauritania.
Underlying unit amortisation excluding impairment rose to US$9.6 boe 2008: US$8.0 boe.
Exploration expense and premmboe licence exploration costs amounted to US$57.0 million 2008: US$42.9 million and US$20.3 million 300 2008: US$15.8 million respectively.
Exploration expense includes all costs relating to dry holes 250 drilled in 2009 and the write-off of previously capitalised exploration costs relating to PSC B in Mauritania, amounting to US$19.2 million.
Net administrative costs were stable at US$18.3 million 200 2008: US$17.2 million despite our growing presence in Aberdeen, Norway and Vietnam.
150 In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 3 Business Combinations, we have included in the income statement for the year an amount of US$11.6 million, representing 100 the excess of fair values recorded in respect of the Oilexco North Sea Ltd Oilexco acquisition over 50 and above cost.
These fair values were reviewed at year-end to reflect the additional information which has become available concerning conditions that existed at the date of acquisition.
For this 0 purpose, values were only allocated to assets with booked proven and probable reserves.
A 05 06 07 08 09 deferred tax asset of US$140.8 million was also recorded on the acquisition, reflecting the future value of UK corporation tax allowances acquired with Oilexco.
Operating profits were US$169.7 million 2008: US$261.7 million.
Finance costs, net of interest revenue and other gains were US$28.7 million 2008: US$12.4 million reflecting the increase in Operating cash flow borrowings arising from our acquisition and capital investment programmes.
Pre-tax profits were 2005-2009 US$79.9 million 2008: US$277.6 million after charging mark to market revaluation of the groups hedges of US$61.1 million 2008: US$28.3 million, gain.
$ million 400 Current tax charges in 2009 of US$48.2 million 2008: US$192.9 million are significantly lower due 350 to the utilisation of acquired tax allowances in the UK.
The current tax charge has also been more 300 than offset by a deferred tax credit representing the value of future tax allowances in the UK.
The 250 net tax credit is US$33.1 million 2008: US$179.3 million, charge.
The additional deferred tax asset 200 recognised at year-end is based on a long-term oil price of US$70 bbl.
US$275 million of UK tax allowances remain unrecognised at year-end.
Profit after tax is therefore a record US$113.0 million 150 2008: US$98.3 million resulting in basic earnings per share of 104.1 cents 2008: 99.0 cents, restated.
100 Cash flow 50 Cash flow from operating activities, before movements in working capital, amounted to US$453.5 0 million 2008: US$478.1 million.
After working capital items and tax payments, cash flow from 05 06 07 08 09 operating activities was US$347.7 million 2008: US$352.3 million despite the fall in oil and gas prices.
Cash flow from the Oilexco producing assets was consolidated from completion of the acquisition on 21 May 2009.
Capital expenditure in 2009 for exploration and development activities totalled US$303.1 million Profit after tax 2008: US$217.3 million.

20 0 05 06 07 08 09 Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 16 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Acquisitions and disposals The group completed two very significant acquisitions during the year and also initiated a number of disposals of assets which were not material for our operations.
On 25 March 2009, Premier announced the acquisition of Oilexco for US$505 million.
Oilexco was a company active in the UK Central North Sea which had been placed into administration by its lending banks on 7 January 2009.
The acquisition provided the group with a significantly greater presence in the North Sea, adding a material package of assets comprising existing producing fields, development projects of existing discovered reserves and a portfolio of exploration prospects, together with high quality UK operatorship capabilities.
The group funded the acquisition and associated costs by way of: a 4 for 9 rights issue of new Ordinary Shares at a price of 485 pence per share, raising gross proceeds of approximately 171 million US$252.2 million : new credit facilities comprising initially of a US$175 million 18-month bridge facility, a US$225 million three-year revolving credit facility and US$63 million and 60 million US$97 million three-year letter of credit facilities: and the groups existing cash resources.
The acquisition was completed on 21 May 2009 for a final consideration of US$500.7 million, after certain working capital adjustments for transactions between the effective date and completion.
Total consideration, as disclosed in the financial statements, of US$574.2 million includes US$63.0 million of cash paid by the group, which is held in trust for future abandonment obligations, and direct acquisition costs of US$10.5 million.
On 20 July 2009, the group announced that it had completed the acquisition of Delek Energy Vietnam LLC Delek, the holding company for a 25 per cent interest in Block 12W in the Nam Con Son Basin, offshore Vietnam.
The purchase price for the interest was US$72 million in cash which after completion adjustments amounted to US$83.9 million.
Future payments of up to a total of US$10 million are contingent on the development of new fields in Block 12W other than Chim So.
Following completion of the Delek acquisition and the exercise of PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corporations PVEP back-in right to acquire a 15 per cent interest in the PSC, Premiers interest in the block increased from an initial 37.5 per cent to 53.125 per cent.
On 19 August 2009, the group announced the sale of its 10 per cent non-operated interest in the NW Gemsa licence, onshore Egypt.
The licence contained the producing Al Amir field and the 2009 discovery at Geyad.
On 22 December 2009 the transaction was completed for an adjusted price of US$14.8 million in cash.
On 19 November 2009, Premier announced the sale of its 6.45 per cent equity interest in the Janice James fields for a production royalty interest.
The acquirer, Maersk Oil, will assume future operating costs, capital expenditure and abandonment obligations of the assets.
The transaction was completed on 5 March 2010.
At the same time, Premier also announced that it had reached agreement for the sale of certain UK blocks containing the Caledonia field, the Sheryl discovery and the Catcher prospect for a consideration of US$12 million in cash and future contingent payments of US$13 million.
The acquirer failed to achieve the necessary UK regulatory approvals and the agreement was terminated.
Discussions continue with potential purchasers of the groups interest in the Caledonia field.

Cash and cash equivalents of US$250.6 million excludes an amount of 43.0 million US$70.2 million held in an abandonment trust and classified in the balance sheet under trade and other receivables.
It is anticipated that this cash will be replaced by bank letters of credit following the resolution of certain tax issues regarding the winding-up of the trust.
Net debt cash $ million 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents 250.6 323.7 Convertible bonds 213.2 206.4 Other long-term debt 353.0 Total net debt cash 315.6 117.3 Excluding unamortised issue costs and allocation to equity.
Long-term borrowings are made up of convertible bonds and bank debt.
The bonds have a par value of US$250 million and a final maturity date of 27 June 2014.
Following the rights issue in April 2009, the bonds carry an adjusted equity conversion price of 13.56 per share.
New credit facilities of US$550 million were arranged in connection with the acquisition of Oilexco.
During subsequent syndication and the restructuring of the 18-month bridge facility, the total facility size was increased to US$789 million with a maturity of 31 March 2012.
As at 31 December 2009, drawn borrowings were US$353 million and issued letters of credit bank performance bonds were US$126 million.
Undrawn borrowing facilities were US$328 million which, together with cash on hand or held in escrow, amounted to US$649 million.
Financial risk management Consistent with its conservative financial approach, the Boards policy continues to be to lock in oil and gas price floors for a portion of expected future production at a level which protects the cash flow of the group and is consistent with the business plan.
These floors are supplemented by forward sales to meet other short-term financial objectives.
Floors are purchased for cash or via collars, funded by selling caps at a ceiling price when market conditions are considered favourable.
All transactions are matched as closely as possible with expected cash flows to the group: no speculative transactions are undertaken.
During 2009, oil price collars for 2.5 million barrels mmbbls matured at a cost of US$nil 2008: US$8.1 million.
At year-end, a total of 8.3 mmbbls of Dated Brent oil were hedged via collars for the period to end-2012 with an average floor price of US$49 bbl and an average cap of US$84 bbl.
This volume represents approximately 41 per cent of the groups expected liquids production over the period.
During the year, gas price collars for 120,000 metric tonnes of HSFO matured.
No changes were made to the groups existing gas hedges during the year which cover approximately 400,000 metric tonnes, representing approximately 22 per cent of expected Indonesian gas production for the period to June 2013.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 18 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued In connection with the Oilexco acquisition, 1.3 mmbbls of oil were sold forward at an average price of US$55.0 bbl.
Subsequent to year-end a further 1 mmbbls were sold forward at an average price of US$83.5 bbl.
From 1 January 2010 therefore, forward sales of oil amounting to 1.4 mmbbls or 20 per cent of expected 2010 liquids production were in place with an average weighted price of US$76.0 bbl.
In aggregate, cash premia of US$12.5 million were paid during 2009 to put in place new hedges or enhance existing ones.
Premiers gas hedging is required to be marked to market at the balance sheet date.
The aggregate valuation is a US$29.8 million liability 2008: US$2.9 million generating a US$26.9 million charge in the income statement.
Oil hedges have typically been incorporated within the pricing terms of physical offtake agreements for the underlying oil production avoiding the requirement to revalue the hedges at year-end.
At the time of the Oilexco acquisition however, it was not possible to embed new hedges within the terms of existing offtake agreements.
Accordingly, a charge of US$29.0 million is recorded in the 2009 income statement.
From 1 January 2010, following new offtake arrangements, further revaluations over the life of these hedges will not impact the income statement, and the existing provision of US$29.0 million will be credited to income in the years 2010 and 2011.
Premier operates and reports in US dollars.
Exchange rate exposures relate only to local currency receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Local currency requirements are acquired on a short-term basis.
The group recorded a gain of US$2.8 million on such short-term hedging during 2009 2008: US$2.5 million, loss.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view to minimising counter-party risks.
The group undertakes a significant insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with its exploration, development and production activities.
In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields.
Going concern The group monitors its capital position and its liquidity risk regularly throughout the year to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements.
Sensitivities are run to reflect latest expectations of expenditures, forecast oil and gas prices and other negative economic scenarios to manage the risk of funds shortfalls or covenant breaches and to ensure the groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Further details of the group funding facilities and liquidity position are included in the financial statements and related notes.
Despite economic volatility, the directors consider that the headroom provided by the available borrowing facilities gives them confidence that the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern.
As a result they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Business risks Premier is an international business which has to face a variety of strategic, operational, financial and external risks.
Under these distinct classes, the company has identified certain risks pertinent to its business including: exploration and reserve risks, loss of key human resources, drilling and operating risks, security risk in areas of operation, costs and availability of materials and services, economic and sovereign risks, market risk, foreign currency risk, loss of or changes to production sharing or concession agreements, joint venture or related agreements, and volatility of future oil and gas prices.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 19 Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our assets, personnel and reputation.
Premier manages its risks prudently by maintaining a balanced portfolio, through compliance with the terms of its agreements and strict application of appropriate policies and procedures, and through the recruitment and retention of highly skilled individuals throughout the organisation.
Further, the company has mitigated risks by focusing its activities mainly in known hydrocarbon basins in jurisdictions that have previously established long-term oil and gas ventures with foreign oil and gas companies, existing infrastructure of services and oil and gas transportation facilities, and reasonable proximity to markets.
A summary of the principal risks facing the company and the way in which these risks are mitigated is provided in this report and also on the companys website www.
