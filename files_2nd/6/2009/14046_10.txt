Income statement Overview Our business delivered a strong Sercos income statement for the year is summarised in Figure 1 below.
This includes financial performance in 2009, with the results of joint ventures which are proportionately consolidated.
revenue growing 27.1% and Adjusted operating profit increasing by 39.0%.
Figure 1: Income statement Our results benefited from the Year ended 31 December 2009 2008 acquisition of SI International, Inc. SI m m Increase and from currency movements: Revenue 3,970.0 3,123.5 27.1% excluding currency, revenue growth Gross profit 586.8 456.8 28.5% was 20.8% 10.2% excluding SI and Administrative expenses 357.1 291.6 22.5% Adjusted operating profit growth was Adjusted operating profit 229.7 165.2 39.0% 31.1% 15.8% excluding SI.

Profit before tax 177.1 136.1 30.1% Free cash flow grew by 45.8% to Tax 46.9 36.5 28.5% 137.3m, and Group recourse net debt Profit for the year 130.2 99.6 30.7% reduced by 136.8m to 387.7m from Effective tax rate 26.5% 26.8% the 2008 year end position.
Adjusted earnings per share 29.53p 22.20p 33.0% Earnings per share 26.76p 20.49p 30.6% Dividend per share 6.25p 5.00p 25.0% 1.1 Currency translation The increase in the size of overseas operations with earnings not denominated in Sterling, principally as a result of the acquisition of SI at the end of 2008, and changes in currency exchange rates over the last 12 months, have benefited Sercos reported results.
In order to present the underlying growth of the business in the year, the effect of currency exchange rate changes on revenue, Adjusted operating profit, investment revenue and finance costs, Adjusted profit before tax and Group recourse net debt are presented in the Finance Review.
The currency effect has been calculated by translating non-Sterling earnings, including those of SI, for the year ended 31 December 2009 into Sterling at the average foreign exchange rates for 2008.
Revenue growth, excluding SI and currency effects was 10.2%.
Organic revenue growth, excluding currency, was 9.4%, and reflects the growth of existing contracts and the contribution of new contracts.
SIs revenue was US Dollar 618.5m 331.9m excluding currency effects, which added 10.6% to revenue growth.
SIs revenue grew 7.5% when compared to 2008.
Currency effects added a further 196.0m 6.3% to Group revenue.
1.3 Gross margin Gross margin the average contract margin across our portfolio was 14.8% 2008: 14.6%.
1.4 Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit increased by 39.0% to 229.7m representing an Adjusted operating profit margin of 5.79%.
Adjusted operating profit margin increased by 50 basis points 45 basis points excluding currency effects.
The table in Figure 2 illustrates the Adjusted operating profit and margin resulting from the Group excluding SI and currency, SI, and currency effects.
1.5 Investment revenue and finance costs Investment revenue and finance costs totalled a net cost of 35.0m 2008: 19.9m, an increase of 15.1m.
The increase, excluding currency effects, was 12.4m.
Borrowing costs to fund the SI acquisition and an increase in the net pension funding cost of 5.7m charged to the income statement were the principal reasons for this increase.
1.6 Adjusted profit before tax Adjusted profit before tax was 194.7m, an increase of 34.0%.
Excluding SI and currency effects, the Adjusted profit before tax margin was 4.92%, an increase of 27 basis points.
1.7 Tax The tax charge of 46.9m 2008: 36.5m represents an effective rate of 26.5%, compared with 26.8% in 2008.
The reduction principally reflects the fall in the UK corporation tax rate from the blended UK corporation tax rate of 28.5% in 2008 to 28.0% in 2009.
1.8 Earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS rose by 33.0% to 29.53p.
EPS and Adjusted EPS are calculated on an average share base of 486.6 million during the year 2008: 485.7 million.
Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 16:20 Page 40 40 Finance Review continued 2. Dividend Sercos policy is to increase the total dividend each year broadly in line with the increase in underlying earnings.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 4.40p per share, representing an increase on the 2008 final dividend of 25.0%, and bringing the total dividend for the year to 6.25p, a growth of 25.0%.
The final dividend will be paid on 19 May 2010 to shareholders on the register as at 12 March 2010.
Cash flow The Group generated a free cash inflow of 137.3m 2008: 94.2m, an increase of 45.8%.
Figure 3 analyses the cash flow.
As in previous years, we have designed the analysis to show the true cash performance of the Group the cash flows generated by subsidiaries plus the dividends received from joint ventures.
It therefore differs from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 85, which proportionately consolidates the cash flows of joint ventures.
The adjustment line in Figure 3 reconciles the movement in Group cash to the consolidated cash flow.
Figure 3: Cash flow Year ended 31 December 2009 2008 m m Operating profit excluding joint ventures 150.6 107.8 Non cash items 75.4 40.6 Group EBITDA 226.0 148.4 Working capital movement 27.2 22.8 Group operating cash flow 198.8 125.6 Interest 31.5 25.0 Tax 26.5 11.8 Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets 49.8 31.8 Dividends from joint ventures 46.3 37.2 Group free cash flow 137.3 94.2 Disposal of investments subsidiaries 0.6 1.9 Acquisition of subsidiaries 15.4 322.2 Financing 36.8 289.0 Dividends paid 25.9 21.6 Group net increase in cash and cash equivalents 59.8 41.3 Adjustment to include joint venture cash impacts 14.1 2.8 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 73.9 44.1 Note: Group EBITDA is earnings from subsidiaries excluding joint ventures before interest, tax, depreciation, intangible amortisation and other non cash items.
3.1 Group operating cash flow Group operating cash flow of 198.8m 2008: 125.6m reflects a conversion of Group EBITDA into cash of 88% 2008: 85%.
The increase in working capital from 22.8m to 27.2m reflects the requirements of a growing business and the continued high level of contract start ups.
3.2 Interest Net interest paid was 31.5m, compared to 25.0m in 2008 reflecting the increase in borrowings resulting from the acquisition of SI in 2008.
The increase reflects the fact that there was no tax relief available in 2009 on the special pension contribution made in 2007.
Cash tax is below the equivalent charge in the income statement as a result of accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences.
3.4 Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets Net expenditure on tangible and intangible assets in the year was 49.8m 2008: 31.8m.
Gross expenditure, excluding disposals, was 52.3m 2008: 48.7m representing 1.6% of Group revenue excluding joint ventures 2008: 2.0%.
3.5 Dividends from joint ventures Dividends received from joint ventures totalled 46.3m 2008: 37.2m, a conversion rate of 93% 2008: 84% of joint ventures profit after tax and minority interest, excluding costs allocated by Group.
3.6 Acquisition of subsidiaries To effect the partnership arrangement between Serco and Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust announced on 30 January 2009, in February 2009, Serco Group plc acquired a 50% interest in GSTS Pathology LLP.
The joint venture arrangement with Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust will provide improved pathology services to the Trust and target the significant national and international pathology market.
Total cash outflows associated with this transaction were 5.5m including directly attributable costs.
Other acquisition costs included the acquisition of Sandrunner Limited, a UK based specialist consultancy provider, for 0.3m in January 2009 and further payments in relation to the acquisition of Infovision and SI in December 2008 of 3.7m and 5.9m respectively.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition of Infovision and SI to the year ended 31 December 2008, the fair values of the acquired companies assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities were determined provisionally.
The fair value adjustments arising from the acquisitions were finalised in the current year, with adjustments made to the previously published fair values.
The Consolidated Balance Sheet at 31 December 2008 has been restated to reflect the finalisation of the fair value adjustments.
These adjustments represent managements best estimate of the adjustments required to restate book values to fair values at the date of acquisition.
The net effect of these adjustments is to reduce goodwill by 1.5m.
3.7 Financing The movement in financing resulted primarily from repayments on our committed facility and non recourse debt.
Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 16:20 Page 42 42 Finance Review continued 4.
Net debt Figure 4 analyses Sercos net debt.
Figure 4: Net debt Year ended 31 December 2009 2008 m m Group - cash and cash equivalents 253.7 199.8 Group - loans 619.1 708.8 Group - obligations under finance leases 22.3 15.5 Group recourse net debt 387.7 524.5 Joint venture recourse net cash 58.2 44.5 Total recourse net debt 329.5 480.0 Group non recourse debt 29.0 34.1 Total net debt 358.5 514.1 4.1 Group recourse net debt Group recourse net debt decreased by 136.8m to 387.7m.
This reflects the changes in currency exchange rates which reduced Group recourse net debt by 52.0m together with the repayment of debt.
Group cash and cash equivalents rose to 253.7m, an increase of 53.9m, primarily reflecting periodic changes in working capital.
Cash and cash equivalents includes encumbered cash of 11.2m 2008: 10.4m.
This is cash securing credit obligations and customer advance payments.
4.2 Group non recourse debt The Groups debt is non recourse if no Group company other than the relevant borrower has an obligation to repay the debt under a guarantee or other arrangement.
The debt is excluded from all of our credit agreements and other covenant calculations, and therefore has no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Group non recourse debt reduced by 5.1m to 29.0m, primarily as a result of the payments made in line with the debt repayment schedule on debt relating to our Driver Examination Services contract in Canada.
Pensions The Group operates and is a member of a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2009, the net liability included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet arising from our defined benefit pension scheme obligations was 113.6m 2008: 20.5m, on a pension scheme asset base of 1.4bn.
Figure 5: Defined benefit pension schemes At 31 December 2009 2008 m m Group schemes non contract specific 120.0 0.7 Contract specific schemes: reimbursable 144.3 89.6 not certain to be reimbursable 29.9 24.4 Net retirement benefit liabilities 294.2 114.7 Intangible assets arising from rights to operate franchises and contracts 11.4 14.4 Reimbursable rights debtor 144.3 89.6 Deferred tax assets liabilities 24.9 9.8 Net balance sheet liabilities 113.6 20.5 The total pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2009, including the proportionate share of joint ventures, increased to 92.4m 2008: 85.9m.
Within this charge, the Groups contributions to UK and other defined contribution pension schemes increased to 64.8m 2008: 49.0m, reflecting the higher proportion of Group employees who are now members of defined contribution pension schemes.
The charge relating to the Groups defined benefit schemes was 27.6m 2008: 36.9m, principally as a result of changes to inflation assumptions as at the end of 2008.
Serco has three main types of scheme which are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.
Each type has its own accounting treatment under International Financial Reporting Standards.
These are: Non contract specific schemes which do not relate to specific contracts or franchises.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss for the year to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income SOCI : Reimbursable schemes where we have a right of full cost reimbursement and therefore include both the pension scheme deficit and offsetting reimbursable rights debtor in the balance sheet: and Not certain to be reimbursable schemes relating to specific contracts or franchises, where the deficit will pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss on our share of the deficit for the year to the SOCI, recognise a recoverable intangible asset on the balance sheet at the start of the contract or franchise and amortise the intangible asset to the income statement over the contract or franchise life.
Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 16:20 Page 44 44 Finance Review continued Serco has limited commercial risk in relation to the contract specific schemes, due to either the right of cost reimbursement or because the deficit will, in general, pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
Among our non contract specific schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
At 31 December 2009, SPLAS had a deficit of 54.7m 2008: surplus of 62.4m.
The deficit reflects the effect of the market conditions on investment returns in the year and an increase in inflation assumptions.
The regular triennial review of SPLAS is currently ongoing.
As part of this process, we are working closely with the Trustees on options for the Scheme.
Figure 6 shows the sensitivity of the liabilities of our pension schemes to changes in discount rates and to adjustments in the actuarial assumptions for the rate of inflation, members salary increases and life expectancies.

Treasury The Groups principal debt finance comprises a 400m bank revolving facility which matures in September 2013 together with a term loan and bilateral facility totalling US Dollar 550m to fund the acquisition of SI.
The term loan and bilateral facility are repayable between September 2010 and September 2013.
There is a scheduled repayment of US Dollar 92m due in September 2010: thereafter the next repayment on these facilities is due in September 2011.
The facilities, which are syndicated with a group of 13 banks, are unsecured.
As at 31 December 2009, 458m had been drawn down on these combined facilities 2008: 560m.
Excluding the effects of currency on the US Dollar denominated debt, the equivalent draw down would have been 514m.
Serco has loan notes in issue under a private placement of 117m, which will be repaid evenly from 2011 to 2015.
Segmental information As disclosed in note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Directors have determined that the segments under IAS 14 continued to be appropriate under IFRS 8 for 2009.
Although management information is presented in a variety of ways, the reportable segments presented within the financial statements reflect the principal way in which management information was reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker the Chief Executive and Executive Board during the year.
As discussed in the Chief Executives Statement, the Group has repositioned the business for growth and, as a result, has created five new divisions.
This change was effective from 1 January 2010.
We will present these divisions as our new reportable segments for the first time in the half year results announcement for the six month period ended 30 June 2010, including comparatives.
The new reportable segments are: Civil Government, comprising UK and Europe civil government and transport: Local Government and Commercial, comprising our UK and Europe IT and BPO, integrated services, education and commercial businesses: Defence, Science and Nuclear, bringing together UK and Europe defence and science-based businesses: Americas, comprising US defence, intelligence and federal civil government agencies operations, and Canadian operations: and AMEAA, which consists of our operations in Africa, Middle East, Asia including Hong Kong and India and Australasia.
Going concern The Directors have acknowledged the guidance Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009, published by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2009.
Whilst the current economic environment remains uncertain, the broad base of our contract portfolio and with over 90% of our customers being government bodies, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks as discussed in the section Principal risks and uncertainties successfully and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Groups revenues are largely derived from long-term contracts with governments which, historically, have been largely unaffected by changes in the general economy.
The contract portfolio is spread across a number of markets, sectors and geographies such that a downturn in any one segment is highly unlikely to affect the Group as a whole.
In addition, with an order book of 17.1bn and high visibility of future revenue streams 91% in 2010, 76% in 2011 and 64% in 2012, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks despite the current uncertain economic climate.
In September 2008, the Group secured medium-term financing by entering into a five-year revolving credit facility and bilateral facilities.
Including the term loan and US private placements, the Group has in excess of 860m of credit facilities.
As at 31 December 2009, the headroom on the facilities was approximately 300m.
The first repayment on these facilities falls due in September 2010 for an amount of US Dollar 92m.
The Group fully expects to meet this repayment through internally generated cash flows.
Based on the information set out above, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
