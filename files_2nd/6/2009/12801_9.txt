These pubs are likely to be sold or converted for alternative use within the next few years and have been written down to their fair value less costs to sell.
The 483m charge also includes impairments recognised on pubs where their expected future cash flows have fallen to a level such that their value-in-use is below carrying value.
The 180m impairment recognised in the Punch Pub Company division is primarily due to the reduction in profits experienced in the current financial period, being brought about by the change in the consumer environment impacting the trading for these pubs.
The impairment has been recognised on pubs where the expected future cash flows have fallen to a level such that their value-in-use is below carrying value.
Accounting standards require that where the value-in-use of individual pubs falls below their carrying value, then this reduction is charged to the income statement.
Uplifts in value are only reflected in the financial statements to the extent that they reverse a previous impairment charge.
Included within the impairment charge for the year are reversals on impairment losses previously recognised of 50m for Punch Partnerships and 46m for Punch Pub Company.
The impairment reversals are primarily due to the identification of pubs where expected future cash flows have risen to a level such that value-in-use is now above carrying value.
In addition to the pub impairment charge, the Group made a loss on disposal amounting to 32.3m, the majority relating to a goodwill disposal of 28m, 18m of which relates to Punch Partnerships and 10m to Punch Pub Company, representing the apportioned value of goodwill allocated to those pubs disposed 1.6m of in the year.
