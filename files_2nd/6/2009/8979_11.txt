an increase in work in progress within the smelters in Kazakhmys Copper in the last quarter of the year which will be processed into copper cathodes during 2010: negative final pricing adjustments on provisionally priced contracts at 31 December 2008 within Kazakhmys Copper of approximately $50 million were paid to Chinese customers in January and February 2009 due to the sharp fall in copper prices at the end of 2008.
This contributed to the adverse working capital movement in respect of trade and other payables within Kazakhmys Copper: an increase in the level of trade receivables within the Kazakhmys Copper Division given the sharp increase in commodity prices seen during the second half of the year: and within MKM the adverse working capital impact on inventory levels of $102 million and trade receivables of $16 million was largely commodity price driven.

These include assumptions as to grade estimates, recovery rates, commodity prices, exchange rates, production costs, capital costs, processing and reclamation costs and discount rates.
The actual volume of ore extracted and any changes in these assumptions are accounted for prospectively as they could affect future depreciation rates and carrying values.
The majority of other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the appropriateness of useful economic lives at least annually and any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
Contingencies Material contingencies facing the Group are set out in note 34 of the financial statements commencing on page 142.
A contingent liability arises where: a past event has taken place for which the outcome will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events outside of the control of the Group: or a present obligation exists but is not recognised because it is not probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
A provision is made when a loss to the Group is likely to crystallise.
The assessment of the existence of a contingency and its likely outcome, particularly if it is considered that a provision might be necessary, involves significant judgement taking all relevant factors into account.
As laws and regulations in Kazakhstan continue to evolve, for example, in the areas of taxation, environment and subsoil rights, uncertainties regarding contingencies are greater than typically found in countries with more developed legal and regulatory frameworks.
Taxation The determination of the Groups obligations for taxes for each reporting period requires the interpretation of tax legislation.
Whilst the Directors believe that the Groups judgements are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the Groups future tax obligations.
The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities.
The tax system and tax legislation in Kazakhstan have been in force for only a relatively short time compared to more developed jurisdictions and are subject to frequent changes and varying interpretations.
The Directors interpretations of such legislation in applying it to business transactions may be challenged by the relevant tax authorities and, as a result, the Group may be assessed for additional tax payments including fines, penalties and interest charges, which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position and results of operations.
Such uncertainties may relate to calculating the profitability of each subsoil contract for mineral extraction tax purposes, the applicability of excess profits tax to the Groups mining and processing operations and the structuring of cross border transactions, particularly in respect of the application of transfer pricing policies.
