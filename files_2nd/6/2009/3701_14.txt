Details of the most 27 significant of these instruments are described in notes 26 and 28 of the Notes to the Group financial statements.

Going concern The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out on pages 14 to 21 and 28 of the Business Review.
In addition, notes 24 to 28 of the Notes to the Group financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, financial risk management, details of financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposure to credit, liquidity and other risks.
