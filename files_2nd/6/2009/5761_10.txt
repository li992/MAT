The ability to maintain tight control of lending decisions across such a large network is a major priority for the bank.
During 2008, Sberbank began a multi-stage project to implement Experians full suite of Strategy Management systems in order to centralise the control of its lending strategy and enhance decisionmaking at each stage of the banks relationship with customers.
Strategy Management will be used for deciding whether to accept customer applications and on what terms, monitoring customer performance and determining the best time to offer new products and, if accounts fall into arrears, deciding on the appropriate follow-up actions.
Vadim Kulik, Director of Sberbanks Centre for Development of Centralised Retail Credit Back-Office: Experian is providing Sberbank with the most advanced analytical technologies to control our lending operations.
These will give us much greater control of risk, while increasing our business effectiveness and enabling us to automate millions of decisions each year.
For our customers, it will mean we can make faster decisions and offer products that are more relevant to their individual needs and circumstances.

Successfully managing customers who have fallen into arrears and who may be in financial difficulty is an important concern for the bank.
In the UK, Barclays chose Experians Tallyman debt management and collection system to improve collections for retail banking customers in arrears on their mortgages, current accounts and unsecured loans.
Tallyman is enabling Barclays to take a much more proactive approach in rehabilitating these customers, while minimising the amount of debt that is written off.
Peter Frost, Operations Director, Barclays PLC: In todays financial environment it is essential to employ best practice systems to manage customers who might be getting into difficulties.
Working with Experian, we are improving our collections performance through being able to apply the most appropriate treatment for each customer at the right time.
We have also been able to automate many aspects of the collections process, which has made decision-making both faster and more cost-effective.
