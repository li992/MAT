An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Mineral rights for the assets under development are included within Exploration and development.
When a production phase is started, mineral rights are transferred into Mining assets and are depreciated as described below.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the Capital  original carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
Capital  assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.

Refined metals are valued at the average total cost of production per saleable unit of metal.
Work in-process, metal concentrate and dor are valued at the average When it has been determined that a mining asset can be economically developed as a result of established proven and total production costs at each assets relevant stage of production.
Ore stockpiles are valued at the average cost of mining probable reserves, the costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred that ore. Where ore stockpiles and work in-process are not expected to be processed within 12 months, those inventories are to as stripping costs, are capitalised as a part of mining assets when these costs are incurred.
Non-mining assets Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on forward metal prices for inventories which Non-mining assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Depreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Consumables and spare parts Estimated useful lives are as set out below: Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the weighted Machinery and equipment 5-20 years average moving cost.
The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is classified as a long-term asset in the Groups consolidated balance sheet.
Net realisable value represents the estimated Transportation and other assets 3-10 years selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with Financial instruments the assets carrying amount at the date.
The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
