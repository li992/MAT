Tim Fallowfield Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director Supplier rebates are typically agreed on an annual basis, aligned financial year and are earned based on pre-agreed with the 5 May 2015 targets, mainly linked to sales.
These require estimates of the income earned up to the balance sheet date, for each relevant supplier contract.
Where agreements span a financial period-end, estimations are required of projected turnover and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate level earned as agreements may involve multiple tiers.
In order to minimise any risk arising from estimation, supplier confirmations are also obtained to agree the value to be recognised at year-end, prior to it being invoiced.
Rebates represent the smallest element of Sainsburys supplier income and by aligning the agreements to Sainsburys financial year where possible, judgements required areminimised.
Supplier income represents a material deduction to cost of sales and directly affects the Groups reported margin.
The supplier arrangements resulting in this supplier income can be complex, with income spanning multiple products over different time periods, and there can be multiple triggers and discounts.
We have not disclosed the quantum of supplier income within the Group income statement as this information is commercially sensitive.
