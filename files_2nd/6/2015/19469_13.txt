Pensions at AER At 31 December 2015 the Companys UK defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new members, was valued at an accounting surplus of 237.0m on the Companys balance sheet.
The trustees value the scheme on a different basis and the most recent triennial actuarial valuation at 31 March 2013 showed that the Scheme was 98.7% funded with a deficit of 17.8m.
A recovery plan was agreed with contributions of 3.2m per annum over a six-year period being paid into a joint escrow account by the Company.
The first payment was made in October 2014 and the escrow balance was 6.4m at 31 December 2015.
In the event that the deficit is not cleared by the time of the 31 March 2019 valuation, itwill be funded from the escrow account.

An interim valuation of the Scheme is being carried out at 31 December 2015 and the current recovery plan will be discussed by the Company and the Trustee later in the year in light of the strong funding position.
