By area of operation Housing associations have strong balance sheets and the ability to borrow against their existing housing stocks, at very low rates of South Midlands East North interest.
The provision of guarantees by the Homes and Communities Agency HCA also helps to reduce their funding costs.
Lower levels of government grants mean that housing associations 11,150 4,600 are increasingly looking to cross-subsidise new affordable homes by developing homes for sale.

Our strategic land holdings stood at 1,500 acres at the year end 2014: 1,405 acres and we expect to generate in excess of 8,000 plots from this land.
To increase delivery in both the short and longer-term, we expanded our strategic land team during the year.
Affordable housing and regeneration In addition to our Galliford Try Partnerships business see page 25, Linden Homes develops affordable homes for sale.
Providing a proportion of affordable housing on our sites is often a condition of obtaining planning permission.
We sell a large majority of these affordable homes to housing associations, who typically pay us during the construction phase and help us to optimise the cash contribution from affordable homes.
This business had another strong year, benefiting from our excellent client relationships, active management of our grant 02 from the HCA, which we can use to support affordable housing schemes, and further growth in our joint venture relationships with leading housing associations.
During the year, we formed important new joint ventures with Home Group at Newhall in Harlow, and with Spectrum Housing Group, through which we will deliver new homes in the South West over the next 15 years.
Our existing joint ventures, with Thames Valley Housing, Aster Homes, Notting Hill Housing and Devon & Cornwall Housing, all performed well.
Public land releases through the HCAs Delivery Partner Panel and the Greater London Authority have provided excellent land acquisition opportunities.
We continue to be successful insecuring public land on deferred payment terms.
The underlying fundamentals for the UK affordable homes market continue to be strong, with a continuing and cumulative shortfall 03 between supply and demand.
The changes to social rent setting policy announced in the recent budget will have an impact on the tenure profile of affordable housing, but will not reduce underlying demand.
We anticipate some uncertainty in the short-term, as registered providers assess the impact and local authorities consider the potential in alternative tenures.

The shortage of housing in the UK will continue, with mortgage availability contributing to demand and to sustainable increases in selling prices.
Continued government support for Help to Buy is alsobeneficial.
In affordable homes we have unrivalled capabilities, with both contracting and development expertise, which is a highly attractive combination to clients in this rapidly growing market.
At the year end, we had secured plots for 100% of our planned developments in 2016 and 87% for 2017.
We will continue to drive efficiency to enhance our margin.
While supply chain conditions have eased somewhat during the year, the main challenge continues to be to deliver homes within our expected timescales and costs.

Other key wins included a 36 million contract with ExtraCare Charitable Trust for a new retirement village our seventh development for this client.
The increase in mixed-tenure revenue contributed to the rise in 04 margins, as we successfully implemented our strategy to fund these developments using cash generated by Galliford Try Partnerships contracting operations.
The Linden Homes brand and approach to customer care makes these developments highly attractive to buyers and positions them as a premium product, compared to homes provided by competing contractors.
Our capability in landled developments also contributed to the higher margin.
For these schemes, we find sites, obtain planning permission for affordable housing and then sell the site on to a housing association client.
Galliford Try Partnerships contracting order book was 825 million at the year end 2014: 513 million.
At the same date, the business had 43million of unit sales in hand.
Outlook The outlook for the affordable homes market is strong, reflecting the critical shortage of homes in this sector.
We see strong prospects for Galliford Try Partnerships and an opportunity to 04 Brook House in North London accelerate our growth in mixed-tenure developments, by investing up to 30 million of extra funding over the next few years to buy land for theseschemes.
As in Linden Homes, the challenge is to ensure we have the resources, in terms of both our supply chain and our own people, to continue to deliver our plans.
