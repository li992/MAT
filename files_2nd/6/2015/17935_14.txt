This is largely due to a change in Groups markets and services, assessing the committed facility and the actuarial assumptions used to assess the present value of the financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Groups ability liabilities.
Most notably, the discount rate assumption has increased to access further funding.

Group Finance Director The liability for the other European Schemes decreased by 0.7m.
25 February 2016 The key reason for the decrease in the deficit in the European Schemes is an increase in the discount rate assumptions used in most countries due to rises in corporate bond yields over the year.
Post balance sheet events There are no post balance sheet events that require disclosure in the financial statements.
Going concern In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report and the Groups viability statement made on page 27, the directors have considered the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position.
This includes an overview of the Groups financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a combination of cash resources, committed and uncommitted facilities and overdrafts.
The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities are repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due for renewal as set out below.
There is sufficient headroom in the committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities can be operated as contracted for the foreseeable future.
The committed facilities as at 31 December 2015 were as follows: 230m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 3 July 2019 $10m Letter of Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016 The December 2015 weighted average life of the committed facilities was 3.4 years.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable potential changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current committed facilities.
