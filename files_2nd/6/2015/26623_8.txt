2014 to 106 basis points for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The total net management fee margin defined as gross management fees less external distribution costs has decreased from 114 basis points to 96 basis points in 2015.
These reductions are due to a continued mix shift towards institutional assets, particularly in the alternatives quant category, and the full year impact of including Numerics assets acquired in September 2014 which have a blended margin of around 40 basis points.
The reduction in margin is less at the net level as there are higher distribution costs associated with retail FUM than institutional FUM.
This product mix shift and consequent reduction in overall margin is likely to continue as we sell more open ended alternative and long only product, particularly to institutions, and there are no sales of guaranteed products.
During 2015, the alternatives quant net management fee margin reduced by 50 basis points as a result of the continued mix shift towards institutional assets, with around 80% of the net inflows from institutional investors into AHL Dimension and AHL Alpha, where the gross margin was around 1%.
The inclusion of a full year of Numeric quant alternatives assets, which have a margin of around 1%, has also been a contributing factor.
Going forward, it is expected that this margin will decline further with the continued shift towards institutional assets.
