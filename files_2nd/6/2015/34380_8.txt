Retailers strategies are successfully being refined to cover multiple channels, with the physical store remaining a core part of the offering.
The focus today is on connecting with customers through the look and feel of the store and the range of services offered.
The best quality retail schemes are complementary to these strategies and in a more selective market are enjoying strong demand for space.
This is reflected in low vacancy rates and at the strongest assets, improving rental growth.
In a low yield environment, with improving retailer results, and emerging rental growth, assets with a strong income profile present an attractive proposition.

Its business friendly environment, diverse pool of talent and the choice it offers in terms of retail, leisure and entertainment underpin its appeal.
