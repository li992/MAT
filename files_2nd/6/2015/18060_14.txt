Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the groups ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures.
EBITDA is also frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or EBITDA multiple that is based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a company.
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and does not have any standardised definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs and income of financing activities and taxes, and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS.
Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently.
The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit for the year attributable to the Company.

62 Centamin plc Annual report 2015 strategic report FINANCIAL REvIEw continued Non-gaap financial measures continued 2 cash cost per ounce calculation: Cash costs per ounce is a nonGAAP financial measure.
Cash cost per ounce is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a period by the total gold production over the same period.
Operating costs represent total operating costs less administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortisation.
Management uses this measure internally to better assess performance trends for the Company as a whole.
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use such nonGAAP information to evaluate the Companys performance and ability to generate cash flow.
The Company believes that these measures provide an alternative reflection of the groups performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its expected performance in future periods.
Cash costs is intended to provide additional information, does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
This measure is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP.
Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

In June 2013 the World Gold Council WGC, an industry body, published a Guidance Note on the AISC metric, which gold mining companies can use to supplement their overall nonGAAP disclosure.
AISC is an extension of the existing cash cost metric and incorporates all costs related to sustaining production and in particular recognising the sustaining capital expenditure associated with developing and maintaining gold mines.
In addition, this metric includes the costs associated with developing and maintaining gold mines, corporate office structures that support these operations, the community and rehabilitation costs attendant with responsible mining and any exploration and evaluation costs associated with sustaining current operations.
AISC per ounce is arrived at by dividing the dollar value of the sum of these cost metrics, by the ounces of gold produced.
