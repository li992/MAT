Along with hangovers and apocalyptically bad weather, 1 January 2016 also saw the implementation of the new European Solvency II regime.
As weve said previously, Admiral is initially using the Standard Formula to calculate its requirement and has agreed a capital add-on with the Prudential Regulation Authority which reflects risks specific to Admiral that arent captured by the Standard Formula.
We prepared well for the new regime and go into 2016 with a healthy capital position.
Consistent with our long-standing belief in not holding excess capital in the company, we intend to return to shareholders funds that arent needed for solvency and buffers.
There are though a number of uncertainties that remain, not least of which is our plan to submit an application for approval to use an internal model to calculate capital requirements during 2017 and also the 2016 year-end reassessment of the capital add-on by the PRA.
We, therefore, think its prudent to return the capital surplus gradually, whilst the uncertainty reduces over the next two to three years.
The final 2015 dividend includes the first such additional payment of 33 million or 11.9 pence per share.
Well separately identify these returns of capital as we make them.
