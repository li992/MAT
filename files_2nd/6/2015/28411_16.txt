The groups strategy to deliver To support the delivery of the groups strategy, the high returns is underpinned group operates a strict financial model that aligns dividend policy, gearing and growth plans.
by the groups consistent financial model.
The financial model has been developed, and applied consistently, to ensure that the group maintains a robust capital structure, providing a comfortable level of headroom against banking covenants, including the gearing covenant of 5.0 times, and the regulatory capital requirements setby the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
The strong capital generation of the businesses in which the group invests supports the distribution of up to 80% of its post-tax earnings by way of dividend.
This allows the business to retain sufficient capital to support receivables growth consistent with managements medium-term growth plans and a maximum gearing ratio of around 3.5 times.
The financial model is underpinned by the groups consistent application of prudent and appropriate accounting policies.
How this works in practice: Andrew Fisher Finance Director 2015 adjusted pre-tax profit amounts to 293m prior to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items which equates to a profit after tax of 234m tax at 20.25% : Dividend cover in recent years has been around 1.35 times High returns business which amounts to dividends of 173m 234m 1.35 : Equity retained in the business to fund growth equals 61m Dividend policy Gearing Growth 234m less 173m : Cover 1.25x 3.5x versus Supports receivables Target gearing ratio of 3.5 times allows debt funding of 214m covenant of 5.0x growth of275m 61m multiplied by 3.5 : Provides total funding and capital for receivables growth of275m 61m plus 214m : and Pre-tax profit in excess of 293m allows dividends to be increased and receivables growth in excess of 275m.
