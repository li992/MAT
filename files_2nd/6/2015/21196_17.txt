Through a series of non-cash and cash actions, we reduced the balance of the intercompany loan between our main UK general insurance legal entity, Aviva Insurance Limited, and the Group, from 2.8 billion as at the end of February 2015 down to 1.5 billion as at the end of February 2016, below our target of 2.2 billion.
Further reductions are possible, but none are planned or considered necessary at this point.
Our external debt leverage improved slightly from 28% to 27% on an S&P basis.
It remains under the 30% threshold commensurate with an AA rating, which continues to be our target for debt leverage.
Liquidity at the centre is 1.3 billion as at theend of February 2016 February 2015: 1.1billion and within our risk appetite.
We took steps during the year to further develop our internal reinsurance company, domiciled in the UK, to enhance our future capital and liquidity management.
Efficiency gains We hit our operating expense ratio target of 50% in 2015, a year earlier than expected.
On a constant currency basis and excluding Friends Life, operating expenses reduced by 1%.
In our business segments, our expense ratios improved in general insurance to 13.9% FY14: 14.8% and in health to 14.5% FY14: 15.7%.
However, the impact of the Friends Life acquisition increased the life insurance expense 3 ratio for the life segment to 32.2% FY14: 29.7%.
We expect to achieve more efficiency gains in UK Life over the next few years.
