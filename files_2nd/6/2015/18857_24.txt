50 Johnson Matthey Annual Report & Accounts 2015 2.
Financial Financial Review Summary Underlying profit before tax up 3% and underlying earnings per share up 6%.
Balance sheet remains strong: net debt including post tax pension deficits EBITDA of 1.7 times.
Working capital increased due to business growth and higher precious metal inventories at year end.
ROIC at 18.8%, down 2.0% due to loss of income from Anglo Platinum and higher working capital.
Final dividend of 49.5 pence recommended, resulting in full year dividend up 9% at 68.0 pence.
Den Jones Group Finance Director Introduction Johnson Matthey made good progress in 2014 15.
Underlying profit before tax was 3% ahead at 440.1 million and underlying earnings per share was up 6%.
At constant exchange rates and adjusting for loss of commission income from Anglo Platinum sales grew by 9% and underlying profit before tax was up 15%.
Further aspects of the groups financial performance in 2014 15 are outlined below.
Corporate Costs Corporate costs increased slightly in the year from 33.3 million to 34.0 million to support the growth in the business.
In line with prior year, and as we continue to expect going forward, this represents just over 1% of sales.
Research and Development R&D Gross expenditure on R&D was 169.9 million, which was up 12% compared with 2013 14.
In line with previous years, this represented just over 5% of group sales.
R&D expenditure in ECT and Process Technologies accounted for over 60% of total spend.
Profit Before Tax The groups underlying profit before tax increased by 3% to 440.1 million 2013 14 427.3 million.
Profit before tax was 22% higher at 495.8 million 2013 14 406.6 million, boosted by profit of 69.7 million from the sale of the Gold and Silver Refining business in March 2015 which was excluded from underlying profit before tax.

The groups underlying operating profit at constant exchange rates is shown in the table below: Underlying Operating Profit Year ended 31st March 2014 at 2015 exchange 2015 2014 % rates % million million change million change Emission Control Technologies 236.9 203.6 16 195.5 21 Process Technologies 106.0 101.9 4 99.1 7 Precious Metal Products 101.5 130.9 -22 127.8 -21 Fine Chemicals 88.8 84.1 6 82.9 7 New Businesses 22.1 18.3 -21 18.6 -19 Corporate 34.0 33.3 33.6 Total group 477.1 468.9 2 453.1 5 Sterling appreciated against the majority of currencies during 2014 15 and overall, the impact of exchange rates decreased sales and underlying operating profit for the year by around 92 million and 16 million respectively, primarily in the first half of the year.
However, there was volatility throughout the year and at 31st March 2015, the exchange rates of sterling against the US dollar, euro and Chinese renminbi were $1.478, 1.372 and 9.16 respectively.
Of the groups underlying operating profit that is denominated in the groups principal overseas currencies, the average exchange rates during 2014 15 were: Share of 2014 15 non-sterling denominated Average exchange rate % underlying operating profit 2014 15 2013 14 change US dollar 44% 1.613 1.591 1 Euro 23% 1.275 1.186 8 Chinese renminbi 13% 9.99 9.73 3 The US dollar, euro and Chinese renminbi represent about 80% of the groups non-sterling denominated underlying operating profit.
Each one cent change in the average US dollar and euro exchange rates has approximately a 1.2 million and 0.8 million effect respectively on underlying operating profit in a full year: a ten fen change in the average rate of the Chinese renminbi has around a 0.6 million impact on underlying operating profit in a full year.
If current exchange rates are maintained throughout 2015 16, foreign currency translation will have a limited impact on reported underlying operating profit, primarily as sterlings weakness against the US dollar is offset by its strength against the euro.

Financial Financial Review continued Return on Invested Capital Taxation The groups return on invested capital ROIC fell from 20.8% The groups total tax charge for the year was 68.5 million, to 18.8%.
Around 1.5% of this fall resulted from the loss of a tax rate of 13.8% on profit before tax 2013 14 16.7%.
commission income in relation to the Anglo Platinum contracts, The tax charge on underlying profit before tax was 74.9 million, with the remainder due to an increase in working capital across which represents an effective tax rate of 17.0%, down from the group.
Underlying operating profit for the group was slightly 19.4% last year.
This decrease was primarily due to the higher than last year at 477.1 million, while average invested continued reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax in capital was 284 million higher at 2,538 million.
We remain committed to our 20% long term ROIC target The group will continue to benefit from a further reduction and we will continue to invest organically in our businesses in the headline UK corporation tax rate down to 20% for the across the world to drive these returns.
We will also target year ending 31st March 2016.
Going forward, although the appropriate acquisitions that accelerate the delivery of the geographic mix of profit is uncertain, we anticipate that the rate groups strategy which may depress ROIC in the short term of tax on the groups underlying profit should remain at least but create long term value.
At 18.8%, the groups ROIC is well 3% lower than the headline rate for UK corporation tax, partly ahead of our pre-tax cost of capital, which we estimate to be as the group benefits from the UKs patent box legislation.

Interest Earnings per Share The groups net finance costs were 37.5 million, down from The combination of slightly higher underlying profit before tax 42.1 million in 2013 14.
This decrease was mainly due to a and a lower effective tax rate meant that underlying earnings reduced pension interest charge and lower average interest per share increased by 6% to 180.6 pence.
Earnings per share rates following refinancing of some of our long term debt rose by 26% to 211.2 pence.

At this level, the dividend would be covered 2.7 times by underlying earnings per share.

The increase in this to rise to around 170 million by 2016 17 as a result of the working capital days was due to four principal factors: a strong increased investment across the group.

This will be included in the divisions underlying operating profit.

Making PVC Production More Sustainable The manufacture of vinyl chloride monomer VCM is an important intermediate step in the production of poly vinyl chloride PVC and today, much of the worlds production requires a mercury based catalyst.
In October 2013, 90 countries signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury which is a binding international treaty aimed at controlling and reducing emissions of toxic mercury compounds.
As a result, after 2017 VCM plants will need to switch to a mercury-free catalyst, providing there is an economically available alternative.
Johnson Matthey has successfully developed a catalyst which does not contain any mercury for the manufacture of VCM.
Our catalyst uses gold as the active component which is carefully positioned on the surface of a carbon support material.
This can be seen in the element map on the right where the green colour represents the gold.
We call this an eggshell catalyst as the gold sits only on the surface and we have specifically designed it this way to minimise the amount of gold used and to make it readily available for reaction.
As well as putting the gold in the right place, we also faced the challenge of producing it in a stable form.
Through applying our expertise, we were able to stabilise the gold and produce the catalyst using an environmentally friendly manufacturing process.
We are currently commissioning the catalyst production plant in China which should be ready to produce commercial quantities of the new catalyst during 2015 16.
Through combining our chemistry skills and applications knowledge, we have successfully developed a new, economically viable catalyst that will enable a more sustainable route to PVC.
