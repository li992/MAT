PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION The information presented in this Financial Review is derived from the Groups financial statements, prepared under IFRS.
However, management principally reviews the performance of the business on a proportionally consolidated basis, including the Groups share of joint ventures and associates, but not proportionally consolidating our investments in premium outlets.
We classify the Groups proportionally consolidated joint ventures and associates as Share of Property interests.
Further explanations of terms used in this section are in the Glossary on pages 181 and 182.
To provide a clear explanation of the performance of the business during 2015, the tables in this Financial Review state whether the information has been presented on a proportionally consolidated basis and whether it includes the premium outlet investments.
At 31 December 2015, the property ownership associated with the Irish loan portfolio, acquired in October 2015 in a 50:50 joint venture, had yet to be transferred from the borrowers and these loans are accounted for as current receivables of the joint venture, and included within the Groups investment in joint ventures.
Details of the movement in the Groups investment in joint ventures are shown in table 55 on page 59.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR The Groups profit for the year, attributable to equity shareholders, under IFRS was 726.8 million, 27.7 million higher than 2014.
This includes income from operations and financing costs as well as one-off gains realised on the sale of properties and unrealised property valuation changes.
As with other property companies, and in line with EPRA guidance, we review the Groups profit on an adjusted basis, which best reflects underlying earnings and table 46 shows a reconciliation of IFRS profit to adjusted profit for the year.
Analysis of the Groups income statement under IFRS split between underlying Adjusted profit and Capital and other profit is shown in note 2 to the accounts on page 128 and further details of the EPRA adjustments are provided in note 10A on page 136 to the accounts.

The Groups premium outlet investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets, the latter acquired in July 2014, contributed an additional 5.9 million of earnings.
Lower finance costs, reflecting the refinancing activity undertaken to reduce the Groups average cost of debt to 3.8%, increased earnings by 12.3 million.
These positive factors were partly offset by the impact of the euro depreciating against sterling during 2015 which reduced earnings by 2.3 million, although the Groups hedging strategy provided an approximate two-thirds hedge against the adverse currency movement.
Overall, the 21.0% increase in adjusted profit resulted in a 12.6% increase in adjusted EPS, after taking account of the dilutive effect of the September 2014 share placing.

Acquisitions contributed 10.3 million of additional income, principally relating to the 180 million acquisition in September 2014 of our former joint venture partners 40% stake in Highcross, Leicester.
Disposals reduced net rental income in 2015 by 4.8 million, reflecting the 2015 sales of Drakehouse Retail Park, Sheffield, Bercy 2, Paris and Grand Maine, Angers.
Additional net rental income from developments of 9.7 million mainly relates to Les Terrasses du Port in Marseille, which opened in May 2014 and has traded strongly during 2015.
Development income also came from our joint venture property interests in Croydon whilst the major regeneration scheme is progressed.
Net rental income from the like-for-like portfolio increased by 2.3% during the year, with the most significant contributions made by rent reviews at Union Square and tenant rotation at Les Trois Fontaines.
Like-for-like income also benefitted from the growth in car park and commercialisation net income which increased by 5% and 24% respectively on a like-for-like basis.
Like-for-like net rental income growth on the Reported Group properties was 3.4%, whilst for properties held by the Groups proportionally consolidated joint ventures and associates, like-for-like net rental income growth was 0.6%.
Further analysis of net rental income is provided in tables 103 and 104 of the Additional Disclosures on page 167.

In 2015, underlying administration expenses, net of management fees receivable, were 42.3 million, a decrease of 1.2 million, or 2.7%, compared to 2014.
This reduction was associated with cost-saving initiatives undertaken since the beginning of 2014 including relocating our London headquarters to Kings Cross, additional management fee income, principally from the Nicetoile joint venture, and favourable foreign exchange movements.
COST RATIO The EPRA cost ratio for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 23.1%, an increase of 30bp compared to 2014.
The ratio is calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis excluding premium outlets, and reflects total operating costs, including the cost of vacancy, as a percentage of gross rental income.
The ratio is not necessarily comparable between different companies as business models and expense accounting and classification practices vary.
The calculation methodology has been amended in 2015 to adjust for inclusive lease costs recovered through rent, this is in line with EPRA best practice and comparative ratios have been restated.
The cost ratio calculation is included as table 106 of the Additional Disclosures on page 168.
Whilst the ratio of net administration costs to gross rental income fell from 12.8% to 11.8% associated with the cost saving initiatives noted above, the ratio of property costs increased from 10.0% to 11.3%.
This reflects additional expenditure associated with vacancy and running costs at properties awaiting redevelopment such as in Croydon, as well as the impact of an increased portfolio weighting to shopping centres which have higher running costs than retail parks.
SHARE OF RESULTS OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN PREMIUM OUTLETS As explained on page 53, for management reporting purposes we proportionally consolidate the results of our investments in joint ventures and associates, except for our premium outlet investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets.
The nature of the control over our premium outlet investments means that VIA Outlets is accounted for as a joint venture, whilst Value Retail is accounted for as an associate.
We refer to the Groups proportionally consolidated share of its joint ventures as Share of Property joint ventures.
The operating performance of our investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets is described on pages 39 to 42 of the Business Review and the aggregated financial contribution to the Group is shown in table 109 of the Additional Disclosures section on page 170.
Share of results of joint ventures, including VIA Outlets The Group has interests in 12 joint ventures and the share of results of joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 246.8 million 2014: 279.0 million as summarised in table 50.
Further details are provided in note 12 to the accounts.

COM 55 Financial review continued The reduction in the share of results of joint ventures of 32.2 million during 2015 was principally due to property revaluation gains from the Groups share of Property joint ventures which were 31.8 million lower in 2015, this is consistent with the year-on-year revaluation gains on the Groups wholly-owned property portfolio.
Net rental income from the Groups share of Property joint ventures was 8.7 million lower than in 2014, associated with the acquisition by the Group of the former joint venture partners 40% stake in Highcross, Leicester in September 2014.
This was offset by an increase in profit of 14.2 million from VIA Outlets, which was acquired in July 2014, of which 11.7 million related to property revaluation gains.
On an adjusted basis, profit was 1.9 million higher in 2015.
Share of results of associates, including Value Retail The Group has two associates: Value Retail PLC and its group entities VR, and a 10% interest in Nicetoile, which was acquired in January 2015 and where the Group is the asset manager.
The share of results of associates for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 160.6 million 2014: 109.9 million, of which 159.3 million related to VR and principally related to the property valuation uplift of 163.7 million.
On an adjusted profit basis the results of associates were 18.1 million 2014: 16.0 million, of which 17.1 million related to VR.
The additional adjusted profit was due to strong trading, particularly at La Valle, Paris and the two Spanish Villages, La Roca and Las Rozas.
See note 13 of the accounts for further details on the Groups associates.
The Group also provides loans to Value Retail from which the Group received 5.3 million 2014: 5.8 million of interest receivable in 2015.
Total investment in premium outlets In 2015, the Groups two investments in premium outlets contributed 28.5 million to adjusted profit, 5.8 million higher than 2014 principally due to a full years profit contribution from VIA Outlets and the continued strong underlying trading performance from Value Retail.
Further details of the aggregated profit contribution from our premium outlets investment is provided in table 109 of the Additional Disclosures section on page 170.
FINANCE COSTS Underlying net finance costs, comprising gross interest costs less finance income, including the Groups share of Property interests, were 89.4 million compared with 108.9 million in 2014, a reduction of 19.5 million.
During 2015, the Groups weighted average interest rate was reduced to 3.8%, compared to 4.7% for 2014.
This was primarily due to the refinancing of the 480 million 4.875% bond, redeemed in December 2014, with the issue of the 500 million 2% bond in July 2014.
Finance costs have also reduced due to a new 415 million revolving credit facility RCF, signed in April 2015, having an initial margin of 80 basis points, which is 70 basis points lower than the previous 505 million facility it replaced.
Finally, the increased use of floating rate debt at low rates of interest has also acted to reduce the weighted average cost of borrowing.
There was a 13.9 million 2014: 8.7 million exceptional finance cost, principally associated with the early redemption of a 272 million 5.25% bond which was due to mature in December 2016.
This is excluded from adjusted profit.
Interest capitalised during the year was 5.3 million and principally related to the Groups developments in Beauvais, Leeds, Rugby and Southampton.
This is 3.5 million lower than in 2014 when interest was capitalised on the development of Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille.
TAX The Group is a UK REIT and French SIIC for tax purposes and is exempt from corporation tax on rental income and gains arising on property sales.
The tax charge for 2015 remained low at 1.6 million 2014: 1.0 million.
DIVIDEND The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 12.8 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 9.5 pence, the total for 2015 is 22.3 pence, representing an increase of 9.3% compared with the prior year.
The final dividend is payable on 29 April 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 18 March 2016.
6.4 pence will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the balance of 6.4 pence paid as a normal dividend.
The Company will be offering a scrip dividend alternative, and for shareholders who elect to receive this, the entire dividend will be treated as a normal non-PID dividend.
As the Company is offering a scrip dividend alternative, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP will be suspended.

The increase in EPRA net asset value was principally due to the valuation surplus on the Groups property portfolio, including those held in joint ventures and associates, due to yield and income improvements.
Further analysis of valuation movements is provided in table 53 on page 58.
Adjusted profit contributed 211 million, although this was largely offset by dividend payments totalling 165 million.

During 2015, the Groups portfolio, excluding premium outlets, achieved a revaluation gain of 368 million, of which 195 million was from the UK shopping centres and 117 million from our French portfolio.
Improvements in investment yields accounted for 78% of this gain, with the remainder of the valuation uplift principally associated with leasing and ERV changes.
For UK shopping centres, investment yields fell by an average of 25 basis points, contributing 127 million, or 65% of the revaluation gain.
The benefit of leasing and market income growth produced a valuation increase of 67 million.
The UK retail parks valuations increased by 19 million associated with an uplift from leasing and ERV changes as yields were virtually unchanged.
In France, investment yields reduced by an average of 40 basis points during 2015, generating a 161 million valuation increase.
This uplift was partly offset by a valuation reduction of 15 million associated with reductions in ERVs and 29 million associated with local taxation changes and refurbishment expenditure ahead of retenanting at a number of centres.
Developments and the UK Other portfolio achieved a revaluation gain of 37 million, following letting and construction progress at Victoria Gate, Leeds and Watermark WestQuay, Southampton.
Further valuation and yield analysis is included in tables 107 and 108 in the Additional Disclosures section on page 169.

The returns include development properties and the Groups returns include those from the properties held through its investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets.
The Groups weighted IPD All Retail Universe total return benchmark of 9.9% is weighted 70:30 between the UK and French indices.
The All Retail Universe indices includes returns from all types of retail property.
As the Annual IPD benchmarks for both countries are not available until after this Annual Report has been published, the benchmarks have been estimated and are subject to revision.
The UK IPD data is based on the Quarterly All Retail Universe to December 2015.
As there is less data available for France, for the purposes of calculating the Group IPD benchmarks, we have assumed that the French benchmark is equal to the returns generated by our French portfolio.
The Groups total return was 12.4%, 250 basis points higher than the estimated benchmark.
The Groups outperformance was driven by the property portfolio held by our premium outlet investments which produced a total return of 23.7%.
The total return for the UK portfolio was 10.2% which was higher than the UK IPD index, although the income return was 30 basis points lower, reflecting the prime nature of the Groups UK portfolio.
The French portfolio generated a total return of 12.0%.
In 2015, the Reported Group portfolio generated a total return of 10.6%, whilst properties held by our joint ventures and associates generated a total return of 14.3%.
Both portfolios exceeded the estimated benchmark, the performance of the latter portfolio being boosted by the strong return from premium outlets.
An analysis of the capital and total returns by business segment is included in table 107 on page 169 Shareholder returns For the year ended 31 December 2015, the Groups return on shareholders equity was 14.3%, which compares to the Groups estimated cost of equity of 8%.
The income element of the return on equity tends to be relatively low given the prime nature of the property portfolio.
The capital element of the return was driven by the portfolios strong valuation performance during the year.
Hammersons total shareholder return for 2015 was 2.4%, which represents an underperformance of the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index by 970 basis points.
Over the last five years, the Groups average annual total shareholder return has been 11.4%, compared to 15.0% for the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index.
INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN PREMIUM OUTLETS Investment in joint ventures, including VIA Outlets At 31 December 2015, the Groups investment in joint ventures totalled 3,214 million compared with 2,341 million at the beginning of the year, an increase of 873 million.
The key change during 2015 was the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio in a new 50:50 joint venture with Allianz for a cost of 690 million, further details of this transaction are given on page 26 of the Business Review.
The movement in investments in joint ventures during 2015 is shown in table 55 and further analysis is provided in note 12D of the accounts.

COM 59 Financial review continued Investment in associates, including Value Retail The Groups investment in associates principally relates to the Groups investment in Value Retail PLC and its group entities VR and totalled 768 million at 31 December 2015, an increase of 139 million during 2015.
The increase was largely due to the revaluation gain on VRs property portfolio which totalled 164 million, of which 42% was due to yield movements and the balance associated with income growth.
During the year, acquisitions increased the investment by 37 million, of which 24 million related to the acquisition in January of a 10% interest in Nicetoile, and the remainder related to an additional VR stake in Kildare Village acquired in December.
Distributions totalled 45 million, which principally related to funds received by the Group in December, following a debt refinancing by VR in relation to Bicester Village.
Further analysis is provided in note 13 to the accounts on pages 145 and 146.
Total investment in premium outlets At 31 December 2015, on an EPRA adjusted basis, the Groups total investment in premium outlets, representing our share of VR and VIA, and including the Groups loans to VR and the investment in VR China, totalled 1,003 million 2014: 832 million.
The property portfolios produced a combined valuation surplus of 174 million and produced a combined capital return of 16.4% and a total return of 23.7%.
Further details of the Groups aggregated investment are provided in table 110 of the Additional Disclosures on page 170. FINANCING AND CASH FLOW Our financing strategy is to generally borrow on an unsecured basis on the strength of the Groups covenant to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The Board approves financing guidelines against which it monitors the Groups financial structure.
These guidelines, together with the relevant metrics, are summarised in table 56 which illustrates the Groups robust financial condition.

The facility has a maturity of five years which may be extended to a maximum of seven years at the Groups request and on each banks approval of their participation.
The new facility replaced the existing 505 million revolving credit facility with an initial margin of 150 basis points which would have matured in April 2016.
The cancellation of this existing facility resulted in a one-off exceptional interest charge of 1.0 million associated with the write-off of unamortised fees.
In the second half of the year we undertook a number of financing transactions, principally to support the acquisition of the Irish loan portfolio.
To fund the acquisition we raised a new 1.5 billion revolving credit facility, of which 1.0 billion matures in March 2017 and 0.5 billion in September 2017.
This is expected to be refinanced through a 500 million disposal programme, of which 200 million has already been contracted.
In October, we issued a ten-year 350 million bond at a coupon of 3.5%.
This bond was subsequently swapped into euros resulting in a net coupon cost of 2.5%.
In December, we redeemed an outstanding 272 million bond due to mature in December 2016 with a coupon of 5.25% for a total consideration of 284.6 million.
This resulted in a one-off exceptional finance cost of 12.9 million.
Exposure to exchange translation differences on euro-denominated assets is managed through a combination of euro borrowings and derivatives.
At 31 December 2015, the value of euro-denominated liabilities compared to the value of euro-denominated assets was 90%, an increase of 2% from the position at the beginning of the year.
Interest on euro debt also acts as a hedge against exchange differences arising on rental income from our French business.
Approximately two-thirds of the relevant income was hedged in this way during 2015, compared to an average of 82% during 2014.
Whilst the overall level of euro-denominated debt grew during 2015 to increase the hedge of assets, the reduction in the hedge of income was due to increased rental income from our French business, predominantly due to the opening of Les Terrasses du Port in May 2014.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities and the US private placement senior notes contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing, defined as the ratio of net debt to shareholders equity, should not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income divided by net interest payable, should not be less than 1.25 times.
The same gearing covenant applies to three of the Companys unsecured bonds, whilst the remaining bonds contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175%.
These figures are on a proportionally consolidated basis and the bonds have no covenant for interest cover.
Hammersons financial ratios are comfortably within these covenants.
Fitch and Moodys rate Hammersons unsecured credit as Aand Baa1 respectively.
Moodys upgraded its rating from Baa2 in February 2015 to recognise Hammersons high-quality retail portfolio with a strong focus on outlet retail, its progress in reducing leverage and improving fixed charge coverage, and the expectation of continued stable performance of its core UK assets, and reaffirmed this rating in October following the Irish loan portfolio acquisition.
As explained at the beginning of this Financial Review, we do not proportionally consolidate our two premium outlet investments for reporting purposes.
These are financed independently from the rest of the Group and both Value Retail and VIA Outlets utilise a combination of secured borrowings and partner loans as funding.
At 31 December 2015, the Groups share of net debt in VR and VIA totalled 362 million.
Including the Groups share of the net assets of VR and VIA on a proforma basis would increase the Groups gearing from 54% to 60%, whilst the loan to value would reduce from 38% to 37%.
