Finance review DELIVERING STRONG PERFORMANCE 2015 has been a solid year of growth.
Not only in terms of adjusted NAV per share which was 14.6% but also earnings and dividends, the latter contributing 3.4% to the total accounting return of 18% for the year.
Fraser Kennedy Head of Finance, Kennedy Wilson Europe 2015 financial key performance indicators KPIs Total accounting return % 18.0 Adjusted NAV per share p 1,174.5 Adjusted earnings per share p 47.9 Dividends paid p 35.0 LTV % 39.7 Weighted average cost of debt % 2.9 48 Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic report Governance Financials Additional information Overview KWE had a successful year having built on its debut in 2014.
Many areas of the financial results reflect the strong acquisition-led growth that continued to be a feature of our operations in 2015.
Transaction levels were high during the year consisting of 1,180.2 million of investments in direct real estate and loans including associated purchasers costs, as well as 124.4 million in cash generated from disposals.
The total accounting return for the year was 18.0% which was the combination of significant NAV growth, chiefly driven by portfolio valuation increases, plus dividends paid which contributed 3.4% to the total return.
Adjusted earnings of 47.9 pence per share grew by 85% on the prior year, primarily owing to a full year of 2014 operating income supplemented by 2015 acquisition activity.
Increased earnings and cash generated from operations drove the quarterly dividend from 7.0 pence to 10.0 pence per share during the year.
The total dividend paid of 35.0 pence per share represented a 1.4 coverage ratio to adjusted earnings.
The first dividend of 2016 declared by the Board of 12.0 pence per share is a 20% quarter-on-quarter increase and indicative of the portfolios strong cash generation and the Boards commitment to delivering a significant income component within total return.
Moreover, on an annualised basis, the prospective dividend of 48 pence per share for 2016 represents a significant 37% increase over 2015s 35 pence per share.
We achieved a significant milestone in June, with the successful issue of our debut 300 million seven-year senior unsecured bond, with simultaneous rating by Standard and Poors of BBB stable for both the KWE and the bond.
This was followed by the establishment of a 2,000 million EMTN programme and a subsequent 400 million ten-year unsecured bond issue in November.
During the year we have been actively managing our debt profile, to extend the term to maturity, which we have moved out by a full year to 5.9 years and fixing our rates either through fixed rate debt or hedging, which now stands at 85% of total debt.
Our average cost of debt now stands at a very competitive 2.9%.
The LTV is 39.7%, providing us with further financing capacity, and our fixed charge coverage for 2015 was a comfortable 2.9 times.
The financing mix has now matured to complement the expanded and diversified real estate portfolio and reflects our goals of achieving the appropriate combination of tenor, cost and leverage.
Net operating income Net operating income consists of net rental income, the hotel earnings and loan portfolio interest income.
The chief drivers of the substantial net operating income growth in the year are the full period impact of acquisitions completed in 2014 and the ongoing deployment of capital into real estate acquisitions during 2015.
Movements in income statement net operating income m 2014 income statement NOI 50.7 Part period NOI from 2014 acquisitions 39.1 Part period NOI from 2015 acquisitions 45.0 Part period NOI from 2015 disposals 4.7 2015 income statement NOI 130.1 Administrative expenses Total administrative expenses excluding hotel operations which are included in NOI have fallen in 2015 to 10.9 million 2014: 11.5 million.
A significant proportion of the administrative expenses are fixed in nature or are non-recurring relating to set-up and acquisition activity.
1.2 million of the costs incurred in 2015 related to real estate loan acquisition costs which, unlike direct real estate deal costs, are not capitalised in accordance with our accounting policies and IAS39.
As KWE grows and invests capital, we see the benefit of scale meaning that the administrative cost ratio to portfolio value is 39bps this year compared to 76bps in 2014.

In line with the investment management agreement, the fee is settled 50% in cash and 50% in shares, where new shares are issued if the prevailing share price is at or above IFRS NAV per share.
Where the prevailing share price is at a discount to IFRS NAV per share, an amount equivalent to the fee is applied insofar as possible towards market purchases of existing shares.
The total management fee for 2015 is 15.2 million 2014: 8.4 million.
Performance fee The performance fee is a form of remuneration used to reward the Investment Manager for total return outperformance against a hurdle.
The performance fee is paid entirely in shares, to ensure alignment with shareholders.
The performance fee is 20% of the return above a 10% hurdle, calculated from the EPRA NAV per share at the beginning of the year plus dividends paid.
New shares are issued if the prevailing share price is at or above IFRS NAV per share.
Where the prevailing share price is at a discount to IFRS NAV, an amount equivalent to the fee is applied insofar as possible towards market purchases of existing shares.
The performance fee for 2015 is 29.7 million 2014: nil which is expected to be settled through market purchases of existing shares.
To be eligible for a performance fee in 2016 the minimum total return required is 10% of the 2015 EPRA NAV.

This increase is primarily due to the drawdown of the Gatsby senior facility and a full year of interest on debt raised during 2014, together with the interest accrued on the bonds issued in the year.
Also included within finance costs are amortisation of capitalised loan arrangement fees together with commitment fees in respect of the revolving credit facility.
Tax The Company is tax resident in Jersey but liable to any foreign tax on activities in its overseas subsidiaries.
Investments in Ireland are held through two Irish qualifying investor alternative investment funds, which are exempt from any Irish taxation on income and gains.
The cost of maintaining these regulated funds, including depository, AIFM and administrator costs, are included within Administrative Expenses.
The Italian portfolio acquired in December 2015 is held through a regulated close-ended alternative investment fund which is exempt from Italian tax on income and gains.
The Group is subject to corporate income tax at 28% 25% from 2016 onwards on taxable profits generated within its Spanish subsidiaries.
In the UK, income tax on rental income deriving from UK investment properties is reflected in the tax charge for the year of 7.6 million 2014: 1.9 million.
The increase is primarily due to greater levels of taxable profits from the UK portfolio.

The 14.6% Adjusted NAV growth reflects a strong valuation surplus of 211.8 million, primarily from assets held throughout 2014 and, importantly, also from acquisitions during the year, where we have more than made up the associated acquisition costs.
Disposals in the year also contributed a total of 14.6 million to NAV, reflecting a 5.8% premium over the preceding valuation.

The major sources of cash during the year were: operating activities, which generated cash of 120.6 million secured and unsecured financing activity of 925.7 million and proceeds on disposal of assets, which generated cash of 124.4 million.
KWE maintains a 225.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility.
At 31 December 2015, the full 225.0 million facility was available to be drawn.
The Groups interest rate hedging policy is to eliminate substantially the risk associated with interest rate volatility, through a combination of fixed rate borrowings and, in respect of floating rate debt, the use of interest rate caps.

The face value of the bond is 300 million, with net proceeds of 295.2 million.
After using a cross-currency swap to translate 50% of the proceeds to Euro, the effective fixed coupon is 3.35%.
At the time of issuing the bond, both KWE and the bond were rated BBB outlook stable by Standard and Poors.
This allowed us to access an alternative source of funding in the unsecured debt capital markets, diversifying our sources of finance and providing flexibility to manage our portfolio, as well as extending our term to maturity.
On 6 November 2015, KWE established a 2,000 million EMTN Programme.
On 10 November 2015, we announced the first drawdown under the Programme, with the issuance of 400 million senior unsecured notes with an annual fixed coupon of 3.25% and a ten-year term to maturity.
As a result of the financing activity during the year, including the above transactions, our weighted average term to maturity improved by 12 months from 4.9 years to 5.9 years, while our cost of debt increased from 2.4% at 31 December 2014 to 2.9% at 31 December 2015, for the benefit of the lengthened term and greater flexibility.
At 31 December 2015, LTV, our key measure of gearing, stood at 39.7% compared with 7.5% at 31 December 2014, driven by the increases in debt outlined above on the back of strong acquisition activity during the year.
Group LTV is not expected to exceed 50% and we continue to target a ratio between 45-50%.
The fixed charge cover the ratio of adjusted earnings before finance costs to finance costs for the year was a comfortable 2.9 times.
Throughout 2015 and as at 31 December 2015, the Group was in compliance with its debt covenants.
