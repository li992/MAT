SUMMARY The increase in revenue during the year has been driven by continuing strong organic growth in the number of services we provide, partially offset by lower energy prices and lower average household energy usage compared with the previous year.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits of 22.5% reflects the underlying increase in the average number of Members during the year, and a full-year contribution from our new energy supply arrangements, offset by higher costs being attributed to us than we had previously expected relating to leakage within the national gas distribution network which is discussed in more detail below.
Increased promotional activity during the year targeted on recruiting high quality multi-utility new Members in a highly competitive market has led to an increased loss from our Customer Acquisition operating segment of 15.5m 2014: 12.1m.
Distribution expenses, which primarily consist of commissions paid to our Partners, increased by 3.3m to 21.9m 2014: 18.6m, reflecting the higher number of services being provided to our Members and additional promotional costs associated with gathering new Members.
Administrative expenses increased during the year by 4.9m to 46.5m 2014: 41.6m mainly as a result of higher staff costs.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 9.3% to 53.0p 2014: 48.5p, reflecting the full impact of the increase in the Companys share capital resulting from the transaction with Npower in December 2013.
In accordance with previous guidance and our strong cash position, the Company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 21p 2014: 19p per share, making a total dividend of 40p 2014: 35p per share for the year.
18 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements WRITE-DOWN OF UNBILLED ENERGY DEBTOR As announced in our trading update on 16 April, a detailed review of the unbilled energy debtor carried on our balance sheet disclosed that approximately 11m net of anticipated tax credit, which had accumulated over the seven years between April 2007 and March 2014 was not recoverable.
This related to higher levels of leakage within the national gas distribution network than had previously been anticipated, and as fully explained in the trading update, has been written off.
The Board has restated the Companys accounts to reflect the impact of this write-down on previous years, providing stakeholders with an accurate reflection of the historic underlying trend in the performance of the business.
MARGINS Our overall gross margin for the year was 15.9% 2014: 14.9% reflecting a full years contribution from the new energy supply arrangements with Npower which were completed in December 2013, and an improving gross margin on our telephony services where higher pricing has largely offset the continuing downward trend in call spend amongst Members using their landlines.
We expect our gross profit margins to remain within the previously stated range of 15% to 17% for the foreseeable future, subject to the impact from any new services which may be introduced.
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS We have continued to achieve steady growth in the number of services we are supplying, with an increase of over 200,000 services during the course of the year.
This takes the total number of services provided by our Discount Club to almost 2.1 million an increase of more than 10% compared with the previous year.
These numbers reflect our continuing focus on making it easier for Partners to gather new Members by simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our prices more competitive, and improving the quality of service and support we provide to our membership base.
As a result, all our core services have continued to see consistent organic growth.
Revenues increased across all our core services, notwithstanding both lower average energy consumption and lower retail energy prices compared with the previous year: Restated m 2015 2014 Electricity 304.7 273.5 Gas 278.4 255.4 Landline and Broadband 93.7 82.2 Mobile 20.3 16.7 Other 15.5 15.7 TOTAL 712.6 643.5 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 19 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED CUSTOMER ACQUISITION Our net investment in acquiring new Members increased during the year to 15.5m 2014: 12.1m, mainly reflecting increased promotional activity in a challenging and increasingly competitive market and a higher proportion taking our Double Gold bundle.
Although the cost of acquiring an owner-occupier taking our Double Gold Bundle is generally considerably higher than for a tenant taking fewer services, our experience shows that the return on that investment will more than compensate for the higher upfront costs we incur, due to the much longer expected lifetime of this type of Member.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution expenses include both the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Partners, and other direct costs associated with gathering new Members included as part of the Customer Acquisition Segment result for the year.
These increased by 3.3m to 21.9m 2014: 18.6m, reflecting a combination of higher residual income payments to Partners, and the costs of various promotional incentives such as shopping vouchers provided to new Members.
Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year remained at 1.5% of revenues 2014: 1.5%, but increased slightly in absolute terms to 10.7m 2014: 9.9m.
Notwithstanding our growing membership base, the number of prepayment meters we installed during the year fell to 8,642 2014: 8,958, of which many were provided at the Members own request.
This reflects our efforts over the last few years to attract and retain high quality multi-service owner-occupiers.
At the end of the year we had an installed base of 68,066 2014: 50,095 prepayment meters, representing approximately 7.1% of the energy services we supply.
This remains significantly below the average level of prepayment meters within the industry of around 15% source: Ofgem.
20 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements DELINQUENT MEMBERS Delinquency the proportion of Members who have at least two energy bills outstanding has been on a steady downward trajectory over the last few years, and we are pleased that this trend has continued over the last 12 months.
The average number of employees increased from 696 to 787, reflecting our commitment to continue delivering the best possible service experience to our Members, and a significant ongoing investment in strengthening our management structure.
Personnel expenses excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive schemes increased by 12.2% during the year to 26.7m 2014: 23.8m.
Overall, administrative expenses remained broadly flat at 6.4% of revenue for the year 2014: 6.3%.
OPUS Our share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited Opus, in which we maintain a 20% stake, increased during the year to 6.0m 2014: 4.7m.
This excellent result reflects a continuing strong trading performance, and the further steady progress they have made in supplying gas alongside electricity into the small business and corporate sector, for which they are now buying renewable energy from over 500 small UK generators.
Opus revenues increased by 20.5% to just over 523m 2014: 434m and profit before tax increased from 30.2m to 38.0m.
We remain encouraged by the resilience of the business model and the strength and experience of the Opus management team, and look forward to receiving a dividend of approximately 5.4m from them later this month.
Our shareholding in Opus is valued on our balance sheet at 10.8m in line with standard accounting policy, notwithstanding the likelihood that its market value is substantially in excess of this figure: we are extremely pleased to have such significant exposure to this rapidly growing, profitable and highly cash generative business.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 21 2012 1.46% 2013 1.23% 2014 1.15% 2015 1.10% FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL Our cash balances at the year-end reduced to 16.5m 2014: 45.4m as we took advantage of the opportunity to re-negotiate our banking facilities and reduce our borrowing costs by repaying 30m to the bank ahead of the originally agreed repayment schedule.
We also spent 19m during the year out of the 23m anticipated total cost of refurbishing our new office headquarters.
Our overall working capital position benefitted from a year on year cash inflow of 8.4m, largely due to lower average energy consumption and payment timing differences related to our energy purchasing arrangements with Npower.
This cash inflow is expected to reverse during the current financial year.
On an underlying basis, and in the normal course of events, we anticipate a modest rise in our working capital requirements over the next two years due to a number of factors: i the costs associated with funding the growth in our mobile business where increasing numbers of Members are choosing to be provided with a premium mobile handset, which they can obtain from us with no upfront cost on a 24 month contract : ii an increase in the number of BMW Minis supplied to Partners on hire purchase agreements: and iii the cost of providing them with Tablets on 30 months interest-free credit to help them build their businesses more effectively.
Under the terms of our energy supply arrangements Npower remains responsible for funding the working capital requirements associated with providing energy to Members who have chosen to pay on a budget plan.
BORROWINGS Our balance sheet at the year-end shows a net debt position of 74.0m 2014: 75.1m including the deferred consideration of 21.5m payable to Npower in December 2016. DIVIDEND The final dividend of 21p per share 2014: 19p will be paid on 18 August 2015 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 July 2015 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting which will be held on 11 August 2015.
This makes a total dividend payable for the year of 40p 2014: 35p, an increase of over 14% compared with the previous year.
We believe our strong underlying cash flow, rising earnings and significant borrowing capacity will enable us to refinance or repay our remaining borrowings as they fall due, whilst maintaining a progressive dividend policy.
We remain comfortable with previous guidance that our total dividend for the current year will increase by 15% to 46p per share, and thereafter that further growth in earnings from the level we achieve this year should be reflected in a corresponding rise in the level of distributions to shareholders.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme credits of 1.0m 2014: charges of 4.2m.
These credits relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2 and arose principally as a result of the fall in the Companys share price over the year.
22 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements As a result of the relative size of share incentive scheme credits charges as a proportion of our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits and earnings so that the underlying performance of the business can be clearly identified.
Our current adjusted earnings per share have also therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
The tax charge for the year is 9.8m 2014: 7.2m.
The effective tax rate for the year was 23.2% 2014: 20.8%, with the increase compared with last year primarily due to the inclusion of a full years amortisation charge in respect of the intangible asset, which is not tax deductible.
