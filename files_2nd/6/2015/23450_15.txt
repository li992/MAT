Financial Review The Companys diluted NAV per share total return was 25% during the year as a result of a strong performance from the total portfolio which delivered gains of 429 million.
Analysis of Movement in Net Asset Value per share The Consolidated Income Statement on page 65 of the Report shows the total return for the period and, together with the impact of Bond conversions and the interim dividend of 38p per ordinary share paid during the period, explains the movement in NAV for the year to 30 September 2015.
Performance from the investment portfolio contributed 10.65 per share, 34% of the opening NAV.
Deducted from this, as shown below, were finance, operating costs and tax, which together totalled 64p per share: the priority profit share paid to Electra Partners for managing the portfolio amounted to 62p per share: and the charge for incentive schemes amounted to 167p per share.
Bond conversions during the period increased NAV per share by 6p and the interim dividend paid reduced NAV per share by 38p.
These net costs, together with the investment performance, resulted in an increase to net assets of 7.40 per share, a total return adding back the dividend paid of 25% for the year.

Currently, there are three pools in relation to the three-year periods commencing 2006, 2009 and 2012.
The carried interest schemes are described in more detail in Note 22 on pages 92 to 95.
The carried interest provision has increased from 83 million to 132 million in the year to September 2015.
The movement in the provision comprises a 67 million provision for future carried interest in relation to the increase in value of the portfolio in the year and payments of 18 million in relation to the 2006 pool and pre-2006 incentive arrangements.
Additionally, 17 million was paid in the year in relation to amounts payable in the previous year and shown in creditors which arose from realisations in the 2006 pool during the year to September 2014, as shown in the table below: Creditor Provision Total m m m At 1 October 2014 17 83 100 Paid in period: Pre 2006 pools 4 4 2006 pool 17 14 31 Provisions made in year: Pre 2006 pools 1 4 5 2006 pool 7 7 2009 pool 9 9 2012 pool 47 47 At 30 September 2015 1 132 133 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 61 Further Information Governance Financial Statements Managers Review Strategic and Business Review Overview The increase of 67 million equivalent to 1.67 per share to the provision for incentives made during this period reflects the strong performance of the investment portfolio, which produced a total return of 429 million for the year.
The provision represents approximately 16% of the increase in the portfolio value, which is less than the accrual rate on the post 2006-pools of 18% due to the lower percentage applied to investments such as Zensar Technologies.
The majority 70% of this increase relates to the 2012-pool and reflects the increase in valuation and realisations achieved in respect of AXIO Data Group, Elian, Audiotonix, The Original Bowling Company and EP1.
The majority of cash paid in the year related to the 2006 pool, most of which had been provided for in previous years.
This pool commenced on 1 October 2006 and contains 436 million of direct investments made between six and nine years ago.
This pool has a realised return of 1.7x cost and a total return of 1.8x cost.
A brief summary of the pool from inception to date is shown below: m Amount invested 2006 to 2009 436 Amount realised 756 Valuation of remaining investments 34 Pool profit 354 Multiple of cost 1.8x PPS 31 Net profit 323 Carried interest at 18% 58 Paid in prior year 21 Paid in current year 31 Provision pending future realisation 6 Over 80% of the provision carried forward relates to the 2009 and 2012 pools which represent investments made since 2009.
Both of these pools require substantial realisations to occur before any carried interest payments are made to the participants.
In aggregate, at 30 September 2015 more than 800 million would need to be realised across the two pools before the hurdle requirements are met.
Net Liquid Resources The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 70 analyses the movement in the Groups cash for the year.
Cash has reduced by 51 million during the year.
The larger components of cash inflows were sales of investments and investment income including liquidity funds which yielded nearly 390 million.
The major constituents of the cash outflows were investments of 187 million, and the repayment of drawings of 153 million under the multi-currency bank facility.
The repayment of the multi-currency bank facility in March followed the conclusion of the Boards strategic review and consequent change in currency hedging policy.
It is expected that approximately 270 million of cash proceeds relating to transactions previously announced will be received in the near term.
Against this, Electra has the following commitments: payment of the final capital entitlement of 155.41p per ZDP share to the ZDP shareholders in August 2016 amounting to 73 million in aggregate: subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in January 2016, payment of a final dividend of 78p per ordinary share 31 million, as recommended by the Directors: and financing of committed and other investments.
Based on the number of shares that will be in issue following the mandatory conversion of 5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds.
Accordingly, it is expected that free cash, after taking the above into account, will be approximately 170 million.
62 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2015 Finance Costs, Gearing and FX Finance costs of 41p per share, or 17 million, in the year were made up as follows: Cost m Bank facility 5 Convertible Bond 7 Zero Dividend Preference Share 5 17 The coupon payable in respect of the bank facility is based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.5%, which was equivalent to an average 3.7% during the period when the facility was drawn.
As stated above, following the Boards strategic review, the bank facility was repaid in full at the end of March.
Should the facility remain undrawn, commitment fees will continue to be paid at a cost of 2 million per annum.
The Convertible Bond pays a coupon of 5% per annum, amounting to 5 million in the year.
A further amount was accrued in respect of the Convertible Bond to represent the cost of the embedded derivative of the conversion option.
In total the accrual rate adopted is 9.9% adding an additional 2 million in the year.
Subsequent to 30 September 2015, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 5% Subordinated Convertible Bond, the Company became entitled to exercise its right to a Mandatory Conversion of all of the outstanding Bonds into new ordinary shares.
Accordingly, the Board has resolved to exercise this right and proposes to issue the Mandatory Conversion notice to Bond holders in November 2015, following which the outstanding Bonds will convert into ordinary shares on 29 December 2015.
The Zero Dividend Preference Share ZDP is accounted for by accruing at 6.5%, which is the yield to maturity based on its redemption value.
The amount charged in this period was 5 million, which was charged to the capital column in the Consolidated Income Statement, reflecting the way in which this instrument will be eventually repaid.
The ZDP will be repaid in August 2016 and is therefore disclosed as a short-term creditor.
The weighted average cost of debt for the period was 7.5%.
This is greater than last year due to the repayment of the multi-currency facility, which has a lower cost than the remaining debt instruments.
The repayment of the multi-currency facility in March 2015 removed the natural hedge on Electras currency exposure.
Over the year Sterling has strengthened against the Euro and weakened against the US Dollar leading to an overall foreign exchange gain on the investment portfolio of 0.6 million for the year ended 30 September 2015.
At 30 September 2015 the estimated foreign currency exposure, taking into account hedging within portfolio companies, was 235 million and $320 million.
Of the US$ exposure $127 million related to Zensar which was sold shortly after the year end.
