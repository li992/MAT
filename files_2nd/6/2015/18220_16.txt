This is expected to reduce in2015 thefuture cost and riskattached to thescheme.
Balance sheet leverage and return ofexcess capital we will maintain anefficient balance sheet, appropriate to our investment requirements.
We target a balance sheet leverage of 1 to Jez Maiden 1.5times net debt: EBITDA excluding Group Finance Director deficits on retirement benefit schemes, although we are prepared to move outside thisrange if circumstances warrant.
Below this leverage range, we will returnexcess capital to shareholders when appropriate.
Following the Incotec acquisition, the leverage remains below this policy.
Inlight of this, and the ongoing cash generation of Croda, the Board isproposing toreturn 100p per share 136m to shareholders by way of aspecial dividend with consolidation.
The effect of thisreturn of capital would have been to increase the2015 year end leverage toaround the mid-point ofthe Boardstarget range.
