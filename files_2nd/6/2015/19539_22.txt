Financial and operating review Financial targets achieved with momentum for sustainable growth Chief Financial Ocer, Steve Hare, analyses the 2015 financial performance Throughout the year we have conducted a complete review of the business, including our products, organisational structure, operating model and policies in order to prepare for next phase of long-term sustainable growth.
We have simplied our three existing product categories to Growth and Heritage and have initiated organisational transformation in order to implement our target operating model and realise cost savings to re-invest for growth.
Our revenue category denitions have rened and we have amended the application of the revenue recognition policy to certain products enabling stakeholders to clearly and transparently track performance.
None of the updates impact cash generation and the financial summary below is included for comparability to previous announcements.
All subsequent gures and metrics are prepared on the revised basis.
Impact of changes to revenue reporting: As we enter the next phase of growth, the denitions of revenue categories have been rened and we have amended the application of the revenue recognition policy to certain products to enable stakeholders to clearly and transparently track performance.
None of the changes impact cash generation.

We have assessed the categorisation of revenue between Software and Software Related Services SSRS recognised immediately and Recurring recognised over initial contract duration.
Upfront revenue associated with time limited products is now being pro-rated over the initial contract life.
The impact is to reclassify some revenue from SSRS to Recurring.
The dierence between revenue deferred in FY14 and FY15 results in a 3m decrease in the revenue and operating profit for FY15.
We also considered the accounting for arrangements with business partners that refer customers to the Group, such as Independent Sales Organisations ISOs in the North America Payments business.
We have concluded that payments made to these business partners are better reected as costs and not as deductions to revenue.
The impact is an equal increase in revenue and costs, therefore having no eect on the operating profit gure, but decreases the operating profit percentage.
In order to enhance disclosure, a separate category has been introduced for Processing revenue, which is volume based and relates to payments and some payroll processing services.
The impact is to disclose this revenue separately from SSRS and Recurring revenue, with no change to total revenue or the operating margin.
