STRATEGIC REPORT PERFORMANCE REVIEW Key Performance Indicators KPIs The Group tracks its performance using two operating KPIs, three financial KPIs and four funding targets that the Board believes are key indicators of its progress against its strategic and financial targets.
In addition the Group has a number of guidance measures at a group, divisional and business level, details of which are set out in this section and in the finance review on pages 56 to 63.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 45 STRATEGIC REPORT MARKET DRIVERS UK population growth trends, immigration and smaller family units continue to create demand for housing, with the formation of around 225,000 new households per year.
In 2015, around 160,000 new homes were built.
This shortfall in supply, combined with historic underinvestment in the existing 28 million dwellings in the UK means the Group expects continued growth in both new house building and, importantly, in the repair, maintenance and improvement RMI market.

There was no change in the number of trading days in 2015 when compared with the prior year.
Adjusted operating profits increased by 7.6% to 413m.
Excluding property profits, adjusted operating profit increased by 8.7%.
At a divisional level, adjusted operating profits grew in General Merchanting, Contracts and Consumer, partially offset by a decline in Plumbing & Heating.
Adjusted earnings per share EPS increased by 5.1 pence to 124.1 pence.
This 4.3% improvement was driven by a 5.5% increase in adjusted profit after tax, partly diluted by an increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue due to the exercise of share options and other share related incentives.
The proposed dividend for the year is 44 pence 2014: 38 pence, a 16% increase, and reflects the Boards confidence in the future growth prospects and cash generating ability of the Group.
Dividend cover reduces to 2.8 times 2014: 3.1 times, and is just below the mid-point of the Groups target cover range of between 2.5x and 3.25x.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 47 STRATEGIC REPORT Revenue Total group revenue increased by 6.5%, with growth of 3.8% on a like-for-like basis.

As previously mentioned, the link between the RMI market and the level of secondary housing transactions shows a strong correlation.
The impact of the Mortgage Market Review on the availability of mortgages, and therefore the number of secondary housing transactions, along with uncertainty at the time of the election, had a negative impact on the RMI market in the second half of 2015.
Whilst the summer months, especially August, were particularly weak, the significant recovery in RMI spend in October was not sustained consistently through November and December.
Consequently, weaker fourth quarter trading was experienced across all of our trade businesses, with lower like-for-like sales growth in General Merchanting, Contracts and Plumbing & Heating leading to more competitive market pricing.
The Groups consumer businesses, however, performed well during the final quarter of the year, further extending their outperformance of themarket.
The start to 2016 has been encouraging.
The six to nine month lagged growth in housing transactions suggested RMI demand would improve in Q4 2015 or early in Q12016.
The Group has seen these improvements in demand take a firmer hold in January and February of 2016.
The following table sets out volume, like-for-like and expansionary sales growth by division through 2015.

There was continued inflation in heavyside products, although this slowed in the second half of the year.
Lightside products continued to experience price deflation as commodity prices weakened further through the second half of 2015, and direct sourcing of products continued to drive lower costs passed through to customers in more competitive pricing.
Plumbing & Heating sales were broadly flat, with the 2014 benefits from the Government incentive scheme being not repeated in 2015, the disruption from the branch re-segmentation programme and continued market weakness.
These factors were compounded by deflation in copper and plastic prices.
48 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 Strategic Report Governance & Remuneration Financial Statements Shareholder Information STRATEGIC REPORT Price inflation in heavyside products in the Contracts division was partially offset by more competitive pricing in the industrial plumbing market and copper and steel price deflation.
Keyline and CCF volume growth was strong, and contributed significantly to 8.5% like-for-like revenue growth in the Contracts division as a whole.
Further investment in value and more focused promotions generated significant growth in sales in Wickes.
Toolstation continued to grow strongly as it invested in lower prices, opened new stores and delivered an enhanced 60 minute click and collect proposition.
New branch openings and acquisitions added 2.7% to Group sales in 2015.
Acquisitions included Rudridge, which added four branches to the Keyline heavy civils network and The Underfloor Heating Store and Bathrooms.

Adjusted Operating Profit In 2015 the Group was required to impair the goodwill and other intangible assets of the PTS and F & P businesses by 141m.
Thisimpairment is a non-cash, exceptional charge, and is explained in the Plumbing & Heating business review section.
Reported adjusted operating margins were broadly stable in 2015 and improved by 10 bps excluding the effects of changes in property profits.
Improvement in gross margin across the Group was broadly offset by higher operating costs and the recognition of slightly lower property profits, 24m in 2015 2014: 26m.

Strong sales growth in Keyline and CCF combined with higher volumes of direct to customer sales were the principal drivers of the lower gross margin.
In General Merchanting, the strong gross margin performance in the first half of 2015 reversed in the second half as price competition due to lower volumes in the market intensified.
Group operating costs increased by 10 bps in 2015, with lower operating costs in the Contracts division owing to good cost control, more than offset by higher costs in the Plumbing & Heating and Consumer divisions.
In Plumbing & Heating, operating costs increased following the re-segmentation programme, with City Plumbing branches having a higher cost to serve than PTS branches.
Operating costs in the Consumer division as a function of sales increased owing to the relative immaturity of new Toolstation branches, the labour costs associated with range changes in Wickes and additional marketing and online costs.
In 2014 Plumbing & Heating benefited from property profits realised from the sale and leaseback of the Warrington primary distribution centre.
The Contracts division included 5m of property profits 2014: nil, which added 40bps to the adjusted operating margin.
