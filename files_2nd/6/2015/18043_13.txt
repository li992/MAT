Having this wide range of skills and resources enables the Group to deliver fully integrated solutions for buildings and infrastructure, from project finance through design and construction to lifetime asset management, together with business support services that add value for our customers and the communities in which we operate.
The Group has operations in the UK, Canada and the Middle East and North Africa, as set out on the inside front cover.
Overall, the Group and its four business segments performed in line with expectations in 2015.
Revenue Total revenue in 2015 increased by 13 per cent to 4,586.9 million 2014:4,071.9 million, largely driven by organic growth of 10 per cent in construction services excluding the Middle East, support services and Middle East construction services, together with contributions from the support services businesses we have acquired in Canada.
Total revenue included acontribution from Joint Ventures of 636.2 million 2014: 578.0 million, an increase of 10 per cent, which was largely due to growth in our Middle East Joint Venture business, Al Futtaim Carillion.
Underlying operating profit 1 Underlying operating profit increased by eight per cent to 244.4 million 2014: 226.0 million, including operating profit from Joint Ventures of36.0 million 2014: 34.2 million.
The Groups total 1 underlying operating margin reduced to 5.3 per cent 2014: 5.6 per cent.
Weexpected the margin to be lower in 2015, because the margin in construction services excluding the Middle East has reduced to amore normal level, in line with our long-standing guidance, as the temporary benefits of rescaling our UK construction activities have largely ended, and because the margin in Middle East construction services also reduced, in line with our previously announced Richard Adam expectations.

Underlying operating profit also increased by eight per cent to 146.6million 2014: 135.9 million, with the underlying operating margin maintained at 5.8 per cent 2014: 5.8 per cent, despite higher than normal contract mobilisation costs.
This demonstrates the benefits of our business model and centralised operating platform, which plays akey role in enabling us to mobilise major new contracts efficiently.
Thisis also encouraging because with mobilisation costs now running at amore normal level, we have the potential to improve our support services margin in 2016.

Given our strategy is to focus on large, high-quality projects, for customers for whom quality and reliability are paramount, the phasing of contracts can result in significant movements in Middle East construction revenue between accounting periods.
Underlying operating profit increased to 25.3 million 2014: 25.1 million, with the growth in revenue broadly offset by areduction in operating margin to 4.2 per cent 2014: 5.0 per cent.
As previously guided, our operating margin in 2015 reduced, despite the benefit to profit generated from reorganising our staff accommodation facilities in Oman, because our markets in the region continue to be highly competitive.
Although we expect our margin to be lower in 2016, because this benefit to profit will not be repeated, our objective is to mitigate the impact of this and the potential effect of the low oil price on customer investment by targeting projects where we can use our market-leading positions in the UK Export Finance and Public Private Partnership projects.
