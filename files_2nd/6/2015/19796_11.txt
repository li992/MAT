Financial review The reported year has been both an extremely challenging year for Tesco and a year in which we began a process of considerable change.
Against this backdrop we delivered sales of 70bn in 2014 15, 1.3 % below last year on a 52 week basis at constant currency.
Trading profit declined by 58.1 % to 1.4bn principally as a result of a fall in like-for-like sales, the accumulated costs of inefficiencies within our operations and the changes we have made in the second half to stabilise the business.
Our statutory loss before tax was 6.4 bn, after charging one-off items of 7.0 bn.
Of these one-off items, 0.6 bn will result in a direct cash outflow, with the remaining amounts being non-cash adjustments to balance sheet carrying values.

Consistent with standard grocery market practice, we negotiate a very wide range of payments to and from our suppliers including fees, contributions, discounts, multiple offers and volume rebates.
Whilst we have embarked on a fundamental review which will significantly simplify our approach, in total we currently use over 20 different categories of variation in payment terms.
Many of these relate to adjustments to a cost price and can be considered and are in practice a part of the standard unit price variations that can be expected under normal, competitive market conditions.
As such these amounts are recognised in the income statement as a deduction to the cost of goods sold.
A number of commercial income categories can be conditional on the satisfaction of certain actions or performance conditions by either Tesco or the supplier in question, including the achievement of agreed sales volume targets, the provision of certain benefits such as marketing materials or promotional product positioning, and costs incurred for unplanned variations in product specification.
