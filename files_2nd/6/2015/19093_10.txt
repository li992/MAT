Our Uncoated Fine Paper business benefited from domestic selling price increases and contributions from capital investments, which more than offset the negative currency effects from the weaker rouble.
Our South Africa Division delivered strong results through higher selling prices, good cost control and currency benefits.
In 2015 we continued to seek out and exploit opportunities for value-enhancing growth and cost optimisation through a combination of capital investments, acquisitions and asset rationalisation.
We completed the acquisitions of Ascania nonwoven Germany GmbH and KSP, Co. South Korea and Thailand during the second half of the year, broadening our product portfolio and expanding our geographic reach in the fast growing Consumer Packaging business.
We closed six operations and sold a further four to optimise cost structures and refine our product mix.
Our capital investments completed during 2014 and 2015 contributed strongly to underlying operating profit.
The incremental operating profit from theseprojects amounted to around 50 million in 2015.

Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 27 Chief financial officers review Input costs were generally lower across most of our operations.

In Russia, higher domestic wood costs were more than offset by the weaker rouble.
Benchmark paper for recycling costs were around 7% higher on average than the prior year, with prices increasing in the second half of the year.

Polyethylene prices were highly volatile in 2015, but were, on average, at similar levels to theprior year.
Currently favourable cost conditions, combined with our ongoing productivity improvements and strong cost control should provide further benefits in 2016.
The impact of maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit in 2015, which included a number of longer project related shuts, was in line with expectations at around 90 million.
In 2016, based on prevailing market prices, we estimate that the impact of planned maintenance shuts on underlying operating profit will reduce to around 70 million.

Tax We aim to manage our tax affairs conservatively, consistent with our approach to all aspects of financial risk management.
Our objective is to structure our operations tax efficiently, taking advantage of available incentives and exemptions.
We endeavour to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to maintain constructive dialogue with taxation authorities.
Arms length principles are applied in the pricing of all intragroup transactions, in accordance with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines.
We have dedicated internal tax resources throughout the organisation, supported by a centralised Group tax department that takes overall responsibility for management of the Groups tax affairs.
We maintain a detailed set of operational guidelines aimed at ensuring a sound tax control environment.
Mondi operates in a number of countries, each with a different tax system.
In addition, there have been significant developments within the global tax environment to achieve greater tax transparency.
The Group is routinely subject to tax audits and reviews which may take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provision is made for known issues and the expected outcomes of any negotiations or litigation.
Tax risks are monitored on a continuous basis and are more formally reviewed on a halfyearly basis by the audit committee as part of our half-yearly reporting process.
We seek regular professional advice to ensure that we remain up to date with changes in tax legislation, disclosure requirements and best practices.
Based on the Groups geographic profit mix and the relevant tax rates applicable, we would expect our tax rate to be around 22%.
However, we benefited from tax incentives related to our capital investments in Slovakia, Poland and Russia.
In addition, we Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 29 8.6% 7.5% 5.9% 5.4% 6.3% Chief financial officers review recognised deferred tax assets related to previously unrecognised tax losses which we now expect to be able to utilise in the coming years.
As such, our tax charge for 2015 of 161 million reflects an effective tax rate for 2015 of 19%, consistent with 2014.
Tax paid in 2015 was 160 million 2014: 106 million as a result of the increased profitability and the timing of final tax payments for the 2014 and earlier financial years.
Going forward, in the absence of further investment related tax incentives and assuming a similar profit mix, we would anticipate marginal upward pressure on the tax rate over the next three years as it moves towards the expected tax rate of 22%.
