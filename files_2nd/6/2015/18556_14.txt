Fresnillo Today Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Fresnillo plc Performance Annual Report 2015 Driving Long-Term Value from Solid Foundations Financial Review The Consolidated Financial Statements of Fresnillo plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the EU.
This Financial Review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance understanding of the Groups financial statements.
All comparisons refer to 2015 figures compared to 2014, unless otherwise noted.

This deflation reflected, amongst other factors, the favourable effect of the 19.2% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US Others dollar.
Other cost components include freight and insurance premiums, which decreased by an estimated 4.0% and 3.6% respectively on a Labour per unit basis.
The remaining components had an average deflation Employees received a 5.5% increase in wages in Mexican pesos and of 5.7% over 2014. administrative employees at the mines received a 4.5% increase: when converted to US dollars the deflation factor was 11.7%.
Treatment and refining charges 1 Treatment and refining charges, which are deducted from adjusted Energy revenue for the purposes of revenues as disclosed in the income Electricity statement, are determined annually using international benchmarks.
The Groups weighted average cost of electricity decreased by 35.6% Treatment charges per tonne of lead concentrate decreased by 7.0%, to US$7.1 cents per kW in 2015, compared to US$11.0 in 2014. whilst silver refining charges and treatment charges per tonne of zinc Electricity rates are set by the Comisin Federal fide Electricidad CFE, concentrate remained relatively stable year on year.
However this was the national utility, based on their average generating cost, which more than offset by the increase in volumes of lead and zinc correlates mainly to fuel oil and coal prices.
In 2015, the decrease in concentrates with high silver contents shipped mainly from Saucito to electricity rates by CFE was mainly explained by the lower oil prices Met-Mex, resulting in an 8.7% aggregate increase in treatment and and its efforts to substitute expensive fuels for cheaper and cleaner refining charges.

The higher volumes sold mainly due to the ramp-up at Saucito II and Herradura resulted in a positive impact on revenues of US$247.2 million.
This was partly offset by the US$208.9 million unfavourable effect of the lower metal prices.
The contribution of gold to adjusted revenues rose from 47% in 2014 to 52% in 2015 and the contribution of silver decreased from 46% to 39%.
This resulted from the combination of: i the increase in the volume of gold sold 28.3% being higher than that of silver 3.4% : and ii that whilst the average price of gold decreased 10.4%, average silver price decreased 16.1%, thus increasing the gold silver price ratio from 67.3 to 73.8.
In terms of adjusted revenues by mine, Saucito has become the main contributor to adjusted revenues as a result of the successful ramp-up at Saucito II.
Herradura increased its share of consolidated adjusted revenues due to higher volumes of gold produced and sold resulting from the ramp-up to steady state post the lifting of the suspension of the explosives permit in 2014, and the first full year of operations at the dynamic leaching plant.
The increased gold production at Noche Buena slightly increased its contribution.
In contrast, Fresnillo contributed a lesser share of adjusted revenues and decreased to the third most important contributor to adjusted revenue, reflecting the lower volumes produced as a result of the operational challenges faced in this mine see pages 50 to 51.
The lower gold grades at Cinega combined with lower precious metal prices resulted in a decrease in its contribution to adjusted revenues.

The US$118.7 million increase is explained by the following Profit sharing US$0.2 million : Slight increase due to higher profit combination of factors: base at Saucito and Penmont Herradura and Noche Buena, as each Fresnillo subsidiary pays profit sharing individually.
A decrease in adjusted production costsUS$43.5 million : This OthersUS$11.5 million : The change in others principally relates was mainly driven by: i the efficiencies achieved at Saucito, Noche to unproductive costs incurred in the first quarter of 2014 related Buena, Cinega and the dynamic leaching plant resulting from the to the limited operations at Herradura due to the temporary economies of scaleUS$53.2 million : ii the favourable effect of suspension of the explosives permit: that situation was solved and the devaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate when thus no unproductive costs were recognised this year.

ore grade US$1.46 oz : higher treatment and refining charges per silver ounce due to: lower silver ore grade which implies producing more concentrate per ounce of silver, higher zinc and lead ore grades which increases the volume of concentrates, and an increase in the participation of zinc concentrate which has a higher per unit treatment charge US$0.28 oz : and higher cost per tonne US$0.12 oz see page 51.

Saucito: Higher, as a result of the increase in capex invested in the expansion and in efficiency projects: which was partly mitigated by the lower cash cost detailed above.
Cinega: Lower, primarily explained by the decrease in development, mining works and sustaining capex: and the lower cash cost detailed above.
Herradura: Higher, due mainly to the temporary increase in capitalised stripping costs and higher sustaining capex: and to a lesser extent, the higher cash cost detailed above.
Noche Buena: Lower, driven by the decrease in capitalised stripping costs: sustaining capex and lower cash cost detailed above.
Soledad-Dipolos: There were no comparable figures in 2015 and 2014 due to the suspended operations.
Gross profit Gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses, is a key financial indicator of profitability at each business unit and the Fresnillo Group as a whole.
The US$88.0 million decrease in gross profit was mainly explained by: i the adverse effect of lower silver and gold pricesUS$187.0 million : ii the 8.2% decrease in ore throughput and 14.9% decrease in silver grade at the Fresnillo mineUS$64.3 million : iii higher depreciationUS$35.0 million : and iv other effectsUS$8.4 million.
The above factors were partially mitigated by higher gross profit related to: i increased ore volumes processed at Saucito US$117.2 million : ii the 19.2% devaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar US$48.0 million : iii the positive effect of reaching steady state at Herradura US$23.8 million : iv the first full year of operations at the dynamic leaching plant US$13.4 million : and v higher ore grades at Herradura US$4.3 million.
On a per mine basis, Saucito became the largest contributor to the Groups consolidated gross profit, reflecting the increased volumes produced and sold as a result of the ramp-up of Saucito II and strong margins generated at this mine, despite the lower metal prices.
Gross profit at Herradura increased 19.9% to US$163.3 million in 2015 due to Herradura and its DLP being operational for the full year, the ramp-up to steady state and the commissioning of the second Merrill Crowe plant.
This increased Herraduras share of the Groups consolidated gross profit from 24.0% in 2014 to 36.5% in 2015.
Gross profit at the Fresnillo mine decreased 59.8% to US$83.1 million in 2015, reflecting the adverse effect of the lower volumes produced and the decrease in metal prices, which reduced Fresnillos contribution to the Groups total gross profit to 18.5%.
Gross profit at Cinega decreased 58.1% as a result of the lower sales volumes of gold and the decline in metal prices, which reduced its share of the Groups total to 3.8%.
Lastly, at Noche Buena, the favourable effect of higher gold volumes produced and sold did not fully offset the impact of lower gold price and higher costs, generating a loss of US$1.2 million including depreciation of US$43.5 million.
