Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements CFO Financial Review The financial results for 2015 reflect a year of significant progress for UBM, both strategically and operationally.
We made good progress in the integration of the December 2015 was the 2014 acquisition of Advanstar and announced the sale of PR Newswire.
The transaction is a significant step for UBM in executing our Events First strategy as it increases our focus first year of on the attractive, high growth global events sector.
implementing 2015 was the first year of implementing our Events First strategy and the early benefits of the strategy are reflected in the results for the year and in the outlook for 2016 see page 14. our Events First PRN disposal strategy and the On 15 December 2015 UBM announced the proposed disposal of PRN for $841m comprising $810m cash and $31m of preferred equity.
On completion, 245m of proceeds early benefits of will be returned to shareholders via a special dividend and accompanied by a share consolidation.
The remaining cash proceeds will strengthen UBMs capital position and the strategy are provide funds to allow UBM to undertake further value-accretive bolt-on acquisitions.
reflected in the Shareholder approval was obtained on 7 January 2016 and the disposal, which is subject to anti-trust clearance in the US, is expected to complete at the end of Q1 2016.
PRNs results for the year operations have been treated as a discontinued operation and held for sale in the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2015.
For a review of the operating performance of PRN see page 40.
Continuing revenue Continuing reported revenue in 2015 was 769.9m, up 39.9% 2014: 550.5m due to the consolidation of Advanstar, a biennial up year, and the favourable FX movement.
Continuing revenue, on an underlying basis, declined 2.0%: principally the consequence of strategic margin-enhancing rationalisation and the expected decline in OMS revenues.
Adjusting for the rationalisation, underlying continuing revenue growth for the Group was 2.2%.
Continuing adjusted operating profit Marina Wyatt The continuing adjusted operating profit rose by 46.0% to 197.1m 2014: 135.0m.
Chief Financial Officer CFO The continuing adjusted operating margin grew to 25.6% 2014: 24.5% with the impact of Advanstar including synergies and the benefits of rationalising lower-margin activities more than offsetting the strategic opex of 7.6m and the absence of the 11.0m of one-off corporate gains recorded in 2014.
Adjusted EPS Total fully diluted adjusted EPS increased 6.0% to 40.5p 2014: 38.2p reflecting the inclusion of Advanstar and the strong operating performance of the business, partially mitigated by the full year impact of the increase in the number of shares following the rights issue.
Continuing adjusted EPS increased by 19.3% to 30.3p 2014: 25.4p, a more pronounced increase given the proportionately greater impact of Advanstar on the continuing Group.
Cash generated and capital structure Free cash flow after capital expenditure and before discretionary investment increased to 196.8m 2014: 85.4m principally reflecting the inclusion of Advanstar, a stronger working capital performance, higher odd-year biennial inflows and a lower level of capital expenditure.
Cash invested in acquisitions totalled 34.7m.
We received 21.8m from the full repayment of the Delta Vendor Loan Note.
Net debt at 31 December 2015 was 484.9m, 1.8 times EBITDA.
Return on average capital employed for the total Group in 2015 was 14.5% 2014: 13.3%.
This increase year on year reflects the inclusion of Advanstar earnings in the 12 month period and the reduced average capital employed due to the 250m GBP bond becoming a current liability as at 31 December 2015.
In the prior year, the closing capital employed included the equity issued to acquire Advanstar but no earnings as the acquisition took place at the end of 2014.

Capital expenditure Capital expenditure for the year was 28.3m 2014: 50.2m, reflecting investment in the final stages of CORE and expenditure on the new London office.
We also capitalised costs in relation to the integration of Advanstar to UBM properties and the capital expenditure reflects the higher level of investment with Advanstar consolidated into the Group.

Return on investment for acquisitions made over the past three years is 10.5%.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Details of related party transactions in the 12 months ended 31 December 2015 are disclosed in Note 8.2.
GOING CONCERN After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that UBM has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In reaching this conclusion, the Directors have had due regard to the following: After taking account of available cash resources and committed bank facilities, none of UBMs borrowings fall due within the next 12 months that require refinancing from resources not already available.
The cash generated from operations, committed facilities and UBMs ability to access debt capital markets, taken together, provide confidence that UBM will be able to meet its obligations as they fall due.
Further information on the financial position of UBM, its cash flows, financial risk management policies and available debt facilities are described in my review on the preceding pages.
UBMs business activities, together with the factors likely to impact its future growth and operating performance are set out in the Strategic Report of the Annual Report.
