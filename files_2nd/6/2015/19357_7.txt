STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW Nick Hateley Chief Financial Officer Dear Shareholder I am pleased to be able to present our financial performance for the year ended 29 March 2015, our first full year as a public company.
We performed strongly across all of the Key Performance Indicators KPIs set out in our IPO prospectus, especially in the growth of our store estate and in our strong cash flow, as the table shows.

REVENUE Group underlying revenue was 1,111.5 million 2014: 997.8 million, which represents growth on the prior year of 11.4%, or 11.8% on a constant currency basis.
This improvement was driven by contributions from both our opening programme and like-for-like sales growth.
We grew like-for-like sales during the year by 2.4% on a constant currency basis 2014: 1.9%, which was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with amazing value every day, as well as some favourable tail winds including a late Easter, the looms jewellery band craze and more favourable weather patterns in the first quarter.
Our new store opening programme was weighted to the second half of the year, with the result that the contribution from new store weeks was considerably lower than in the same period last year.
However, we achieved our target to open 60 net new stores for the year as a whole and we have a strong pipeline in place for the current financial year.
We also faced some currency headwinds due to the weakening Euro, especially in the second half of the year.
If current exchange rates are maintained, then this will be more of a feature in the 2016 financial year.
We recorded non-underlying revenue of 5.4 million 2014: nil, which represents our trial in Spain.
We opened 5 stores in Spain in the 2015 financial year and will move towards our target for the trial of 10 in the current financial year.
We will then evaluate the performance of these stores before announcing our longer term plans.
UNDERLYING GROSS MARGIN Gross profits increased by 12.0% to 412.7 million 2014: 368.5 million and gross margins increased by 20 basis points to 37.1 % 2014: 36.9%.
This increase was primarily driven by a combination of our improved buying power, but also assisted by the improved penetration within our sales mix of our own label products, which increased from 36.6% of sales to 38.0% or to 37.5%, excluding the sale of loom bands.
This was driven by having two Easter trading periods, the looms craze and our improved own label product offer, which included the launch of the highly successful Jane Ashers Kitchen and Make Up Gallery.
These positive factors, together with an effective hedging strategy helped to limit the negative impact of the unfavourable movement in the Euro exchange rate and enabled our gross margin to rise.
POUNDLAND GROUP Plc 20 Annual report and financial statements for p e 29 March 2015 OPERATING COSTS Underlying operating costs m Growth 2015 2014 Growth Ex PLC costs 11.8% Distribution expenses 332.1 297.0 15.2% 7.3% Administrative expenses 36.3 31.5 12.1% 11.4% Total overhead 368.4 328.5 13.2% Wages and salaries 163.7 144.5 7.1% Underlying depreciation and amortisation 15.0 14.0 12.7% Operating leases 88.5 78.5 10.6% Other inc. rates 101.2 91.5 12.1% 11.4% Total overhead 368.4 328.5 % of sales Wages 14.7 14.5 Underlying depreciation and amortisation 1.4 1.4 Operating leases 8.0 7.9 Other inc. rates 9.1 9.2 20 bp flat Total overhead 33.1 32.9 Underlying operating costs in the financial year increased by 12.1% to 368.4 million 2014: 328.5 million.
This increase in the cost base in the period was primarily a result of the greater number of stores in our estate, but also reflects the additional costs of being a listed company, which were 2.5 million in the financial year.
This drove an increase in our operating costs as a percentage of sales of around 20 basis points to 33.1% 2014: 32.9%.
We also incurred extra costs due to our interpretation of an ongoing legislative process regarding average holiday pay and this increased our wage bill by 2.4 million, before mitigating action involving improved labour efficiency in our stores.
In order to aid a better understanding of the underlying growth of the business, for this year only, we have included information to demonstrate the effect of the additional costs of being a PLC, which were 2.5 million.
If these costs were to be excluded, then operating costs as a percentage of sales were unchanged at 32.9% 2014: 32.9%.
EBITDA AND EBIT Reconciliation to underlying EBITDA m 2015 2014 Reported EBITDA 53.5 42.8 Adjustments Costs in respect of IPO 0.3 10.0 Harlow warehouse 1.5 Costs in respect of 99p Stores 2.0 Spain e-commerce 2.1 1.3 Underlying EBITDA 59.4 54.0 We report non-underlying items in our income statement to show one-off items and to allow investors to better understand the underlying performance of the business.
In relation to the 2015 financial year, these included double running costs associated with our new warehouse at Harlow 1.5 million and strategic initiatives in launching our pilot stores in Spain 2.1 million.
In the previous financial year, we incurred costs related to our successful IPO and to strategic initiatives in ecommerce and in international development.
Underlying EBITDA grew by 9.9% to 59.4 million 2014: 54.0 million, driven by good margin management and cost control.
com 21 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW continued Growth ex PLC m 2015 2014 Growth % costs % 14.6 Underlying EBITDA 59.4 54.0 9.9 7.1 Underlying depreciation and amortisation 15.0 14.0 7.1 17.1 Underlying EBIT 44.4 40.0 10.8 Up 16 bp Underlying EBITDA margin % 5.34 5.41 Down 7 bp Up 21 bp Underlying EBIT margin % 4.0 4.0 flat The table above shows underlying EBIT and movement in underlying margins.
Underlying EBIT excludes brand amortisation of 1.1 million 2014: 1.1 million from depreciation and amortisation expenses, including charges associated with Spain as we regard this charge as non-underlying.
Underlying EBIT grew by 10.8% to 44.4 million.
The underlying Group EBITDA margin fell by 7 basis points and the Group EBIT margin was flat.
Once again, these numbers are distorted by the additional costs of becoming a PLC, which were 2.5 million.
Excluding these costs, the underlying growth in EBITDA and EBIT was 14.6% and 17.1% respectively and both saw underlying increases in margin.
We believe that this is a good performance, especially given the impact of adverse changes in average annual holiday pay and also the effects of the weakening Euro.
NET FINANCE COSTS In the 2015 financial year, the Group saw its underlying net finance cost reduce significantly, by 78% to 0.7 million 2014: 3.2 million.
This was a consequence of the Groups good trading performance, lower financing charges related to the new loan facility and high cash conversion rates.
STATUTORY PROFIT BEFORE TAX Reconciliation to underlying profit before tax m 2015 2014 Reported profit before tax 36.2 21.5 Adjustments Costs in respect of IPO 0.3 10.0 Amortisation 1.1 1.1 1.5 Distribution centre Costs in respect of 99p Stores 2.0 Spain e-commerce 2.2 1.3 Net financing expense 0.3 2.9 Underlying profit before tax 43.7 36.8 Underlying profit before tax was 43.7 million, which represented an increase of 18.6% on last year 2014: 36.8 million.
Statutory profit before tax increased by 68.3% to 36.2 million 2014: 21.5 million, due to a reduction in net non-underlying charges, primarily costs in the previous year associated with the Groups stock market flotation.
TAXATION The underlying tax charge for the period was 9.7 million 2014: 9.6 million.
The full year underlying effective tax rate was 22.2% 2014: 26.0%, with the reduction primarily due to the fall in UK corporation tax rates from 23% to 21%.
STATUTORY PROFIT AFTER TAX Underlying profit after tax was 34.0 million, which represented an increase of 24.6% on last year 2014: 27.3 million.
Statutory profit after tax increased by 104.9% to 28.4 million 2014: 13.9 million, due to a reduction in net non-underlying charges, primarily due to costs associated with the Groups stock market flotation in the previous financial year.

Fully diluted earnings per share increased by 104.7% to 11.34p per share 2014: 5.54p per share.
The weighted average number of shares in issue during the period was 250 million and the weighted average number of fully diluted shares was 250.4 million.
IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE Our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is twofold.
First, we source products overseas, primarily in US Dollars but, increasingly, in Euros.
This relates primarily to the sourcing of our own label products.
Because we are a single price retailer, and therefore cannot pass on price increases, we seek to mitigate changing exchange rates by hedging our exposure 12 to 18 months ahead.
Our second exposure is a consequence of our growing European business, Dealz, in Ireland and in Spain.
Besides the obvious translational risk, we also have transactional risk because we mostly buy in Sterling and sell in Euros, although we are making progress in sourcing products from European markets.
In our 2014 financial year, the to ratio averaged 1.19, whereas in our 2015 financial year, it averaged 1.27.
Over the last six months, the Euro has weakened considerably, to the extent that, if current exchange rates were to be sustained, then we are guiding that the risk to EBITDA in the 2016 financial year will be around 4 million.

We continued to roll out the Poundland format in the UK and the Dealz format in Ireland.
We opened a total of 73 stores in the UK & Ireland in the 2015 financial year, or 60 net of closures.
We also opened 5 stores in our trial in Spain.
We ended the year with 593 stores 2014: 528, including 545 Poundland stores in the UK and 48 Dealz stores, including 41 in Ireland, 2 in the Isle of Man and Orkney and 5 in Spain.
We have a long-term target of 1,000 stores in the UK and 70 in Ireland.
We plan to open 60 net new stores a year in the UK and Ireland and our pipeline is strong for the current year.
We continued to invest in our infrastructure to support our planned growth and our new purpose-built 350,000 sq.
ft. distribution centre in Harlow became operational in September.

This is after payment of 5.3 million in costs associated with our successful stock market flotation.
Operating cash flow fell slightly to 53.8 million, due to the fact that we invested working capital in both our new warehouse in Harlow and in our pilot in Spain.
These latter two points also led to our cash conversion ratio falling slightly, as expected, to 92.7% 2014: 123.7%.
DIVIDEND The Directors are pleased to propose a final dividend of 3.0p, which will be paid on 2 October 2015 to shareholders whose names are on the Register of Members at the close of business on 18 September 2015.
The ordinary shares will be quoted ex dividend on 17 September 2015.
As set out at IPO, we have adopted a dividend policy which reflects our long-term earnings and cash flow potential, targeting a level of annual dividend cover of 2.5 to 3.5 times based on earnings.
Together with the previously announced interim dividend of 1.5p per share, this would give a total dividend for the year of 4.5p and represents cover of 3.0.
