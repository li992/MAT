Hotels & Restaurants profits grew to 401.4 million, up 15.3%, with UK profits of 406.6 million, up 14.8%.
Within this, rent costs reflected the higher mix of leasehold openings, increasing by 20.8% to 107.5 million 2013 14: 89.0 million, and our depreciation and amortisation charge increasing by 10.1% to 109.8 million 2013 14: 99.7 million as we continued to invest in enhancing our hotels and restaurants and upgrading our systems.
We are focused on continually improving our customer propositions.
In February 2015, we launched our free upgraded Wi-Fi offering and in 2015 16 we will increase the number of full room refurbishments to around 4,500 rooms, complete the roll out of our best ever bed and install around 2,300 air-conditioning units.
We will also continue to increase our revenue investment in technology and process improvements as we grow our digital capabilities and evolve our systems to support future growth.
These revenue investments will amount to approximately 15 million incremental spend in 2015 16. International hotel losses were 5.2 million 2013 14: loss 6.0 million with good progress in the Middle East and the continued planned investment in establishing our South East Asia operation.

Interest The underlying interest charge for the year was slightly lower than last year at 16.3 million 2013 14: 18.9 million due to a greater proportion of our debt funded hotels under construction, which increased the element of interest capitalised on these developments.
The effective interest rate on average net debt reduced from 4.7% to 4.3%.
The total pre-exceptional interest cost was 37.9 million 2013 14: 42.5 million including the IAS 19 R pension finance charge of 21.6 million 2013 14: 23.6 million.

Investments in capital expenditure, including business combinations, rose to 565.3 million 2013 14: 306.2 million.
This resulted from an increase in our hotel room openings and the investment in our pipeline, with a greater focus on freehold properties, and in improving our existing estate.
Within this, there were also business acquisitions of 19.5 million for a Costa Franchise partner, Coffee Life, and for two going concern hotels.
Pension payments totalled 81.4 million, with the defined benefit contribution being in line with the triennial valuation scheduled payments agreed with the pension trustee in 2011. Dividend payments amounted to 130.6 million 2013 14: 62.4 million.
The dividend payment last year was significantly lower due to the high take up of the scrip dividend, which has subsequently been replaced by the dividend reinvestment plan, and the increase in this years dividend payments is in line with the Groups basic earnings per share growth.
Corporation tax paid in the year was 82.8 million 2013 14: 81.4 million.
With the investments in our growth, net debt as at 26 February 2015 was 583.2 million 2013 14: 391.6 million.
Capital expenditure On an accruals basis the Groups capital expenditure, including business combinations, was 567.5 million, 2013 14: 336.6 million.
The Groups cash capital expenditure was 565.3 million 2013 14: 306.2 million including business combinations.
Capital expenditure is split between expansionary which includes the acquisition and development of properties and product improvement and maintenance.
Hotels & Restaurants cash capital expenditure was 483.1 million 2013 14: 231.1 million, with expansionary expenditure increasing to 333.3 million 2013 14: 147.4 million as we opened more rooms and built our pipeline to 12,465 rooms, including 5,568 in London.
Within this we acquired 191.8 million of freehold property, an increase from 62.9 million in 2013 14, resulting in freehold property representing 41% of our pipeline compared to 25% at the end of the previous year.
Freehold properties remain Whitbreads preferred route to market for Hotels & Restaurants and, with record occupancy, they are providing a low risk opportunity to extend the number of rooms in our existing hotels.
Product improvement and maintenance cash expenditure in Hotels & Restaurants was 149.8 million 2013 14: 83.7 million.
This was an increase on the previous year as we stepped up the refurbishment programme with a combination of light and full refurbishments, increased the investment in our hotels infrastructure, invested in our Wi-Fi offering and upgraded our systems.
Costa cash capital expenditure was 82.0 million 2013 14: 74.2 million with 56.1 million on expansionary capital as we opened 370 new coffee shops and installed 777 net new Costa Express machines.
Costa product improvement and maintenance expenditure was 25.9 million 2013 14: 21.9 million, a significant part of which was spent on upgrading 117 Costa stores.

The year on year increase is principally driven by Hotels & Restaurants with an increase in room openings to c. 5,500 and the higher freehold pipeline mix being maintained, with a greater weighting to London.
Hotels & Restaurants product improvement and maintenance investment will also increase year on year, as we continue to improve our customer experience and competitive edge through our refurbishment programme and systems capabilities.
Around 80% of our room openings are planned for the second half of the year.
Costa is planning to open around 250 coffee shops net and to install c. 700 to 800 Costa express machines with cash capital expenditure planned at c. 100 million.
Return on capital Return on capital is a prime focus for Whitbread.
In the year, the Groups return on capital improved 0.4% pts to 15.7% with Costas returns up 5.8% pts to 46.3% and Hotels & Restaurants returns up 0.2% pts to 13.5%.
Return on capital in Hotels & Restaurants would have been 0.5% pts higher at 14.0% if the capital invested in freehold developments in construction was excluded.
Pension As at 26 February 2015 there was an IAS 19 R pension deficit of 553.8 million 2013 14: 534.3 million.
The increase on last year was a result of a reduction in the liability discount rate from 4.3% to 3.3% and an improvement in members life expectancy.
The increase was partially offset by an increase in asset values and the company contributions.
We have reached agreement with the Trustee of the Pension Fund on the 2014 triennial funding valuation and recovery plan.
The funding deficit at 31 March 2014 was 564 million compared to the last valuation in 2011 of 432 million.
The increase in the deficit reflects an increase in the value of the liabilities and members life expectancy, again partially offset by the recovery plan contributions and better than expected investment returns.
The recovery plan maintains the schedule of company contributions agreed in the 2011 recovery plan up to 2018 and extends the contributions to 2022.
The recovery plan schedule of company contributions are 65 million in 2015, 70 million in 2016, 80 million per annum for 2017 to 2021 and 17 million in 2022.
The payments will be accelerated by up to 5 million per year where increases in ordinary dividends exceed RPI.
The Group also makes payments of c. 910 million per year into the pension fund through the Scottish Partnership arrangements.
Financial status and funding Whitbread aims to maintain its financial position and capital structure consistent with retaining its investment grade debt status.
To this end we work within the financial framework of net debt to EBITDAR pension and lease adjusted of less than 3.5 times.
The debt to EBITDAR for 2014 15 was 3.2 times.
With the growth of our Premier Inn and Costa estate and the increase in the leasehold mix of new hotels, our total lease commitment increased to 2,832.7 million 2013 14: 2,577.7 million.
In October 2014, we announced that Whitbread extended the maturity of its 650 million syndicated bank facility, under the existing terms, by one year to 4 November 2019.
With this extension to our loan facility, together with our 258 million of private placement notes at the hedged rate and our strong balance sheet with freehold asset backing, we believe the Group is well positioned to be able to meet the needs of our growth programme.
