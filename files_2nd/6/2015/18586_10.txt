Financial results Adjusted EBITDA was $8,694 million and Adjusted EBIT was $2,172 million, decreases of 32% and 68% respectively compared to 2014, mainly due to sharply lower average commodity prices in 2015, net of producer country currency depreciation.
Against such backdrop, significant operating cost savings were achieved through a relentless focus on all areas of the business, including supply chain, contractor management and employee productivity, while decisive action wasalso taken to reduce supply and associated capex opex, notably within our coal, zinc, copper and oil portfolio.

The stronger H2 performance, on an annualised basis, came in 7% above 2014s result.
Energy products Adjusted marketing EBIT was up 48% compared to 2014, as oil in particular was presented with and executed well within an attractive, opportunity rich market environment.
The Agricultural products Adjusted marketing EBIT was down 46% compared to 2014, in large part due to the high comparable base exceptionally strong Canadian harvest and the immediate imposition of a punitive wheat export taxinRussia in Q1.
Glencore Annual Report 2015 37 Strategic report Financial review Industrial Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 38% to $6,034 million Adjusted EBIT was negative $292 million, due to the relatively fixed non-cash depreciation charge, owing primarily to weaker average year over year commodity prices including oil, nickel, coal, copper and zinc down 46%, 30%, 20%, 20% and 11% respectively, partially mitigated by weaker producer currencies notably the Kazakhstan Tenge, South African Rand and Australian and Canadian dollars, down relative to the US dollar, by 24%, 18%, 20% and 16% respectively.
