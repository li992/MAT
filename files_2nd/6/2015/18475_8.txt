com FINANCIAL REVIEW Statement of operations The Groups consolidated revenues decreased PAVEL TATYANIN by 32.9% to US$8,767 million compared to Senior Vice President, US$13,061million in 2014 primarily as a result CFO of falling prices and depressed demand in 2015.
However, we managed to cushion the effect of market challenging conditions by implementing the cost-efficiency programme and market initiatives, consequently EBITDA margin is just 1.6 percentage points lower than in 2014 16.4% in 2015 compared to 18.0% in 2014.
Consolidated EBITDA decreased by 38.9% to US$1,438 million compared to US$2,355 million in 2014.
In 2015, revenues from the Steel segment including inter-segment decreased and amounted to 68.3% of the Group total.
The decrease was mainly attributable to lower revenues from sales of steel products, which declined by 36.8% year-on-year, largely due to a drop in average selling prices down 31.6%, in line with global benchmarks.
Revenues from the sales of steel products was also impacted by changes in the Groups sales volumes which declined from 13.5 million tonnes in 2014 to 12.8 million tonnes in 2015, due to deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium less 0.4 million tonnes and worsening conditions in key markets.
Revenues from the Steel, North America segment fell by 28.2% year-on-year.
Revenues from the sales of steel products dropped by 29.1%, driven by declining prices down 12.2%, lower sales volumes down 14.8% and changes in the product mix down 2.1%.
The key drivers of these were, in turn, significant reductions in EVRAZ North Americas seamless pipe and oil country tubular goods OCTG sales, resulting from the slump in oil prices, subdued demand for flat products and price decrease for rod and bar products.
Revenues from the Coal segment fell due to lower sales prices and volumes.
In 2015, production was impacted by both planned work the scheduled longwall moves at Yuzhkuzbassugol and unplanned events such as the suspension of operations at Raspadskayas MUK-96 mine due to market conditions.
35 Strategic report In 2015, the Steel segments EBITDA declined amid depressed demand in Russia and In the present generally negative steel price trends globally, partly offset by lower expenses in US dollar terms due to rouble depreciation.
Lower prices of iron ore, coking coal and scrap, the environment deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium and the disposal of EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel all positively affected the segments results.
free cash flow The Steel, North America segments EBITDA was impacted by lower sales volumes stemming generation from a downturn in the OCTG and flat product markets.
and further The Coal segments EBITDA decreased slightly year-on-year, as Yuzhkuzbassugol implemented deleveraging an efficiency improvement programme and optimised assets and coal product sales prices decreased, this was offset by the positive impact of rouble devaluation on ost base.

This was accompanied by the impact of deconsolidation of Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited following the loss of control.
General and administrative expenses declined by 36.2% in 2015.
This reflected the reduced staff costs following headcount optimisation at EVRAZ North America, the Russian steel mills and coal companies, and the weakening of the rouble and hryvnia.
Impairment losses during the reporting period included the write-off of goodwill at subsidiaries in the US and Canada totalling US$251 million, impairment of the cash-generating units Annual Report & Accounts 2015 37 Strategic report of EVRAZ Palini e Bertoli by US$37 million and EVRAZ Yuzhny Stan by US$30 million, and a US$77 million loss relating to one of Raspadskayas coal fields that was damaged by fire.
Foreign exchange losses arose as a result of the devaluation of the rouble, hryvnia, tenge and Canadian dollar.
The subsidiaries in respective countries have US dollar-denominated debts, such as bonds and bank loans.
In addition, there are some intra-group debts between subsidiaries with different functional currencies and, consequently, gains losses of one subsidiary recognised in the Statement of Operations are not offset by the exchange differences of another subsidiary with a different functional currency.
Interest expenses incurred by the Group decreased due to a reduction of gross debt.
The interest expense for bank loans, bonds and notes amounted to US$430 million in 2015 and US$503 million in 2014.
It was also impacted by a decrease in the interest expense of rouble bonds due to the rouble weakening.
Gain on disposals classified as held for sale in 2015 amounted to US$21 million.
The amount includes US$20 million of a gain recognized in relation to disposal of assets of Portland Structural Tubing.
In 2014 gain on disposal classified as held for sale amounted to US$136 million, including US$90 million in relation to disposal of EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel and US$25 million from disposal of iron ore mine and heat and power plant located in the Krasnoyarsk and Kemerovo regions of Russia.
Losses on financial assets and liabilities amounted to US$48 million and included, among other things, US$459 million of realised losses and US$439 million of unrealised gains on changes in the fair value of derivatives cross-currency swaps for rouble-denominated bonds.
Also the losses include US$15 million of loss on extinguishment of debts which predominantly is a premium of repurchase of US Dollar denominated bonds and US$11 million of impairment relating to the decline in quotations of available-for-sale financial assets shares of Delong Holdings Limited, a flat steel producer headquartered in Beijing, China.
Loss of control over EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium starting 14 April 2015 resulted in recognition of a loss on disposal of a subsidiary in the amount of $167 million, including $142 million of translation loss recycled to the statement of operations.

Annual Report & Accounts 2015 39 Strategic report CAPEX and key projects In 2015, EVRAZ reduced its total capital expenditure to US$428 million, compared with US$654 million in 2014, primarily due to currency fluctuations and the completion of capitalintensive projects.
In Q4 2015, the Group launched the continuous casting machine at EVRAZ ZSMK and the plan is to reach full capacity in H2 2016.
The Mezhegey coal project is in the final stage of development launch of the mine is scheduled for 2016.
Two projects began at EVRAZ Regina in Canada with a total investment of over US$200 million.

com Effect of Russian rouble devaluation on book value Under IAS 21, the financial information of each subsidiary is prepared in its functional currency and then translated into the Group reporting currency the US dollar for consolidation and presentation purposes.
Changes in the carrying values of each subsidiarys assets and liabilities when translated into US dollars are recognised as a translation difference directly in other comprehensive income loss.
Thus any significant depreciation or appreciation of the subsidiaries functional currencies has a significant effect on the carrying values of subsidiaries and the Groups equity.
At the beginning of 2015, EVRAZ had approximately US$4 billion net asset exposure in Russian roubles RUB the functional currency of Russian subsidiaries and Ukrainian hryvnia UAH the functional currency of the Ukrainian subsidiaries.
These net assets mostly represented the historic cost of property, plant and equipment of the RUB and UAH functional currency subsidiaries less related rouble and hryvnia nominated liabilities.
Rouble-denominated bonds are not a part of these net assets, as at the issuance they were economically swapped into fixed rate US dollar borrowings.
During 2015, there was a 23% depreciation of the Russian rouble and a 34% depreciation of the Ukrainian hryvnia against the US dollar.
This depreciation led to a decline of approximately c. US$1.0 billion in the US dollar equivalent of the carrying values of net assets primarily property, plant and equipment of these subsidiaries and a corresponding decline in the Groups consolidated equity.
Management believes that the market value of the respective property, plant and equipment measured in US dollars is significantly higher than its carrying value.
This is also the case for their US dollar-measured cash-generating capacity, as determined by IAS 36 discounted cash flows value-in-use methodology VIU.
The change in the value-in-use in 2015 was largely due to the shift in the product mix, stemming from lower domestic demand caused by sanctions and associated economic instability in the local markets of the assets involved.
Other contributors included a decrease in the weighted average cost of capital and adjustments to long-term forecasts for global steel, iron ore and coal prices.
Even though IAS 16 allows the use of a fair value option for accounting for property, plant and equipment, the fair value accounting is rarely used in metals and mining industries and it is complicated for a capital extensive business.
Moreover, the use of fair value model for accounting for property, plant and equipment would decrease the comparability of EVRAZ financial statements.

Sales volumes of railway products in 2015 also fell due to lower demand in the CIS, caused by a decline in new railway infrastructure construction and maintenance projects and a slump in demand from railcar producers and repair shops.
Sales to Russian Railways, however, remained flat year-on-year reaching 632 thousand tonnes.
External revenues from flat-rolled products dropped.
This was mostly due to lower sales volumes down 51.5% and average prices down 11.7% following the deconsolidation of EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel and EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium as well as lower sales of thirdparty producers flat-rolled goods by EVRAZ Metall Inprom amid reduced demand.
Revenues from external sales of steel products to Russia decreased by 42.7% year-on-year, mainly due to lower prices, while sales volumes fell by 15.8%.
The share of Russia in external sales of steel products also declined, from 54.4% in 2014 to 48.3% in 2015, as shifting sales from the domestic to export markets helped to stabilise production volumes and increased profitability amid the weaker rouble.
Steel segment revenues from sales of iron ore products fell by 39.9%.
This was due to lower iron ore prices down 37.2% and sales volumes down 2.7% resulting from the deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium.
Prices for iron ore products generally declined in 2015, in line with global benchmarks.
Steel segment revenues from sales of vanadium products declined by 37.0% due to lower sales prices down 19.2% and sales volumes down 13.1%.
This stemmed from the deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium, while average selling prices mirrored the downward trends in the global steel market.
Steel segment cost of revenue | The Steel segments cost of revenue decreased by 34.8% yearon-year in 2015.
The main reasons for the decline were as follows: The cost of raw materials fell by 32.3% mainly due to decline in prices, lower iron ore and scrap consumption as a result of changes in the mix of raw material consumption, steel production decreases and a reduction in volumes of iron ore purchased from third parties, as own production volumes increased.
The decline in raw material costs is also attributable to deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium, and cost-cutting initiatives, which reduced consumption.
Auxiliary material costs decreased by 26.3%, primarily due to the roubles weakness and deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium down US$45 million, partly offset by higher prices in local currencies and an increase in consumption of refractories, mainly for repairs at EVRAZ NTMK.
Lower service costs were driven by the weakness of the rouble and hryvnia, as well as the deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium down US$105 million.
Transportation costs decreased by 17.9%, primary due to the roubles weakness.
Annual Report & Accounts 2015 45 Strategic report Staff costs fell by 39.7%, largely due to the rouble and hryvnia weakness and headcount optimisation.
Additional contributor was the deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium partly offset by wage inflation at Russian sites.
Depreciation and depletion costs dropped, driven mainly by local currency depreciation and the deconsolidation of EVRAZ Highveld Steel and Vanadium down US$13 million.
Lower energy costs were driven by the rouble and hryvnia devaluation: reduced consumption of electricity and natural gas due to asset optimisations and lower production volumes at Russian steelmaking sites: the use of pulverised coal injection PCI technology at ZSMK, which was commissioned in Q2 2014: an increase in own generation at ZabSib Heat and Power plant.
Lower energy costs were partially offset by an increase in tariffs in local currencies.
Other costs decreased, primarily due to changes in goods for resale costs down US$227 million and lower consumption of semi-finished products mainly due to disposal of EVRAZ Vitkovice Steel down US$51 million.
Steel segment gross profit | The Steel segments gross profit decreased by 43.4% year-on-year, driven primarily by lower revenues from sales of steel products.
com Steel, North America segment Revenue from steel product sales decreased due to lower sales prices down 14.2% and the impact of changes in sales volumes down 14.9%.
Revenues from tubular product sales decreased by 32.2%, primarily due to lower sales volumes down 22.3% and price change down 9.9%.
The drop in sales volumes was driven by weaker demand for OCTG and small-diameter line pipe, caused by a slowdown in drilling activities due to the slump in oil prices.
Sales of large-diameter pipes LDP remained strong due to demand from midstream infrastructure companies.
Railway product revenues declined by 15.2%, driven by a 11.9% drop in average prices, in line with the general price trend in the US steel market.
The lower volume related to operational issues in Q3 2015, while demand from railway customers was stable.
Revenues from sales of construction products decreased by 35.9%, primarily due to lower sales volumes down 21.6%, sales price down 14.3%.
The fall in sales volumes was attributable to the disposal of a structural tubing facility in Portland in March 2015.
Prices for construction products were under pressure from high import volumes in North America.
Revenues from flat-rolled products fell, mainly due to lower prices down 21.6% and sales volumes down 7.6% caused by higher imports.

5 Includes scrap and services Annual Report & Accounts 2015 47 Strategic report Steel, North America segment cost of revenue | Cost of revenue decreased by 24.5% year-onyear in 2015.
The main drivers were as follows: Raw material costs decreased by 32.2%, primarily due to lower consumption of raw materials scrap, coke, ferroalloys and other.
The main reasons for this were lower volumes of crude steel and finished products, such as OCTG, flat and wire rod, cost-cutting initiatives that reduced consumption, and declining raw material prices.
Costs of semi-finished products fell by 39.9%, amid prices for slab purchased and lower production volumes of tubular products.
Auxiliary materials dropped by 19.8%, as a cost-cutting plan was implemented and production volumes of crude steel and finished products dropped compared with 2014.
Service costs declined by 5.3%, as production volumes in 2015 fell year-on-year.
Energy costs fell, driven by decreased production volumes, a decline in energy consumption, and lower tariffs for energy and natural gas.
Steel, North America segment gross profit | Gross profit totalled US$290 million in 2015, down from US$537 million in 2014.
The decline was due to lower sales revenues amid the downturn on the OCTG and flat product markets.
com Coal segment Overall revenues decreased amid a reduction in sales prices, reflecting decreased global demand and greater output in other coal-exporting countries.
Sales volumes also decreased, as the Group mined less raw coal in accordance with the annual schedule of longwall moves.
Non-core steam coal production was suspended in 2014.
Decommissioning of the only remaining steam coal mine among EVRAZs Russian coal assets started.
In 2015, prices in rouble terms increased year-on-year due to higher prices in Russia and a shift in shipments in favour of more expensive grades.
However, due to the sharp rouble depreciation, when re-calculated in US dollars, prices in 2015 were lower than those in 2014.
Revenues from internal sales of coal products decreased due to lower average sales prices down 12.7% and sales volumes down 8.0%.
The decrease in coal consumption in 2015 compared with 2014 resulted from reduced coal consumption at EVRAZ ZSMK after the shutdown of two coke batteries and launch of the PCI plant.
Revenues from external sales of coal products decreased, mainly due to lower prices down 16.3% and sales volumes down 3.4%.
In 2015, Coal segment sales to the Steel segment amounted to US$419 million and 39.2% of sales, compared with US$528 million and 40.1% in 2014.
During the reporting period, c. 53% of EVRAZs coking coal consumption in steelmaking came from the Groups own operations, compared with 54% in 2014.
The decline in Russian sales of coking coal products from 6.2mt in 2014 to 5.2mt in 2015 is mainly attributable to the decreased demand for coking coal from Russian steelmaking companies who have started to use more of their own captive coal supply.
The decreased demand from Russian steelmakers is also driven by the decline in steel production volumes in Russia and introduction of PCI.

Transportation costs declined due to lower sales volumes and transportation costs from Russian entities as a result of the rouble devaluation.
Staff costs decreased due to the rouble weakness down US$114 million.
Depreciation and depletion costs decreased, mostly due to lower depreciation and depletion expenses at Yuzhkuzbassugol caused by the revision and detailing of future mining plans and lower depletion of mineral deposits down US$17 million.
This was also accompanied by a fall in depreciation in US dollar terms due to the rouble weakness down US$89 million.
Energy costs fell due to the effect of currency movements down US$21 million, partly offset by higher electricity prices in local currencies up US$8 million.
Other costs increased, primarily due to changes in taxes, work-in-progress and stocks of finished goods and the effect of the rouble weakness.
Coal segment gross profit | The Coal segments gross profit amounted to US$319 million in 2015, up from US$278 million in 2014.
The gross profit margin rose, primarily due to the rouble depreciations influence on costs, lower depreciation and depletion, and cost-cutting initiative.
