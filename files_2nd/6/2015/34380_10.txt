FINANCIAL REVIEW It has been another active and successful year for British Land as we continue to deliver strong total returns Overview The Group had another successful year, continuing to deliver high returns underpinned by the positive market and our actions.
Over the last two years, our business has achieved a total accounting return of nearly 50%, with returns of 24.5% in 2015.
This strong performance reflects strategic decisions taken over the last five years, together with our day to day asset management activities.
This, combined with a continued tightening of market yields has resulted in EPRA valuation surplus of 1.6 billion and a 20.5% increase in NAV per share to 829p.
We completed 2.4 billion of investment activity including the acquisition of One Sheldon Square in April 2015: with acquisition and development spend broadly balancing disposals.
We took advantage of the strength of the market to sell assets which we do not believe will be successful in the long term and, with an increased focus towards London and the South East, reinvested in assets which strengthen our Key highlights of the year existing estates and provide development opportunities.
We manage our mix of equity and debt financing to achieve the right balance between enhancing returns for shareholders and the risk of 24.5% 829p Up 20.5% higher leverage.
Our approach to LTV seeks to ensure that it does not exceed a maximum threshold if market yields were to rise to previous Total accounting return EPRA net asset value per share peak levels, this means we do not gear up on market yield shift.
The decrease in LTV to 35% is a reflection of the impact market yield improvements, ERV growth and our actions had on valuations.

Underlying profit increased to 313 million as a result of significant letting activity and the financing actions taken.
The increase in EPS of 4% is higher than the dividend increase in the year of 2.5% as we improve dividend cover.

We continue to achieve attractive financings which improve earnings and liquidity.
We have raised 1.9 billion of debt finance since 31 March 2014, including the five year 785 million unsecured Revolving Credit Facility RCF in April 2014: an extension by one year was agreed May 2015.
Lucinda Bell Chief Financial Officer In February 2015, we undertook a restructuring of British Lands other syndicated RCFs.
A new 485 million unsecured RCF was entered into at an initial margin of 90 bps with a maturity of five years, which may be extended to a maximum of seven years, on British Lands request and on each banks approval for their participation.
This facility replaced the 560 million RCF which would have matured in May 2016, and was an extension and re-pricing of the 310 million RCF, which was due to expire in May 2018.
This restructuring reduced the total facilities available to the Group by about 400 million, in line with our lower leverage mind-set.
Refinancing of our joint venture and fund facilities in the year consisted of an extension of the Hercules Unit Trust 350 million facility at a borrowing cost 80 bps lower than the previous facility and refinancing of the Tesco BL Properties joint venture 325 million facility at a borrowing cost 280 bps lower than the previous facility.
We also repaid the higher rate 60 million facility held by Tesco British Land Property Partnership in March 2015 following our acquisition of Tescos interest in this joint venture.
Overall, liability management completed in the year, including the re-couponing element of the Tesco property exchange transaction, has reduced the proportionally consolidated weighted average interest rate from 4.1% to 3.8% British Land has 1.9 billion of committed banking facilities and 73 million of cash and short term deposits.
Of these facilities 1.6 billion have maturities of more than two years.
