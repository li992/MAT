Chief Financial Officers Review To the extent there is surplus capital within the business, the Board expects to return that capital to shareholders Darren Bryant Chief Financial Officer The FY15 accounting period refers to the year ended 31 January 2015 and the comparative period FY14 refers to the year ended 31 January 2014.
REVENUES Total Group revenues during the year grew by 8.1% to 353.3m FY14: 326.9m, a similar growth rate to the prior year, with both of the Groups businesses contributing to this increase.
The Card Factory business grew revenue by 7.5% to 337.8m FY14: 314.3m.
A total of 51 net new stores were added during the year.
Like-for-like sales in existing stores grew by 1.8%, notwithstanding a strong prior year comparative of 3.1%.
Both single cards and non-card products contributed to this like-for-like sales growth, with a particularly strong performance in non-card as a number of new ranges were introduced into store.
The relatively small, lower margin Christmas box cards segment continued to decline and this was particularly relevant in the second half of the year given the seasonal weighting of these sales.
As a consequence, there was a marginal mix shift to non-card, the full year mix being 57.9% single cards FY14: 59.1%, 39.9% non-card FY14: 38.5% and 2.2% Christmas Box Cards FY14: 2.4%.
Getting Personal revenues grew by 23.1% to 15.5m FY14: 12.6m.
Revenue growth was strong throughout the year, particularly in the second half, as a number of strategic initiatives bore fruit.
Whilst the growth prospects of this business remain strong, it has less of an established track record than the Card Factory store network.
The rate of growth can therefore be less consistent and the business will clearly be facing much tougher comparatives in the year ahead.
OPERATING COSTS Cost of sales and operating expenses continued to be well controlled and can be analysed as follows: FY15 FY14 Increase % of % of m revenue m revenue m % Cost of goods sold 110.3 31.2% 102.0 31.2% 8.3 8.2% Store wages 57.3 16.2% 52.9 16.2% 4.4 8.3% Store property costs 56.7 16.1% 53.7 16.4% 3.0 5.7% Other direct expenses 15.7 4.4% 14.7 4.5% 1.0 6.4% Cost of sales 240.0 67.9% 223.3 68.3% 16.7 7.5% Operating expenses 25.1 7.1% 23.2 7.1% 1.9 8.1% Excluding depreciation and amortisation.
16 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS The overall ratio of cost of sales to revenue improved marginally to 67.9% on an underlying basis FY14: 68.3% with the following movements in sub-categories: Cost of goods sold: principally comprises cost of raw materials, production costs, finished goods purchased from third-party suppliers, import duty, freight costs, carriage costs and warehouse wages.
The ratio of cost of goods sold to revenue remained consistent with the prior year, notwithstanding the slight mix shift to Getting Personal and non-card products in the Card Factory business.
Store wages: includes wages and salaries including bonuses for store based staff, together with National Insurance, pension contributions, overtime, holiday and sick pay.
This cost increased as new stores opened but remained consistent as a ratio of revenue.
Store property costs: consists principally of store rents net of rental incentives, business rates and service charges.
This cost also increased as new stores opened but reduced slightly as a ratio of revenue.
Many of the Groups existing stores remain on leases taken out before the recession when the property market was stronger and the Companys covenant was weaker.
The improvement in this cost ratio reflects changes to these factors for both new stores and breaks and expiries on existing leases.
There remains the potential for further cost savings in this area but these potential savings are not certain and will not necessarily be realised in a straight line trajectory.
Other direct expenses: includes store opening costs, store utility costs, waste disposal, store maintenance, point of sale costs, card charges and pay per click expenditure.
This cost category is largely variable in respect of existing stores and increases with new store openings.
The ratio of other direct expenses to revenue remained broadly consistent with the benefits of various business efficiency initiatives having offset cost pressures in other areas, in particular utility costs and card charges, the latter impacted by the increased use of payment cards by customers as the EPOS conversion project continued.
Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation include items such as head office remuneration, costs relating to regional and area managers, design studio costs and insurance together with other central overheads and administration costs.
The Group has invested heavily in central infrastructure and people in recent years to support the ongoing planned growth.
Total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to 25.1m FY14: 23.2m.
This cost line remained at 7.1% of revenue as economies of scale and business efficiencies offset additional recurring operating costs now being incurred following the Companys flotation in May 2014.
As this transaction occurred part way through FY15, in the coming financial year these recurring IPO related operating costs will annualise and increase this cost line as a full year charge is recognised and also as further LTIP awards are made, as the associated share based payment charge is amortised to the Income Statement over the three year vesting period.
We also propose to introduce a new SAYE share scheme for employees during the coming financial year.
Depreciation and amortisation increased from 7.5m to 8.8m reflecting significant one-off investments made in recent years, in particular, the expansion of the central distribution centre, the relocation and expansion of our printing division, Printcraft, and the initial phases of the EPOS rollout and conversion project.
UNDERLYING EBITDA AND OPERATING PROFIT The underlying EBITDA margin of the Group improved to 25.0% FY14: 24.6%.
Both of the Groups retail brands, Card Factory and Getting Personal, performed well, with the EBITDA margin of Getting Personal improving considerably as a result of improved marketing effectiveness and increasing economies of scale: Increase FY15 FY14 m m m % 1 Underlying EBITDA Card Factory 85.4 78.7 6.7 8.4% Getting Personal 2.8 1.7 1.1 67.6% Group 88.2 80.4 7.8 9.6% Underlying EBITDA margin Card Factory 25.3% 25.1% 0.2ppts Getting Personal 18.0% 13.2% 4.8ppts Group 25.0% 24.6% 0.4ppts 1.
As defined in note 5 to the financial statements on page 88.
The Groups underlying operating margin improved slightly to 22.5% FY14: 22.3%, despite the higher depreciation charge referred to above.
Excluding the incremental recurring operating costs associated with the IPO, underlying EBITDA and operating margins improved by 0.7ppts and 0.5ppts respectively.
As expected, whilst there is some seasonality in our business, the Group continued to deliver positive operating profit in each month of the year.
Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 17 Chief Financial Officers Review continued IPO AND SENIOR DEBT REFINANCING The IPO of the Company was completed with formal unconditional admission to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 20 May 2014 and a senior debt refinancing was completed on 30 May 2014.
Given the change in capital structure as a result of both of these events, a year-on-year comparison of financing costs, profit before tax and profit after tax is not meaningful.
Following the IPO and refinancing, proforma opening senior debt of approximately 160m consisted of 180m senior debt and approximately 20m of cash after all anticipated transaction costs.
The new debt facility of 200m also included a 20m revolving credit facility.
The fees and expenses of this debt refinancing which totalled 2.6m have been capitalised and will be amortised to the Income Statement over the five year term of the new senior debt facility in accordance with accounting standards.
Debt costs capitalised in relation to the previous senior debt facility of 7.7m were written off as a non-cash, non-underlying item at the same time.
The new senior term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to a margin ratchet dependent upon leverage levels with interest currently charged at 2.00% above LIBOR and 1.75% above LIBOR respectively.
A 100m LIBOR swap at 0.795% provides interest rate protection until 31 October 2015.
NET FINANCING COSTS Net financing costs in the period include approximately four months with the previous capital structure with higher levels of leverage, a significant proportion of accrued loan note interest and a higher weighted average interest cost.
Had the IPO and senior debt refinancing completed on 31 January 2014, the net financing costs expensed in the Income Statement in the year would have totalled approximately 5.4m including a non-cash charge of c0.5m of amortising debt costs, rather than the underlying net financing expense of 13.9m reported.
STATUTORY RESULTS As mentioned above, as a consequence of the IPO and refinancing completed during the period, statutory results differ materially from the underlying results and can be reconciled as follows: FY15 FY14 m m Underlying profit before tax 65.5 32.0 Losses on foreign exchange derivatives not designated as a hedge 0.1 1.9 IPO costs 3.8 Residual management equity share based payment 11.2 Refinanced debt issue cost amortisation 7.7 Statutory profit before tax 42.7 30.1 Further detail on the non-underlying reconciling items is set out in note 3 of the financial statements on page 87.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL Capital expenditure totalled 10.1m in the year of which 2.6m related to the EPOS rollout.
In the prior year, capital expenditure totalled 12.0m of which 5.3m related to one-off strategic projects, principally EPOS and the building of a fourth warehouse and a new Head Office.
The Board anticipates that, in the coming year, annual recurring capital expenditure will continue to run at approximately 8m per annum, similar to the recent historic level, with further budgeted expenditure of approximately 4m allocated for one-off strategic projects, the largest of which continues to be the ongoing EPOS conversion project.
There was a slight cash inflow of 1.1m from working capital movements in the year FY14: 0.6m.
STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION The Group remains highly cash generative.
As at 31 January 2015, net debt excluding debt issue costs of 2.2m had reduced to approximately 103.6m, analysed as follows: m Borrowings Current liabilities 14.5 Non-current liabilities 155.9 Total borrowings 170.4 Add debt costs capitalised 2.2 Gross debt 172.6 Less cash 69.0 Net debt 103.6 Net debt at the year end represented less than 1.2 times underlying EBITDA.
DIVIDENDS As stated at the time of the IPO, we expect to maintain a progressive dividend policy which reflects the Companys strong earnings potential and cash generative characteristics, while allowing us to retain sufficient capital to fund ongoing operating requirements and invest in the Companys long term growth plans.
For the year ending 31 January 2015, the Board is recommending a total dividend of 6.8p per share, giving a dividend cover of 2.5 times based on adjusted proforma earnings of 16.85p per share.
This dividend has been calculated as if the IPO and senior debt refinancing had completed on 31 January 2014.
This dividend comprises an interim dividend which the Directors are declaring of 2.3p per share together with a final dividend which the Directors are recommending of 4.5p per share.
The final dividend will, subject to shareholders approval at the Companys first Annual General Meeting on 27 May 2015, be paid alongside the interim dividend on 5 June to shareholders on the register on 1 May.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE As stated at the time of the IPO, the Board is focused on maintaining a capital structure that is conservative yet efficient in terms of providing long-term returns to shareholders.
The Board has considered further the capital structure of the Group and continues to recognise the benefits of financial leverage, whilst also wanting to ensure that the Company has sufficient flexibility to invest in the growth of the business.
Over the medium term, the Board expects to maintain leverage broadly in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 times net debt to underlying EBITDA.
Given that the business does see working capital swings through the cycle, at times the net debt position of the Company may fall outside the above range.
It should be noted that, at the year end, net debt is typically lower than the average for the previous 12 months given the particularly strong cash generation during the Christmas period.
To the extent there is surplus capital within the business, the Board expects to return that capital to shareholders.
The Board will consider the most appropriate method of returning such surplus cash from time to time, taking into account, amongst other things, views of shareholders and the liquidity of the shares.
