As at 31 January, the Allied business represented a disposal group held for sale and as such is reported as a discontinued operation in the Groups financial statements.
The continuing part of the segment, Saga Healthcare, constitutes the private pay elements of the business that remains, namely the Country Cousins and Patricia Whites brands and the Saga SOS Personal Alarms product offering.

The business generated revenue of 4.3m, which reduced by 0.4m 8.5% on the previous year 2014: 4.7m.
This flowed through to gross profit of 4.0m, which similarly reduced by 0.4m 9.1%, as this business has very low cost of sales since all of the Country Cousins and Patricia Whites carers are self-employed.
The business generated Trading EBITDA of 2.2m and operating profit of 2.0m, which both decreased by 0.5m, or 18.5% and 20.0% respectively.
Discontinued operations The Group has recognised a total loss after tax in respect of the discontinued Allied Healthcare operation of 220.2m, a significant increase on the loss in the previous year of 17.9m, analysed as follows: 12m to Jan 2014 12m to 12m to Jan 2015 Jan 2014 Reported Adjustment Loss profit for the year from discontinued operations after tax 0.3m 0.7m 0.3m 0.4m Amortisation of associated intangible assets 10.4m 14.9m 14.9m 0.0m 0.0m Impairment of associated intangible assets 0.0m 3.7m 3.7m Loss on re-measurement of disposal group to fair value 209.5m 0.0m 0.0m 0.0m Trading EBITDA 220.2m 17.9m 18.3m 0.4m The majority of this loss, 209.5m, has arisen on the re-measurement of the disposal groups assets and liabilities to fair value, with a further 10.4m of amortisation costs recognised in respect of intangible assets that form part of the disposal group, and a loss after tax from discontinued operations of 0.3m during the year.
The fair value re-measurement has placed a value on the business of nil.
This value has been determined by considering the current asset and liability position of the business, the future profit cash flows and the associated capital investment set out within managements five year plan for the business, the risk attaching to the various cash flows, and the costs of disposing of the business.
There are a range of ways of valuing the business and it is our expectation that an appropriate buyer will ultimately value the business higher than nil.
The Allied Healthcare business has continued to operate in a challenging market throughout the year and the revenue for the year of 283.2m was down 30.6m 9.8% on the previous year 2014: 313.8m.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue has improved by 0.9 percentage points year-on-year to29.4% driven by the branch efficiency programme, which is a good performance given the deflationary pressures on hourly rates for the provision of care services experienced throughout the market.

This has dropped through to a year-on-year increase in operating profit of 0.9m 17.0%, and takes operating profit to 6.2m.
