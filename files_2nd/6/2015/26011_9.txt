This was driven by a rise in net management fees to 300.8m 2014: 285.0m, as organic mutual fund flows and further strengthening first-half market appreciation resulted in average assets increasing by 7 per cent.
This was despite the loss of 7.6m of revenues of our liquidity and following the sale of private client contracts in 2014.

The Groups net management fee margin for the year was in line with last year at 88 basis points 2014: 88 basis points at a headline level.
This was distorted by the loss of lower margin assets, the closure of several sub-economic funds, and the sale of private client contracts and a segregated mandate loss in 2014.
Excluding these factors, the underlying progression was in line with management expectations and within our stated guidance.
We continue to expect net management fee margins to decline slowly over time, due to the continued expansion of both our international presence and the fixed income component of our AUM, although the introduction of the aggregated operating expense fee on the SICAVs will reduce the impact of the former.
Given the uncertainties inherent in these factors, the rate and angle of any such decline remains uncertain.
Further information on the revenue and cost impact of introducing the SICAV aggregated operating expense fee is contained later in the section.
Net initial charges of 14.1m 2014: 13.1m were ahead of the prior year, due to higher box profits resulting from increased crossing within unit trust share classes.
