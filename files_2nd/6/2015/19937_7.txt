Our Performance 35 Dividend In line with the dividend policy in place since 2012, the Board has recommended a final dividend of 11.125 pence per share to be paid on 20 May 2016 to shareholders on the register at 8 April 2016.
When added to the 2015 interim dividend of 5.15 pence per share paid on 25 September 2015, this represents a full year dividend of 16.275 pence per share.
It remains the Boards intention to deliver long-term dividend growth, provided this is supported by underlying earnings, cash flows, capital expenditure requirements and the prevailing market outlook.
Key Performance Indicators The following key performance indicators were set and have been reported against consistently since 2013.
Details of the indicators are provided on pages 40 and 41.
As with prior years, the way in which we measure our results is on an underlying basis, where we adjust to ensure appropriate comparability between periods, irrespective of currency fluctuations and any corporate activity.
This is done by: Restating the previous periods results at the same foreign exchange FX rates used in the current period Removing the results of disposed businesses in both the current and prior years Removing the results of businesses acquired in both the current year and prior years Therefore, for 2015 we have: Retranslated 2014 results at the FX rates used in calculating the 2015 results Removed the results of Sidermes, which was acquired in 2015 Removed the results of ECIL Met Tec and Process Metrix which were acquired in 2014 Objective: Deliver growth over the long term KPI: Research & Development spend We believe that our market-leading product technology and services deliver fundamental value to our customers and that the only way we can continue to deliver that value is to invest significantly in research and development.
In 2015 we spent 25.8m 2014: 26.1m on R&D activities, which represents 2.0% of our revenue 2014: 1.8%.
KPI: Underlying revenue growth Reported revenue for 2014 was 1,444m, which after FX translation effects of 37m and removing the impact of acquired businesses, was 1,404m on an underlying basis.
The reported revenue in 2015 of 1,322m, when adjusted for acquisitions made, was 1,296m which equates to an overall reduction of 7.7% year-on-year.
The reduction of 7.7% is made up of a 9.7% decline in underlying revenue in the Steel division and a more moderate 3.3% decline in the Foundry division.
This reflects the different end-markets of the two businesses and, to a lesser degree, the different regional components of each.

Group sales growth was also positive in North Asia, although this was due to Steel alone with Foundry recording a marginal decline.
NAFTA was the region with the largest decline 18% and was predominantly driven by Steel on the back of regional steel production weakness and the adverse impact of cheap imports on local production, made worse by the strengthening US dollar.
Europe too fared badly with a 7% drop in sales, again driven mainly by Steel and for the same macro reasons as NAFTA.
The reasons for the market decline and sales shortfalls in the short term are well understood and protectionist measures being put in place may improve the situation temporarily.
Beyond 2016, however, our strategy to continue to diversify geographically is how we aim to compensate for what is likely a longer-term trend of decline in more mature markets.
Objective: Deliver attractive profitability KPI: Trading profit and return on sales We continue to measure both the absolute trading profit of the Group as well as taking profit as a percentage of sales, which we refer to as the return on sales or RoS.
Trading profit of 124.0m was a decrease of 18.8m on 2014, which, on an underlying basis, is a decline of 14%.
RoS was 9.4% in 2015 which represents a return to 2013 levels of profitability, albeit in arguably more difficult trading circumstances.
RoS in 2014 was 10.1% on an underlying basis.
Similar to the sales results discussed above, the trading profit and RoS in the businesses show a reasonably broad range.
Steel recorded a RoS of 8.9% this year, a decline from the 9.8% in 2014.
Foundry on the other hand reported a 10.5% RoS, which was a hard fought improvement over the 10.0% reported in 2014.
Key to the margins enjoyed in both businesses was the reduction in operating expenses, largely as a result of restructuring programmes, launched throughout the year.
These are discussed in more detail below.
KPI: Headline PBT and EPS Headline profit before tax PBT and earnings per share EPS are used to measure the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The main difference between trading profit and PBT is net finance costs.
Net finance costs in 2015 of 15.4m were 1.0m below 2014.
Net finance costs include interest payable on our borrowings, part of which were renegotiated this year at more favourable rates, as well as interest on pension obligations and unwinding of provisions.
The key changes in 2015 were lower arrangement fees and lower interest on pension obligations.
Our Headline PBT was 108.6m, 15.0% behind last year.
Including amortisation and the exceptional restructuring charges of 14.6m, our PBT fell to 77.4m which was 30.4% less than 2014.
Headline EPS at 28.1p is 16.0% lower than 2014.

Free cash flow from continuing operations was 65.3m for the year, 10.3% ahead of 2014.
There are two key drivers of this: lower capital expenditure and high cash conversion of profits.
Capital expenditure was curtailed from the second quarter of 2015 as soon as the degree of market weakness became evident.
Our cash conversion in 2015 was 100.3%, an improvement over last year, due to a combination of working capital management and the decline in sales.
As sales reduce, so too do our debtors, and as long as stock levels are tightly managed, over time this generates cash.
We measure working capital both in terms of actual cash flow movements, and as a percentage of sales revenue.
Trade working capital as a percentage of sales in 2015 was 26.3% 2014: 24.8%, measured on a 12-month moving average basis.
Absolute values of working capital reduced, but not to the same extent as the contraction in sales.
A significant contributor to that was difficulty in getting prompt payment from some bigger customers at year-end.
KPI: Return on net assets RONA RONA is our principal measure of capital efficiency.
We do not exclude the results of businesses acquired and disposed from this calculation as capital efficiency is an important consideration in our portfolio decisions.
It is calculated by dividing trading profit plus our share of profits from joint ventures by our average operating assets property, plant and equipment, and trade working capital.
As with most of our KPIs, we measure this on a 12-month moving average basis at constant currency to ensure we focus on sustainable underlying improvements.
Our RONA for 2015 was 21.1% 2014: 25.5%, driven by a greater decline in profits than the decrease in asset base.
Objective: Maintain a strong financial position KPI: Interest cover and net debt As at 31 December 2015, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 532.4m 2014: 647.4m, of which 181.1m were undrawn 2014: 343.5m.
The changes reflect a successful replacement of the previous 425m multi-currency revolving credit facility, which was due to expire in April 2016, with a new multi-currency credit facility of 300m repayable in June 2020.
Under the arrangements of the new revolving credit facility taken out in June 2015 the Group has the option until the end of 2016 to increase the amount of committed funds by up to 200m either from the existing bank group or by introducing additional banks on the same lending terms.
This provides us with sufficient debt capacity for the short term.
Net debt as at 31 December 2015 was 291.6m, a 23.3m increase over 2014.
The main driver of the increase was the acquisition of Sidermes during the year.

These ratios are monitored regularly to ensure the Group has sufficient financing available to run the business and fund future growth.
At the end of 2015, the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8x, an increase on the prior years 1.5x and EBITDA to interest was 11.7x, versus the 13.1x last year.
Although more geared than 2014, the Group remains well within its covenants.
Further information on our finance costs can be found in note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 125.
Financial Risk Factors The Group undertakes regular risk reviews and at a minimum a full risk assessment process twice a year.
In 2015 this included input from the Board in both the assessment of risk and the proposed mitigation.
Having recently completed the assessment and as referred to in the Viability section on page 25, we continue to consider the main financial risks faced by the Group as being end-market demand volatility and foreign exchange.
Important but lesser risk exists also in interest rate movements and cost inflation but neither is expected to have a material impact on the business after considering the controls we have in place.
The financial risks we associate with end-market demand volatility include: reduced revenue: potential customer failures: and declines in general market demand.
As discussed in the introduction above, and elsewhere in this report, our key mitigation of end-market demand volatility is to manage the Groups exposure through balancing our portfolio of business geographically and by end-market.
We do so through targeted capital investment in new and growing businesses and a combination of capital and human resource in emerging markets.
The second main financial risk is foreign exchange, which is inherent in the international business we have.
We operate in many countries, the results of which are recorded in local currency and then translated into sterling.
As sterling strengthens against the local currency, so the reported Group results for that country will reduce.
The stronger pound resulted in reported sales being 42m lower in 2015.
Where possible we align the cost structure with revenue as best we can in order to mitigate foreign exchange exposure.
Other Relevant Financial Information Restructuring As noted previously, we undertook a broad range of restructuring programmes during the year in response to the significant declines in the majority of our end-markets.
Unlike last year, where the amount and extent of restructuring charges were immaterial, this years programmes covered all Business Units and involved a material number of redundancies across the Group.
Costs incurred were predominantly on redundancy and outplacement and largely paid by December.
We are carrying a restructuring provision forward into 2016 of 6.5m along with a historic onerous lease provision of 3.3m.
Our Performance 39 Net dened benefit pension deficit m -30.9% 35.3m 2015 35.3 2014 51.1 2013 47.9 Taxation The Groups effective tax rate, based on the income tax costs associated with headline performance of 27.7m 2014: 32.9m, was 25.5% in 2015 2014: 26.0% The income tax credit on separately reported items of 2.9m 2014: 25.8m comprises non-cash deferred tax movements relating to the amortisation of a deferred tax liability arising from the 2008 acquisition of Foseco plc 4.7m: 2014: 4.0m and tax credits relating to restructuring charges 1.5m: 2014: nil and a reduction in the deferred tax asset previously recognised in respect of US tax losses and certain other temporary differences 3.3m: 2014: 21.8m credit.
The net income tax credit recognised directly in the Group statement of comprehensive income of 1.6m 2014: 0.5m comprises 0.9m 2014: 0.5m in respect of deferred tax on pension obligations and 0.7m 2014: nil in respect of exchange differences.
Capital expenditure Capital expenditure in 2015 of 35.0m 2014: 53.5m comprised 24.4m in the Steel division 2014: 28.6m and 10.6m in the Foundry division 2014: 24.9m.
The reduction in 2015 was in recognition of weaker end-markets and in order to preserve cash as profits reduced.
Capital expenditure on revenue generating customer installation assets has been maintained at 6.2m 2014: 6.2m.
Pensions The Group has a limited number of historical defined benefit plans mainly in the UK, US, Germany and Belgium.
The main plans in the UK and US are largely closed to further benefit accruals and 57% of the liabilities in the UK have already been insured.
The total net deficit attributed to these defined benefit obligations at the end of December 2015 was 35.3m 2014: 51.1m, representing an improvement of 15.8m.
This is mainly due to: an increase of 9.0m in the surplus of the UK defined benefit plan due to decreasing long-term inflation expectations and more deferred pensioners transferring out of the defined benefit scheme: the additional voluntary contributions of 3.7m into the UK and US plan: and the completion of a triennial valuation of the defined benefit obligations in Belgium confirmed 3.0m of experience gains attributed to benefits paid out over the last three years.
The higher discount rates assumed for all the plans led to a lower defined benefit liability valuation of 25.0m, but this was offset by a 25.2m reduction in the value of the pension plans asset values, mainly in the UK and USA.
The majority of the ongoing pension plans are defined contribution plans, where our only obligation is to make contributions, with no further commitments on the level of post-retirement benefits.
During 2015 10.7m 2014: 9.2m of contributions were made into the plans and charged to trading profit.
Corporate activity In the first half of the year we acquired Sidermes in Italy for 23.8m, as a continuation of our strategy to build our technical services business.
We continue to focus on acquisitions to reinforce our growth opportunities whilst maintaining a balance in the portfolio of the Group.
