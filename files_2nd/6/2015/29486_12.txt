03183415 Strategic Report St. James's Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 21 The Board starts by considering the underlying cash result, which most clearly reflects the impact of the primary drivers of the business being FUM and expenses as described in Sections 1 and 2.
This is derived from the underlying profit measure, principally by adjusting for differences between deferred and current tax, share option costs and some solvency reserve impacts.
Other cash flows are taken into account in the Cash result, not least tax settlement timing variances and changes in solvency reserving requirements.
Allowance is also made for the cost of the back-office infrastructure development.
These two measures are presented with a breakdown explaining the sources of profit based on the key drivers of the business, with the aim of assisting investors to understand the development of profits.
The Board also believes it is useful to understand the contribution to profits from just the in-force business as this reflects the value being generated by the existing business, and so the breakdown identifies the new business impact and makes clear the ongoing contribution from the established business.
Neither the cash result nor the underlying cash result should be confused with the IFRS cash flow statement which is prepared in accordance with IAS 7 and disclosed on page 118.
Finally, we also present an embedded value result.
Management believes this approach is particularly useful for investors seeking to assess the full value of the long-term emergence of shareholder cash returns, since it includes an asset in the valuation reflecting the net present value of the expected future cash flows from the business.
This type of presentation is also commonly referred to as a discounted cash flow valuation.
Our embedded value is based on the EEV principles, which were set out as an industry standard by the Chief Financial Officers CFO Forum in 2004.
Many of the future cash flows derive from fund charges, which change with movements in stock markets.
Since the impact of these changes is unrelated to the performance of the business, management believes that the EEV operating profit reflecting the EEV profit before tax, adjusted to reflect only the expected investment performance and no change in economic basis provides the most useful measure of performance in the year.
We have provided an analysis of the FUM development in Section 1 and Expenses in Section 2.
Section 3 provides a commentary on the performance of the business on the IFRS basis whilst Sections 4 and 5 provide further detail on the Cash and EEV results.
Finally, Section 6 covers the Solvency and Capital Management.

This is followed by information about the income the Group earns from managing these funds, together with the profile of these earnings, and finally a geographical and segmental analysis of the funds under management.
Movement in Funds Under Management During 2015 we have seen gross new funds of 9.24 billion, growth of 17% and a net inflow of funds under management of 5.78 billion 2014: 5.09 billion, growth of 14%.
Investment return has also been positive although not as strong as in the prior year.
Nevertheless, given the strong net inflow, and the positive investment performance, funds under management increased to 58.61 billion.
Analysis of the development of the funds under management is provided in the following tables: Year Ended 31 December 2015 Note Investment Pension UT ISA Total Billion Billion Billion Billion Opening funds under management 21.14 18.08 12.79 52.01 Gross inflows 2.45 3.66 3.13 9.24 Net investment return 0.19 0.38 0.25 0.82 Regular income withdrawals and maturities 1 0.48 0.62 1.10 Surrenders and part surrenders 2 0.78 0.64 0.94 2.36 Closing funds under management 22.52 20.86 15.23 58.61 Net inflows 1.19 2.40 2.19 5.78 Implied surrender rate as a percentage of average funds under management 3.6% 3.3% 6.7% 4.3% In addition, there is a further 430 million of funds under management in third party funds within our Asia business.
Year Ended 31 December 2014 Note Investment Pension UT ISA Total Billion Billion Billion Billion Opening funds under management 18.74 15.36 10.20 44.30 Gross inflows 2.70 2.43 2.75 7.88 Net investment return 0.87 1.17 0.58 2.62 Regular income withdrawals and maturities 1 0.43 0.42 0.85 Surrenders and part surrenders 2 0.74 0.46 0.74 1.94 Closing funds under management 21.14 18.08 12.79 52.01 Net inflows 1.53 1.55 2.01 5.09 Implied surrender rate as a percentage of average funds under management 3.7% 2.8% 6.4% 4.0% In addition, there was a further 449 million of funds under management in third party funds within our Asia business.
Regular income withdrawals are those amounts selected by clients which are paid out by way of periodic income.
The withdrawals have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Maturities are those sums paid out where the plan has reached the selected maturity date e. g. retirement date.
The expected maturities have been assumed in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit.
Surrenders and part surrenders are those amounts where clients have chosen to withdraw money from their plan.
Surrenders are assumed to occur in the calculation of the embedded value new business profit based on actual experience, updated on an annual basis, by plan duration and the age of the client.
The implied surrender rate shown in the table above is very much a simple average and reflects only recent experience.
Whilst it could be compared with the long-term assumptions underlying the calculation of the embedded value, it should not be assumed that small movements in this rate will result in a change to the long term embedded value assumptions.
Fees on Funds Under Management As noted at the start of this Financial Review, our financial model is to attract and retain retail funds under management FUM on which we receive an annual management fee.
03183415 Strategic Report St. James's Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 23 The net annual management fee retained by the Group is c. 0.77% post tax.
However, due to our product structure, investment and pension business does not generate net cash in the first six years.
Consequently, the level of income we are receiving today is not fully representative of the expected earnings from the funds we are managing, and these earnings will increase as a result of the new business from six years ago becoming cash generative.
This deferral of cash generation means there is always six years worth of business in the gestation period.
Our product structure involves an early withdrawal charge that reduces to zero over the first six years of the life of the policy.
This allows us to establish an opening liability net of the outstanding withdrawal charge that would apply if the policy were to be encashed.
As the withdrawal charge reduces to zero over the first six years of the policy, so the liability to the policyholder is enhanced by increasing their funds by 1% per annum.
In other words, there is a cost which offsets the annual management fee above.
This is known as the unwind of the withdrawal charge.
As a result this business does not make a meaningful contribution to the cash result until year seven.
The table below provides an estimated current value of the funds under management where the early withdrawal charge applies.
Year Total Billion 2010 2.0 2011 2.4 2012 2.7 2013 3.7 2014 3.9 2015 4.5 Total 19.2 These funds under management are not yet generating income within the cash result but will do so once the six year early withdrawal charge is fully unwound.
This 19.2 billion represents approximately a third of the total funds under management which, if all the business reached the end of the early withdrawal charge period, would contribute an additional 147.7 million to the annual post-tax cash result.
Although, as noted above, a proportion of the new client funds do not generate a meaningful net income to the Group within the first six years, the Group does incur costs associated with attracting these new funds and therefore the Directors believe it is useful to provide details of the economic return we expect will be generated from the new business.
In other words, the business case for the investment in attracting new clients and funds under management.
As detailed later in this review on page 29, a net cost of 84.2 million 2014: 62.7 million has been incurred to attract the 9.24 billion of gross new funds 2014: 7.88 billion.
The increase in this net cost has been impacted by a significant increase in the FSCS levy.
We regard this as an investment in new business which we expect to generate income in the future significantly exceeding this cost and therefore provide positive returns for shareholders.
The table below provides details of the new business added during the reporting periods and different measures of valuing the investment: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 Gross inflows Billion 9.24 7.88 Post-tax investment in new business Million 84.2 62.7 Post-tax present value of expected profit from investment Million 358.9 298.4 Cost of new business % of new money invested 0.9% 0.8% New business margin % of new money invested 4.8% 4.7% Cash payback period years 5 4 Internal rate of return net of tax 22.1% 26.1% The investment as a percentage of net inflow of funds under management was 1.5% compared with 1.2% for 2014.

These costs are met from corresponding policy margins and any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not directly impact the profitability of the Group.
Other performance related costs, for both Partners and employees, vary with the level of new business and operating profit performance of the business.
Establishment costs are the running costs of the Groups infrastructure and are relatively fixed in nature in the short term, although they are subject to inflationary increases.
These costs will increase as the infrastructure expands to manage the higher number of clients, the growing number of advisers and increasing business volumes.
The growth in establishment expenses during the year was higher than our original expectations as a consequence of an increase in expenditure associated with the high level of adviser recruitment in the year together with the costs relating to the higher business volumes.
During 2016 we will be expanding our presence in London with a new office opening in Canary Wharf as well as taking additional space in our existing London locations.
Reflecting this additional expenditure, we expect establishment expenses in 2016 to increase by c. 11% 8.5% before these additional property costs.

The Academy continues to be an important strategic investment for the future.
The additional expenditure during 2015 reflected both the increased number of Academy participants, together with the expansion of the programme to Manchester and Solihull.
2016 spend will increase further to an expected 7.5 million, reflecting continued Academy intakes in London, additional intakes in Manchester and Solihull, plus our first Academy intake in Edinburgh.
Other development costs represent the expenditure associated with the on-going development in our investment proposition, corporate initiatives, technology improvements and other system developments.
These costs amounted to 21.1 million for the year 2014: 15.6 million.
Included within these costs is 1.6 million in relation to due diligence and transaction costs of our acquisition of Rowan Dartington.
We will continue to invest in the business and anticipate development spend in 2016 to be in line with the previous year.
The costs of the back office investment programme and related costs were 18.1 million 2014: 11.9 million.
The change programme has continued to progress well during 2015, albeit the project is running behind and costing more than our original plan.
During the final quarter of last year we undertook full migration of the unit trust and ISA business onto the new system.
This was a significant milestone for the project and we will start to see the benefits accrue in 2016 within the EEV result an assumption change has been made to reflect the lower charges which now apply to the existing business.
Having successfully completed this phase of the project, during 2016 we will launch a new retirement account and plan the migration of the existing pension and drawdown business, once the pensions landscape is clear.
As we continue to develop the system and migrate the existing business we will incur further investment expenditure and anticipate costs for 2016 of a similar amount to 2015.
The regulatory costs represent the fees payable to the regulatory bodies of 7.5 million 2014: 6.1 million : we expect 2016 costs to increase to some 8.5 million.
This represents our required contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of 20.1 million 2014: 5.9 million.
The key driver of this increase relates to our share of compensation claims made by the FSCS in relation to external failures within the life and pension intermediary regulatory category.
Whilst we are anticipating a further elevated levy in 2016 our current estimate is for a levy of c. 16.0 million, we expect a more normalised level in future years.

These combine to explain the Underlying cash result on which the Underlying profit and the IFRS result develop.
The following table starts with the Underlying cash result detailed in Section 4 on page 29 and provides a reconciliation to the Underlying profit result and the IFRS result.
The results are reported after tax and also before shareholder tax.
In arriving at the profit before shareholder tax which is effectively after policyholder tax, it is necessary to estimate the analysis of the total tax charge between that payable in respect of policyholders and that payable by shareholders.
Shareholder tax is assessed based on the effective rate of tax that is applicable to the shareholders, with the balance being treated as tax in respect of policyholders.
Further detail is provided on page 28 of this review and in Note 8 on page 135.

Therefore, as well as the income generated on the funds under management, there is a profit or loss from the distribution activity.

The Cash result and Underlying cash result are the principal measures the Board considers when determining the dividend payment to shareholders.
The Board starts by considering the Underlying cash result, which most clearly reflects the impact of the primary drivers of the business being FUM and expenses as described in Sections 1 and 2.
This is derived from the Underlying profit measure, principally by adjusting for differences between deferred and current tax, share option costs and some solvency reserve impacts.
Other cash flows are also taken into account in the Cash result, not least tax settlement timing variances and changes in solvency reserving requirements.
Allowance is also made for the cost of the back office development.
In considering the dividend the Directors will take into account the impact of the Cash result on the overall capital position of the Group.
The Cash result and Underlying cash result, which are presented after tax, are a combination of the cash emerging from the business in force at the start of the year less the investment made to acquire new business during the year.
The tables and commentary below provide an indicative analysis of the cash result into these two elements.

The net annual management fee: This is the manufacturing margin the Group retains from funds under management after payment of the associated costs e. g. investment advisory fees and Partner remuneration.
Broadly speaking the Group retains an average rate of 0.77% post tax of funds under management 2014: 0.77% post tax.
The level of net annual management fee was some 18% higher than last year, reflecting the higher average funds under management in 2015.
Further analysis of the FUM generating the net annual management fee, and the outlook, is presented in Section 1 on page 22.
Unwind of early withdrawal charge: This relates to the reserving methodology applied to the early withdrawal charge within the structure of single premium life and pension business.
At the outset of the product we establish a liability net of the outstanding withdrawal charge which would apply if the policy were to be encashed.
As the withdrawal charge reduces by 1% per annum to zero over the first six years the gestation period, the liability to the policyholder increases.
This cost is known as the unwind of early withdrawal charge.
In practice it offsets the annual management fee above.
Like the net annual management fee, the unwind of the withdrawal charge has increased due to growth in funds under management.
However, the movement is also impacted by the fact that the funds under management added six years ago have completed the withdrawal charge period.
Further commentary on the unwind of the withdrawal charge, together with information on the FUM still in the gestation period, is presented in Section 1 on page 23.
Margin arising from new business: This is the cash impact of new business in the year, reflecting growth in new business and production related expenses.
Establishment expenses: These are the expenses of running the Groups infrastructure.
Further analysis is presented in Section 2 on page 24.
Development expenses: These represent the expenditure on Group developments.
Further analysis is presented in Section 2 on page 25.
Regulatory fees: This reflects the fees payable to the Regulatory bodies.
FSCS levy: This reflects the full year levy.
Shareholder interest: This is the assumed income accruing on the investments and cash held for regulatory purposes together with the interest received on the surplus capital held by the Group.
Tax relief of capital losses: In recent years, a deferred tax asset has been established for historic capital losses which are now regarded as being capable of utilisation over the medium term.
During the year 12.1 million tax value of these losses has been utilised 2014: 16.7 million benefiting the cash result by the same amount.
In both years the actual tax losses utilised exceeded the expected 8-10 million benefit in a year.
Since the tax losses have been recognised immediately through a deferred tax asset in the IFRS result, utilisation of tax losses in the cash result is offset in the IFRS results because of the reduction in the deferred tax asset.
Miscellaneous: This represents the cash flow of the business not covered in any of the other categories, including tax relief arising from deferred recognition of insurance business acquisition expenses due to structural timing differences in the life company tax computation.
Back office infrastructure: These costs relate to a major project which has combined our back offices under one management team and put in place one unified, client centric administration system, enabling them to deliver improved service and improved efficiency for the business.
Variance: This reflects variances in the cash result in a year due to the impact of actual experience including economic assumptions changes and investment performance on insurance reserves, as well as variances in the settlement of tax related liabilities between the policyholders unit-linked funds, the shareholder and HMRC.
In both years the variances arise mainly from policyholdertax charge effects.
Cash Balance Sheet In addition to presenting an IFRS balance sheet on page 117 and an EEV balance sheet on page 188, we believe it is beneficial to provide a balance sheet using the approach underlying our cash result.
This is because the cash result is adjusted for non-cash items such as DAC, DIR and deferred tax as well as removing the policyholder interest in the unit-linked funds.
The following table analyses the differences between the IFRS balance sheet and the Cash result balance sheet.
These adjustments include netting out assets and liabilities of the policyholder interest in unit-linked funds Adjustment 1, and removal of a number of significant non-cash items Adjustment 2 in particular DAC, DIR and deferred tax.

Going forward, the Solvency I regulations no longer apply and therefore we will change the Cash result and the Cash result balance sheet that we present to reflect the equivalent movement in net assets under the new Solvency II regulations see also page 35.

Distribution business 21.2 10.9 Back office infrastructure The unwind of the discount rate for the year was 172.4 development 18.1 11.9 million 2014: 182.0 million.
The unwind is calculated by Other 41.9 25.5 multiplying the opening VIF by the discount rate but adjusting to EEV operating profit 660.2 596.4 reflect emergence of profits into cash during the year.
The lower Investment return variance 24.4 80.2 result in the current year principally reflects the lower opening discount rate, as the opening VIF balance was higher.
Economic assumption changes 0.9 7.0 EEV profit before tax 636.7 669.6 The discount rate is based on the risk free rate, which is set by Tax 116.5 132.6 reference to the yield on a UK 10 year gilt at the start of the year.
Corporation tax change 47.8 As a result, the unwind for the current year is based on a discount rate of 5.0% compared with 6.2% for the prior year.
EEV profit after tax 568.0 537.0 Had the current year discount rate been consistent with 2014 then the unwind and operating profit would have been 41.4 million higher.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 There was a very strong positive experience variance during the Pence Pence year of 78.1 million, which follows a similarly strong positive EEV operating profit basic variance of 78.5 million in the prior year.
As covered on page earnings per share 103.9 93.1 28, further capital losses were identified within historic Group companies, and the net present value of the future benefit is EEV operating profit diluted recognised in the EEV as a positive 63.1 million experience earnings per share 102.8 91.5 variance.
The balance of the experience variance reflects continuing strong retention and other miscellaneous items.
03183415 Strategic Report St. James's Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information 33 There was a large positive operating assumption change in the year of 44.1 million 2014: 3.0 million.
The major contributors to this result are changes to the pension retention assumption and the maintenance expense assumption, as follows: 1.
Pension retention assumption For a number of years, retention of pension funds under management has been better than the EEV operating assumption.
Following the 2015 annual actuarial investigation, the assumption has been amended to better reflect experience.
The maximum term has also been extended, reflecting the potential for continuation of the business beyond the client age of 75.
Maintenance expense assumption During 2015 the contract with our third party back office administrator was updated to reflect administration charges for business administered on the new Bluedoor administration platform.
This resulted in a change in the maintenance expense operating assumption.
However, it will take some time for the remaining business to be migrated to the new system, and so the valuation also reflects the expected costs of both the future systems development and migration of the remaining existing business.
The operating assumption change therefore reflects the full cost of the change in tariff on existing business, but we also expect savings will arise on new business costs.
These are not reflected in the embedded value and will emerge within the future new business contribution.
The investment income for the year was lower at 6.1 million 2014: 8.1 million, reflecting the lower risk free interest rate.
Distribution Business, Back Office Development and Other These items have already been commented on in the IFRS section on page 27.
Investment Return Variance The investment return variance reflects the capitalised impact on the future annual management fees resulting from the difference between the actual and assumed investment returns.
Given the size of our funds under management, a small difference can result in a large positive or negative variance.
The fall in global stock markets during the second half of 2015 has impacted the investment return on our funds.
However, in comparison to the falls experienced in world stock markets for example the FTSE 100 fell 4.9%, the investment returns on our funds were only slightly lower than allowed for in the calculation of the embedded value.
Consequently there was a small negative investment return variance of 24.4 million for the year 2014: positive 80.2 million reflecting the strong market growth in that year.
Economic Assumption Changes There was a small positive variance of 0.9 million arising from changes in the economic basis adopted at the year-end 2014: 7.0 million negative.
EEV Profit before Tax The total profit before tax for the year was 636.7 million, compared with 669.6 million, although the comparison is obscured by the different investment market experience and consequential investment return variance in the two years.
Tax The tax charge at 116.5 million 2014: 132.6 million reflects the underlying result.
A further two reductions in the corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% in April 2017 followed by a further cut to 18% in April 2020 were announced in the 2015 Summer budget and included in the Finance No2 Act 2015.
The capitalised effect of these changes has been included as a reduction in tax of 47.8 million.
EEV Profit after Tax The EEV profit after tax was 568.0 million 2014: 537.0 million reflecting the movement in EEV profit before tax, but also the positive impact of the tax rate change.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 34 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED New Business Margin The largest single element of the EEV operating profit analysed in the previous section is the new business contribution.
The level of new business contribution generally moves in line with new business levels.
To demonstrate this link, and aid understanding of the results, we provide additional analysis of the new business margin Margin.
This is calculated as the new business contribution divided by the new money invested, and is expressed as a percentage.
The table below presents the margin before tax from our manufactured business based on gross fund flows: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2015 2014 Life business Investment business New business contribution Million 124.9 146.2 New money invested Million 2,447.0 2,702.0 Margin % 5.1 5.4 Pension business New business contribution Million 140.6 87.5 New money invested Million 3,660.9 2,428.5 Margin % 3.8 3.6 Unit Trust business New business contribution Million 175.2 139.4 New money invested Million 3,129.9 2,750.7 Margin % 5.6 5.1 Total business New business contribution Million 440.7 373.1 New money invested Million 9,237.8 7,881.2 Margin % 4.8 4.7 Post tax margin % 3.9 3.8 Overall the margin has increased to 4.8% 2014: 4.7%.
The changes in margin in the different business lines result from different drivers.
The reduction in Investment business margin reflects particular features of the business written in the year.
The increase in margin on Pension business reflects the change in retention assumptions.
The increase in margin on Unit Trust business reflects revised allocation of expenses as a result of migration of the business to the new administration system.
The benefit of lower expenses associated with the new administration contract will reflect in the 2016 results, as an increase in the new business margin for all business in future years.

As a consequence, this year we are reporting for the last time on the familiar Solvency I basis, and we are introducing new reporting on the Solvency II basis.
Solvency I We have already presented the Cash result net assets of 642.5 million 2014: 603.1 million in the table on page 31.
The Solvency I net assets at 609.0 million 2014: 572.0 million is some 33.5 million lower, principally due to an amount of additional prudential reserves over that required by the UK regulator arising from the Irish solvency regulations.
The table below provides an analysis of the Solvency I position between regulated and non-regulated entities, together with an assessment against both the required minimum regulatory capital and the internal capital requirement set by the Board referred to as the Management solvency buffer.
Other Life Regulated Other Total Million Million Million Million Solvency I net assets 338.5 98.1 172.4 609.0 Intra-group proposed dividends 140.0 140.0 Proposed final 2015 dividend 90.5 90.5 Solvency I net assets after dividends 198.5 98.1 221.9 518.5 Required minimum regulatory capital 52.1 26.2 Solvency ratio 381% 374% Management solvency buffer 164.3 52.3 Management solvency ratio 121% 188% Comparison with previous valuations will show that the Group solvency position remains resilient, reflecting the Groups low appetite for market, credit and liquidity risk in relation to solvency.
The Insurance Groups Directive IGD assessment is calculated by considering the level of net assets in the Group outside of the insurance companies that could be available to support the solvency of the insurance company and other regulated companies.
It therefore represents additional solvency cover over the 198.5 million Life company solvency assets identified in the table above.
At 31 December 2015 the IGD resources were estimated at 250 million 2014: 266 million.
Solvency II The underlying driver of the new Solvency II regulation is to focus attention on risk management.
We therefore introduce our Solvency II results by reprising some key themes underpinning risk management in our business.
St. Jamess Place is a simple Wealth Management Group in contrast with the many complex insurance groups that are also impacted by Solvency II, offering mainly investment products.
Our strategy is to attract and administer retail funds under management, from which we receive an annual management fee we are a fee-based business.
Our clients can access their investments on demand but, because we match the surrender value, movements in equity markets, interest rates, mortality, morbidity, longevity and currency rates have little impact on our ability to meet liabilities although they can affect emergence of profit.
We also have a prudent capital management approach and invest surplus assets in cash, AAA rated money-market funds and UK government securities.
The overall effect has been a resilient solvency position and ability to meet liabilities, even through adverse market conditions.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 36 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Solvency II continued The new regulation introduces extensive new valuation and reporting requirements.
However, our approach to managing the business is unchanged: we will continue to match the surrender value on unit-linked business, thereby mitigating both market and persistency risk, and ensuring that we will always be able to meet our liability to clients.
Nevertheless, the new regulation does introduce changes to the way we report on solvency.
Firstly, the net assets will be presented on a Solvency II basis and we have provided a reconciliation to the Solvency I basis in Note 1 below.
Secondly, we are required to recognise a new asset in respect of the expected Value of In-Force cashflows VIF, together with a new Risk Margin RM an amount reflecting the cost to secure the transfer of the business to a third party, if required.
Together the Solvency II net assets, VIF and RM will comprise the Own Funds equal to the difference between the Gross Assets and the Technical Provisions.
Finally, we calculate a Solvency Capital Requirement SCR which reflects the capital required to protect against a range of 1 in 200 stresses.
Given our simple business we have been able to adopt the Standard Formula approach in calculating the SCR, and we have not needed or chosen to adopt any of the Transitional Provisions in the calculation of the technical provisions or SCR.

The value of in-force represents the expected future emergence of profit, calculated as prescribed by the Solvency II regulations.
Specific requirements in the Solvency II regulation give rise to differences with the VIF presented in the EEV result on pages 32 to 35 and therefore, to aid understanding, the table below provides a reconciliation between the two numbers.
Note, Solvency II only applies to the life business and so the unit trust business VIF is not reflected in the Solvency II own funds assessment.
Other Life Regulated Other Total Million Million Million Million EEV VIF Section 5 page 34 2,471.6 787.6 3,259.2 Remove UT ISA VIF 787.6 787.6 Change in contract boundaries 111.8 111.8 Discounted deferred tax asset 123.8 123.8 Add back EEV risk margin 147.8 147.8 Economic basis differences 31.1 31.1 Adjustment for Solvency I reserves and other items 46.1 46.1 Solvency II VIF 2,306.6 2,306.6 The principal differences between the two methods of calculating VIF are: - The Solvency II approach has not been extended to our Unit Trust and ISA business meaning the significant additional VIF on this business is not reflected.
- The Solvency II methodology requires a very prudent assumption about the contract boundary for regular premium business, resulting in the potential value from all future investment premiums being discounted.
- Under EEV a discounted deferred tax asset is assessed in the VIF.
Under the Solvency II approach the undiscounted deferred tax asset calculated in line with the IFRS 12 is assessed in the net assets.
- Under our EEV approach we make allowance for non-hedgeable risk through including an explicit margin in the risk discount rate of 0.73% see page 190.
The equivalent requirement in Solvency II is achieved through ensuring assumptions are best estimate of outcomes.
The explicit addition therefore falls away in Solvency II.
The remaining difference in the VIF balance is made up of a number of smaller points including the removal of Solvency I reserves and the use of a slightly different economic basis.
The assessment of the Risk Margin is a specific new adjustment for Solvency II.
The solvency capital requirement has been calculated using the prescribed rules for the standard formula approach.
We have not used an internal model.
Solvency Ratios and Sensitivities In comparing the Solvency I and Solvency II positions it will be noted that the level of own funds is higher under Solvency II, however the Solvency Capital Requirement is also higher.
As the following table demonstrates, the increase in the SCR leads to a much lower value for the solvency ratio, despite the higher level of free assets.
This is a general feature of Solvency II and the change to lower solvency ratios will be common across the industry.
ST. JAMESS PLACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 38 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Solvency Ratios and Sensitivities continued Solvency I Solvency II Million Million Net assets before final dividend 609.0 812.9 Final proposed dividend 90.5 90.5 Net assets after final dividend 518.5 722.4 Value of in-force VIF 2,306.6 Risk margin 624.0 Own funds A 518.5 2,405.0 Solvency capital requirement B 78.3 1,595.8 Free assets 440.2 809.2 Solvency ratio A B 662% 151% The solvency ratios before taking account of the final dividend are 778% under Solvency I and 156% under Solvency II.
The nature of our business is that much of the Own Funds value reflects future profits, but the SCR similarly reflects loss of future profits.
As a result, the solvency ratio can move counter-intuitively with changes in experience, as the following sensitivities demonstrate: Solvency II Solvency Free Assets Ratio Million % Original valuation 809.2 151% 10% reduction in FUM 753.6 153% 10% increase in lapse assumption 832.0 156% 10% increase in renewal expense assumption 777.2 149% Introducing the Management Solvency Buffer MSB As a result of the counter-intuitive nature of the sensitivities above, we believe a solvency ratio is not an appropriate metric on which to assess the strength of our business and instead we intend to use as our metric, the level of assets in excess of client unit-linked liabilities.
This will ensure we are able to meet client liabilities at all times, and we also intend to hold a prudent MSB as protection against other risks.
We have assessed the MSB for our Life business as 150 million, having taking into account a wide range of factors and information, not least the results from stress and scenario testing carried out as part of our annual ORSA Own Risk and Solvency Assessment.
We will also continue to hold capital within the Group in respect of the other regulated but non-insurance companies, typically based on 200% of the sectoral requirement.

However, we do expect it will be utilised over the next ten years, albeit the actual rate of utilisation will depend on business growth and external factors, particularly investment market conditions.
More generally, our intention is that assets backing the MSB should be liquid and of high credit quality.

As noted previously, future growth in cashflow is driven by new business, but in the short term growth will reflect the transition as new business from six years ago becomes cash generative.
A further source of liquidity is share option proceeds.
At 31 December 2015, there were 2.3 million share options outstanding under the various share option schemes which, if exercised, would provide up to 11.0 million 2014: 15.4 million of future capital and liquidity for the Company.
Finally, as noted at the half-year, the Group has refinanced and extended our borrowing arrangements, providing funding for the acquisition of Rowan Dartington and committed facilities for the future should they be required.
The key calls on liquidity will be payment of the Group dividend and investment to support the business.
As noted previously, our policy is to increase the dividend in line with the underlying performance of the business.
We believe this will also enable us to continue to invest in the business to support our growth aspirations.
