Wolseley plc 34 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Overview Strategic report Governance Financials Shareholder information Other financial risks The nature of the Groups business exposes it to risks which are partly financial in nature.
Counterparty risk is the risk that banks and other financial institutions which are contractually committed to make payments to the Group may fail to do so.
Commodity risk is the risk that the Group may have purchased commodities which subsequently fall in value.
The Group manages counterparty risk by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, which are approved by the Treasury Committee and monitored regularly.
The Group manages convertibility risk by limiting its exposure to assets which, in the judgement of the Board, may become illiquid for any length of time.
The management of credit and commodity risk is considered to be the responsibility of operational management and, in respect of these risks, the Group does not prescribe a uniform approach across the Group.
The Groups principal risks including strategic, operational, legal andother risks are shown on pages 44 to 51.
Going concern The Groups principal objective when managing cash and debt is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
The Group retains sufficient resources to remain in compliance with the financial covenant of its bank facilities with substantial headroom.
The Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
