GROWING REVENUE In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2014 volume rate Out-patient Other 2015 Growth Underlying revenue 826.6 18.1 0.9 3.5 0.1 847.4 2.5% Acquisitions disposals 29.4 37.4 Total revenue 856.0 884.8 3.4% Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 increased by 28.8 million, or 3.4%, to 884.8 million 2014: 856.0 million.
Underlying growth, excluding revenue of 5.8 million 2014: 8.3 million relating to Spire St Saviours Hospital which was closed in September 2015, 31.6 million 2014: 19.2 million arising from Spire St Anthonys Hospital since its acquisition in May 2014, and nil 2014: 1.9 million from the disposal of the fertility business in August 2014, was 2.5%.
Of the underlying revenue growth of 2.5%: an increase of 3.3% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 2.2% increase in revenue in the year with volume growth across all payor groups: the Group reported a nominal decline in the rate for in-patient and daycase average revenue per case equivalent to a 0.1% decline in total revenue.
This was the result of year-on-year NHS tariff reductions and a shift in PMI case mix towards lower yielding daycase admissions in the year: and out-patient activities increased with the volume of admissions but growth has been tempered by PMI out-patient pricing in the year.
Out-patient revenue growth accounted for an increase in underlying total revenue of 0.4%.
28 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION PMI In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2014 volume rate Out-patient 2015 Growth Underlying PMI revenue 416.9 0.7 0.7 4.7 412.2 1.1% Acquisitions disposals 15.5 22.6 Total PMI revenue 432.4 434.8 0.6% PMI revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 increased by 2.4 million, or 0.6%, to 434.8 million 2014: 432.4 million.
Underlying growth, excluding revenue relating to Spire St Saviours and Spire St Anthonys hospitals, fell by 1.1%.
Of the underlying fall in PMI revenue of 1.1%: an increase of 0.2% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 0.2% increase in PMI revenue in the year: overall the proportion of daycase admissions increased from 73.9% of PMI admissions in 2014 to 75.8% of PMI admissions in 2015.
This mix shift in admissions had an adverse impact on average revenue per case and on out-patient revenue associated with the patient episodes: the Group reported a comparable decline of 0.3% in the rate of in-patient and daycase average revenue per case.
As explained above this is largely a product of mix.
Relative to 2014, the average rate per case for 2015, on an equivalent mix of PMI admissions, increased by 2.4%: inflation plus rate rises for in-patient and daycase admissions tempered overall by reductions in the rates achieved for out-patient activities.
Overall PMI price increases for 2015 were positive but sub-inflationary: and out-patient revenue declined in the year, equivalent to a 1.1% decline in overall underlying PMI revenue.
This was a combination of lower out-patient activity levels arising from the daycase surgery mix and the bias of 2015 price increases towards in-patient and daycase surgical activities.
NHS In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2014 volume rate Out-patient 2015 Growth Underlying NHS revenue 238.8 11.2 1.2 6.1 254.9 6.7% Acquisitions disposals 7.1 7.1 Total NHS revenue 245.9 262.0 6.5% NHS revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 increased by 16.1 million, or 6.5%, to 262.0 million 2014: 245.9 million.
Underlying growth, excluding revenue relating to Spire St Saviours and Spire St Anthonys hospitals, was 6.7%.
Of the underlying growth in NHS revenue of 6.7%: the underlying increase in NHS e-Referral Service revenue was 12.5% in the year: the underlying decline in non-NHS e-Referral Service revenue was 10.0% in the year.
The Group has been impacted by a significant and abrupt curtailment of outsourcing work from NHS Trusts in the second half of 2015 as a direct response to directives designed to address NHS funding deficits: overall the Group reported a net increase of 5.7% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions.
This accounted for a 4.7% increase in NHS revenue in the year: the Group reported a decline in the rate for in-patient and daycase average revenue per case equivalent to a 0.5% decline in NHS revenue.
Although case mix complexity increased in the year, this was mitigated by an overall effective reduction in NHS tariffs of approximately 2.0% for the year: and out-patient activities increased with the volume of NHS admissions accounting for an overall increase in NHS revenue of 2.6% over 2015.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 29 STRATEGIC REPORT Financial review continued Self-pay In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2014 volume rate Out-patient 2015 Growth Underlying Self-pay revenue 140.1 6.2 1.0 2.1 149.4 6.6% Acquisitions disposals 6.0 6.8 Total Self-pay revenue 146.1 156.2 6.9% Self-pay revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 increased by 10.1 million, or 6.9%, to 156.2 million 2014: 146.1 million.
Underlying growth, excluding revenue from Spire St Saviours Hospital, Spire St Anthonys Hospital and the fertility business, was 6.6%.
Of the underlying growth in Self-pay revenue of 6.6%: an increase of 6.8% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 4.4% increase in Self-pay revenue in the year: the Group reported an increase in the rate for in-patient and daycase average revenue per case equivalent to a 0.7% increase in Self-pay revenue: and out-patient activities increased with the volume of admissions, accounting for an overall increase in Self-pay revenue of 1.5% over 2014.
Other revenue Other revenue, which includes fees paid to the Group by consultants e. g. for the use of Group facilities and services and third-party revenue e. g. pathology services to third parties, increased by 0.2 million, or 0.6%, in the year, to 31.8 million 2014: 31.6 million.
COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT Cost of sales increased in the year by 23.4 million, or 5.4%, to 460.0 million 2014: 436.6 million.
Underlying cost of sales excluding Spire St Saviours and Spire St Anthonys hospitals and the fertility business increased in the year by 17.1 million, or 4.1%, to 436.8 million 2014: 419.7 million.
Underlying gross margin for the year of 2015 was 48.5%, compared to 49.2% in 2014.
On an underlying basis, and as a percentage of relevant revenue: clinical staffing costs increased from 17.3% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 18.4% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The increase in costs reflects the current overall shortage in the supply of qualified nursing staff across the UK and a consequent increase in agency staffing spend: fees paid to clinicians for services provided to the NHS increased from 5.8% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 6.0% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.
This increase reflects the weighting of overall revenue growth in the year.
Fees as a percentage of NHS revenue have reduced in the year from 19.9% of NHS revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 19.8% for the year ended 31 December 2015: other direct costs, which includes drugs, consumables and prosthesis spend, has reduced in the year from 22.0% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 21.7% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.
This has been achieved notwithstanding a relative increase in NHS activities and a reduction in equivalent NHS tariff reimbursement rates: and other fees payable to consultants for out-patient and diagnostic activities reduced as a percentage of revenue, from 5.7% for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 5.6% of revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.
OTHER OPERATING COSTS Other operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2015 decreased by 30.0 million, or 8.3%, to 329.3 million 2014: 359.3 million.
Underlying other operating costs excluding Spire St Saviours and Spire St Anthonys hospitals and the fertility business decreased in the year by 28.4 million, or 8.2%, to 318.9 million 2014: 347.3 million.
Included within these costs are exceptional costs of 54.0 million for 2014 and 15.7 million for 2015 relating to the business reorganisation, hospital closure, and regulatory and governance costs.
Before exceptional items, underlying operating costs increased by 9.9 million, or 3.4% from 293.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 to 303.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 on revenue growth of 2.5% in the year.
Depreciation Excluding 1.5 million relating to Spire St Saviours and Spire St Anthonys hospitals, the underlying charge for depreciation for the year ended 31 December 2015 has increased by 3.4 million, or 7.7%, relative to 2014, to 47.4 million.
30 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Rent Rent of land and buildings before exceptional items for the year, excluding 0.1 million relating to Spire St Anthonys Hospital, increased by 1.6 million, or 2.6%, to 62.2 million.
The increase is largely the consequence of the annualised impact of Spire Washington Hospital rent and commencement of rental of Spire Hesslewood Clinic, Hull, part of Spire Hull and East Riding Hospital.
Share-based payments in other operating costs During the year, grants were made to Executive Directors and members of the senior management team under the Companys Deferred Bonus Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan.

After taking into consideration the basis of differences between 2015 versus 2014, adjusted operating profit before exceptional costs decreased by 0.4%, from 111.6 million to 111.2 million.
PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT The loss on disposal of 0.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 relates principally to obsolete equipment.
The profit in the prior year of 18.5 million relates principally to the sale, subject to lease, of the Spire Washington Hospital.
FINANCE COSTS Finance costs in the prior year include those incurred in respect of borrowings drawn under the capital structure of the Group prior to Admission.
On Admission, indebtedness reduced significantly and, therefore, finance costs also reduced.
Finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2015 totalled 21.4 million, a reduction of 64.5 million, or 75.1%, over the prior year.
This reduction mainly comprised 54.8 million of interest on shareholder debt and 13.7 million on bank loans, net of the mark-to-market movement on interest rate swap instruments settled on Admission.
TAXATION The taxation charge for the year ended 31 December 2015 consisted of a 7.9 million charge for corporation tax and a charge of 5.7 million for deferred tax.
Before exceptional items, the effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 18.3%.
The taxation credit for the year ended 31 December 2014 consisted of a 0.7 million charge for corporation tax and a credit of 13.7 million for deferred tax.
The UK corporation tax charge on 2014 profits was nil, reflecting the significant allowable costs arising from the Admission, including the settlement of out-of-the-money interest rate swaps.
The UK corporation tax charge in the income statement was an adjustment to prior years.
The credit for deferred taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 13.7 million, comprising deferred tax assets previously unrecognised, in relation to losses carried forward following the reorganisation into a single tax group.
Before exceptional items, the effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 was 21.6%.
PROFIT AFTER TAXATION The profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 60.0 million, compared with a profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 6.0 million.
The capital restructuring of the Group on Admission substantially reduced finance costs, contributing 64.5 million to the increase in profit after tax in the year.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2015 31 STRATEGIC REPORT Financial review continued PRO-FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION The pro-forma financial information set out below, as presented in the Groups Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014, was prepared to illustrate the effect of the IPO on pro-forma profit after tax.
This statement was prepared for illustrative purposes only and did not represent the Groups actual earnings.
The information was prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies of the Group and as described in the notes set out below.
Pro-forma profit after tax and earnings per share The prior years income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 included finance costs that related to debt which was settled on Admission on 23 July 2014, reducing the borrowings outstanding on that date and finance costs that will arise in future periods.
