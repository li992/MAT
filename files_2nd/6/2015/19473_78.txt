The FTSE 100 was selected as the Company was a constituent member until September 2014 and it is considered to be the most appropriate broad equity market index against which the Companys performance should be measured.
The graph shows the value at each year end to 31 December 2015, assuming that dividends have been reinvested, of 100 invested in Rexam shares on 1 January 2009 compared with the value of 100 invested over the same period in the FTSE 100 share index.
The Rexam share price for the period preceding the rights issue in 2009 has been adjusted for the bonus element inherent in that rights issue.
Total shareholder return reflected in the graph is not an indication of the likely vesting of awards granted under the LTIP which is based on a different comparator group, as explained on page 66.
