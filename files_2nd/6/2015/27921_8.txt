Within this, net interest income increased to 197.4 million from 179.4 million for the year ended 30 September 2014.
This increase reflects both improving margins and growth in the size of the average loan book, which rose by 7.0% to 9,659.2 million 2014: 9,028.7 million appendix B.
Net interest margins increased slightly in 2015 to 2.04% compared to 1.99% last year appendix B, driven by new originations and portfolio purchases having higher margins than those assets redeeming in the period and despite some tightening of market funding margins and the cost of funding an increased new business pipeline.
Other operating income was 14.1 million for the year, compared with 18.5 million in 2014.
The decrease reflects a lower level of third party fee income earned in Idem Capital with the focus of its operations having been on direct, rather than co-investment opportunities from 2014 onwards.
PAGE 24 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Strategic Report Annual Report & Accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT Operating expenses increased by 12.3% to 71.2 million from 63.4 million for 2014.
The operational costs of Paragon Bank, where expenditure will exceed associated revenues whilst the business becomes established, had a significant impact on Group costs in the period.
This resulted in the cost:income ratio increasing to 33.7% from 32.0% for 2014 appendix A, although it remains significantly below the industry average.
The underlying cost:income ratio excluding the Paragon Bank segment was, however, broadly stable at 29.3% compared to 28.8% in the year ended 30 September 2014.
The increase in non-bank costs was attributable principally to additional employee numbers being required to support increased business levels, with average headcount rising by 9.3% in the year note 14.
The Board remains focused on controlling operating costs through the application of rigorous budgeting and monitoring procedures.
The charge of 5.6 million for loan impairment has reduced from that for 2014 2014: 12.3 million.
As a percentage of average loans to customers appendix B the impairment charge has reduced to 0.06% compared to 0.14% in 2014.
The Group has seen positive trends in arrears performance over the period, with the incidence of new cases reducing and customers correcting past arrears, whilst increasing property values served to decrease average loan to value ratios in the portfolio and in turn to reduce the overall exposure to losses on enforcement of security.
The performance of the Groups post credit crisis lending has been particularly pleasing.
The loan books continue to be carefully managed and the credit performance of the buy-to-let book remains exemplary.
Yield curve movements during the period resulted in hedging instrument fair value net losses of 0.5 million 2014: 0.6 million net gains, which do not affect cash flow.
The fair value movements of hedged assets or liabilities are expected to trend to zero over time, as such this item represents a timing difference.
The Group remains economically and appropriately hedged.
Cash flows from the Groups securitisation vehicle companies and the acquired portfolios remain strong.
These, together with debt raisings, financed further investments in loan portfolios, the capital requirements of Paragon Bank and credit enhancement for mortgage originations.
Cash was also utilised in the share buy-back programme, which commenced during December 2014 and where 49.7 million had been deployed by 30 September 2015.
Free cash balances were 199.9 million at 30 September 2015 2014: 177.3 million note 38.
Corporation tax has been charged at the rate of 20.2%, compared with 20.8% for the last year: the reduction being principally a result of the lower UK Corporation Tax rate applicable to the Group in the year ended 30 September 2015.
Decreasing gilt yields have increased the accounting value placed on the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension plan over the year ended 30 September 2015, leading to the deficit under IAS 19 increasing to 21.5 million 2014: 17.3 million.
This resulted in an actuarial loss in other comprehensive income of 4.3 million before tax 2014: 2.1 million.
Profits after taxation of 107.1 million 2014: 97.2 million have been transferred to shareholders funds, which totalled 969.5 million at the year end 2014: 947.1 million.
The Group continues to adopt the segmental reporting format introduced in 2014, which analyses the business between the three divisions described below.
