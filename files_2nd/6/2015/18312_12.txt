Commodity prices During 2015, we and our franchisees enjoyed the benefits of a benign food price landscape with a record low cheese price, favourable wheat price and a fall in fuel costs.
For the full year 2015 the average food basket in the UK saw a year-on-year decrease of 1.6% of store sales over 2014, which is a combination of the favourable food cost environment and the continued efforts of our supply chain procurement function to leverage the Groups buying power and secure the most competitive deals with quality suppliers.
