FINANCIAL REVIEW Introduction Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under adopted IFRS, as management believe these measures enable them to assess the underlying trading performance of the businesses.
Adjusted figures exclude certain non-operational items which management have defined in Note 2 to the Financial Statements.
Unless otherwise stated, figures quoted for operating profit, net interest, profit before tax, tax, earnings per share and operating cash flow are adjusted measures.

Reported sales increased 1.4% to 1,190.0 million 2014: 1,173.7 million.
The year-on-year contribution to sales from acquisitions of 36.1 million 3.1% was reduced by adverse foreign exchange movements of 16.7 million -1.4% arising primarily from the strength of Sterling against the Euro, partly offsetting the impact of the stronger US Dollar, with the result that, on an organic constant currency like-for-like LFL basis, sales decreased 3.1 million -0.3% compared with 2014, as can be seen in the chart below.

Excluding adverse foreign exchange movements -0.4 pp and acquisitions 0.1 pp, LFL gross margins increased 0.1 pp.
LFL gross margins improved in the Materials Analysis and Test and Measurement segments, but were lower in the In-line Instrumentation and Industrial Controls segments, reflecting the impact of lower sales, pricing pressure in specific markets and an adverse sales mix.
The combination of unchanged LFL sales, continued investment in our growth initiatives and R&D programmes, with LFL R&D spend increasing 3%, andinflationary cost increases resulted in adjusted operating profit decreasing from 198.1 million in 2014 to 181.1 million in 2015.
Acquisitions contributed 5.2 million 2.6% to operating profit and foreign currency exchange movements had an adverse impact of 4.8 million -2.4%, resulting in LFL operating profit declining 17.4 million -8.8% for the year, as shown in the chart below.
The operating margin decreased 1.7 pp from 16.9% in2014 to 15.2% in 2015, and 1.5 pp on a LFL basis.
To mitigate the effects of the low growth environment and challenging trading conditions seen particularly in North America and China, cost reduction and containment measures were put in place during the year to protect profitability, with a number of businesses initiating targetted restructuring programmes.
These measures resulted in 6.8 million 2014: 0.8 million of restructuring costs being charged against operating profit in the year with incremental benefits amounting to 3.7 million in 2015 such that the net full-year cost for 2015 is 3.1 million.
The annualised benefit in 2016 arising from these measures is anticipated to be approximately 7 million.
Compared with 2014, net overheads increased 16.1 million, which included the above restructuring costs and the absence of a one-off 3.0 million R&D-related government grant which benefitted the prior year.
Excluding these items, net overheads increased approximately 1.5% on a LFL basis, reflecting the focussed cost containment measures undertaken in the year.

Although average net debt for the year was 23.5 million higher than the prior year, primarily as a result of the five acquisitions made, net finance costs benefitted from a reduction in the weighted average interest rate on debt.
This followed the re-financing of the US$550 million revolving credit facility in October 2014 and the re-financing of the $75.6 million fixed rate loan in September 2015 with a new seven-year 116.2 million fixed rate loan, both of which were on more favourable terms.
com m FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Profit before tax decreased 8.4% from 192.5 million to 176.3 million.
Statutory operating profit, after including acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation and impairment of 34.6 million 2014: 25.9 million and net acquisition-related costs and fair value adjustments of 2.9 million 2014: 3.9 million, decreased 14.7% from 168.3 million to 143.6 million.
Statutory profit before tax decreased 17.2% from 171.1 million in 2014 to 141.6 million in 2015.
The reconciliation of statutory and adjusted measures is shown in the following table.

The total cost of acquisitions in the year was 45.0 million 2014: 96.7 million, including 2.7 million 2014: 0.9 million for cash acquired.
Included in the total cost of acquisitions is an amount of 2.7 million 2014: 4.5 million attributable to the fair value of net deferred and contingent consideration which is expected to be paid in future years.
A net 0.5 million 2014: 0.3 million was paid in respect of prior year acquisitions, making the net cash outflow in the year 40.1 million 2014: 91.6 million.
Furthermore, an amount of 3.9 million 2014: 2.5 million was spent on acquisition-related legal and professional fees, which makes the total acquisition-related cash outflow for the year 44.0 million 2014: 94.1 million.
Acquisitions contributed 36.1 million 2014: 17.6 million of incremental sales and 5.2 million 2014: 4.4 million of incremental operating profit during the year.
Taxation The effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax was 22.8% 2014: 23.2%, a decrease of 0.4 pp due to a reduction in the weighted average statutory tax rate arising from a change in the geographical mix of pre-tax profits.
On a statutory basis, the effective tax rate of 19.6% 2014: 21.0% continues to be below the weighted average statutory tax rate of 25.4% 2014: 28.1%, primarily as a consequence of R&D-related tax incentives and a taxefficient financing structure, partly offset by a reduction in non-taxable income.
Earnings per share Earnings per share decreased 8.1% from 124.4p to 114.3p, reflecting the net impact of the 8.4% decrease in profit before tax, the reduction in our effective tax rate and the increase in the weighted average number of shares from 118.8 million in 2014 to 119.0 million in 2015.
52 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report 01-55 Governance 56-97 Financial Statements 98-168 Statutory basic earnings per share decreased 15.9% from 113.7p to 95.6p.

Average trade working capital, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased to 15.4% 2014: 13.3%, a 2.1 pp increase, of which 0.3 pp related to foreign exchange.
Excluding acquisitions, the increase in working capital arose primarily within the In-line Instrumentation segment due to higher inventory levels to support new product launches and a higher level of receivables due to the timing of sales, and within the Industrial Controls segment due to higher inventory levels from lower sales.
Capital expenditure during the year equated to 2.2% of sales 2014: 2.3% and, at 26.0 million 2014: 27.4 million, was 107% of depreciation andsoftware amortisation 2014: 126%, primarily due to ongoing investments in property and infrastructure in Europe and North America.
Overall, net debt decreased 27.0 million 2014: decrease of 21.5 million from 125.6 million to 98.6 million.
Interest costs, excluding the financing charge arising from IAS 19 Revised and other finance costs, were covered by operating profit 39.4 times 2014: 36.7 times.
com FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Financing and treasury The Group finances its operations from both retained earnings and third-party borrowings, with almost all of the year-end gross debt balance being atfixed rates of interest.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had 526.2 million of committed facilities denominated in different currencies, consisting of a five-year US$550 million 371.1 million revolving credit facility maturing in October 2019, a seven-year 94.8 million 69.7 million term loan maturing in October 2020, and a seven-year 116.2 million 85.4 million term loan maturing in September 2022.
The revolving credit facility was undrawn at the year end.
In addition, the Group had a year-end cash balance of 58.2 million, together with other uncommitted facilities of 1.7 million.
At the year end, the Groups borrowings amounted to 156.8 million, 99% of which was at fixed interest rates 2014: 76%.
The ageing profile at the year end showed that 1% of year-end borrowings are due to mature within one year 2014: 32%, 44% between two and five years 2014: 22% and 55% in more than five years 2014: 46%.
Currency The Group has both translational and transactional currency exposures.
Translational exposures arise on the consolidation of overseas company results into Sterling.
Transactional exposures arise where the currency of sale or purchase invoices differs from the functional currency in which each company prepares its local accounts.
The transactional exposures include situations where foreign currency-denominated trade receivable, trade payable and cash balances are held.
After matching the currency of revenue with the currency of costs wherever practical, forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a proportion up to 75% of the remaining forecast net transaction flows where there is reasonable certainty of an exposure.
At 31 December 2015, approximately 60% of the estimated net Euro, US Dollar and Japanese Yen exposures for 2016 were hedged using forward exchange contracts, mainly against the Swiss Franc, Sterling, the Euro and the Danish Krone.
The largest translational exposures are to the US Dollar, Euro, Danish Krone, Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc.
Translational exposures are not hedged.
Thetable below shows the key average exchange rates compared to Sterling during 2015 and 2014.
2015 2014 average average USD 1.53 1.65 EUR 1.38 1.24 JPY 185 174 CHF 1.47 1.51 To demonstrate the transactional and translational currency exposures faced by the Group, the table below shows the differences between the Groups consolidated revenues and costs for each of the major currencies in 2015 before reflecting the effect of transactional hedges taken out in the year.

The above table is for overall guidance only as the phasing of income and the movement in the monthly average exchange rates during the year can have a significant effect on the impact of foreign exchange on the Groups results.
54 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report 01-55 Governance 56-97 Financial Statements 98-168 Like-for-like methodology The Group uses the non-statutory LFL performance metric, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements, to measure the underlying performance of businesses.
The standard methodology for calculating LFL performance is based on using each entitys functional currency result i. e. sales or operating profit and translating it into its presentation currency using the prior years exchange rate, irrespective of the underlying transaction currencies.
However, the underlying transactional exposure can have a major impact on the LFL calculation when there are a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency and during periods of currency volatility.
Within the In-line Instrumentation segment, the BTG business has large functional currency mismatches against its underlying transaction currencies which distort LFL comparisons at times of significant currency movements.
This applies primarily to BTGs largest operation in Switzerland, but also to alesser extent to its operations in Sweden and China.
Within the Swiss business, approximately 7% of sales and almost 70% of costs are denominated in Swiss Francs CHF with the consequence that LFL results are distorted by applying our standard methodology for translating the functional currency to Sterling, the Groups presentation currency.
The effect of this mismatch was emphasised following the unpegging of the CHF against the Euro by the Swiss National Bank in January 2015, which led to a sharp appreciation of the CHF against the Euro.
Accordingly, we have modified the basis upon which BTGs LFL results are translated into Sterling by using the actual underlying transaction currency mix for determining translational gains losses toprovide more accurate and reliable information on BTGs underlying performance.
This modified approach has not been applied to any other operatingcompany as BTG is the only business within the Group with a significant functional currency mismatch for LFL reporting purposes.
If the standard LFL methodology had been used for BTG, Group LFL sales growth for 2015 would have been 33 basis points bps 2014: 9 bps lower, and LFL sales growth for the In-line Instrumentation segment would have been 147 bps 2014: 38 bps lower.
For the avoidance of doubt, the reported results of the Group and the In-line Instrumentation segment, under IFRS, remain unchanged as a result of the application of the modified LFL methodology for BTG.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Company operates a number of pension schemes throughout the Group.
The net pension liability in the balance sheet before taking account oftherelated deferred tax asset of 5.6 million has increased to 22.1 million 2014: 14.0 million.
The movement can be summarised as follows: m Net deficit in defined benefit schemes as at 31 December 2014 14.0 Actuarial losses 7.9 Contributions in excess of current service cost 0.1 Past service credit 0.3 Scheme administration costs 0.3 Expected return on pension scheme assets net of interest costs on pension scheme liabilities 0.1 Net deficit as at 31 December 2015 22.1 The movement in individual plan deficits is shown in the table below: m UK Germany Netherlands Switzerland Total overseas Net total Surplus deficit as at 31 December 2014 3.6 7.7 1.7 8.2 17.6 14.0 Change in year 5.6 0.2 0.2 2.5 2.5 8.1 Deficit as at 31 December 2015 2.0 7.5 1.9 10.7 20.1 22.1 The UK plan surplus of 3.6 million at 31 December 2014 decreased 5.6 million to a deficit position of 2.0 million at 31 December 2015 due to investment returns being lower than expected.
The net deficit for the overseas plans increased 2.5 million to 20.1 million primarily due to changes in market conditions during the year, in particular a fall in the discount rates used to value the plans liabilities.
The Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 16 February 2016.
