FINANCIAL REVIEW When managing the performance of our business we focus on non-GAAP measures, which we refer to as adjusted measures.
We believe they provide a useful comparison of performance from one period to the next.
These adjusted measures are supplementary to, and should not be regarded as a substitute for, GAAP measures, which we refer to as reported measures.
The basis of our adjusted measures is explained in our accounting policies accompanying our financial statements, and reconciliations between reported and adjusted measures are included in the appropriate notes to our financial statements.
Percentage growth figures for adjusted results are given on a constant currency basis, where the effects of exchange rate movements on the translation of the results of our overseas operations are removed.
