the increase in the share of profits of equity accounted joint ventures to $77.3 million from $75.9 million in the prior year resulted from an increase in profits from morila, on the back of increased production and lower cost of production, partially offset by a drop in profits from Kibali, which were lower than the previous year due to increased costs and depreciation charges.
the share of profits from the Kibali joint venture is stated after a tax charge of $8.0 million attributable, including deferred tax calculated at 30% of profit, despite the fact that the mine has an accelerated tax allowance which reduces the cash tax paid in the initial years.
