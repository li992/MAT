The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2015 Financial review Total revenue increased by 7.9%, a product of 1.5% like-forlike sales growth and the impact of new openings.
Total EBITDA for the year was 128m, an increase of 9.4% on the prior year and operating profits increased by 10.5% to 88.9m.
Group operating margin for the year was 13.0%, an increase of 30 basis points on the prior year.
Within this, our administration cost base increased as a percentage of turnover by 30 basis points, reflecting the increase in resource in many of our central support functions during the latter part of 2014.
This was more than offset by efficiencies elsewhere and the benefit of minimal food cost inflation, resulting in the overall 30 basis point improvement in margin.
Interest costs were a little lower this year, partly due to a lower level of average net debt during the year and partly due to improved terms under the new financing arrangements which were completed in June.
This resulted in total profit before tax of 86.85m, an 11.2% increase on the prior year.
The average tax rate in the year was 22.4%, a little lower than the prior year, resulting in earnings per share of 33.8p, an increase of 13% on the prior year.
