Revenue The Groups revenue decreased by 42.6% to US$448.9 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$781.9 million.
This ismainly explained by the decrease in the average Brent crude oil price from 99.7 US$ bbl during 2014 to 53.6 US$ bbl onaverage during the reporting period.
The pricing for all of the Groups crude oil, condensate and LPG is, directly orindirectly, related to the price of Brent crude oil.
Revenues from sales to the Groups largest three customers amounted to US$141.4 million, US$105.0 million and US$86.0million respectively FY 2014: US$321.8 million, US$124.8 million and US$77.0 million.

The decrease isprimarily explained by the change in royalties, repair, maintenance and other services and depreciation, depletion andamortization, referred to below.
On a boe basis, cost of sales decreased marginally by US$1.0 or 7.6% to US$12.7 forthereporting period FY 2014: US$13.7 and cost of sales net of depreciation per boe decreased by US$1.5, or 22.2%, toUS$5.4 FY 2014: US$6.9.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation for the reporting period is in line with prior year.
Depreciation is calculated with units of production method.
The fact that depreciation is lower in the reporting period when compared to FY 2014 is aconsequence of the ratio between the volume produced and theproven developed reserves decrease in the reporting period when compared to prior year.
Repair, maintenance and other services decreased by 25.9% to US$26.6 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$35.8million.
These expenses include maintenance expenses related to the gas treatment facility and other facilities ofthe Group, engineering and geophysical study expenses.
These costs fluctuate depending on the planned works on certain objects.
Royalties, which are calculated on the basis of production and market prices for the different products, decreased by 41.0%to US$14.4 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$24.3 million.
This decrease follows the decline of revenues for sold products.
Materials and supplies expenses decreased by 28.3% to US$7.8 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$10.9 million.
This decrease resulted from less need for spare parts and other materials for repairs and maintenance of the facilities, specifically for the gas treatment facility and wells.
Well workover costs decreased by 17.7% to US$5.2 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$6.3 million.
The decrease resulted from adjustments to the drilling and workover programme.
Costs for government profit share decreased by US$2.7 million to US$1.9 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$4.6million.
This was primarily due to decrease in professional services, in particular audit fees, legal services and other consultancy fees, offset by an increase in payroll and related taxes driven partly by the agreement on 19 May 2014 toacquire Nostrum Services BVBA formerly Prolag BVBA and Nostrum Services Central Asia LLP formerly Amersham OilLLP, which led to the elimination of intercompany management fees, decrease in consultancy fees and recognition ofthose expenses as payroll and related taxes.

These costs werehigher in H1 2014 due primarily to the expenses relating to the early redemption of the Notes issued in 2010 and theamortisation of the remainder of transaction cost, incurred for the issuance of these Notes.
Finance costs reorganisation The finance costs reorganisation are represented by the costs associated with the introduction of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC asthe new holding company of the Group and respective reorganisation that took place in June 2014.
Other Foreign exchange losses amounted to US$21.2 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$4.2 million.
Higher losses in2015 are explained by the fact that on 20 August 2015 the Tenge was devalued against the US Dollar and other majorcurrencies due to decision of Kazakhstan to switch to free-float, triggering a 23% slide in the Tenge to a record 257,21 Tenge for 1 US Dollar.
As per 31 December 2015 the exchange rate made up 340,6 Tenge for 1 US Dollar.
Since theGrouphad a net asset position of Tenge denominated accounts around this date, the devaluation of the Tenge resulted inasignificant foreign exchange loss recognised in the reporting period.
Gain on derivative financial instruments amounted to US$37.1 million for the reporting period.
Movement in the fair value ofthe derivative financial instruments is disclosed in the Note 29 of the Consolidated financial statements included in thisreport.
Other expenses decreased marginally by 38.7% to US$30.6 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$49.8 million mainly due to lower export custom duties, compensation for social gas and expenses for accruals under subsoil use agreement.
Income tax expense increased by 0.8% to US$166.6 million for the reporting period FY 2014: US$165.3 million.
The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by lower taxable profit offset by additional deferred tax expenses dueto decrease of the tax base due to effect of exchange rates changes.

The decrease in realised profit is mainly driven by a decrease in the oil prices during the second half year of 2014, resulting in a decrease in revenue combined with an increase in other operating costs and income tax expenses, partially offset by a gain on derivative financial instruments.
Revenue The Groups revenue decreased by 12.6% to US$781.9 million for the reporting period FY 2013: US$895.0 million.
The decrease in Group revenue was driven primarily by a significant decrease in the overall oil prices during the second half of2014.

Gas Treatment Facility Following the successful completion of the first phase of the gas treatment facility, consisting of two units, the Group is constructing a third unit for it.
The construction of GTU3 is important for implementing the Groups strategy to increase operating capacity and production of liquid hydrocarbons.
Management estimates, based on the production profile ofboth proved and probable reserves reported in the 2015 Ryder Scott Report and assuming the successful completion ofthe gas treatment facility in 2017, that the Companys annual production will more than double from the 2015 annual production with an average of 40,391 boepd in 2015 by the end of 2018.
Total costs for the completion of GTU3 are estimated to be not more than US$500 million, of which US$250 million have been spent as of the end of the reporting period.
