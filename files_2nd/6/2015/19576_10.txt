Other one-time items relate to the early termination of a UK Local Authority contract where settlement has been mutually agreed with the customer.
The one-time profit represents a payment to Serco in lieu of anticipated profits in future years, net of direct costs, impairments and other charges.
In 2014, Underlying Trading Profit of 113.2m excludes non-exceptional charges made in respect of OCPs, asset impairments and other provisions arising from the 2014 Contract and Balance Sheet Review of 745.3m.
Discontinued operations Completion of the sale of the majority of the offshore private sector BPO business, which accounted for the bulk of the Global Services division, occurred on 31 December 2015.
The disposal of operations based in the Middle East to the same purchaser is expected to complete in two tranches during 2016 following receipt of the necessary approvals: the balance sheet items associated with these operations remain within assets and liabilities held for sale at 31December2015.
During the course of 2015 the other predominantly UK onshore private sector BPO operations have either been sold or exited early, or will be in the near future.
As a result, in 2015 the Global Services division is deemed to be a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS.
Those onshore BPO businesses which have not yet been exited are treated as assets held for sale and segregated from the other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

In May 2015 the Group completed the sale of its Great Southern Rail GSR business in Australia for a cash consideration of 2.9m, resulting in a loss on disposal of 2.8m.
The transaction was part of the disposal programme of businesses identified as not being core to Sercos future strategy, as announced initially in November 2014.
In addition, in January 2015, the Group disposed of its National Physical Laboratory NPL business for a consideration of 12.1m, with no gain or loss on disposal.
AgPlus was a subsidiary of NPL which was retained and sold separately with a gain of 0.5m being recognised.
In June 2015, the Group also disposed of its Serco India Private Limited business, representing the Groups frontline public services operations in the Indian transport sector, for a consideration of 1.0m, resulting in a loss on disposal of 0.8m.
All of these businesses were classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2014.
In 2015 there was also an exceptional gain of 0.5m recognised relating to transactions completed in prior periods.
Other exceptional operating items arising on continuing operations Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that there is a risk that it could be impaired.
The recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit CGU is based on value in use calculations derived from forecast cash flows based on past experience, adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, the Groups strategy and key risks.
These forecasts include an estimated level of new business wins and contract attrition and an assumption that the final year forecast continues into perpetuity at a CGU-specific terminal growth rate.
The terminal growth rates are provided by external sources and are based on long-term inflation rates of the geographic market in which the CGUs operate and therefore do not exceed the average long-term growth rates forecast for the individual markets.
In 2015, we conducted impairment testing of our CGUs that has identified a non-cash exceptional impairment to continuing operations of 87.5m 2014: 181.2m, primarily due to a higher level of contract attrition than previously forecast and the associated impact on future cash flows.
The impairments arose in the following CGUs.
2015 2014 For the year ended 31 December m m Local & Regional Government: Direct Services and Europe 57.6 Local & Regional Government: UK Health 22.9 Americas 87.5 100.7 Total exceptional goodwill impairment charge 87.5 181.2 In 2015, a charge of 19.7m 2014: 24.0m arose in relation to the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review.
This included redundancy payments, provisions, external advisory fees and other incremental costs.
The disposal of the Environmental and Leisure businesses was aborted in the year and as a result the one-off costs of 1.7m associated with the aborted sale have been treated as exceptional.
In 2015, there were exceptional costs totalling 1.2m associated with the UK Government reviews, this reflected external costs incurred and included external adviser costs related to these reviews.
In 2014 costs totalling 9.2m were incurred associated with both the UK Government reviews and the programme of corporate renewal.
In 2015, the exit of the UK Frontline Clinical Health contracts was completed with the Cornwall Out of Hours contract being exited in May and the Suffolk Community Healthcare contract ended in September.
On completion of the contract exits, existing OCPs of 2.8m that are no longer required were released and recorded as a credit in exceptional items.
Strategic Report Finance Review 57 In November 2014 the Group agreed to settle a dispute with the Trustees of the Docklands Light Railway DLR Pension Scheme over the extent of its liability to fund the deficit on the scheme.
The settlement resulted in a total exceptional charge inclusive of costs of 35.6m, consisting of the full and final settlement amount of 33.0m and costs of 2.6m.
The settlement is to be paid over four equal annual instalments from January 2015 to January 2018 covering all past and any future DLR associated pension liabilities.
In 2014 an exceptional provision of 20.1m was recognised for legal claims made against Serco for commercial disputes.
This provision was based on legal advice received by the Company.
There have been no further charges in 2015 in relation to these disputes.
In 2014 an impairment review was performed on the Australian rail business, Great Southern Rail GSR, resulting in a charge totalling 37.2m.
This consisted of an impairment of 23.1m to reduce the carrying value of its net assets to the estimated recoverable amount and a charge of 14.1m in relation to the break costs of leases relating to the business.
The GSR business was exited in May 2015, with the loss on disposal of 2.8m, included within loss on disposal of businesses.
Exceptional profit or loss on disposal of discontinued operations Completion of the sale of the majority of the offshore private sector BPO business occurred on 31 December 2015.
During the year the Group also disposed of businesses in relation to the predominantly UK onshore private sector BPO business.
The net assets at the date of disposal of discontinued operations were: Offshore UK onshore Total m m m Goodwill 156.7 156.7 Other intangible assets 30.4 30.4 Property, plant and equipment 35.1 0.8 35.9 Trade and other receivables 82.8 0.5 83.3 Deferred tax assets 3.1 3.1 Cash and cash equivalents 31.0 0.8 31.8 Trade and other payables 51.5 0.5 52.0 Obligations under finance leases 1.1 0.1 1.2 Provisions 16.8 4.9 21.7 Corporation tax liabilities 26.0 0.3 26.3 Deferred tax liabilities 5.1 5.1 Minority interest disposed 0.4 0.4 Net assets liabilities disposed 239.0 3.7 235.3 Financial Statements Directors Report Strategic Report 58 Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Finance Review continued The loss on disposal is calculated as follows: Offshore UK onshore Total m m m Cash consideration 212.8 1.6 211.2 Face value of loan note received 30.0 30.0 Gross consideration 242.8 1.6 241.2 Loan note fair value adjustment 10.5 10.5 Indemnities provided 30.7 2.3 33.0 Net consideration 201.6 3.9 197.7 Less: Net assets liabilities disposed 239.0 3.7 235.3 Disposal related costs 7.5 0.5 8.0 Loss on disposal of discontinued operations 44.9 0.7 45.6 prior to reserve recycling Recycling of gains on translation of foreign operations 43.0 43.0 Recycling of gains on hedged derivative financial instruments from reserves 8.0 8.0 Exceptional gain loss on disposal 6.1 0.7 5.4 The offshore disposal reflects the majority of the offshore BPO operations, which excludes the consideration and net assets related to the smaller but separate disposal transactions of operations in the Middle East that are subject to separate completion in 2016.
As at 31 December 2015 the net assets relating to the Middle East were 15.0m and expected consideration in respect of the disposal was 15.0m.
The UK onshore business is being sold or transferred as components to various different purchasers.
One element was sold in the year and the elements remaining at the year-end are expected to be sold or transferred during 2016.
Other exceptional operating items arising on discontinued operations In 2015 a charge of 2.2m 2014: 8.7m has arisen in discontinued operations in relation to the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review.
During 2015, an impairment test of the Global Services business was conducted as a result of the offers received in the year together with movements of the assets held for sale since the end of 2014.
The impairment testing identified a non cash exceptional impairment of goodwill relating to discontinued operations of 65.9m 2014: 284.8m as a result of a reduction in the carrying value of net assets due to a decrease in the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU: this was recorded at the half year.
Assets other than goodwill have also been impaired by a total of 14.9m 2014: 39.2m.
The impairment of goodwill relates primarily to the offshore Global Services business, the majority of which was disposed of on 31 December 2015, and the other asset impairments to the UK onshore business.
Strategic Report Finance Review 59 Exceptional finance costs In December 2014, agreement was reached for the Group to defer its December 2014 covenant test until 31 May2015.
As a result, costs were incurred in 2015 to preserve the existing finance facilities.
In addition, payments were made to the US Private Placement USPP Noteholders as a result of early settlement following the Group refinancing.
Total charges of 32.8m have been treated as exceptional items as they are outside of the normal financing arrangements of the Group and are significant in size.
Other finance costs and investment income on continuing and discontinuing operations Investment income of 8.2m 2014: 6.2m principally relates to interest earned on deposits during the period of 3.2m and interest accruing on net retirement benefit assets of 4.9m.
Other finance costs of 40.2m 2014: 42.9m principally relate to interest incurred on the USPP loans and the Revolving Credit Facility 24.7m, facility fees and other charges 7.2m and the movement in discount on provisions 5.6m.
In total, pre-exceptional net finance costs were 32.0m 2014: 36.7m.
Taxation on continuing and discontinuing operations Our tax strategy is to manage all taxes to ensure that we pay the appropriate amount in the countries in which we operate, while both respecting applicable tax legislation and utilising appropriate legislative reliefs.
Our strategy is aligned with the Groups business strategy and endorsed by the Board.
Responsibility for tax strategy and risk management sits with the Chief Financial Officer.
Day to day delivery of the strategy is executed by a global team of tax professionals who are aligned with our businesses and who work closely with local tax authorities and local advisers.
Tax charge In 2015, we recognised a tax charge of 36.7m on a pre-tax and pre-exceptional profit of 100.7m representing an effective tax rate of 36.4%.
The tax charge on an underlying basis, reflecting Underlying Trading Profit of 96.0m less pre-exceptional net finance costs of 32.0m, was 30.5m, representing an effective tax rate of 47.7%.
A 3.1m tax credit was also recognised on exceptional losses of 220.3m.
The principal reasons for the absence of a tax credit on these exceptional costs is that no UK deferred tax asset is being recognised in respect of UK costs and no tax deduction is available for the impairment of goodwill in any territory.
The credit of 3.1m represents tax relief on restructuring costs in overseas territories and the benefit of a tax credit from losses sold to joint venture partners.
The principal reasons why the effective tax rates are higher than the UK standard corporation tax rate of 20.25% are due to higher rates of tax on profits arising on our international operations, together with the absence of any deferred tax credit for losses incurred in the UK which includes the result of UK divisions, the majority of corporate costs and certain interest costs.
The increase in the effective tax rate has been partially offset by a tax credit on the recognition of additional deferred tax assets that were not previously recognised on provisions in Australia.
Our tax charge in future years will continue to be materially impacted by our accounting for UK deferred taxes.
To the extent that future UK tax losses are not recognised, our effective tax rate will be higher than prevailing standard corporation tax rates as we will not be able to recognise the associated tax benefits arising.
To the extent that our existing UK tax losses are subsequently recognised or utilised, our effective rate will be impacted by the associated tax benefit and will reduce accordingly.
Financial Statements Directors Report Strategic Report 60 Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Finance Review continued Contingent tax assets At 31 December 2015, the Group has gross estimated unrecognised deferred tax assets of 1.05bn 195m net, which are potentially available to offset against future taxable profits.
These principally relate to tax losses of 890m.
Of these tax losses, 761m arise in the UK business net 137m 584m arising in Serco Limited, the Groups principal UK trading entity: the remaining 177m of tax losses arise in other UK group companies.
Of the net 137m of UK tax assets in respect of losses, only 10.5m is recognised on the balance sheet on the basis of forecast utilisation against future taxable profits, with the remaining 126.5m being a contingent asset not recognised.
Taxes paid Net corporate income tax of 9.4m was paid during the year, relating primarily to our operations in Americas 2.2m, India 6.7m, Middle East 1.3m, Europe 3.6m and offset by tax refunds arising in AsPac 4.4m in respect of prior years.
The Groups UK operations have been loss making overall and accordingly no tax payments have been due.
During the year the Group has transferred tax losses to its profitable joint ventures in return for cash payments from the joint ventures of 6.7m, resulting in an overall tax paid figure in our cash flow of 2.7m.
Dividend As indicated in March, the Board is not recommending the payment of a dividend in respect of the 2015 financial year.
The Board is committed to resuming dividend payments when it is prudent to do so.
The Directors decision as to when to declare a dividend and the amount to be paid will take into account the Groups underlying earnings, cash flows and financial leverage, together with the requirement to maintain an appropriate level of dividend cover and the market outlook at the time.
Share count and earnings per share The equity placing conducted in May 2014 and Rights Issue in April 2015 increased the weighted average number of shares for earnings per share EPS purposes to 986.5m 2014: 655.1m.
The annualising effect of the Rights Issue will further increase the weighted average number of shares to approximately 1,099m for 2016.
EPS before exceptional items from both continuing and discontinuing operations was 6.55p per share: including the impact of exceptional items there was a loss of 15.47p per share.
Underlying EPS was 3.44p per share.
This measure reflects the Underlying Trading Profit 96.0m and deducts pre-exceptional net finance costs including those for discontinued operations and related tax effects.
Cash flow and reconciliation to net debt The table below shows the operating loss and Free Cash Flow reconciled to movements in net debt.
Free Cash Flow is the cash flow from subsidiaries and dividends received from joint ventures and is stated before exceptional items which are considered non-recurring in nature.
Free Cash Flow for 2015 was an outflow of 16.2m compared to an inflow of 62.2m in 2014.
Operating cash flow before movements in working capital, exceptional items and tax was 82.5m, a reduction of 3.9m from the prior year: included within this are movements in provisions that in the year predominantly reflect the cash outflows in relation to onerous contracts whilst in the prior year the movement reflects the establishing of provisions for onerous contracts identified following the 2014 Contract and Balance Sheet Review.
The year-on-year decrease in other non-cash movements is principally due to the 2014 impairment of working capital items that arose following the Contract and Balance Sheet Review.
2015 free cash flow reflects a 22.6m outflow in working capital from the continued normalisation of balances at the end of the statutory period compared to the average for the period, tax returning to a paid position compared with a small net refund received in 2014 and higher net purchases of tangible and intangibles assets of 36.0m.
The impact of the Contract and Balance Sheet Review was mostly non-cash in nature in 2014, relating principally to provision movements and other impairments.

The reduction in net debt was predominantly due to the Rights Issue and proceeds from the disposal of the offshore private sector BPO business.
The table below provides an analysis of trading cash flow and provides the pre-interest and pre-tax cash flows equivalent to Underlying Trading Profit.
This is derived from the cash flow from operating activities excluding tax items and is shown after net capital expenditure and after dividends received from joint ventures.
Financial Statements Directors Report Strategic Report 62 Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Finance Review continued The percentage conversion of Underlying Trading Profit into trading cash flow is also provided in this table and this is a measure of the efficiency of the business in terms of converting profit into cash before taking account of the impact of interest, tax and exceptional items.
This measure is impacted by provisions related to onerous contracts, and we would expect it to be impacted in future periods by the expected utilisation of OCPs.
2015 2014 Trading cash flow: Year ended 31 December m m Free cash flow from operating activities before exceptional items 16.2 62.2 Add back: Tax paid received 3.4 0.1 Interest received 3.4 2.7 Interest paid 36.1 42.3 Trading Cash Flow 19.9 101.7 Underlying Trading Profit 96.0 113.2 Underlying Trading Profit cash conversion 20.7% 89.8% The Underlying Trading Profit conversion into trading cash flow was 20.7%.
This was due primarily to the cash outflows on provisions movement, including assets held for sale 116.0m, the outflow of working capital of 22.6m in the year from the continued normalisation of balances at the end of the statutory period compared to the average for the period, and from the net purchase of tangible and intangible assets 72.5m.
These reductions to cash were largely offset by the impact of depreciation, amortisation and impairments during the year, including the Underlying Trading Profit benefit relating to assets held for sale, 83.2m, the cash inflows arising from one-time items and the collection of bad debts provided for under the Contract and Balance Sheet review 18.4m and other non-cash items 31.3m.
Analysis of net debt Net debt, including assets held for sale, reduced to 77.5m 2014: 682.8m, predominately due to the proceeds received from the Rights Issue and from the disposal of the offshore private sector BPO business.

The Group has a centralised treasury function whose principal role is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to meet the Groups funding requirements as they arise and that the financial risk arising from the Groups underlying operations is effectively identified and managed.
Treasury operations are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and are reviewed annually.
Financial instruments are only executed for hedging purposes - speculation is not permitted.
A monthly report is provided to senior management outlining performance against the treasury policy and the treasury function is subject to periodic internal review.
Liquidity and funding As at 31 December 2015, the Group had committed funding of 855m, comprising a 480m revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks and 375m of private placement notes.
In addition the Group had a receivables financing facility of 30m.
The principal financial covenants attaching to these facilities are that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA should not exceed 3.5x and the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense should be greater than 3.0x.
In April 2015 the Group raised gross proceeds of 555m from the Rights Issue, of which 450m was used to reduce gross indebtedness see Rights Issue, debt refinancing and covenants overleaf.
Following the disposal of the majority of the offshore private sector BPO operations, the Group was required to offer the net disposal proceeds to the debt holders in prepayment.
Two thirds of the proceeds were offered to private placement note holders at par and one third to repay any outstanding drawdowns on the revolving credit facility nil outstanding at 31 December 2015.
As a result of this process, 113m of private placement notes were repaid on 16 February 2016, leaving 262m of private placement notes in issue at that date.
Interest rate risk Given the nature of the Groups business, we have a preference for fixed rate debt to reduce the volatility of net finance costs.
Our treasury policies require us to maintain a minimum proportion of fixed rate debt as a proportion of overall net debt and for this proportion to increase as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense falls.
As at 31 December 2015, more than 100% of the Groups net debt was at fixed rates.
Interest on the revolving credit facility is at floating rate, however it was undrawn.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to currency exposure on the translation to GBP of its net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
The Group manages this risk where appropriate by borrowing in the same currency as those investments.
Group borrowings are predominantly denominated in GBP and USD.
The Group manages its currency flows to minimise foreign exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where appropriate to hedge net currency flows.
Credit risk Cash deposits and in-the-money financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from counterparties.
The Group manages this risk by adhering to counterparty exposure limits based on external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
Financial Statements Directors Report Strategic Report 64 Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Finance Review continued Rights Issue, debt refinancing and covenants The Group announced in November 2014 plans for new equity to be raised through a Rights Issue and for the proceeds to be used primarily to reduce the Groups indebtedness.
This was launched on 12 March 2015 and received shareholder approval on 30 March 2015.
The equity Rights Issue successfully completed in April2015 raising approximately 555m of gross proceeds 530m net after expenses, with trading in new shares commencing on 17 April 2015 and 549,265,547 new shares being issued.
On 30 April 2015, the Group concluded a refinancing with its lending banks and private placement noteholders.
This included the reduction of gross indebtedness by 450m.
The Groups committed revolving credit facility was reduced in size from 730m to 480m and the maturity date extended by two years to April 2019.
Financial covenants across the Groups funding arrangements are unchanged, reflecting the strengthening of the Groups balance sheet by the Rights Issue.
Fees and expenses relating to the repayment of the Groups borrowings and amendments to the existing finance agreements were 33m, and these included a premium of 25m on the early settlement of private placement notes.
These expenses have been treated as exceptional finance costs.
In accordance with the amended terms of Serco Group plcs borrowing facilities, compliance certificates for the year to 31 December 2014 and 12 months to 30 June 2015 were submitted to its lenders in May and September 2015 respectively, and these showed the Group complied with the financial covenants.
For covenant purposes the definition of Consolidated Total Net Borrowings CTNB represents Group recourse net debt at the balance sheet date adjusted to exclude encumbered cash, loan receivable amounts, and also adjusted to reflect the impact of currency hedges associated with recourse loans.
The covenant definition of EBITDA is the twelve month operating profit of the business before exceptional items, deducting profits from joint ventures and after adding back depreciation, intangible amortisation, share based payment charges and dividends received from joint ventures.
The covenant test for 31 December 2014 was deferred until 31 May 2015.
The covenant definition of EBITDA for 31 December 2014 and the 12 months to 30 June 2015 was amended to exclude the impact of charges arising from the Contract and Balance Sheet Review whilst CTNB was calculated after the proceeds less underwriting charges from the equity Rights Issue.
The covenant test for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2015 are shown below: 2015 2014 As at 31 December m m Operating loss profit before exceptional items 132.7 655.8 Less: Joint venture post-tax profits 37.0 30.0 Add: Dividends from joint ventures 32.5 34.8 Amortisation of other intangible assets 40.5 38.7 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 28.9 41.8 Impairment of property, plant and equipment 2.1 Share based payment expense 9.8 5.4 Balance sheet and contract write-downs in 2014 757.6 EBITDA per covenant 209.5 192.5 Net finance costs 32.0 36.7 Other adjustments 0.6 0.2 Net finance costs per covenant 31.4 36.9 Recourse net debt including assets and liabilities held for sale 77.5 658.2 Encumbered cash and other items 14.2 Proceeds from rights issue less underwriting charge 543.7 Consolidated Total Net Borrowings CTNB 91.7 114.5 Covenant CTNB EBITDA not to exceed 3.5x 0.44x 0.59x Covenant EBITDA Net finance costs at least 3.0x 6.67x 5.22x Strategic Report Finance Review 65 Balance sheet summary The balance sheet at 31 December 2015 is summarised below showing the impact of the assets and liabilities held for sale for each line item.
At the year end the balance sheet had net assets of 282.1m, a movement of 348.3m from the 2014 closing net liabilities position of 66.2m.
The movement is mainly due to the funds raised through the Rights Issue and a reduction in provisions due predominantly to utilisation, partially offset by the impairment to goodwill.

Movements in contract provisions, including those related to businesses held for sale since the 31 December 2014 balance sheet date, are as follows: Total contract Onerous Other provisions Total contract Contract Contract including assets Held for sale provisions as Provisions Provisions held for sale adjustment reported m m m m m At 31 December 2014 447.1 4.9 452.0 21.6 430.4 Charged to income statement 91.8 10.1 101.9 12.8 89.1 Released to income statement 88.8 2.7 91.5 1.3 90.2 Released to income statement exceptional 2.8 2.8 2.8 Utilised during the year 114.1 16.6 130.7 24.7 106.0 Utilised during the year exceptional 10.8 10.8 10.8 Unwinding of discount 5.5 5.5 5.5 Disposals 6.5 0.4 6.9 6.9 FX 8.2 0.3 8.5 8.5 Transfer to trade payables 4.5 4.5 4.5 Assets held for sale 4.9 4.9 Reclassifications 13.3 13.6 0.3 0.3 At 31 December 2015 299.9 13.1 313.0 10.9 302.1 Onerous Contract Provisions OCPs arising from the Contract and Balance Sheet Review in 2014 accounted for 447.1m of the 31 December 2014 contract provisions balance shown above.
A full assessment of the forecasts that form the basis of the OCPs is conducted annually as part of the budgeting process.
In 2015, additional charges have been made in respect of future forecast losses on onerous contracts of 91.8m.
This increase related to revisions to existing contracts of 53.1m and new provisions raised on contracts of 38.7m.
New contract provisions include charges of 34.0m in respect of the Lincolnshire contract, details of which are provided below.
In 2015, releases to the income statement from OCPs were 91.6m, including a release of 62.7m resulting from the renegotiation completed in November 2015 of our contract to operate and maintain a fleet of patrol boats for the Royal Australian Navy.
This contract was the single largest OCP charged in 2014.
Utilisation of OCPs in 2015 was 124.9m: of this 10.8m was utilised against OCPs recorded as exceptional items.
The OCPs arising as exceptional items relate solely to contracts within the UK Frontline Clinical Health sector following the decision in 2013 to exit this sector: this exit was completed in September 2015 when the Suffolk Community Healthcare contract ended.
Below is an update for the largest OCP contracts following the reassessment conducted as part of the annual budget process: Strategic Report Finance Review 67 Armidale Class Patrol Boats ACPB The ACPB contract relates to the operations and maintenance of a fleet of patrol boats for the Royal Australian Navy.
This contract was entered into in December 2003 with an initial design and build phase, after which the fleet became operational in 2007.
Sercos key obligation is to have the fleet available for operations for a fixed number of days a year.
In November 2015, agreement was reached with the Australian Government customer to amend the terms of the ACPB contract.
The main changes agreed within the amendment are for an improved service regime under an enhanced maintenance and remediation scope of works and schedule, for Serco to provide maintenance and remediation work on an agreed cost recovery basis subject to strict expenditure caps and audit processes, and that the contract will end in June 2017 rather than running through to 2022.
Furthermore, under the terms of the Settlement and Amendment Deed, both parties agreed to a mutual release of claims they may have had against each other prior to the point of contract amendment.
As a result of the agreement the OCP forecast has been reassessed resulting in a release of 62.7m.
Commercial and Operational Managers Procuring Asylum Support Services COMPASS The COMPASS contract with the UK Home Office is for the provision of accommodation, transportation and subsistence payments for asylum seekers whilst their claims are being processed.
Claim processing can take from a few months to several years.
This contract commenced in 2012 and provides services in two of the six administrative regions of the contract in the UK: the North West, comprising fourteen Local Authority areas: and Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The contract runs to December 2017, with a further extension of up to two years at the option of the customer.
In 2015, the numbers of service users continued to be volatile, however for the year as a whole utilisation of the onerous contract provision was in line with the forecast expectation.
The forecasts for the contract have been reassessed with the result being that the remaining balance of the provisions as at 31 December 2015 of 89.1m, is considered sufficient to cover the anticipated losses over the remaining contract term.
The final outcome over the contract life will be heavily dependent on the future number of asylum seekers, the volatility of numbers and our ability to find suitable accommodation.
Future Provision of Marine Services FPMS The FPMS contract that commenced in 2007, which has a 15-year duration, provides marine support services to the UK Ministry of Defence MOD dockyard ports of Portsmouth, Plymouth and Faslane as well as support to military exercises and training to the Raasay Ranges.
In 2015 the contract has performed better than expected due largely to lower costs in respect of backfill vessel bookings and dockings, and the revenues from additional taskings from the customer.
The forecasts for the contract have been reassessed with the result being a net release of 2.1m due to both the favourable performance in the year and savings expected in future years from a voluntary redundancy programme run in 2015: partially offset by lower RPI inflation on the contract than previously forecast and costs relating to the purchase of a new vessel.
Financial Statements Directors Report Strategic Report 68 Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Finance Review continued Prisoner Escort and Custody Services PECS The contract provides prisoner transportation between courts and prisons and for the management of prisoner welfare when at court for the Ministry of Justice MOJ.
It was awarded in 2011 and runs for seven years.
In 2015, utilisation of the OCP was slightly higher than originally expected.
The contract is operated with a very challenging KPI regime and in order to meet these KPIs we require a larger workforce than previous envisaged, along with the associated recruitment, training and contract management costs: the forecast for the contact has been reassessed with the result being an increase to the OCP of 11.3m.
In the case of this contract, we have judged that it is unlikely that the customer will wish to extend this contract beyond its minimum term in 2018 on the current basis.
If this judgement proves to be incorrect, further OCP charges may be required.
HMP Ashfield The HMP Ashfield PFI contract commenced in 1999 and runs through to 2024.
In 2013 the operational role of Ashfield changed from a Young Offender Institution to an adult male sex offenders prison, resulting in a changed cost base.
Since the change of operational role of the prison the MoJ has imposed a level of pricing that we dispute, and which would result in substantial losses over the remaining life of the contract.
Discussions with the MoJ around re-pricing proposals are expected to conclude in 2016.
In 2015 performance has been slightly better than expected due to the benefit of in year cost savings.
The forecast for the contract has been reassessed with the result being a release of 8.7m due to the expected future ongoing benefits of the cost reductions and efficiencies delivered in 2015.
Lincolnshire County Council The Lincolnshire contract commenced in April 2014 with a transition phase expected to complete in March 2015 before full operational services were due to commence in April 2015.
The contract is for an initial five year term, commencing April 2015, with a further two extension periods of two years each exercisable at the customers option.
The contract scope is to provide the following outsourced services: information management and technology services and support: back office services including finance, HR and payroll services: and customer services acting as the internal and external point of contact for Lincolnshire County Council and all Council services.
In 2015 the contract had difficulties implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system and resolving these issues has been more complex and protracted than originally anticipated.
While we are making good progress, the full implementation of the new system is not expected until later this year.
The delay has impacted our ability to make the wider service transformation changes needed to make the contract more efficient and also led to operational service difficulties, triggering service credits.
The issues have also resulted in the requirement to increase and maintain additional management and support resources on the contract to remediate the problems faced.
As a result of these factors a charge totalling 34.0m was taken in 2015, comprising a provision for future losses over the remaining term of the contract.
In 2015 5.3m of the provision was utilised against the impairment of assets.
The in-year losses incurred on the contract, of 5.2m, were recorded within Underlying Trading Profit.
The OCPs referred to above account for 76% of the total OCP balance as at 31 December 2015.
Other OCP movements in the year occurred across multiple sectors and geographies in which Serco operates and at 31December 2015 there were no other OCPs that have expected cumulative future losses in excess of 15m.
The other movements include additional charges made in the Americas in respect of revised expectations and contract exits, additional charges relating to our Hong Kong operations, a further provision on a UK Transport contract and new charges made in respect of a Justice and Immigration contract in AsPac.
Strategic Report Finance Review 69 Other Contract and Balance Sheet Review items In addition to the net charge of 3.0m impacting non-exceptional OCPs, there were other adjustments arising in the period on items identified during the Contract and Balance Sheet Review.
These adjustments relate to a number of items including: The releases of other provisions and accruals of 26.5m where liabilities have either been settled for less than the amount provided or accrued or have lapsed due to the passage of time.
The release of allowances for bad debts of 8.5m following the receipt of payments in respect of old outstanding balances.
Additional charges made in the year of 11.1m to increase provisions or settle further liabilities arising on items identified during the Contract and Balance Sheet Review.
The overall net improvement to Trading Profit from OCPs and other Contract and Balance Sheet Review adjustments was therefore 20.9m in the year.
Pensions At 31 December 2015, the net retirement benefit asset included in the balance sheet arising from our defined benefit pension scheme obligations was 94.8m 2014: 101.1m.
The pension scheme asset base is 1.3bn 2014: 1.5bn.

The Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS and this had a surplus of 127.1m 2014: 143.9m calculated under IAS19 rules and is shown in the non-contract specific section of the above table.
Financial Statements Directors Report Strategic Report 70 Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Finance Review continued The decrease in the surplus was driven principally by a decrease in the value of Liability Driven Investment LDI assets in the year.
Certain LDI assets were transferred to a separate gilt portfolio in late December to back the longevity swap and those gilts 50m still contribute to the Schemes overall interest rate and inflation protection but do not fall under the classification of LDI.
Assets have also been disinvested to meet cashflow requirements particularly member benefits over the year.
Of the total net retirement benefit asset of 115.6m 2014: 130.5m, of that related to non-contract specific schemes there was a surplus of 127.1m 2014: 143.9m in SPLAS, a deficit of 11.1m 2014: 13.1m in the Serco Section of the Railways Pension Scheme and a deficit of 0.4m 2014: 0.3m in a small German pension scheme.
The last formal actuarial valuation of SPLAS was undertaken as at 5 April 2012 and showed a deficit of 24m.
The estimated actuarial deficit at 31 December 2015 was approximately 28m 2014: deficit 5m.
The principal difference between the actuarial valuation and the IAS19 valuation relates to the use of a lower discount rate applied to measure the scheme liabilities for the actuarial basis.
The main investments of this scheme are LDI assets that seek to reduce volatility by matching the liabilities of the scheme for changes in interest and inflation rates through a combination of gilts and corporate bonds with inflation and interest swap overlays.
In the period, Serco Caledonian Sleepers Ltd began to trade and the Serco Caledonian Sleeper Shared Cost Section of the Railways Scheme became part of the Group.
As at 31 December 2015 there was a nil deficit on the Serco Caledonian Sleeper Shared Cost Section of the Railways Scheme contract after the franchise adjustment.
Pre-tax ROIC Pre-tax ROIC is calculated as Trading Profit divided by the Invested Capital balance.
Invested Capital represents the assets and liabilities considered to be deployed in delivering the trading performance of the business.
Of the total assets on the balance sheet, Invested Capital assets are: goodwill and other intangible assets: property, plant and equipment: interests in joint ventures: trade and other receivables: inventories: and assets classified as held for sale.
All other assets are excluded from Invested Capital, being: retirement benefit assets: tax assets: derivative financial instruments: and cash and cash equivalents.
Of the total liabilities on the balance sheet, Invested Capital liabilities are trade and other payables and liabilities classified as held for sale.
All other liabilities are excluded from Invested Capital being: retirement benefit obligations: tax liabilities: provisions: obligations under finance leases: derivative financial instruments: and loans.
In 2015 Invested Capital is calculated using the two-point average of the opening and closing balance sheets for the year.
For 2014 a single point was utilised due to the significant reduction in net assets during the year.
For 2015 the return from Underlying Trading Profit was 11.1%.
The composition of Invested Capital and calculation of ROIC is summarised in the table below.

Our Trading Profit results for the year, prepared on a comparable basis to the profit forecast assumptions, are consistent with our reported Underlying Trading Profit of 96m.
Hence, our results for the year are broadly in line with the published Trading Profit forecast of around 90m.
