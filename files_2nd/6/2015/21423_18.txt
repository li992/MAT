This increase in profit was driven by an improved combined ratio aided by an increase in releases from prior year claim reserves as well as experiencing a smaller foreign exchange loss in 2015 relative to the prior year, which had a favourable impact on profit of $2.6m.
These effects more than compensated for the lower investment return.

Rates on renewal business on average decreased by 2% across the portfolio.
We have continued to adjust our underwriting appetite in areas where competition is most intense.
Our portfolio by business division has remained broadly unchanged from 2014.
We continue to operate a diversified portfolio by type of business and geographical location, and have grown our business across three of the six divisions during 2015.
The charts above highlight how we achieve diversification by product mix, geography and type of business.
Reinsurance purchased Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: to enable the group to put down large, lead lines on the risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
The amount the group spent on reinsurance in 2015 was $367.8m 2014: $289.1m.
The increased purchases in 2015 reflects Beazleys strategy of implementing reductions in risk appetite by increasing reinsurance rather than reducing our market profile via lower gross writings.
Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims and expenses to total net earned premium.
A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio has decreased in 2015 to 87% 2014: 89%, maintaining our five year historic average of 90%.
It is worth pointing out that the calculation of the combined ratio for Beazley includes all claims and other costs to the group but excludes foreign exchange gains or losses.
We believe this represents the most transparent and useful measure of operating performance as it ensures that all of the costs of being in business are captured, whether directly linked to underwriting activity or not.

There has been minimal exposure to natural catastrophes throughout the year.
Reserve releases Beazley has a consistent reserving philosophy, with initial reserves being set to include risk margins that may be released over time as and when any uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range 5-10% above the actuarial estimates, which themselves include some margin for uncertainty.
The margin held above the actuarial estimate was 8.2% at the end of 2015 2014: 7.1%.
This margin has remained stable over time and is a lead indicator for the sustainability of reserve releases.
However, it is important to recognise that claims reserve uncertainty is significant for Beazley and a positive lead indicator will not always equate to future releases.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
There was an overall increase in reserve releases in 2015 compared to 2014.
This was driven by the reinsurance division experiencing a benign claims environment in both 2014 and 2015, thus allowing further reserves to be released.
The increase was also attributable to our specialty lines division increasing their reserve releases as the post recession portfolio from 2012 onwards matures: a trend which we expect to see continuing.
Please refer to the financial statements for information on reserve releases and loss development tables.
com Annual report 2015 41 Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased during 2015 to $663.8m from $658.9m in 2014.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2015 2014 $m $m Brokerage costs 362.8 349.7 Other acquisition costs 85.8 91.5 Total acquisition costs 448.6 441.2 Administrative expenses 215.2 217.7 Total acquisition costs and administrative expenses 663.8 658.9 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premium they remain consistent at 21% year on year.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with accounting standards.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity e. g. underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
In 2015 the expense ratio reduced for the first time for a number of years.
Exchange rates helped, but not withstanding that, this was a testament to the companys expense control and was achieved despite increasing the level of investment in the business.
Foreign exchange The majority of Beazleys business is transacted in US dollar which is the currency we have reported in since 2010 and the currency in which we hold the companys net assets.
Changes in the US dollar exchange rate with sterling, the Canadian dollar and the euro do have an impact as we receive premiums in those currencies and the majority of our staff still receive their salary in sterling.
Part of this impact, generated by IFRSs treatment of the unearned premium reserve as a non-monetary item, is purely timing with FX profits and losses which unwind in the subsequent period.
Beazleys FX loss taken through the profit and loss in 2015 was $9.7m 2014: $12.3m.
Investment performance Financial markets saw significant volatility in 2015, influenced by slowing economic growth in China, and emerging markets more generally, as well as the associated fall in commodity, and particularly energy, prices.
The prospects for an increase in US interest rates, which eventually happened in December, also affected markets throughout the year.
Against this background global equities, in local currency terms, ended 2015 just 1.3% higher, having been down more than 6% earlier in the year.
Credit spreads on corporate debt widened significantly, particularly at lower credit ratings, where deteriorating conditions for energy related issuers had a significant effect.
Risk free yields in the US also moved higher, with shorter maturities most impacted as the yield curve flattened in anticipation of higher interest rates.

These assets returned 0.7% in 2015, helped by having no material exposure to the worst affected high yield debt issuers.
An element of our assets is invested in more volatile asset classes, seeking to generate additional return in the medium term.
This part of our portfolio performed well in 2015 as equity linked investments returned 4.5% and significantly outperformed the global equity market, while our hedge fund portfolio produced a strong 7.2% return.
Our illiquid credit investments have grown, but remain limited, at 2% of portfolio value.
They returned 1.4% in this period.
Our overall investment return for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 1.3%, or $57.6m 2014: $83.0m: 1.9%.
Although the contribution from investments is lower than last year, we believe this is a good outcome in the context of difficult investment conditions.
At 31 December 2015, the weighted average duration of our fixed income investments was 1.7 years 2014: 1.8 years.
Looking ahead to 2016, available yields on high quality debt investments remain low, but are generally expected to rise, whilst ongoing concerns about the prospects for global economic growth will create continuing headwinds for equity and corporate debt investments.
In this environment it will remain very difficult to generate significant investment returns.

The chart on page 43 shows the increase in our group funds since 2011.
Beazley sold most of its asset backed securities during 2015 in preparation for revised regulatory requirements under Solvency II.
The significant increase in the cash and cash equivalent position of $676.9m 2014: $364.2m is temporary and was the result of some movements of funds between Beazley Re and Beazley plc in December in preparation for Solvency II going live on 1 January 2016.
We expect the cash position to reduce back towards normal levels during 2016 following the significant special dividend payment and the reinvestment of the asset backed securities proceeds.
Tax Beazley is liable to corporation tax in a number of jurisdictions, notably the UK and Ireland.
Our effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate driven by the Irish and UK tax rates.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 12.3% 2014: 16.9%.
The reduction compared to 2014 was due to a number of prior year tax adjustments in 2015 that were all in the groups favour where as in 2014 the reverse was true.
In 2015, it was announced that the UK corporation tax rate will be reduced to 18% by 2020.
This reduction in the UK tax rate will reduce the groups future current tax charge.
The UK government also passed the diverted profits tax early in 2015.
We have considered the implication of this and are of the view that this tax should not apply to Beazley see note 9.
