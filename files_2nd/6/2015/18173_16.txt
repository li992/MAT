In addition, finance charges were impacted by the final interest charges relating to the unwind of the discount on the deferred consideration for the purchase of Damax AG for 0.7 million which was finalised and agreed in June 2015.
These one-off costs have been partially offset by higher than normal interest charges paid by French government customers for overdue receivables.
On an adjusted basis, prior to the interest on Customer Specific Financing CSF, net finance costs were 0.2 million in 2015 2014: 0.3 million income.
CUSTOMER SPECIFIC FINANCING In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are financed by leases or loans.
The leases are secured only on the assets 4 that they finance.
Whilst the outstanding balance of CSF is included within the net funds for statutory reporting purposes, this balance is offset by contracted future receipts from customers.
Whilst CSF is repaid through future customer receipts, Computacenter retains the credit risk on these customers and ensures that credit risk is only taken on customers with a strong credit rating.
The Group does not expect a material increase in the level of CSF facilities, partly as the Group applies a higher cost of finance to these transactions than customers marginal cost of finance.
TAXATION 1 1 The adjusted tax charge on ordinary activities was 19.8 million 2014: 20.3 million, on an adjusted profit before tax of 86.9 million 2014: 81.1 million.
The effective tax rate ETR was 22.8 per cent 2014: 25.0 per cent.
The 2015 ETR is lower than the previous year due to a change in 1 geographic split of adjusted profit before tax with significantly lower losses in France being the primary influence.
The statutory tax charge was 23.7 million 2014: 21.3 million on profit before tax of 126.8 million 2014: 76.4 million.
This represents a statutory tax rate of 18.7 per cent 2014: 27.9 per cent.
The exceptional gain on the sale of RDC of 42.2 million recorded in the statutory profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 is not subject to taxation and is the major reason for the movement in the statutory tax rate.
The Groups adjusted tax rate continues to benefit from losses utilised on earnings in Germany and also from the reducing corporation tax rate in the UK.
As the German tax losses continue to be utilised, the deferred tax asset, previously recognised as an exceptional tax item, is no longer 1 replenishing.
The utilisation of the asset impacts the statutory tax rate but is considered to be outside of our adjusted tax measure.
In 2015 this impact increased the statutory tax rate by 3.2 per cent.
1 From 2017 onwards the Group expects an increasing adjusted tax rate as the impact of the German loss utilisation manifests itself through 1 an increasing cash tax payment.
In 2016, the German adjusted ETR is expected to increase to circa 22 per cent from circa 15 per cent in 2015 1 increasing to, and settling at, circa 32 per cent in 2018 with a direct effect on the Group adjusted ETR.
At 2015 levels of profitability the increase 1 in German cash tax would raise the 2015 Group adjusted ETR from 22.8 per cent to 27.8 per cent by 2018.
A Group Tax Policy was produced during the year and approved by the Audit Committee and the Board.
The Group makes every effort to pay all the tax attributable to profits earned in each jurisdiction that it operates in.
The Group does not artificially inflate or reduce profits in one jurisdiction to provide a beneficial tax result in another and maintains approved transfer pricing policies and programmes, to meet local compliance requirements, particularly given the implementation of the Group Operating Model.
Virtually all of the statutory tax charge in 2015 was incurred in either the UK or German tax jurisdictions.
Computacenter will recognise provisions and accruals in respect of tax where there is a degree of estimation and uncertainty, including where it relates to transfer pricing, such that a balance cannot fully be determined until accepted by the relevant tax authorities.
There are no material tax risks across the Group.
The table below reconciles the statutory tax charge to the adjusted tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2015.

The principal item was the gain on the sale of RDC of 42.2 million.
The sale occurred on 2 February 2015 with cash proceeds net of disposal costs of 59.8 million.
Further Social Plan provisioning in France of 1.5 million was required during the year.
Whilst costs incurred against the existing level of the Social Plan provision have been at an expected level, further redundancy scope has been added to the Social Plan during the year with un-forecasted additional support to certain employees within the plan.
An additional provision for legal costs of 0.4 million is included within this and has been made due to pending litigation stemming from appeals lodged by some employees within the plan.
Further detail on these claims can be found in note 24 to the Financial Statements on page 123.
A release from the onerous contracts provision in Germany has been made for 0.4 million.
This represents better than forecast performance over the year from the two remaining contracts resulting in less utilisation of the provision than planned.
The initial contractual period for the two remaining contracts finishes in 2016.
EARNINGS PER SHARE 1 The adjusted diluted earnings per share has increased in line with profit performance by 21.1 per cent from 44.1 pence in 2014 to 53.4 pence in 2015.
The statutory diluted earnings per share has increased from 40.0 pence in 2014 to 82.1 pence in 2015, primarily driven by the impact of the gain on disposal of RDC.

4 The Group remains highly cash generative and net funds continues to build on the Group balance sheet.
Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a robust capital base and to maintain a strong credit rating whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
If further funds are not required to be available for investment within the business, either for fixed assets or working capital support, and the distributable reserves are available in the Parent Company, we will aim to return the additional cash to investors through one-off Returns of Value.
Dividends are paid from the standalone balance sheet of Computacenter Plc, and as at 31 December 2015, the distributable reserves are approximately 166.7 million.
Ahead of changes to dividend taxation which will take effect on 6 April 2016, we are pleased to announce a second interim dividend for 2015 the Second Interim Dividend of 15.0 pence per share, in lieu of a final dividend for 2015.
The second interim dividend will be paid on 5 April 2016.
The dividend record date is set on Thursday 24 March 2016, and the shares will be marked ex-dividend on Wednesday 23 March 2016.
This has been agreed with the London Stock Exchange, given that these dates fall outside its normal dividend procedure timetable.
Following the payment of a first interim dividend for 2015 of 6.4 pence per share on 16 October 2015, the total dividend per share for 2015 will be 21.4 pence per share.
The total dividend per share for 2014 was 19.8 pence per share for those shares in existence immediately after the Share Consolidation.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Details of the Groups capital management policies are included within note 26 to the Financial Statements.

In addition to the final 2014 dividend paid in June 2015 of 15.8 million and the interim 2015 dividend paid in October 2015 of 7.7 million, the Group had a net cash outflow arising from the disposal of RDC and the Return of Value of 43.2 million.

The Group continued to deliver strong cash generation from its operations in 2015, with net cash flow from operating activities of 93.9 million 2014: 94.4 million.
During the year material improvements were made in the collection of overdue debt within the French business.
The Finance Shared Service Centre in Budapest has standardised and focused cash collection processes and cleansed a number of issues stemming from the poor ERP implementation in 2013.
This, coupled with the disruption from the Social Plan implementation which led to backlogs preventing the timely processing of transactions, impacted cash collection and payment of invoices.
Along with a drive from Senior Group Management the legacy collection and system related invoicing issues are now understood and have been largely resolved.
The French debt balance overdue by more than 60 days has decreased to under 4.6 million at 31 December 2015 from 17.6 million at 31 December 2014.
In the year we spent 20.6 million 2014: 17.7 million on capital expenditure, primarily on investments in IT equipment in our business and software tools, to enable us to deliver improved service to our customers.
Whilst the cash position remains robust, the Group continued to benefit from the extension of an improvement in credit terms with a significant vendor, equivalent to 47.8 million at 31 December 2015, an increase of 9.2 million from 31 December 2014.
This improvement in credit terms has been in operation since 2009 and whilst the continuation of these terms is not guaranteed and can be withdrawn at any time, the terms are generally available to all material partners of that significant vendor.
CSF decreased in the year from 9.3 million to 5.9 million.
CSF remains low compared to historical levels due to a decision to restrict this form of financing in light of the current credit environment and reduced customer demand.
4 The Groups Net Funds position takes account of current asset investments of 15 million.
4 Net Funds excluding CSF decreased from 128.5 million to 126.7 million by the end of the year.
