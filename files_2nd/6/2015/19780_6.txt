CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND NON-FINANCIAL KPIS Our overall performance for the year has been extremely encouraging in a number of key respects: continuing strong organic growth with service numbers up by 208,753 2014: 305,100 low churn lower delinquency higher proportion of Members taking our Double Gold bundle healthy increase in the number of new Partners positive reviews and recognition from Which?
for both energy and telephony services consistently high Net Promoter Scores Against the background of a broadly flat economy, and with household incomes remaining under pressure, our value-based consumer proposition and the part-time income opportunity we offer are extremely attractive to both Members and Partners respectively.
Our continuing strong organic growth is underpinned by high levels of confidence amongst our Partners in our brand and financial strength, the good value we provide, and our commitment to delivering best-in-class service and support to our Members.
Members 2015 2014 Residential Club 551,322 495,234 Business Club 30,191 29,098 TOTAL CLUB 581,513 524,332 In addition, there are 5,700 predominantly small-business customers within our TML subsidiary, which does not form part of our core Discount Club proposition.
We will therefore no longer be including or reporting any customer or service numbers for TML, although the relatively modest financial contribution it makes will continue to be reflected in the consolidated group numbers.
Within the residential Club, there is a significant difference in average expected lifetimes between Members and therefore in the revenues and profits they will generate, depending on whether they are an owneroccupier, and on the number of services we are providing to them.
The most attractive category, with a calculated expected average lifetime of over 25 years, are owneroccupiers taking our Double Gold bundle.
We have therefore recently made it even more attractive for them to take this bundle from us, by introducing a range of additional ongoing benefits and a new two-year fixed energy tariff which are only available to owner-occupiers both new and existing Members : these have replaced the introductory broadband discount previously only offered to new Members taking our Gold Talk and Double Gold bundles, irrespective of the type of housing they occupied.
12 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements This focus on attracting Members who will have the highest lifetime value has been reflected in an increasing proportion of new Members signing up for Double Gold and switching all their services to us Landline, Broadband, Mobile, Electricity and or Gas to us: PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEMBERS TAKING DOUBLE GOLD BUNDLE In the first two months of the current quarter, and following the recent changes to our proposition, the proportion of Double Gold amongst new Members gathered by our Partners had further increased to over 29%.
Overall churn within our membership base has remained close to the record low we reported last year.
This is best illustrated by the level of individual energy supply point churn, which has remained below 1% per month on average, notwithstanding the widening gap between the introductory fixed price deals available from other suppliers and the range of competitive variable tariffs we offer: ENERGY SUPPLY POINT CHURN Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 13 FY11 16.3% Q1 FY15 21.1% FY12 13.3% Q2 FY15 24.6% FY13 11.2% Q3 FY15 23.6% FY14 10.4% Q4 FY15 27.7% FY15 11.2% CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW CONTINUED Average revenue per Member has shown a modest decrease during the year due to falling average energy consumption during another mild year, a full year impact from the lower dual fuel energy prices which became effective on 1 February 2014, and a small impact from a further reduction in domestic gas prices from 1 March 2015: AVERAGE REVENUE PER MEMBER These revenue figures relate solely to our Customer Management operating segment, the figures for 2008 to 2014 inclusive are restated We enjoy high levels of overall satisfaction within our membership base, as evidenced by the positive reviews we receive from Which?
magazine on a regular basis, the feedback we receive from the surveys we send out each month to Members who have contacted our call centre, and the low level of complaints made by our Members to the various industry ombudsmen.
This feedback is reflected in our consistently positive Net Promoter Score of around 45 against a background where many other suppliers in the utility and telecoms sectors achieve negative scores: indeed, our high positive score would have put us in second place overall out of more than 60 brands across nine sectors including mobile and internet in the most recent Satmetrix report April 2015, and is almost double the latest score of 23 reported by British Gas.
