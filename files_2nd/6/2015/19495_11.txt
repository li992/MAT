ROTORK ANNUAL REPORT 2015 38 FINANCIAL REVIEW THIS YEAR SAW MORE FOCUS ON MEASURES TO CONTAIN COSTS AND TO ACCELERATE COST REDUCTIONS IN SOME AREAS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET CONDITIONS.
Underlying market conditions were challenging in 2015 with a number of factors negatively impacting the Group.
Despite these headwinds we continued to look for growth opportunities wherever we could, investing in new products and new sales channels, and continuing to explore opportunities for both organic development and acquisitions.
This year also saw more focus on measures to contain costs and to accelerate cost reductions in some areas in response to market conditions.
The second half of the year saw a reduction in both order intake and revenue compared with the first half of the year on both a reported and organic constant currency OCC basis, with OCC order intake 8.6% lower in the second half and revenue 1.1% lower.
Full year order intake of 526.0m was 11.7% below 2014 but on an OCC basis this was a 15.2% reduction as the currency headwind was more than offset by the contribution from acquisitions.
Revenue of 546.5m was 8.1% lower than the prior year, or 11.9% on an OCC basis, and as this exceeded order intake resulted in the order book reducing in the year by 17.5m 9.5%.
The reduction in revenue resulted in lower margins with gross margins reducing from 48.0% to 45.7%, Jonathan Davis although the key elements within cost of sales Finance Director were managed closely to mitigate the effect of the adverse conditions during the year.
Material costs are the largest element of cost of sales and are an area where sourcing initiatives have consistently driven savings.
This year these initiatives were accelerated and as a result the material cost percentage increased by just 100 basis points.
Our diverse product portfolio means that breaking this down into cost, sales price and mix impacts is particularly challenging but this does illustrate that the impact of pricing pressure was contained.
Labour costs were managed through a recruitment freeze and reduced overtime and so remained at the same percentage of sales as in 2014.
The largely fixed cost associated with our factories and service facilities accounted for the remaining reduction in gross margins.
