The costs associated with our strategic investments include the Academy at 5.5 million 2014: 4.1 million, our Asian operations at 7.5 million 2014: 3.6 million and our back office infrastructure development at 18.1 million 2014: 11.9 million.
The additional FSCS levy and these investment costs affect all the profit measures.
