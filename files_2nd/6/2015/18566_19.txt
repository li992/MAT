98 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Underlying Revenue and PBITA Underlying revenue was 6,433m, an increase of 4.0% on 2014.
Emerging markets grew 8.6% year on year, with revenues of 2.3bn, and now represent 35% of group revenue 2014: 34%.
Developed markets revenues were 1.6% higher than the prior year with strong growth in North America of 5.8% and growth in Europe of 2.6%.
UK & Ireland revenues declined by 3.0% as the UK Electronic Monitoring contract ended in Q1 2014 and with the loss of a large retail contract in cash solutions in Q4 2014.
p. to 19.1% 2014: 19.8% but was offset by a 2% reduction in underlying selling, general and administration costs.
Underlying PBITA of 427m up 5.7% 2014: 404m represents the continuing operations of the group.
We saw effects of the slowdown of commodities and oil prices in the global markets in particular affecting some of our businesses in Africa and Latin America but were able to offset these with the benefits from our productivity programmes on direct labour efficiency, route planning, telematics and focus on organisational efficiency.
The benefits from our productivity programmes also allowed us to make the necessary investments in IT and procurement and to continue to invest a further 7m in sales and business development capability.
Corporate costs of 50m are 10m lower than for 2014 and benefit from cost and organisational efficiency offset by the investment in group procurement and ITcapability.
Portfolio businesses identified for sale or closure The group made further progress with its portfolio management programme and since 2013 we have sold or are exiting 61 businesses with annualised revenues of c. 1.2bn and operating losses of 30m, based on the last full year when each of these businesses formed part of the group.
This programme is greatly improving the groups strategic focus and has also realised 281m in disposal proceeds in relation to the 23 businesses sold to date.
Since 31 December 2015, a further four businesses have been identified for sale, with annualised revenues of 400m.
The groups on-going portfolio management programme is expected to raise a further 250m to 350m over the next 12 to 24 months.
Restructuring costs The group invested 44m 2014: 29m in restructuring programmes during the year, relating to the multi-year efficiency programme across the group.
During 2014 and 2015 these programmes have focused primarily on transforming the operating model in the regions of UK & Ireland and Europe.
During the second half of 2015 these programmes began to address organisational efficiency in Latin America, Africa and North America.
Specific items 2015 2014 m m Contracts review 65 45 Review of assets and liabilities 17 34 Pension curtailment gain 5 21 Pension claim settlement 7 Total specific items 70 58 Certain specific items have been disclosed separately from the underlying results to provide a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the group.
These include a net 70m 2014: 58m specific items charge, comprising: 65m 2014: 45m charge mainly resulting from revising the estimates and judgements relating to future losses on legacy UK government and PFI contracts, including the Compass contract.
Under the UK Compass asylum seeker contract with the Home Office, the group provides accommodation, transportation and subsistence services for asylum seekers whilst their claims are being processed.
This contract commenced in 2012 and runs to 1 September 2017, with a potential extension of a further two years.
In 2014, an onerous contract provision was recognised in relation to the then-current assumptions regarding asylum seeker numbers, the duration and cost of accommodation and support services.
We experienced a significant increase in the number of new asylum seekers between November 2015 and January 2016 and as a result the number of asylum seekers in our care increased by 9.6% year-on-year.
We have updated the Compass provision based upon our best estimate of the increase in asylum seekers assigned to the group, the availability of suitable accommodation approved by local authorities, the speed of processing of applications by the immigration authority and the costs of support services.
To date, the Compass contract has not been extended and the onerous contract provision has been increased by 20m to 31m covering the period to August 2017.
Should the contract be extended for the period to August 2019 then, based on the assumptions in the current provision being extended for the next two years, a further provision for 57m would be required.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 99 Chief Financial Officers review continued The other principal onerous contract provision relates to a previously identified PFI contract entered into in 2005 and is subject to on-going discussions with the customer.
A best estimate has been made based on a range of possible outcomes including a commercial or dispute resolution process.
A net 5m charge in respect of the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of 17m offset by 12m of pension related gains: 17m 2014: 34m which includes a 1m charge relating to specific items in joint ventures charge as a result of updating the estimates and judgements applied to those assets and liabilities that were included in the balance sheet review performed in 2013.
In 2013 the group carried out a review of the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012, over and above its contract review, taking into account any changes in facts or circumstances since that date.
This exercise required a level of judgement based on the groups then-current understanding of the circumstances surrounding eachissue.
The results of the review were presented within specific items and since then any increase or reversal of provision for those items has been consistently reported as a specific item.
As at 31 December 2015 these estimates and judgements have been updated to reflect any further changes in facts or circumstances during the year to 31 December 2015.
This concludes our review of the carrying value of assets and liabilities from 2012.
All future related changes in estimates will flow through underlying results, unless these are individually material, in which case they will be separately disclosed in specific items, in line with the groups policy see note 3 c. A 5m gain in relation to a pension curtailment as a result of transferring the future pension liabilities of the Netherlands Cash scheme to the industry wide pension fund 2014: 21m settlement gain on transfer of the past and future pension liabilities of the Netherlands Security scheme to the industry wide pension fund.
Other gains of 7m 2014: nil relate to the successful resolution and settlement of certain legacy UK pension claims.
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries and goodwill impairment During the year the group realised a profit on disposal of businesses of 12m 2014: nil.
In addition, the group recorded a goodwill impairment of 66m in relation to a business in Estonia and a number of businesses identified for sale or closure.
Interest Net underlying interest payable on net debt was 88m 2014: 97m : benefiting from lower interest rates on swapped fixed to floating debt and the repayment of a 6.43% US$150m bond in July.
The pension interest charge was 12m 2014: 22m resulting in total net interest costs of 100m 2014: 119m.
Tax A tax charge of 78m 2014: 68m was recognised on underlying profits of 327m 2014: 285m which represents an effective tax rate of 24% 2014: 24%.
The group recognised a statutory tax charge of 50m 2014: 46m on profit before tax of 78m 2014: 128m which represents an effective tax rate of 64% 2014:36%.
The underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 24%, including the impact of a credit of 9m in respect of the recognition of deferred tax assets on carried forward tax losses in various countries where the group expects to utilise those tax losses against projected taxable profits arising in the foreseeable future.
The underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been restated to include the reallocation of certain non-profit based taxes in Latin America from the tax charge into underlying profits.
The impact of this change reduced the underlying effective tax rate by 1% to 24%.
The groups underlying effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of its taxable profits and the respective country tax rates, hence if a higher proportion of future taxable profits arises in high tax countries the underlying effective rate will increase.
The difference between the effective tax rate on underlying and statutory profits is due primarily to the absence of tax relief on goodwill impairments, and the limited tax relief in respect of losses relating to portfolio businesses and restructuring costs.
This limited tax relief results where the group does not have sufficient forecast taxable profits to support the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of all such losses.
100 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Discontinued operations During the year progress was made in the collection of 26m US$40m receivables relating to the sale of the US Government solutions business in November 2014.
As at 31 December 2015, only 8m US$13m receivables remain outstanding and are expected to be collected in the short term.
As at 31 December 2015 no further businesses remain classified as discontinued operations given that the entities currently being managed for sale or closure under the portfolio management programme are not significant enough to the group operations to be presented as discontinued operations under IFRS 5.
Non-controlling interest Underlying profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 22m in 2015, an increase from 18m for 2014, mainly due to the strong performance of businesses in the Asia and Middle East region resulting in an increase in the share of profit accruing to non-controlling partners.
Statutory profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 18m in 2015, only a slight increase from 17m in 2014 due to the partners share of specific items charges in 2015.
Profit for the year underlying and statutory The group reported underlying profit attributable to equity holders underlying earnings of 227m 2014: 199m, an increase of 14.1% for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The groups statutory earnings of 8m 2014: 145m is after losses from portfolio businesses held for sale or closure of 40m 2014: 25m, restructuring costs of 44m 2014: 29m, provisions of 65m 2014: 45m relating to onerous contract provisions, a net 5m 2014: 13m from the review of assets and liabilities offset by pension related gains and a non-cash charge of 106m for amortisation of acqusition-related intangible assets and goodwill impairment 2014: amortisation of 59m related to historical acquisitions, together with the corresponding tax effect.
Earnings per share Underlying earnings per share increased to 14.7p 2014: 12.9p.
Statutory earnings per share was 0.5p 2014: 9.4p.
These are based on the weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,545m 2014: 1,545m.

Cash outflows from portfolio businesses heldforsale or closure were 11m 2014: 4m which are excluded from underlying operating cash flows.
Underlying operating cash flow was 460m 2014: 528m, excluding corporate items in 2014 of 27m relating to the Electronic Monitoring contract settlement with the UK Government.
The reduction in underlying cash flow was mainly due to a temporary increase in working capital associated with the strong growth in the second half of 2015 of 5.4% and the impact of transitioning to a shared service centre in the UK which reversed in the first two months of 2016.
The group invested 104m in capex 2014: 119m and received proceeds of 14m 2014: 159m from the disposal of portfolio businesses.
The net cash flow after investing in the business and proceeds from portfolio rationalisation was 292m 2014:516m.
102 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Net debt The net debt position as at 31 December 2015 was 1,782m 2014: 1,639m.
The groups net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio is 3.3x 2014: 3.0x.
Net debt includes an increase of 36m 2014: 24m due to the effect of foreign exchange translation differences relating to the groups debt held in foreign currencies mainly US dollars and Euros and the translation loss on cash and cash equivalents in emerging markets.
The detailed operating profit to net debt reconciliation is provided and is reconciled to the statutory cash flow on page 102.
The groups business plan supports a net debt EBITDA of 2.5x or lower in the next 12 to 24 months.
Net debt maturity In April 2015, the groups credit rating was confirmed by Standard & Poors as BBBStable.
As of 31 December 2015 the group had cash on hand of 443m and unutilised and committed facilities of 683m.
The group has sufficient borrowing capacity to finance its current and medium term investment plans.
The group has no material debt maturities until May 2017 and has a diverse range of finance providers.
Borrowings are principally in pounds sterling, US dollars and Euros reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets and profits.
During 2015 a 1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility provided by a consortium of lending banks at a drawn margin of 1.0% over LIBOR was put in place.
The facility matures in January 2021, with the option of a one year extension which if exercised gives the group facilities through to January 2022.
As at 31 December 2015 the drawings were US$245m and 155m.
The groups average cost of gross borrowings in 2015, net of interest hedging was 4.0% 2014: 4.1%.
Financing and treasury activities The groups treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance and for managing the groups financial risk arising from currency and interest rate volatility and counterparty credit.
Treasury is not a profit centre and it is not permitted to speculate in financial instruments.
The treasury departments policies are set by the board.
Treasury is subject to the controls appropriate to the risks it manages.
These risks are discussed in note 31 on pages 154 to 158.
To assist the efficient management of the groups interest costs, the group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an A-rated bank.
At year end, credit balances of 55m were pooled with debit balances of 57m, resulting in a net pool debit balance of 2m.
There is legal right of set-off under the pooling agreement and an overdraft facility of 3m.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 G4S plc 103 Chief Financial Officers review continued Significant exchange rates applicable to the group The group derives a significant portion of its revenue and profits in the following currencies.
Closing and average rates for these currencies are shown below.
If December 2015 closing rates were applied to the results for the year to 31 December 2015, underlying PBITA would have remained unchanged at 427 million.
As at At 2015 At 2014 31 December average average 2015 rates rates US$ 1.4734 1.5282 1.651 1.3559 1.3795 1.244 South Africa Rand 22.8124 19.5175 17.863 India Rupee 97.5971 97.9690 100.761 Israel Shekel 5.7347 5.9441 5.896 Brazil Real 5.8359 5.1054 3.872 The sterling value of emerging market revenues around one third of group revenues was adversely affected by the sharp fall in many emerging market currencies and this reduced our statutory PBITA.
Dividend In assessing the dividend, the board considers: the future investment in the continuing business: net debt to EBITDA: satisfying the groups pension obligations: the availability of distributable reserves in the parent company: and reward to shareholders.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 5.82p DKK 0.5615 per share 2014: 5.82p per share: DKK 0.6041.
The interim dividend was 3.59p DKK 0.3793 per share and the total dividend, if approved, will be 9.41p DKK 0.9408 per share, an increase of 1.8% 2014, the interim dividend 3.42p: DKK 0.3198 and the total dividend 9.24p: DKK 0.9239.
The proposed dividend cover is 1.6 times 2014: 1.5 times on underlying earnings.
The boards intention is that dividends will increase broadly in line with underlying earnings over the medium term.
Other information Pensions As at 31 December 2015 the net defined benefit pension obligation on the balance sheet was 355m 2014: 394m or 238m net of tax 2014: 255m of which 205m 2014: 264m related to material funded defined benefit schemes.
At 31 December 2015 the group transferred its Netherlands cash solutions defined pension scheme into the industry wide defined benefit scheme, resulting in a curtailment gain of 5m which was recorded within specific items.
The most significant pension scheme is in the UK and accounts for 74% 2014: 87% of the total material scheme obligations.
The scheme has approximately 30,000 members and further details of the make-up of the scheme are given in note 32 on page 160.
Defined benefit obligation UK scheme 2015 2014 m m Scheme assets 2,029 1,983 Obligations 2,218 2,222 Total UK obligations 189 239 The movement in the UK scheme obligation was as a result of an increase of 45m in the value of scheme assets principally arising from an increase in underlying asset values, as well as by the scheme obligations decreasing by 4m.
The decrease in the obligation is mainly due to the discount rate increasing modestly to 3.8% 2014: 3.7% partly offset by inflation rates increasing to 3.1% 2014: 3.0%.
The group made additional pension contributions of 44m 2014: 42m into the scheme during the year, and the groups current payment profile agreed with trustees in 2012 will result in an increase of next years annual deficit recovery payment to 47m.

104 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps The groups investments and borrowings at 31 December 2015 were a mix of fixed rates of interest and floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The private placement notes in March 2007 and July 2008 and the public notes in May 2009, May 2012 and December 2012 were all issued at fixed rates, whilst the groups investments and bank borrowings were all at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The groups interest risk policy requires Treasury to fix a proportion of its interest exposure on a sliding scale in US dollars, sterling and Euro, using the natural mix of fixed and floating interest rates emanating from the bond and bank markets and by utilising interest rate and cross currency swaps.
Part of the proceeds of the private placement and public notes have been swapped to floating interest ratesand accounted for as fair valuehedges, with a net gain at 31December 2015 of 40m 2014: net gain 49m.
The market value of the pay-fixed receive-variable swaps and the pay-fixed receive-fixed cross currency swaps outstanding at 31 December 2015, accounted for as cash flow hedges, was a net liability of 36m 2014: net gain 9m.
Foreign currency The group has many overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, denominated in various different currencies.
Treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt EBITDA ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, where possible.
The group does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans.
The group believes that cash flow should not be put at risk by these instruments in order to preserve the carrying value of net assets.
At 31 December 2015, the groups US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 83% and 90% respectively, hedged by foreign currency loans.
As at 31 December 2015, net debt held in US dollar and Euro and in those currencies officially pegged to these two currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.5 times EBITDA generated from these currencies 2014: 2.3 times EBITDA.
Tax policy The groups policy in relation to tax is as follows: we manage our tax affairs responsibly and transparently: we only undertake tax planning which aligns with our commercial and economic activity: we endeavour to fully involve our tax team in all significant business developments so that we can fully assess any potential tax consequences of our actions in advance: we utilise tax incentives, reliefs and exemptions in line with the tax legislation: in international matters, we follow the terms of the relevant Double Tax Treaties and OECD guidelines in dealing with such issues as transfer pricing and establishing tax presence: we actively seek open dialogue with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC and other tax authorities, in pursuit of a professional relationship of constructive compliance, with the aim of achieving early agreement on disputed items and obtaining certainty where possible: we provide all relevant information when requested todo so by HMRC or other taxauthorities: if we discover errors in tax returns or correspondence with tax authorities, we disclose and correct them promptly: and we take an active role in contributing to the UK and international tax policy-making process, where relevant, includingtaking part in formal andinformal consultations.
The group operates in a large number of countries and is typically subject to tax in those jurisdictions.
The group employs an in-house team of tax professionals who interface with the regional and country business and finance teams to manage the groups tax risks in a controlled and proactive manner.
The complex international tax environment means that there is always an element of tax risk and uncertainty inherent within the groups operations.
Group companies are routinely subject to tax audits which can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
As and when appropriate, the group obtains advice from external professional firms to support its positions.
As a high-profile provider of public services, the group considers it is important that we increase the publics understanding of tax matters and their trust in larger corporate groups by being transparent about our tax affairs and cooperating with the tax authorities.
By responsibly managing the groups tax affairs in line with our tax policy, the group is also adhering fully to the Confederation of British Industrys seven tax principles.
Corporate governance The groups policies regarding risk management and corporate governance are set out in the Risk management section on pages 46 to 54 and in the Corporate governance report on pages 60 to 73.
