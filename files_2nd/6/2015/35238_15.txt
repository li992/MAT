FINANCE REVIEW 2015 was another strong year for DerwentLondon with substantially improved financial results across the board and further refinancing activity too.
Financial overview Derwent London has reported another very strong combination of NAV and earnings growth for the year ended 31 December 2015 and, as explained below, has also taken a number of steps during the year to further strengthen its financial position and fide-risk its pipeline.
Helped by the issue of shares in January 2015 in connection with our call for early redemption of the 2016 convertible bonds, the Groups net asset value NAV rose by 919.7m to 4.0bn through 2015, an increase substantially higher than the 705.2m recorded in 2014.
After allowing for the new shares issued, diluted EPRA NAV per share was 21.6% higher than the year before, giving a total return for 2015 of 23.0% 2014: 30.1%.
The benets of consistently good lettings and asset management over the last year or so, as well as the renancing activity in 2015 which substantially reduced our interest charge, have been reected in a 31.0% increase in EPRA profit before tax and a 25.0% increase in EPRA recurring earnings per share to 71.34p compared to the previous year.
Backed up by a 5.2% DAMIAN WISNIEWSKI increase in like-for-like net rents in 2015 and positive lettings FINANCE DIRECTOR continuing into 2016, this has encouraged us to raise the final dividend by 10.0% to 30.8p per share.
The total dividend for the year remains well covered at 1.6 times recurring earnings.
Our nancing ratios have all improved again, with the loan-tovalue ratio reduced from 24.0% at December 2014 to 17.8% in December 2015 and net interest cover up from 286% in 2014 to 362% for 2015.
We have also been able to reduce the average IFRS interest rate on debt from 4.22% to 3.93% at December 2015, or down from 3.78% to 3.68% on a cash basis, while paying down net debt by 101.6m during the year and usefully increasing the weighted average unexpired length of our debt facilities.

With a further 105m of long-term 4,000 40 nancing arranged in February 2016, we have the financial confidence to comfortably build out the committed pipeline, which continues to produce a significant level of development 3,000 30 profit, while retaining our financial ratios at attractive levels.
Net asset value growth The overall 627p increase in EPRA NAV per share can be 2,000 20 summarised as follows: 2015 2014 1,000 10 p p Revaluation surplus 581 654 Profit on disposals 39 33 0 Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec EPRA profit after tax 71 57 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Dividends paid net of scrip 30 35 Property portfolio at fair value m LTV ratio % Interest rate swap termination costs 6 2 Net assets attributable to equity shareholders m Dilutive effect of convertible bonds 17 46 Non-controlling interest 8 10 Other 3 7 627 644 A detailed reconciliation showing adjustments from the IFRS NAV to the EPRA NAV is shown in note 37 to the financial statements.
EPRA net asset value per share The contribution to NAV growth per share from property p revaluations has fallen slightly from 2014, due partly to the 4,000 larger number of shares in issue, but, at 581p per share 584p including our share of joint ventures remained at a very high level.
Of this increase, 55% came from an increase in 39 71 estimated rental values adopted by our valuers, 24% from 3,535 581 17 30 8 development profits and a relatively lower 21% from yield shift.
3,500 9 We also made substantial property disposals during the year achieving 39p per share over book values and demonstrating that our valuations are underpinned by market demand.
One of the properties, 9 and 16 Prescot Street, was sold into a joint 3,000 2,908 venture in which the Group has a residual 50% interest.
This is the main reason why the carrying value of our investments increased from 7.4m to 30.7m during the year.
As the 175m convertible bonds due in 2016 were redeemed 2,500 early and converted into new shares in January 2015, there was no further dilution relating to those bonds in 2015.
However, with the Groups NAV per share now over 33.35, which is the conversion price of the 2019 convertible bonds, the fully diluted EPRA NAV per share has taken into account 17p per share of dilution in 2015 in relation to the 2019 bonds.
Note that the earliest date that the 2019 bonds can be converted into new shares is July 2016.

The 20 year swap, for example, varied between 1.7% and m 2.5% through the course of 2015 and, since the year end, 180 has fallen back to well under 2.0%.
These are substantial relative movements but interest rates generally remain at very low levels by historical standards, helping to underpin property yields.
We have continued to monitor these rates and to buy 160 3.3 down swaps from time to time thereby managing our interest 18.1 2.3 152.0 rate exposure.
The mark-to-market cost of all our interest rate 4.5 swaps fell from 25.2m to 17.6m through 2015, the latter 2.6 gure representing less than 2% of year end net debt.
Fair value 4.0 138.4 exposures for our xed rate debt and bonds also closed 140 substantially through the year helping the EPRA triple net asset 7.0 value to increase by 23.7% during the year to 3,463p per share.
Income statement As we progress through the current long London ofce 120 property cycle, there is naturally a greater focus on income generation.
Lettings from recent developments and asset management initiatives have had a tangible impact upon the Groups property income, a trend expected to continue over the next few years.
Gross rental income was up by 8.5% to Lettings 148.3m and net rental income by 7.8% to 138.7m.
Allowing and reviews for the profits from sales of residential apartments and other property income, net property and other income increased by 12.5m or 9.2% to 148.6m for the year.
Property acquisitions added another 4.0m of rental income while the disposals brought it down by 7.0m.
The combination of rental growth and lower finance costs Rent lost from lease breaks, expiries and voids was 2.6m drove the recurring EPRA profit before tax to 81.6m, up and from schemes starting was 4.5m.
An additional 2.3m by 31.0% over the year.
After taking account of property came from various small premiums received and rights of light valuation uplifts, profits on disposals of properties and fair settlements.
The other property income of 3.7m related to value movements, the overall IFRS profit for the year increased compensation received from contractors for schemes at from 749.8m in 2014 to 777.2m for the year ended 40 Chancery Lane, Turnmill and 1-2 Stephen Street which 31 December 2015. were delivered late.
The contracts were at xed prices and the sums recognised partly offset the rent lost in 2015 due to the late completion of the projects.
Administrative expenses increased by 7.0% to just under 30.0m in 2015, due mainly to higher staff salaries and bonuses.
However, finance costs were reduced considerably, by 17.0% to 35.2m, as the total amount of debt fell following the conversion of the 2016 bonds and the average interest rate on that debt was also reduced during the year.
This came mainly from lower margins on our bank facilities but was also achieved by breaking or re-setting swap rates during the year at a cost of 4.0m.
The positive impact of this will be felt for several years.
In addition the start date on a 70m forward start Cost ratios swap was deferred at a cost of 2.4m.

The deferred tax charge for the year was lower than in 2014 at 0.4m as this took 50 account of certain historic tax losses which were previously not recognised.
