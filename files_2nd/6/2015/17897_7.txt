Chief Financial Officer On the other hand, this should also reduce pressure on bidding margins.
The Groups US private placement and committed bank facilities contain certain financial covenants, such as the ratio of the Groups EBITDA to its net debt which needs to be less than 3.0 and the ratio of its EBITA to net borrowing costs which needs to be in excess of 3.0.
These covenants are tested on a rolling 12-month basis as at the June and December reporting dates.
At 31 December 2015, both these covenants were passed as the Group had net cash and net interest income from a covenant test perspective, so the Groups poor trading performance and consequent low level of EBIT had no impact on these tests.
