com STRATEGIC FINANCIAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS FUNDING Funding, and specifically maintaining a robust and flexible financing framework to fund investment and acquisitions, is one of the six key disciplines of the Growth Acceleration Plan.
Funding discipline was enhanced in two important ways in 2015.
The Group issued USD 250m of private placement loan notes, with a maturity of seven years USD 120m and ten years USD 130m and an average interest rate of 4.0%.
This financing funded the USD 110m of private placement loan notes that matured in December 2015.
The Group also extended its five-year 900m revolving credit facility by a further year, meaning that it now matures in October 2020.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had committed funding of 1,474.6m available, comprising a 900.0m revolving credit facility and 574.6m of private placement loan notes.
The revolving credit facility was 359.1m drawn down at31 December 2015 31 December 2014: 455.2m.
The Group had 574.6m of private placement loan notes at 31December 2015 31 December 2014: 462.2m and these range in maturity from December 2017 to October 2025.
Theaverage maturity length of the loan notes is 5.5 years 2014: 4.3 years.
The principal financial covenant ratios under the private placement and revolving credit facility stand at a maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually.
At 31 December 2015 both financial covenants were comfortably achieved.
The ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.2 times at 31 December 2014: 2.2 times calculated as per the Groups facility agreements, using average exchange rates and adjusted for a full years trading for 2015 acquisitions.
The ratio of EBITDA to net interest payable was 14.9times at 31 December 2014: 14.4 times.

com INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED ACQUISITION STRATEGY Another key discipline of the Growth Acceleration Plan is the Groups Acquisition strategy: a targeted and disciplined approach to build scale and capability across priority industry verticals and geographic markets.
Acquisitions are assessed on a case-by-case basis against a broad set of financial and strategic criteria.
For bolt-on acquisitions, these have to meet strict acquisition criteria.
These include delivering returns in excess of the Groups weighted average cost of capital in the first full year and being earnings enhancing in the first full year of ownership.
However for certain acquisitions, the Group will take a longer-term view to allow time for full integration of the acquired business, coupled with additional investment to maximise the long-term returns generated.
In 2015 there was total cash spend of 162.0m 2014: 371.4m on the acquisition of subsidiaries and other intangible assets.
This focused on Academic Publishing and Global Exhibitions.
Principal acquisitions and asset intangible acquisitions are shown in the table below: 2015 net 2014 net cash paid cash paid Acquired businesses other intangible asset acquisitions Division m m Acquisition of subsidiaries net of cash acquired: WS Maney & Son Limited Academic Publishing 21.3 Ashgate Publishing Academic Publishing 19.1 Hanley Wood Exhibitions Global Exhibitions 239.8 Virgo Group Global Exhibitions 85.6 Other 28.4 32.0 68.8 357.4 Other intangible asset acquisitions: FIME asset purchase Global Exhibitions 36.3 US book list asset purchase Academic Publishing 16.2 Other intangible asset purchases 40.7 14.0 93.2 14.0 Total net cash paid on acquisition of subsidiaries and other intangible asset acquisitions 162.0 371.4 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT Continually reassessing the mix and focus of the Group is an additional discipline within the Growth Acceleration Plan.
Thisenables Informa to ensure it is allocating capital to the right areas, where the potential to improve returns are greatest.
In 2015 this led to the disposal of the Consumer Information businesses and in Europe the disposal of the conference businesses in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
Details of alldisposals are provided in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The total profit on disposal of subsidiaries and operations was 9.1m and net cash proceeds were 12.9m.
The combination of the Portfolio Management strategy, and the drive to improve the operational performance of the business inherent in the Growth Acceleration Plan, results in an improved 2015 Group Return on Capital Employed ROCE of 9.2% 2014:8.8%.
DIVIDEND As outlined in the Group Chief Executives Review, there will be a 4.1% increase in the Dividend Per Share for 2015.
The proposed final dividend is 13.55p per share 2014: 12.90p per share representing a 5.0% increase.
Subject to Shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 26 May 2016 to Ordinary Shareholders registered as at the close of business on 29 April 2016.
This will result in total dividends fortheyear of 20.1p per share 2014: 19.3p per share.
The improved earnings performance means the dividend cover on an adjusted earnings basis has remained consistent at 2.1times total earnings 2014: 2.1 times.
