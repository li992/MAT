Underlying diluted earnings per share was 41.07 pence, 2.1% ahead of the prior year 2014: 40.22 pence.
On a statutory basis, Group revenue was 388.4 million, 4.9% ahead of the prior year, with profit before tax of 169.5 million and profit after tax of 131.9 million.
The Group effective tax rate reduced to 22.2% from 24.5% in the prior year, as the fall in the UK corporation tax rate continued to feed through.
Statutory diluted earnings per share was 35.99 pence, down 10.5% from the prior year 2014: 40.22 pence.
Overall, active client numbers for the year were ahead of the prior period by 7.9% at just over 136,000, while average revenue per client was flat at 2,937.
Underlying revenue in the second half of the year was slightly ahead of the first half, with the first half marked by the difference between the two quarters: the first quarter was very subdued, while the second quarter was a record for the Group and contained the record month of October, when increased newsflow and a significant sell-off in financial markets produced more trading opportunities for clients.
Revenue from forex trading increased through the year, returning to more normal levels, with evidence of more volatility in this asset type after a very quiet spell in 2014.
IG remains highly cash-generative and we have sought to reflect this in the direct cash returns to shareholders.
Last year the Board raised the Ordinary dividend payout ratio to approximately 70%.
Although statutory earnings this year are behind due to the impact of the Swiss franc incident, both the business and the market opportunity remain strong.
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the Board made clear at the time of the first half results in January its intention to hold the full-year dividend flat on 2014 at 28.15 pence, and so the Board is recommending a final dividend of 19.70 pence.
