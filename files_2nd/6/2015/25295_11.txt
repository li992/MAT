Throughout this review all numbers are presented on an adjusted basis.
The effective tax rate for the period was 15% 2014: 14%.
Based on the adjusted profit above, the Group generated an ROE of 11.0% 2014: 10.2%, an increase on prior year reflecting higher profits and lower shareholders funds following the 100m share buyback during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 42.0p 2014: 39.9p.
The Group had net current assets of 420.6m 2014: 194.0m at the end of the year.
The increase in net current assets is driven by the cash received from the March Sterling bond and higher levels of assets held for syndication at the balance sheet date.
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 15.1p per share 2014: 14.4p, taking the full year ordinary dividend to 22.0p per share 2014: 21.0p.
In addition, the Board has recommended a 300m special dividend.
During the year 100m has been returned to shareholders through a share buyback.
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AUM as at 31 March 2015 increased to 18,012m 2014: 12,980m, driven by strong fundraising across all types of funds.

The new strategies have introduced new long term revenue streams to the business.
Furthermore, given that a strategy will typically reach profitable maturity on its third fund, the fee stream growth from our new strategies will become more visible into the medium term.
Fees on these new strategies are typically charged on invested 95.8 capital so fee income ramps up as the fund is invested, as can be seen in the fee earning AUM bridge below: M Total Third Mezzanine and Credit Real estate Party Fee equity funds funds funds Earning AUM m m m m At 1 April 2014 3,477 4,747 588 8,812 Additions 1,930 1,879 1,091 4,900 Realisations 468 1,339 70 1,877 FX and other 125 160 157 442 At 31 March 2015 5,064 5,447 1,766 12,277 PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANY FEE INCOME Third party fee income increased 21% in the year to 95.8m 2014: 79.0m, and total fee income increased by 15% in the period to 114.5m 2014: 99.7m, both benefiting from an increase in performance fees.
Excluding mezzanine fund performance fees, third party income increased 6% to 69.2m 2014: 65.1m in the year.

Although an integral part of the fee income profile and profitability stream of the Group, the quantum of performance fees in any particular year is unpredictable.
The raising of ICG Europe Fund VI will benefit third party fees as it charges fees on committed capital from April 2015, following the closure of the final investment in ICG Europe Fund V, and has been included within fee earning AUM at the end of the year.
STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT REPORT STATEMENTS Credit funds third party fee income increased 21% with fees from new funds partially offset BALANCE SHEET by the decrease in fees on older credit funds that are in their realisation phase.
The increase INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO in fees is due to the ongoing European and US CLO programme.
In addition, fee income on Senior Debt Partners continues to rise as the money raised through the original and successor funds is invested.
Fees for our real estate and credit products are typically charged on an invested basis, 1,691 although this has little impact for the CLOs which are invested quickly.
The 67% increase in Real estate third party fee income reflects the investment of money raised for ICG Longbow M Fund III and senior debt mandates.
This trend is expected to continue with the raising and investing of ICG Longbow Fund IV.
The weighted average fee rate, excluding performance fees, across our fee earning AUM is 0.91% 2014: 0.86%.
OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses of the FMC were 75.3m 2014: 65.5m, including salaries and incentive scheme costs.
Salaries were 27.4m 2014: 23.5m as average FMC headcount increased from 160 to 190.
This increase is directly related to investing in the growth areas of the business namely Real Estate and the US teams.
Incentive scheme costs have increased to 19.0m 2014: 13.6m reflecting the higher awards made in May 2014, which are being expensed to the income statement over their vesting period.
Other administrative costs of 28.9m 2014: 28.4m increased more slowly by 2%.
INVESTMENT COMPANY BALANCE SHEET INVESTMENTS The balance sheet investment portfolio decreased 11% in the period to 1,691m at 31 March 2015, as the realisation of older assets was partially offset by new investments.
The impact of the realisations is illustrated in the investment portfolio bridge below: m At 1 April 2014 1,908 New and follow on investments 360 Accrued interest income 119 Realisations 609 Impairments 38 Fair value gains 85 FX and other 134 At 31 March 2015 1,691 Realisations comprise the return of 471.8m of principal, the crystallisation of 93.8m of rolled up interest and 43.2m of realised capital gains.
In the period 209.1m was co-invested alongside our mezzanine funds for new and follow on investments.
In addition, 150.7m was invested across our CLOs and credit funds.
The investment in our credit funds is lower risk as the funds are principally investing in senior debt assets.
The sterling value of the portfolio decreased by 131.2m due to foreign exchange movements.
The portfolio is 57% Euro denominated and 15% US dollar denominated.
Sterling denominated assets account only for 16% of the portfolio.
The Group minimises foreign exchange impact of non sterling assets through non sterling liabilities and derivative transactions.

The use of the balance sheet in this way enables our investment teams to continue to source attractive deals whilst a fund is being raised, and in turn facilitates the fundraising as potential investors can see the types of assets they will be investing in.
NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income of 118.8m 2014: 149.0m comprised interest income of 158.6m 2014: 194.0m, less interest expense of 39.8m 2014: 45.0m.
Interest income was below the prior period due to a decrease in the average IC portfolio.
Cash interest income represented 30% 2014: 31% of the total.
The Group utilised the cash generated from realisations over the last two years to reduce its average borrowings leading to a reduction in interest expense.
Average borrowings and interest expense will increase as the Group re-gears its balance sheet.
DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend income of 3.4m 2014: 19.7m was lower than the prior year due to two equity investments making one-off distributions in the prior year following a refinancing of their debt.
OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses of the IC amounted to 49.9m 2014: 36.6m, of which incentive scheme costs of 30.5m 2014: 22.6m were the largest component.

Of these costs, 5.2m 2014: 2.6m related to the cost of business development, including the establishment of Alternative Credit and Australian Senior Loans teams.

CAPITAL GAINS Net realised capital gains in the year were 46.7m 2014: 140.8m, of which 21.9m 2014: 18.7m had previously been recognised as unrealised gains in the P&L with the remaining 24.8m 2014: 122.1m recognised in the current year.
The prior year included the realisation of the Groups largest equity asset, Allflex.

IMPAIRMENTS Net impairments for the year were, as expected, lower than the prior year at 37.6m 150.1 2014: 112.4m.
Gross impairments amounted to 53.5m 2014: 133.6m and recoveries were 15.9m 2014: 21.2m in the year.

ICGs strong balance sheet positions the Group to generate and realise shareholder value through co-investing into our existing and new funds, investing in new opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.
Accordingly, the Board has recommended that, subject to shareholder approval, 300m of capital is returned to shareholders by means of a special dividend, with an associated share consolidation.
On a pro-forma basis, assuming the proposed special dividend had been paid during the year, shareholders funds as at 31 March 2015 would have reduced to 1,156.4m, increasing gearing to 0.72x.
Further growth in the profitability of the business and the Groups ongoing initiatives to re-gear the balance sheet are expected to result in a further increase in return on equity over the coming year.
