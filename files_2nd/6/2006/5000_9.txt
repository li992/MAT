The balance sheet deficit before related deferred tax decreased from 114.8 million at 30 April 2005 to 50.3 million at 30 April 2006.
The decrease of 64.5 million included net actuarial gains of 54.4 million: the actual return on assets was higher than the expected return, but this was offset by an increase in the schemes liabilities that resulted from a reduction in the discount rate used to value the liabilities, from 5.3% at 30 April 2005 to 5.1% at 30 April 2006.
No changes were made during the year to the assumptions made in respect of the longevity of scheme members.
Outlook We are achieving box price increases, but so far they have been insufficient to recover fully the input cost rises incurred through the supply chain.
Based on current forward energy market prices, we anticipate the increase in our underlying energy costs in 2006 07 will be somewhat higher than the 10 million that we indicated at the time of our trading update in April.
In Office Products Wholesaling, we expect our actions to result in improved performance in the second half of the year.
