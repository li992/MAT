plc Low cost with care convenience Operational and financial review Strategy and business model easyJet is Europes leading low fares airline.
Formed in 1995 by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, it has grown rapidly to become Europes fourth largest airline by passengers carried.
easyJet keeps costs low by eliminating the unnecessary costs and frills which characterise traditional airlines.
This is done in a number of ways: The internet is used to reduce distribution costs.
easyJet was one of the first airlines to embrace the opportunity of the internet when it sold its first seat online in April 1998.
Now over 95% of all seats are sold online, making easyJet one of Europes biggest internet retailers: Maximising the utilisation of substantial assets.
We fly our aircraft intensively, with swift turnaround times each time we land.
This gives us a very low unit cost: Ticketless travel.
Passengers receive booking details via an e-mail rather than paper.
This helps to significantly reduce the cost of issuing, distributing, processing and reconciling millions of transactions each year: No free lunch.
We eliminate unnecessary services which are complex to manage such as free catering, pre-assigned seats, interline connections and cargo services.
This allows us to keep our total cost of production low: and Efficient use of airports.
easyJet flies to main destination airports throughout Europe, but gains efficiencies compared to traditional carriers with rapid turnaround times, and progressive landing charge agreements with airports.
Many have tried to imitate easyJets business model, but few have succeeded.
In addition to all the factors above, our customer proposition is defined by low cost with care and convenience.
This means that whilst we are committed to keeping our costs low, we will provide our customers with a quality product and good service: we fly to main European destinations from convenient local airports: and provide friendly onboard service.
People are a key point of difference at easyJet and are integral to our success.
This allows us to attract the widest range of customers to use our services both business and leisure.
We have a powerful business model, with a strong well-recognised brand across Europe.
With a strong market presence and scale, we are well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in the European low-cost market.
easyJet still has only 6% of the total European market, which is forecast to grow by 5% to 6% per annum.
On this basis we have targeted an annual growth rate of 15% over the medium term.
We will do this by reinforcing our presence on our key routes, whilst identifying new route development opportunities where the product offering meets our goals.
Competitors The markets in which easyJet operates are highly competitive, both from traditional flag carrier airlines such as British Airways, Air France KLM, Iberia and Swiss and from other low-cost carriers such as Ryanair, Air Berlin and Vueling.
We face competition from other airlines on same city-pair routes, from indirect flights, from charter services and also from other forms of transport, such as rail.
There are virtually no routes where we have no competition.
The level of intensity of the competition varies on a route-by-route basis, and depends on the nature of the competitors.
However, most of the competitors we encounter have significantly higher unit costs than us.
As a result, whilst these competitors can on occasion offer lower fares than easyJet, they cannot compete with our fares every day without an adverse financial effect.
Network We have continued to develop the network during the year in a manner that absorbed the 12.1% growth in new capacity.
At 30 September 2006, the easyJet network covered 262 routes and 74 airports, compared to 212 and 64 at the same time last year.
During the year, we have added 11 new cities to the easyJet network: Bordeaux, Bournemouth, Bremen, Istanbul, Lisbon, Marrakesh, Palermo, Rijeka, Rimini, La Rochelle and Split.
A new base was opened at Milan Malpensa during the year, and a further base has been announced at Madrid Barajas for the coming financial year.
22 Annual report and accounts 2006 We remain focused on improving execution and delivery of results by revenue enhancement, network development and cost reduction.
Jeff Carr, Group Finance Director Annual report and accounts 2006 23 plc Low cost with care convenience Operational and financial review continued Resources and relationships Fleet At the end of September 2006, the fleet comprised 35 Boeing 737s and 87 Airbus A319s, giving a total of 122 aircraft, up from the 54 Boeing 737s and 55 Airbus A319s at the start of the financial year.
Details of the fleet at 30 September 2006 are as follows: Future deliveries UnderUnder including Unexercised operating finance Changes exercised options Owned lease lease Total in year options note 1 Airbus A319s 38 43 6 87 32 53 100 Boeing 737-700s 32 32 Boeing 737-300s 33 19 38 78 6 122 13 53 100 Notes: 1 Options may be taken as any Airbus A320 family aircraft and are valid until 2012.
A further 53 Airbus A319 aircraft are planned to be delivered through to September 2009.
This will give us a modern fleet of aircraft that will underpin our high levels of asset utilisation and increase our operational efficiency.
The average fleet age is currently 2.2 years 2005: 3.0 years.
During the year, 20 aircraft which had been under option at 30 September 2005 were converted into firm future deliveries.
On 13 November 2006, easyJet agreed that, subject to shareholder approval, it had converted a further 52 of its Airbus option aircraft to firm deliveries in 2008, 2009 and 2010: furthermore an additional 75 purchase rights had been obtained for aircraft which could be delivered during the period to 2015.
Fleet changes: The total fleet over the period to 30 September 2009 based on contractual commitments, excluding the order pending shareholder approval is as follows: Airbus A319s Boeing 737-700s Boeing 737-300s Total aircraft At 30 September 2005 55 32 22 109 At 30 September 2006 87 32 3 122 At 30 September 2007 107 30 137 At 30 September 2008 120 29 149 At 30 September 2009 140 18 158 Whilst we are very confident of growing the business at this rate, we have contractual rights with Airbus that allow us to moderate or accelerate our capacity growth within certain constraints.
Aircraft financing Of the 32 aircraft that were delivered to easyJet during the year, 16 were mortgage financed through US dollar or sterling loans, two were temporarily cash acquired with mortgage finance drawn after year end, six were sold to lessors and leased back under operating leases, five were financed through sale and finance leasebacks, and three were cash acquired supported by a standby facility.
In addition, one previously delivered mortgage-financed aircraft was restructured into sale and finance leaseback funding in the year.
During the year, we continued to secure financing for the Airbus delivery stream.
We have now committed facilities available for 18 of the remaining 53 Airbus aircraft yet to be delivered.
Three of these aircraft will be subject to sale and leaseback, eight will be financed through mortgage finance, and a further seven aircraft will be supported by the standby facility.
24 Annual report and accounts 2006 Our people At 30 September 2006 there were 4,859 employees in easyJet, an increase of 17.0% during the year from 4,152 at 30 September 2005.
Whilst this was in excess of the growth of the business, the principal reason for this was the commencement of self handling at some of our Spanish airports Alicante, Almeria, Asturias, Palma and Malaga, which has added 204 employees during the year.
After allowing for this change, the rate of increase was 12.1%, in line with the rate of growth of the business, and indicative of managements focus on cost control.

25 EBITDAR is defined by the Group as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, share of profits of associates and lease payments excluding the maintenance reserve component of operating lease payments.
Maintenance reserve costs are charged to the cost heading maintenance.
Financial year 2006 compared with financial year 2005 Key performance indicators Return on equity The Board has set return on equity as the key financial measure at easyJet, since it best represents the return for the year attributable to the equity shareholders.
Return on equity for financial year 2006 was 10.1% up from 7.1% in financial year 2005.
This was driven by a significant improvement in profit before tax and the effective tax rate of the business, but was partially offset by the introduction of new assets of 13.3 million relating to the value of financial instruments on adoption of IAS 39 on 1 October 2005, and 17.9 million relating to the exercise of employee share options.
Management is incentivised through the Long-Term Incentive Plan to deliver increases in return on equity to 15% by 2008.
Profit before tax per seat, revenue per seat and cost per seat Profit before tax per seat is a measure used internally to allow all our people to understand and focus on the return on equity target, since the measures are closely related.
It is the difference between revenue per seat and cost per seat, which are important measures that are used to monitor certain areas of the business.
Profit before tax per seat increased in financial year 2006 by 39.6% from 2.38 to 3.32 as a result of a 7.8% increase in revenue per seat from 38.66 to 41.66 explained in more detail in revenue below, set off against an increase in cost per seat of 5.7% from 36.28 to 38.34.
Cost per seat, excluding fuel Since the significant volatility in easyJets fuel cost is largely dictated by external economic and political factors, we consider that the movement in cost per seat excluding fuel is the best indicator of managements performance in keeping unit costs low.
Cost per seat excluding fuel reduced by 1.5% from 28.78 to 28.36 in financial year 2006.
This was as a result of direct management action to control overheads, despite cost increases resulting from disruption.
Seats flown Seats flown is considered by management to be the best measure of output units of production.
The number of seats flown in financial year 2006 increased by 12.1% from 34.7 million to 38.9 million, as a result of the introduction of new aircraft into the fleet.
28 Annual report and accounts 2006 Income statement Revenue easyJets revenue increased 20.7% from 1,341.4 million to 1,619.7 million, from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
Revenue per seat increased 7.8% from 38.66 to 41.66.
Passenger revenue, the largest component, comprises the price paid for the seat less government taxes, such as Air Passenger Duty and VAT.
It increased by 18.7% from 1,254.2 million to 1,488.4 million, driven by an 11.5% growth in passenger numbers from 29.6 million to 33.0 million, and a 6.4% increase in average fares.
The number of passengers carried reflected a 13.8% increase in the size of the easyJet fleet in operation from an average of 94.0 aircraft to an average of 107.0 aircraft offset by a small decrease in the average load factor achieved from 85.2% to 84.8%.
Growth was particularly strong in continental Europe, with intra-European passenger revenues growing by 61.7%.
The performance at our German bases and the successes of our new bases at Basel and Milan Malpensa were the key drivers to this growth.
Ancillary revenue includes fees and charges including credit card fees, excess baggage charges, sporting equipment fees, infant fees, change fees and rescue fees, profit share from in-flight sales including food, beverages, and boutique items, and commissions received from products and services sold such as hotel bookings, car hire bookings and travel insurance, less chargebacks from credit cards.
In 2006, 131.3 million was earned from ancillary revenues, up 50.6% from 2005.
This has been driven by the 11.5% growth in passengers carried, the positive effect of changes in arrangements for car hire, insurance and in-flight catering and increases in rates for change fees and credit card fees.
Ground handling charges, including salaries easyJets ground handling charges increased by 10.4% from 130.5 million to 144.1 million, from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
The increase in ground handling charges reflects the 10.7% increase in the number of sectors flown, alongside mix costs as a result of network expansion decisions.
Cost savings were achieved as a result of self handling and renegotiated third-party handling in Spain.
As a result, ground handling cost per seat decreased by 1.5% from 3.76 to 3.71.
Airport charges easyJets external airport charges increased by 12.3% from 230.1 million to 258.4 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
This increase was attributable to the growth in passengers carried of 11.5% and inflationary cost increases at regulated airports.
On a per seat basis, costs increased by 0.2% from 6.63 to 6.65.
Fuel easyJets fuel costs increased by 49.0% from 260.2 million to 387.8 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
This change is primarily due to a 22.9% increase in easyJets average US dollar fuel cost per tonne excluding hedging, compared with the previous year, resulting in additional costs to easyJet of 69.4 million.
The weakening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which fuel prices are denominated, provided an additional cost of approximately 11.5 million.
The impact of a significant increase in flying and our hedging activities amounted to 52.5 million.
Set against this was a more fuel efficient fleet of aircraft which provided a benefit of 5.8 million.
On a per seat basis, costs increased by 33.0% from 7.50 to 9.98.
Navigation charges easyJets navigation charges increased by 11.6% from 108.6 million to 121.2 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
This increase was principally attributable to a 15.4% increase in the ASKs flown in financial year 2006.
Cost savings were derived from lower unit charges and a weaker euro.
On a per seat basis, costs decreased by 0.4% from 3.13 to 3.12.
Crew costs easyJets crew costs increased by 17.5% from 136.2 million to 160.0 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
The increase in crew costs resulted from an increase in headcount during the financial year 2006 to service the additional sectors and aircraft operated by easyJet during the year, the increase in salaries, following a new pay deal agreed with our flight crew and cabin crew employees, and the costs of recruitment.
On a per seat basis, costs increased by 4.9% from 3.92 to 4.12.
Maintenance Maintenance expenses decreased by 8.2% from 119.2 million to 109.5 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006. easyJets maintenance expenses consist primarily of the cost of routine maintenance and spare parts and provisions for the estimated future cost of heavy maintenance and engine overhauls on aircraft operated by easyJet pursuant to dry operating leases.
The extent of the required annual maintenance reserve charges is determined by reference to the number of flight hours and cycles permitted between each engine shop visit and heavy maintenance overhaul on aircraft airframes.
The decrease in maintenance costs was largely due to the benefits of new contractual arrangements being negotiated with lower prices, such as with SR Technics, offset by the additional cost of a 10.7% increase in the number of sectors flown.
On a per seat basis, costs reduced by 18.1% from 3.44 to 2.82.
Advertising easyJet continues to advertise to consolidate the awareness of the brand and its low fares philosophy.
Advertising costs increased by 16.4% from 32.8 million to 38.2 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
Advertising cost per seat increased by 3.9% from 0.94 to 0.98 principally due to the effect of entering new markets such as Milan during the year.
Annual report and accounts 2006 29 plc Low cost with care convenience Operational and financial review continued Merchant fees and incentive pay Merchant fees and incentive pay increased by 14.5% from 15.6 million to 17.9 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
Merchant fees and incentive pay includes the costs of processing fees paid for all of easyJets credit and debit card sales and the per seat sold transferred commission paid as incentive pay to easyJets telesales staff.
The increase is reflective of a larger volume of transactions in line with the growth of the business.
On a per seat basis, costs increased by 2.2% from 0.45 to 0.46.
Aircraft insurance Aircraft insurance costs reduced by 18.0% from 19.3 million in financial year 2005 to 15.8 million in financial year 2006, despite an 11.5% increase in passenger numbers.
This was as a result of lower rates being negotiated offset by the effect of the weakening of sterling against the US dollar.
On a per seat basis, costs decreased by 26.8% from 0.56 to 0.41.
Other costs Other costs increased by 7.1% from 82.4 million to 88.3 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
Items in this cost category include administrative costs and operational costs not included elsewhere including some salary expenses.
This cost category also includes compensation paid to passengers and other related disruption costs, the cost of share option schemes and management bonuses.
Depreciation Depreciation charges increased by 73.4% from 15.8 million to 27.4 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
The depreciation charge reflects depreciation on owned aircraft and capitalised aircraft maintenance charges, and also includes depreciation on computer hardware and other assets.
easyJet has owned an average of 29.2 Airbus A319 aircraft during the financial year 2006 2005: 4.1 Boeing 737-300 aircraft and 10.6 Airbus A319 aircraft.
The increase in depreciation reflects the introduction of new owned Airbus aircraft, and a weakening in the average value of sterling against the US dollar.
Aircraft are purchased in US dollars, and a stronger dollar will mean higher depreciation charges over the life of the asset.
On a per seat basis, depreciation increased by 54.7% from 0.46 to 0.71.
Aircraft dry lease costs easyJets aircraft dry lease costs comprise the lease payments paid by easyJet in respect of those aircraft in its fleet operated pursuant to dry operating leases and end of operating lease return costs.
Aircraft dry lease costs decreased by 0.6% from 123.7 million to 122.9 million from financial year 2005 to financial year 2006.
During the period six new Airbus A319 aircraft were added to the fleet on lease agreements and 19 Boeing 737-300s were retired.
The average number of leased aircraft during the year decreased by 2.2% to 86.0.
Year over year, easyJet has been impacted by the weakening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which lease costs are denominated, and rising dollar interest rates.
Despite this, easyJet has seen its average leasing cost per aircraft decrease by around 1.7% year on year.
On a per seat basis aircraft dry lease costs decreased by 11.3% from 3.56 to 3.16.
Aircraft long-term wet lease costs easyJets aircraft wet lease costs comprise the lease payments paid by easyJet in respect of aircraft pursuant to wet leases that is, leases of aircraft plus crew, maintenance, and insurance of a duration of one month or more.
The 9.6 million charge in 2006 relates to the costs incurred of leasing aircraft for the summer 2006 season in order to deliver three and a half lines of flying in the light of crew shortages.
Wet leased aircraft are not included in fleet numbers discussed elsewhere in the operating and financial review.
Interest and other finance income Interest and other finance income represents interest received or receivable by easyJet offset by the revaluation of financing assets and liabilities.
Interest and other finance income increased by 30.1% from 27.2 million in 2005 to 35.4 million in 2006.
This reflects an increase in the cash and restricted cash balances during the year from 695.5 million to 899.0 million.
Interest and other finance charges Interest and other finance charges represents interest paid or payable by easyJet offset by the revaluation of financing assets and liabilities.
Finance charges relate predominantly to easyJet borrowings through either loans or sale and finance leasebacks.
The average number of aircraft held under these arrangements increased by 82.3% from 14.7 in 2005 to 26.8 in 2006.
Interest and other finance charges increased 120.9% from 10.9 million in 2005 to 24.1 million in 2006.
This primarily reflects an increase in bank loans from 217.3 million to 479.7 million due to the financing of new Airbus aircraft.
In addition there was an increase in US dollar and sterling interest rates.
Foreign exchange revaluations on financing items produced a net expense of 1.4 million during 2006.
Share of profit after tax of The Big Orange Handling Company The Big Orange Handling Company Limited is a joint venture company owned by Menzies Aviation Limited and easyJet.
It was set up in January 2004 to provide ground handling services at London Luton airport.
During the financial year 2006, the share 26% of the profit after tax attributable to easyJet was 0.1 million 2005: 0.1 million.
30 Annual report and accounts 2006 Taxation In financial year 2006, easyJet incurred a tax charge of 35.1 million, an effective tax rate of 27.2% 2005: 23.6 million charge, being 28.6% effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate is lower than the UK standard rate of tax principally due to some of the Groups income being taxed in other jurisdictions, where lower tax rates apply.
A more detailed explanation may be found in note 5 to the accounts.
The net deferred tax liability increased by 9.5 million from 22.2 million to 31.7 million, primarily due to capital allowances taken being in excess of depreciation charges.
Profit after tax For the reasons described above, easyJets profit after tax increased by 59.4% from 59.0 million in financial year 2005 to 94.1 million in financial year 2006.
Earnings per share The basic earnings per share increased by 56.8% from 14.78 pence in the financial year 2005 to 23.18 pence in the financial year 2006.
Balance sheet Goodwill Goodwill relates to the purchases of TEA Basel and Go Fly.
No impairment was made to the carrying value of either asset in either the current or previous financial year.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprises principally owned aircraft, spares and deposits paid to Airbus in respect of the delivery of future aircraft which are not to be financed according to sale and leaseback arrangements.
The net book amount attributable to property, plant and equipment increased from 398.6 million at 30 September 2005 to 695.7 million at 30 September 2006.
The increase is due to capital expenditure of 413.2 million, set out in more detail in capital expenditure below, set off against disposals of 88.7 million and depreciation of 27.4 million.
Other non-current assets Other non-current assets comprise principally capitalised software and software development costs, restricted cash, deposits paid in respect of Airbus aircraft to be financed by sale and leaseback which deliver in more than one year.
The total of other non-current assets has increased from 30.7 million at 30 September 2005 to 31.1 million at 30 September 2006.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, has increased by 29.0% from 667.0 million to 860.7 million.
Other current assets Other current assets comprise trade and other receivables, restricted cash, derivative financial instruments and assets held for sale.
Other current assets increased by 1.2% from 223.9 million at 30 September 2005 to 226.5 million at 30 September 2006.
Trade and other receivables comprise principally trade receivables, amounts due from credit card companies in respect of seat sales, supplier and lease deposits and prepayments.
Trade and other receivables have increased by 1.2% from 210.7 million at 30 September 2005 to 213.3 million at 30 September 2006, principally due to the growth of the business.
Current liabilities Current liabilities have increased by 22.8% from 414.5 million at 30 September 2005 to 509.0 million at 30 September 2006, principally due to the growth of the business.
Non-current borrowings Non-current borrowings all relate to debt related to owned aircraft.
The amount increased by 122.3% from 201.0 million at 30 September 2005 to 446.9 million at 30 September 2006, due to the acquisition of more owned aircraft subject to debt finance arrangements, set off against the weakening of the US dollar compared to sterling.
Other non-current liabilities Other non-current liabilities include provisions for maintenance liabilities, deferred surpluses on the sale and leaseback of aircraft and deferred tax provisions.
The amount increased by 22.5% from 150.9 million at 30 September 2005 to 184.8 million at 30 September 2006.
Whilst the deferred tax provision increased by 9.8 million, the deferred surplus on sale and leaseback reduced due to the small number of aircraft taken under sale and leaseback during 2006, whilst the maintenance provisions reduced due to the weakening of the US dollar, the currency in which much of the provision is denominated.
Annual report and accounts 2006 31 plc Low cost with care convenience Operational and financial review continued Cash flow Capital expenditure Group capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment is set out in note 9 to the financial statements, and is summarised as follows: 2006 2005 million million Aircraft 353.7 162.3 Prepayments on account aircraft deposits 49.8 71.3 Leasehold improvements 0.9 2.0 Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3.9 1.4 Total cash capital expenditure 408.3 237.0 Aircraft spares received free of charge non-cash capital expenditure 4.9 8.5 Total 413.2 245.5 As a result of a purchase agreement approved by shareholders in March 2003, the Group is contractually committed to the acquisition of a further 53 Airbus A319 aircraft with a list price of approximately US$2.3 billon, being approximately 1.3 billion before escalations, discounts and deposits already paid.
In respect of those aircraft deposit payments amounting to US$164.3 million or 90.9 million 2005: US$262.0 million, 145.5 million had been made as at 30 September 2006 for commitments for acquisition of Airbus A319s.
It is intended that these aircraft will be financed partly by cash holdings and internal cash flow and partly through external financing including committed facilities arranged prior to delivery.
In addition certain of the aircraft will be sold and leased back under operating leases.
Working capital At 30 September 2006, net current assets were 578.2 million, up 101.8 million from 476.4 million at 30 September 2005.
This change principally reflects an increase in cash, an increase in debtors due to increased sales volumes offset by an increase in creditors.
Unearned revenue increased from 160.3 million to 179.3 million due to increased volumes.
Cash flow Net cash inflow from operating activities totalled 225.2 million, a decrease of 21.8 million from 247.0 million in 2005 primarily due to changes in working capital.
Financing arrangements The following table sets out the movements in financing for the two years ended 30 September 2006: 2006 2005 million million Balance at 1 October 217.3 119.8 New loans and finance leases raised 309.8 146.2 Capital repayments of loans and finance leases 31.4 46.9 Effect of exchange rates 12.9 1.4 Effect of deferred financing fees 3.1 3.2 Balance at 30 September 479.7 217.3 Of the 32 Airbus A319s that were delivered during the year, 16 were financed through US dollar or sterling mortgage loans, two were temporarily cash acquired with mortgage finance drawn after year end, six were sold to lessors and leased back under operating leases, five were sold to lessors and leased back under finance leases, and three were cash acquired supported by a standby facility.
Share capital The number of shares allotted, called up and fully paid on 30 September 2006 was 410.5 million 2005: 400.4 million.
During 2006, 10.1 million shares were issued on exercise of options under employee share option schemes 2005: 1.2 million.
Principal risks and uncertainties This section describes the principal risks and uncertainties which may affect easyJets business and financial results and prospects.
Demand for air travel easyJet is dependent on the demand for European air travel and its business can be affected by macro issues outside its control, such as global or even local economic conditions, the continued acceptance of the low-cost model, and the willingness of potential customers to fly.
Changes in any of these will affect the demand for our services and could have a material effect on the financial results of the business.
Competition easyJet operates in competitive marketplaces against both flag carriers and other low-cost airlines.
An increase in competition from any of these sources could result in an adverse effect on easyJets performance.
32 Annual report and accounts 2006 Terrorism catastrophic loss The attacks and attempted attacks on the aviation industry of 11 September 2001 in the United States and 10 August 2006 in the UK show that easyJets business is exposed to potential terrorist attacks, even if easyJet is not a direct target, and even if an attack is not successful.
easyJets business can be affected in a number of ways, including loss of key national infrastructure which may have a knockon effect, loss of restricted access to the airport infrastructure which easyJet uses, increased security costs, potential restriction or removal of insurance cover, and a reduction in the propensity of customers to fly.
Any one of these issues could have a material adverse effect on the business.
Fleet grounding easyJet now operates only two types of aircraft, the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A319.
Were there an accident or discovered defect on these aircraft types, even if related to another airline elsewhere in the world, this could result in some or all of easyJets aircraft fleet being grounded for an indeterminable period of time.
Outbreak of epidemics or pandemics An outbreak of a contagious disease such as avian influenza could affect the propensity of passengers to travel, or in extreme circumstances could affect easyJets ability to continue to operate its planned schedule.
These could have a material adverse impact on the business.
Government or EU taxes may be imposed Air passenger and other taxes are levied by many European countries.
Due to the low fares charged by easyJet, these taxes can form a significant proportion of the total fare paid by a passenger.
These taxes could increase in the future.
Furthermore, there has been much discussion about the possibility of environmental or other social taxes being levied by the EU or other governments.
Any increase in taxes may lead to loss of customers who are highly sensitive to changes in prices.
Fuel price fluctuations Fuel is a significant cost to easyJet, being 26.0% of the cost base during the 2006 financial year.
During the last ten years, the price of fuel has been subject to significant volatility.
Whilst the Groups hedging activities can provide some degree of protection against shortterm price volatility, easyJet is exposed to fuel price movements over longer time periods, which could be material to the cost base.
Currency fluctuations easyJet has significant US dollar denominated costs relating to the purchase price of an aircraft, aircraft financing costs, maintenance reserve payments, engine maintenance costs and fuel purchases.
The US dollar is subject to significant volatility against sterling.
Whilst the Groups hedging activities can provide some degree of protection against short-term exchange rate movements, easyJet is exposed over longer time periods, which could be material to the cost base.
Landing charges and airport access Many of the airports which easyJet fly to are regulated, and charges are levied by way of regulatory decision rather than by commercial negotiation.
As such, easyJet has little influence in the future level and even the basis of charges, which may result in costs increasing at beyond the level of inflation.
Airport access The availability of suitable landing slots at airports is key to easyJets continued growth.
Many airports are slot constrained and are subject to regulation.
This means that there is a risk that slots may not become available.
Furthermore, environmental regulation such as noise restrictions and curfews may further restrict availability.
easyJet does not own its name or branding easyJet does not own its trade marks, domain names or any rights to its orange and white livery.
These are licensed from easyGroup IP Licensing, which is controlled by Stelios Haji-Ioannou, a director and the major shareholder.
The licence imposes duties on easyJet to maintain high standards in the use of the brand and also restricts the business activities that easyJet can carry on.
A loss of the licence to use the brand could have a substantial adverse effect on the business of the Group.
Furthermore, the easy brand is used by a number of other franchises and companies controlled by Stelios Haji-Ioannou.
easyJet may be adversely affected should there be failures or problems in these businesses.
Dependence on technology easyJet is heavily dependent on technology to operate its business.
In particular, there are three key systems: eRes, which is used to process seat purchases and manage reservations: RMS, which is used for yield management: and AIMS, which is used to manage operational data and crew positioning.
Whilst easyJet has a comprehensive system of back up and protection, an outage of any of these systems could result in a material adverse effect for the business.
Dependence on third-party service providers easyJet has entered into agreements with third-party service providers for services covering a significant proportion of its cost base.
This includes aircraft maintenance, pilot training, and ground handling services at airports, where easyJet considers that such services can be provided more efficiently and effectively by third parties.
The loss of any of these contracts, any inability to renew them or any inability to negotiate suitable replacement contracts could have a material adverse effect.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that contract renewals will be at favourable rates.
Industrial action Large parts of the easyJet workforce is unionised.
Collective bargaining takes place on a regular basis.
If there is a breakdown in this process, then operations could be disrupted with a resultant adverse effect on the business.
The same applies to many of our key third-party service providers, where similar issues exist.
easyJet is proud of its good relationship with the unions, and has never been subject to significant strike action, but there is no guarantee that this will continue into the future.
Annual report and accounts 2006 33 plc Low cost with care convenience Operational and financial review continued Treasury management Liquidity and investments The Group holds significant cash or liquid funds as a form of insurance to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events.
The cash, cash equivalent and restricted cash balances at 30 September 2006 totalled 899.0 million 2005: 695.5 million.
The robust increase in cash and liquid investment balances from the prior year represents continued cash inflows generated from the operation of the business together with cash inflows generated from aircraft financing activities.
Group cash resources are used to fund payments made to Airbus in advance of taking delivery of aircraft, and drawdown of the full committed aircraft financing is made only when the aircraft is delivered.
As a result aircraft deliveries are cash generative for the Group.
Surplus funds are invested, in line with Board-approved policy, in high-quality short-term liquid instruments, usually money market funds or bank deposits.
Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any one individual counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
Such counterparty exposures are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
Accordingly, the possibility of material loss arising in the event of nonperformance by counterparties is considered to be unlikely.
Management of financial and fuel price risks The Board of Directors is responsible for setting treasury policy and objectives, and approves the parameters within which the various aspects of treasury risk management are operated.
Approved treasury policy outlines the Groups approach to corporate and asset financing, interest rate risk, fuel price risk, foreign exchange risk and cash and liquidity management.
The policy also lists the financial instruments and time periods which the Groups treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks.
The policy is under ongoing review to ensure best practice in the light of developments in the trading and financial markets.
The treasury function implements the agreed policies on a day-to-day basis to meet the treasury objectives.
These objectives include ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its day-to-day needs and to fund its capital commitments: deploying any surplus liquidity in a prudent and profitable manner: managing currency, fuel, interest rate and credit exposures: and managing the Groups worldwide relationship with banks and financial institutions.
Financing and interest rate risk All of the Groups debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders and other financiers.
These factors are also reflected in the medium-term profile of the Groups loans and operating leases.
The incidence of repayments of loans and finance leases is shown in note 16.
The Group demonstrated its continued ability to raise new committed financing, with 18 of the 53 Airbus aircraft to be delivered through 2009 having committed financing in place at 30 September 2006 2005: 42 of 65.
Group interest rate management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of its financing.
All Group loans are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months, while a minimum of 40% of operating leases rentals are based on fixed interest rates at the time of aircraft delivery.
Of the operating leases in place at 30 September 2006 approximately 56% of lease payments were based on fixed interest rates and 44% were based on floating interest rates 2005: 59% fixed, 41% floating.
The finance leases put in place during the year were predominantly based on floating interest rates.
The Groups loan borrowings and operating leases are denominated in US dollars and sterling.
The Groups aircraft are priced in and transacted in US dollars and 68% of loans outstanding at 30 September 2006 were priced in US dollars and 32% in sterling 2005: 60% US dollars, 40% sterling.
Foreign currency risk The Group is broadly neutral in the key currencies in which it does business, with the exception of the US dollar.
Capital, lease, fuel, and some mortgage payments and proceeds from the sale of aircraft are denominated in US dollars.
As a result the Group can experience adverse or beneficial effects arising from exchange rate movements.
The Group seeks to reduce its foreign exchange exposure arising from transactions in various currencies through a policy of matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency.
In addition, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and zero cost collars.
The Group has substantial liabilities denominated in US dollars.
Some aircraft-owning companies had been treated as US dollar branches, and consequently movements in the aircraft values acted as a natural hedge against the loans.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards, this natural accounting hedge no longer exists, and consequently volatility in the income statement increases with changes in foreign exchange rates.
We are managing this risk through a mixture of drawing down loans in sterling, holding cash in US dollars and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Fuel price risk The Group fuel risk management policy aims to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel price while ensuring that the Group may also benefit from price reductions.
In order to provide protection the Group uses a limited range of hedging instruments traded on the over the counter markets, principally zero cost collars and forwards, with approved counterparties and within approved limits.
Group policy at 30 September 2006 is to hedge a maximum of 80% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in advance, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated expense up to 36 months in advance.
In exceptional market conditions, the Board may accelerate or limit the implementation of the hedging policy.
Further details can be found in note 23.
34 Annual report and accounts 2006 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives selectively for currency and fuel risk management purposes as described above.
The Groups policy is not to speculatively trade in derivatives but to use these instruments to hedge anticipated exposures.
Forward foreign exchange and fuel contracts and zero cost collars are used to cover currency and jet fuel exposures.
All contracts outstanding at 30 September 2006 are summarised in note 23.
The Group does not permit selling of currency and jet fuel options, except on a fully matched basis, to create a collar hedging structure.
All derivatives are used for the purpose of risk management: they do not expose the Group to market risk because gains and losses on the derivatives offset losses and gains on the matching asset, liability, revenue or cost being hedged.
Counterparty credit risk is generally restricted to any hedging gain from time to time and is controlled through mark-to-market-based credit limits.
Critical accounting policies easyJets consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the stated accounting policies requires easyJets management to make estimates and assumptions that will affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
easyJets estimates and assumptions are based on managements historical experiences, changes in the business environment and advice from specialists.
However, actual results may differ from these estimates if actual conditions are different.
The differences may be material.
Critical accounting policies are defined as those which are material to easyJets financial statements, but yet require a significant amount of judgement from management.
The policies used in determining aircraft maintenance liabilities and corporation tax are deemed to be the most critical accounting policies.
Aircraft maintenance costs easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of its leased aircraft during the course of the lease term.
These are as a result of legal and constructive obligations in the lease contract in respect of the return conditions applied by lessors, which require aircraft airframes, engines, landing gear and auxiliary power units to reach at least a specified condition on their return at the end of the lease term.
In most instances, to reach the specified conditions, easyJet will need to carry out a heavy-duty maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe once during the lease term, usually towards the end of the lease.
Other work may be required on landing gear and auxiliary power units.
A charge is made in the income statement each month based on the number of flight hours or cycles used to build up a provision to cover the cost of heavy-duty maintenance checks when they occur.
Estimates involved in calculating the provision required include the expected date of the check, market conditions for heavy-duty maintenance checks pertaining at the expected date of check, the condition of asset at the time of the check, the likely utilisation of the asset in terms of either flying hours or cycles, and the regulations in relation to extensions to lives of life-limited parts, which form a significant proportion of the cost of heavy-duty maintenance costs of engines.
easyJet is also required to pay maintenance reserves to certain lessors on a monthly basis, based on usage, to provide a security deposit for the lessor should the aircraft be returned without meeting its return conditions.
These maintenance reserves are then returned to the Group on production of evidence that qualifying maintenance expenditure has been incurred.
Maintenance reserves paid are deducted from the provision made.
In some instances, not all of the maintenance reserves paid can be recovered by the Group and therefore are retained by the lessor at the end of the lease term.
If management considers this is likely to occur, then an additional provision is made again either on a flying hours or cycles basis to cover the expected liability.
Assumptions made in respect of the basis of the provisions are reviewed for all aircraft once a year.
In addition, when further information becomes available which could materially change an estimate made, such as a heavy-duty maintenance check taking place, utilisation assumptions changing, or return conditions being renegotiated, then specific estimates are reviewed immediately, and the provision is reset accordingly.
Corporation tax In the ordinary course of easyJets business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain at the time the accounts are prepared.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our corporation tax liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
This process involves estimating our current tax exposures on a  basis.
Included in the estimation process is making judgements on the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Tax exposures can involve complex issues and can take an extended period to resolve.
The effective tax rate of the Group is derived from the effective tax rate of the weighted earnings in each jurisdiction that we operate.
Changes in the geographic mix of earnings can affect the Groups effective tax rate.
