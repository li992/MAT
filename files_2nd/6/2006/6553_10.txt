qxp:Layout 1 6 3 07 13:11 Page 32 Business Review Group Financial Review Focused on delivering value Andrew Carr-Locke Group Finance Director Group summary The Group has continued to focus on delivering shareholder value.
Group profit before tax totalled 310.2 million after providing an exceptional item of 60.7 million for land option write-offs and land write-downs in the US.
This item has been separately disclosed on the face of the income statement.
Pre-exceptional profit before tax totalled 370.9 million slightly ahead of last year 2005: 366.5 million.
Shareholders funds rose by 162.7 million, despite the land provisions, and after a further increase in dividends paid out during the year.
A 10% increase in the final dividend is proposed, which if approved, would bring the full year dividend to 19.4 pence 2005: 17.6 pence.
Even after significant investment to improve both the quality and size of the UK landbank, the balance sheet was further strengthened with gearing reduced to 23% 2005: 34%.
Pre-exceptional return on average capital employed for the year was 20.3% 2005: 22.3%, substantially above our cost of capital.
Group KPI Group results The 2006 accounts have been prepared in line with International Financial Reporting Standards and it is profit before tax m pleasing to note a high degree of stability in the final reporting environment in the past year.
As a result there are no material changes to any accounting policies to report.
500 Key Performance Indicators Group UK US 400 Completions 13,616 4,347 300 Operating profit 317.6m $214.7m Operating margin 13.0% 15.5% 200 Profit before tax 370.9m Earnings per share 64.4 p 100 Dividends per share 19.4 p 0 All the above measures are pre-exceptional.
On a post-exceptional basis US operating profit was $96.0 million and 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 US operating margin was 6.9%.
Group profit before tax was 310.2 million and earnings per share were 54.8p.
UK GAAP IFRS before exceptional costs of 5.9 million This year, for the first time we have identified a number of Key Performance Indicators to enable investors in 2002 and 60.7 million in 2006 to measure our performance.
The Groups results as measured by these KPIs are reflected in the following restated for IFRS narrative.
The definition and, where appropriate, the calculations of these measures along with the other KPIs we have chosen to give a fuller picture of our performance, are set out on pages 20 and 21.
Group completions grew by 6% to Year end gearing % 17,963 2005: 17,021, with strong growth in the UK more than offsetting the effect of market weakness in 50 the US.
Pre-exceptional profit before tax rose by 1% to 370.9 million with post-exceptional profit before tax reduced by 15% to 310.2 million 2005: 366.5 million.
Year end net debt reduced from 521.9 million 40 at the end of 2005 to 387.1 million at 31 December 2006.
It is pleasing to note the steady reduction in gearing at the same time as the Company has strengthened its land position for the future.
30 The Group is clearly in a strong financial position which provides a solid platform as well as flexibility when considering future investment opportunities.
20 UK Housing: In the UK, revenue increased by 11% to 2,391.2 million 2005: 2,157.6 million.
This strong 10 performance was driven by the 13% increase in completions to 13,616 2005: 12,100.
Average selling prices were slightly down, with positive like for like price momentum more than offset by the lower 0 average size of homes and an increasing proportion of affordable homes.
Given the very weak margins in our order book coming into 2006, this was a sound UK GAAP IFRS result.
The business continues to focus on improving the operating margin with margins in the second half and in the order book at the end of 2006 continuing to show an improving trend.
This has been achieved by the benefits of stable market conditions and importantly, progress in executing our land strategy and improving cost effectiveness.
With improving profits and a modest increase in assets Group KPI employed, return on average capital employed increased to 19.1% 2005: 17.2%.
Earnings per share pence US Housing: In contrast to the UK, US revenue fell by 9.7% to $1,389.1 million 2005: $1,538.8 million.
100 The sharp fall in the Californian market that we noted at the end of 2005 was the forerunner of generally weaker housing market conditions across most of the US during 2006.
Weak market conditions resulted in 80 reducing sales rates and increasing cancellation rates as the year progressed.
Despite entering 2006 with strong order books, overall completions fell by 12% to 4,347 2005: 4,921.
However this masks the trend of net prices rising through most of 2005 and declining as 2006 progressed.
Given this decline, it was felt prudent to recognise a land write-down 40 of $118.7 million pre-tax, $74.3 million post-tax in December 2006.
This has been calculated in accordance with IAS 2 and is based upon managements assessment of net selling prices needed to achieve a normal 20 sales rate.
This is shown as an exceptional item in the income statement.
Even so, this represents the second best result ever achieved by the US Housing UK GAAP IFRS Division.
The pre-exceptional operating margin was 15.5% 2005: 20.0%.
Although we have seen early signs of stability returning to the US market, we would expect US margins to fall further in the short term.
However, given the positive demographic trends and growth of the US economy, we believe that a recovery to mid-teen margins is achievable in the medium term.
Return on average capital employed in Group KPI the US continued at satisfactory levels, pre-exceptional 24.6% 2005: 44.2% and post-exceptional 11.0%.
Dividend per share pence Interest: Reported net interest costs for 2006 reduced by 19.1 million to 51.9 million 2005: 71.0 20 million, within this, net interest on borrowings from financial institutions totalled 43.9 million 2005: 50.0 million.
Average debt levels for 2006 were 833 million 2005: 965 million.
Other items charged to the interest line include a pension charge of 6.8 million 2005: 8.5 million, a net 4.0 million 15 2005: 3.8 million charged for imputed interest on long term land creditors and a mark to market gain on interest rate derivatives of 5.6 million compared with a 5.3 million charge in 2005.
10 Tax: The tax charge for underlying operations was 114.9 million, reduced by a credit to deferred tax of 22.7 million relating to the US land provision.
The net tax charge was therefore 92.2 million, at an 5 effective rate on profit before tax of 30%.
Earnings per share and dividend: With modestly higher profits but also slightly higher average shares 0 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 in issue, pre-exceptional earnings per share stayed fairly constant at 64.4 pence 2005: 64.3 pence.
Postexceptional earnings per share were 54.8 pence.
The Board sees the delivery of shareholder value as core before exceptional costs of 5.9 million to our purpose and regards the achievement of growth in EPS over the cycle and the maintenance of a in 2002 and 60.7 million in 2006 progressive dividend policy as key measures of this.
restated for IFRS Balance sheet and cash flow Shareholders funds made further progress increasing by 11% to 1,707.1 million 2005: 1,544.4 million.
Expressed on a per share basis, shareholders funds totalled 426 pence 2005: 389 pence, an increase of 37 pence after allowing for dividends paid out during the calendar year and the US land write-down.
The Group delivered strong cash inflow from operations totalling 305.1 million 2005: 286.9 million.
Year end net debt levels fell from 521.9 million in 2005 to 387.1 million in 2006, a reduction of 134.8 million.
Retained shareholders funds continued to be the principal source of finance to support the increased investment in the Groups future.
Net assets employed totalled 2,094 million, an increase of only 28 million.

Group completions This reflects the difficult market conditions in the US, together with the effect of the weakening Dollar.
UK revenue rose by 4% in the second half despite the impact of our policy to increase the balance of 18,000 sales in the first half.
First half UK revenue rose by 22%.
Group completions at 10,141 were 3% below 2005 10,452, the combined effect of 3% growth in the UK and a 19% decline in the US.
15,000 In the UK, operating profit grew by 19% to 203.2 million 2005: 171.3 million.
Operating margins 12,000 showed good progress rising to 14.3% in the second half compared with 13.1% in the second half of 2005 and 11.2% in the first half of 2006.
Of the 3.1% improvement compared to the first half, 0.4% is 9,000 attributable to better overhead efficiency given the bias of volumes towards the second half.
The ratio 6,000 of completions first half to second half was 43% to 57%.
The remaining 2.7% is attributable to underlying improvement in performance.

Financial and Treasury Policies The Group has financed its growth in recent years through a combination of retained profits, bank loans and long term loans in the form of US Dollar private placements with a group of US insurance companies.
All loans and banking relationships are managed centrally through the Group Treasury Department.
We continue to use derivatives to generate the appropriate balance between fixed, capped and floating interest rate profiles.
It is not our policy to trade actively in derivatives or to use more complex derivatives.
The Groups Treasury Committee is responsible for developing and recommending policy to the Board and for monitoring our finance risks.
The main financial risks are liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange currency risk and credit risk.
Liquidity Risk: The Group maintains adequate committed borrowing facilities to ensure that seasonal borrowing can be accommodated whilst maintaining prudent headroom and that a range of development plans can be financed.
The Group has committed bank facilities of 1,110 million at the end of 2006.
It also has long term debt raised in the US private placement market of 291 million with maturities ranging up to 12 years.
Interest Rate Risk: We aim to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the cash interest cost of servicing our debt by using fixed interest rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and options.
The most adverse scenario for the Group is a significant increase in interest rates which would weaken the housing market at the same time as increasing borrowing costs.
In order to mitigate this economic risk most effectively, we manage with regard to average forecast level of borrowings in each currency rather than forecast year end borrowings.
This resulted in fixed rate borrowings slightly above year end borrowings, particularly in Sterling, which is the currency with the greatest seasonal movement in the amount of borrowing.
We continue to hedge interest rate exposure to reduce the economic impact on the business of interest rate movements, even if such hedges do not meet the strict prescriptive conditions to adopt hedge accounting under accounting standard IAS 39.
qxp:Layout 1 6 3 07 13:11 Page 35 the payments for interest marginally and the value of the Groups derivatives rose by 5.6 million as a result of an expected less favourable interest rate environment in the future.
Currency Risk: Our principal currency risk is the translation exposure of our investment in Morrison Homes.
Our policy is to match, as far as practicable, our Dollar denominated assets with Dollar denominated debt.
Consequently movement in the Sterling Dollar exchange rate has had little effect on the Groups shareholders funds, though it did affect the Sterling value of year end debt as well as reported revenue and profit before tax.
Credit Risk: We have no significant concentration of credit risk.
Financial counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Treasury Committee.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit which is reassessed annually.
The Group continues to manage its exposure to the risk related to major inner-city developments by arranging joint ventures and financing the schemes with non-recourse project risk facilities.
All four such joint ventures are performing satisfactorily and they contributed a total of 7.6 million after tax to Group profit in 2006.
Pensions The pension deficit in the 2006 accounts is reported in accordance with IAS 19.
The deficit net of deferred tax at the end of 2006 was 117 million compared to 129 million at the end of 2005.
Actuarial computations under IFRS are designed to satisfy accounting requirements.
Full actuarial valuations of the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme to determine the adequacy of funding for the Scheme are undertaken on a triennial basis.
The latest full valuation, prepared as at 31 March 2005 showed a gross deficit of 148 million.
As agreed following the last full valuation, additional contributions totalling 15 million have been made during the year to help fund the deficit.
Details relating to the Pension Scheme, as presented in the 2006 accounts and the most recent actuarial valuation, are shown in note 20.
Accounting Standards The 2006 Annual Report has been produced in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed and adopted for use in the EU.
There have been no new standards issued during 2006 which materially affect these accounts.
The accounts have been prepared on a basis which is consistent with the accounting policies adopted for 2005.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not effective for 2006 and therefore have not been applied in preparing these accounts: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures require extensive disclosures about the significance of financial instruments for an entitys financial position and performance, and qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the nature and extent of risks.
IFRS 7 and amended IAS 1 which will be adopted for the Groups 2007 accounts, will require additional disclosures with respect to the Groups financial instruments and share capital.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which some or all of the goods or services received cannot be specifically identified.
IFRIC 8 will become mandatory for the Groups 2007 accounts, with retrospective application required.
The Group has not yet determined the potential effect of the interpretation.
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment prohibits the reversal of an impairment loss recognised in a previous interim period in respect of goodwill, an investment in an equity instrument or a financial asset carried at cost.
IFRIC 10 will become mandatory for the Groups 2007 accounts, and will apply to goodwill, investments in equity instruments and financial assets carried at cost prospectively from the date that the Group first applied the measurement criteria of IAS 36 and IAS 39 respectively i. e. 1 January 2005.
IFRIC 10 is not expected to have any significant impact on the consolidated accounts.
The Group does not consider that any other standards or interpretations issued by the IASB, not yet applicable, will have any significant impact on the consolidated accounts.
