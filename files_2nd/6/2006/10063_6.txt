FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW The year to 31 December 2006 was the first full year of trading for Melrose PLC after the acquisition of the McKechnie and Dynacast businesses in May 2005.
The results for 2006 and 2005 cannot be compared directly as the 2005 results include only seven months of the enlarged group.
The accounts for the Group have been compiled using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
GROUP TRADING RESULTS To help the understanding of the results the terms headline Geoffrey Martin Group Finance Director operating profit, headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share have been used in this report.
These are calculated before exceptional costs, exceptional income, intangible asset amortisation other than computer software and profit on disposal of businesses.
The Group made sales for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 507.0 million 2005: 269.9 million.
Headline operating profit was 56.1 million 2005: 27.5 million, giving a headline operating profit return on sales of 11.1% 2005: 10.2%.
Headline earnings per share grew from 9.1p in 2005 to 12.3p in 2006 and this 35% increase reflects the growth achieved in Melrose year on year.
After exceptional costs, exceptional income, intangible asset amortisation other than computer software, and profit on disposal of businesses the operating profit was 49.2 million 2005: 8.1 million and the Basic EPS 14.7p 2005: loss of 2.4p.
This performance has been delivered despite many commodity costs such as zinc having increased in price significantly compared to 2005 and therefore reflects the success achieved in both minimising the cost increases with suppliers and passing them onto customers wherever possible.
The higher profit in 2006 was achieved after incurring a 1.2 million foreign exchange translation loss caused mainly by the strengthening of Sterling against the US Dollar.

MELROSE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 19 FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW continued EXCHANGE RATE RISK RISK MANAGEMENT The Group trades in various different countries around the world The significant financial risks the Group faces have been considered and hence the Group is exposed to many different foreign and policies have been implemented to best deal with each risk.
The Group therefore carries an exchange risk that can be The four most significant financial risks are considered to be liquidity categorised into three types, described below.
The Board policy to risk, finance cost risk, exchange rate risk and commodity risk.
These address these risks is to protect against some of the cash risks but are discussed in turn: not the non cash risks.
The main ongoing cash risk is the transaction risk the Group takes when it invoices a sale in a different currency LIQUIDITY RISK to the one in which its cost of sale is incurred in.
This is addressed The Group has a 200 million five year committed term loan by taking out forward cover against approximately 80% of the which was arranged at the time of the Dynacast and McKechnie anticipated cash flows over the following twelve months, placed on acquisition in 2005 and expires in 2010.
In addition, the Group has a rolling quarterly basis.
This does not eliminate the cash risk but a 30 million committed working capital facility and various smaller does bring some certainty to it.
finance lease arrangements for a number of specific assets.
The term loan is a multicurrency facility split approximately 60% US The most significant non cash exchange risk is the translation risk Dollars, 30% Euros and 10% Sterling.
This split was consistent with when the income statements and balance sheets of the trading the split of net assets on acquisition and provides a partial hedge units denominated in a foreign currency are translated into Sterling.
The income statements are translated at the average rates for the year and the balance sheets at the closing rate for the year.
The The year end net debt was 162.6 million, which consisted rates used in 2006 and 2005 are shown below: of 195.9 million of interest bearing loans and borrowings less 33.3 million of cash and short term deposits.
The Directors EXCHANGE RATES USED IN THE PERIOD consider that the Group has sufficient capital for its current needs.
Average rate Closing rate The facility has two main financial covenants.
An interest cover US Dollar covenant and a headline operating profit before depreciation and 2006 1.84 1.96 amortisation to debt covenant.
The Group remained within these 2005 1.77 1.72 covenant tests during 2006.

The bank facilities finance cost is a variable cost linked to The effect on the key headline numbers in 2006 due to the LIBOR plus a margin.
The margin reduces as the debt to headline movement of exchange rates from 2005 to 2006 is summarised operating profit before depreciation and amortisation ratio reduces.
as follows: To reduce the variable risk of the Group being able to meet its finance cost the Group has taken out some financial instruments to EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENT protect the base finance cost prior to the bank margin.
A two year 2006 exchange rate fixed interest rate swap on its US Dollar debt was secured in July versus 2005 exchange rate 2005 and ends in July 2007 at a fixed rate of 4.1%.
In addition, m instruments were taken out at the same time for the same duration 2006 effect to cap the Euro finance cost at 3% and the Sterling finance cost Sales reduction 8.4 at 5%.
At 31 December the total value of these instruments was Headline operating profit reduction 1.2 1.1 million and in accordance with IAS 32 this value is recognised Net debt reduction 16.3 as an asset on the Group balance sheet.
Net asset reduction 41.4 The combination of the above instruments meant that the combined average finance cost for the Group in 2006 was approximately 5%.
20 MELROSE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 For reference, guidelines to show the net translation exchange risks that the Group currently carries are shown below: EXCHANGE RATE GUIDELINES Increase in profit m For every 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar against Sterling 1.6 For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro against Sterling 1.2 No protection is taken other than the hedge of having a multicurrency debt facility funding these foreign currency trading units.
The final most significant exchange risk that the Group takes arises when a division which is predominantly based in a foreign currency is sold.
The proceeds for those divisions will most likely be received in a foreign currency and therefore an exchange risk arises if these proceeds are converted back to Sterling, for instance to pay a dividend to shareholders.
Protection against this risk is taken on a case by case basis and no instruments have been taken out currently.
It is recognised that this is a cash risk for which the multi currency loan gives some protection.
COMMODITY RISK As Melrose owns various engineering divisions across various sectors the cumulative expenditure on commodities is significant to the Group results.
The Group addresses the risk of base commodity costs increasing by having suitable purchase agreements with its suppliers sometimes fixing the price over some months in the future.
Melrose does not generally enter into financial instruments on commodities as this is not considered to be the most efficient way of protecting against movements.
Instead price rises are passed onto the customer wherever possible.
