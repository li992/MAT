Regus Report & Accounts 2006 10 Financial review Stephen Gleadle Our 2006 financial performance has been impressive, reflecting strong like for like growth and the additional contribution from acquisitions and 2006 new centre openings.
These results have been achieved whilst also investing in people, infrastructure, technology and marketing to secure future growth.
The three key operational drivers have all been improved.
The weighted average number of workstations increased by 36.4% to 107,257.
At the same time average occupancy increased from 78% to 82% and average revenue per occupied workstation REVPOW increased by 2.4% from 7,551 to 7,732.
This results in an increase in REVPAW of 7.6% from 5,890 to 6,340.
Against a relatively fixed cost base these factors have contributed to a 34.9 million increase in operating profit from 47.3 million in 2005 to 82.2 million in 2006.
Revenue and centre contribution excluding non-recurring items Revenue for the Group rose 46.8% to 680.0 million 2005: 463.3 million and centre contribution increased 57.2% to 184.1 million 2005: 117.1 million.
680.0m REVENUE 2005: 463.3m This year-on-year movement can be analysed as follows: Revenue Centre contribution Margin m m a % 2005 463.3 117.1 25.3 107,257 Growth in mature business 39.9 34.0 Subtotal 503.2 151.1 30.0 WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF WORKSTATIONS Centres added in 2005 33.8 12.7 2005: 78,657 Centres added in 2006 147.6 20.2 Centres closed 4.6 0.1 % 2006 680.0 184.1 27.1 82 a Excludes non-recurring items of 0.1 million in 2005.
AVERAGE OCCUPANCY 2005: 78% The mature business, defined as those centres owned and operated at least 12 months prior to 1 January 2006, increased revenue by 39.9 million principally driven through improvements in occupancy, which increased from 7,732 79% to 84%.
This resulted in a 34.0 million increase in centre contribution.
a REVPOW 2005: 7,551 Centres added in 2005 contributed a further 33.8 million of revenue and 12.7 million of contribution.
This was due to both underlying improvements in the performance of these sites and the impact of including them for a full 12 months.
6,340 b Expansions in 2006 include the repurchase of the UK business and a REVPAW 2005: 5,890 number of bolt-on acquisitions and new centres.
These contributed a further 147.6 million of revenue and contribution of 20.2 million.
a Average revenue per occupied workstation.
b Average revenue per available workstation.
Taking all this together contribution margin improved from 25.3% to 27.1%.
administration expenses Administration expenses excluding non-recurring items incurred in 2005 have increased to 15.0% of revenue for the full year 2005: 14.0%.
This increase arises principally from the impact of growth related investments incurred in the second half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 ahead of the full revenue impact of growth.
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 11 These growth related costs focus on three main areas: These results have been Marketing costs to drive occupancy primarily in new centres achieved whilst investing Costs to support the growing scale of the business e. g. country managers, in people, infrastructure, improved systems and processes technology and marketing Costs necessarily incurred to secure workstation growth in a controlled to secure future growth.
and efficient manner e. g. business development teams to identify, secure and integrate new business.
As the growth benefits have been delivered, administration expenses as a proportion of revenue have fallen from 16.1% in the first half of 2006 to 14.1% in the second half of 2006.
Non-recurring items In 2005, the Group incurred 4.9 million of non-recurring costs net, which primarily relate to the integration of HQ.
No similar costs have been incurred in 2006.
Operating profit Operating profit was 82.2 million 2005: 47.3 million representing a margin of 12.1% 2005: 10.2%.
Share of operating loss in joint ventures and associate In the year ended 31 December 2006, the share of joint venture losses attributable to Regus reduced to 0.1 million 2005: 0.2 million loss.
The underlying improvement in our mature joint ventures was masked by the impact of newly opened joint ventures, which recognised losses of 0.3 million in the period due to the recognition of start up costs.
During the period 1 January 2006 to 19 April 2006, the UK business was equity accounted as an associate.
Our 42% shareholding resulted in a profit after tax for the period to 19 April of 1.2 million 2005 full year: 0.2 million.
financing costs Financing costs can be summarised as follows: 2006 2005 m m Interest payable on bank loans 4.6 5.6 Interest receivable 1.8 2.2 Finance lease interest 0.5 0.9 Non cash deferred financing fees 0.4 4.3 Non cash unwinding of discount UK acquisition related net 2.1 Total 5.8 8.6 Interest payable has fallen despite a higher average debt balance in 2006 as a result of refinancing our senior credit facility in March 2006 on more favourable terms.
Lower interest receivable reflects a decrease in the average free cash balance from 55 million in 2005 to 50 million in 2006.
Although the Group is now in an overall net cash position, a net cash interest charge should still be anticipated for 2007.
This is driven by the costs of commitment fees on the senior credit facility and letter of credit issuance fees as well as the impact of incurring a net charge from the margin between interest rates on our deposits and borrowings.
Underlying finance lease costs have fallen in line with the reduction in finance leases.
The amortisation of deferred financing fees relates to the 2.1 million loan arrangement costs incurred on the new 150 million credit facility.
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 12 Financial review continued The 2005 charge of 4.3 million included the write off of the remaining deferred financing fees on the US$155 million credit facility repaid in March 2006.
The unwinding of discounted fair value adjustments on the Regus UK acquisition resulted in a non cash net financing charge of 2.1 million in 2006.
8.4p BASIC EPS 2005: 4.5p taxation As the business performance has strengthened, it has become necessary to recognise in the balance sheet an asset for a greater proportion of the value of the tax losses that the Group holds.
Accordingly in 2006, a credit of 12.9 million 2005: 15.0 million has been recognised in the income 132.8m statement, reflecting the increased deferred tax asset in the balance sheet.
OPERATING CASH FLOW 2005: 78.1m This has been partially offset by an 8.1 million tax charge 2005: 8.9 million, which resulted in a net tax credit of 4.8 million 2005: 6.1 million to the income statement.
Consequently, despite being profitable, the Group has a net tax credit for the year to 31 December 2006.
However, on a cash basis the Group paid 6.6 million 2005: 2.6 million of tax across a small number of countries.
This represents approximately 8.5% of profit before tax.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group had 197.9 million 2005: 270.2 million of tax losses to carry forward against future corporation tax liabilities, of which 111.0 million 2005: 172.0 million are in the USA.
Based upon continued profitable growth and no significant changes to the Groups tax position the cash tax rate should be expected to rise through 2007 to 2009 as the tax losses are progressively utilised.
Earnings per share EpS Basic EPS for the year rose to 8.4p 2005: 4.5p.
This is based on weighted average number of shares of 984,792,040.
Cash flow Strong operating cash flow remains a prime feature of the Group.
Driven by the improvement in operating profit and an improved working capital performance, operating cash flow increased by 54.7 million to 132.8 million 2005: 78.1 million.
The Groups cash flow statement has been summarised as follows: 2006 2005 m m Operating cash flow 132.8 78.1 Tax and net interest paid 10.1 6.9 Maintenance capex 19.6 5.9 Free cash flow 103.1 65.3 New centre openings 26.7 11.1 Acquisitions and investments 88.5 16.8 Financing 23.0 47.5 Other 4.1 1.9 Change in cash 6.8 8.2 Opening cash 74.1 82.3 Closing cash 80.9 74.1 During 2006 we acquired the remaining 58% interest in Regus UK and 27 bolt on acquisitions for a net consideration of 88.5 million.
Regus Report & Accounts 2006 13 Goodwill and intangible assets relating to these acquisitions are 103.7 In addition to acquisitions, million and 21.9 million respectively.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reflects the anticipated future benefits Regus can obtain from we spent 26.7m on opening operating the businesses more efficiently, primarily through increasing 32 new centres.
occupancy and the addition of value adding services.
The intangible amount relates to the brand, customer lists and software.
In addition to these acquisitions, we spent 26.7 million on opening 32 owned centres 15 in Asia Pacific, nine in the Americas and eight in EMEA.
We also opened a further six centres through joint venture, management and franchise agreements.
This growth has been part financed by net borrowings of 23.0 million.
Following the above the Groups net cash position can be analysed as follows: 2006 2005 m m Cash balance 80.9 74.1 Term loan 50.0 22.5 Other loans 3.6 7.4 Finance leases 3.9 8.2 Net cash 23.4 36.0 Of the cash balance, 17.1 million 2005: 19.1 million is blocked and not available for use by the business.
These amounts have mainly been used as collateral against loan and lease obligations of the Group.
Distributable reserves and dividend During the year the Company created distributable reserves by undertaking a court approved cancellation of our share premium account of 153.5 million, this resulted in a corresponding increase in distributable reserves.
As a result, the Group has sufficient distributable reserves to pay dividends to its shareholders.
Given the Groups strong cash generation and its future prospects the Board is proposing, subject to shareholder approval at the 2007 AGM, the payment of a final dividend of 0.6p per share.
The total cost of this dividend payment will amount to 5.9 million.
This dividend is expected to be paid on 1 June 2007 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 27 April 2007.
