Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 | 43 Statutory Group EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2006 increased by 129% to $7,107 million.
The positive impact of the acquisitions and higher LME metals prices more than offset the cost pressures being experienced across the mining industry.
Statutory Group EBIT for the year ended 31 December 2006 increased from $2,520 million to $5,863 million, or by 133%.
The acquisition of Falconbridge was completed through two transactions.
Xstrata acquired 20% of Falconbridge at C$28 per share in August 2005, before acquiring the remaining 80% in 2006 at a price of C$62.50 per share.
The average price paid per share was C$56.44.
Xstratas ability to average the purchase price paid for the second tranche of shares over the full purchase provided Xstrata with a compelling competitive advantage and was a significant factor in the success of the transaction.

This accounting treatment has resulted in the creation of significant additional goodwill of $1.5 billion.
Xstrata has completed a detailed fair value evaluation of the assets acquired and, in accordance with IFRS, tested the goodwill for impairment.
As a result, the company has determined that an impairment charge of $1,378 million to the 2006 statutory income statement is appropriate in the light of the IFRS valuation of the assets.
The impairment has no impact on the 2006 pro forma accounts.
Revenues in 2006 rose by 56% to $27 billion, predominantly due to the positive impact of sustained, stronger commodity prices, particularly in exchange-traded metals.
EBITDA increased by 79% to $10,441 million and EBIT more than doubled to $8,340 million.
EBIT variances shown below have been calculated on the basis of a comparison between the statutory 2005 earnings and pro forma 2006 earnings for the former Xstrata Group.
To enable a meaningful evaluation of the performance of the former Xstrata Group, the contribution to pro forma earnings of the Falconbridge, Tintaya and Cerrejn acquisitions is included as one line.
These acquisitions contributed a total of $4,623 million to pro forma 2006 EBIT.
Higher received sales prices for the majority of Xstratas commodities, in particular for copper and zinc, together with the impact of a stronger US dollar compared to local currencies, contributed $1,798 million to EBIT.
Higher volumes were achieved at Xstratas Australian coal operations, in particular from the coking coal operations and the Rolleston thermal coal mine which was officially opened in 2006.
However, these were more than offset by lower volumes from the north Queensland copper assets due to lower head grades, and lower recoveries from the Mount Isa zinc-lead concentrator due to the transition to processing lower grade ores from the Black Star mine.
Continued robust demand and shortages for key inputs including raw materials and mining equipment, together with increased competition for skilled labour have again resulted in extraordinary increases in mining industry input prices, far in advance of CPI inflation.
As set out in the 2006 interim report, Xstratas commodity businesses have calculated the extraordinary impact of inflation on input prices specific to the mining industry, using third party indices.
Based on these calculations, mining inflation increased Group operating costs by $112 million, over and above CPI inflation of $162 million in 2006, compared to the same period in 2005.
Stripping out the impact of CPI inflation and extraordinary price increases specific to the mining sector, Xstratas businesses excluding the acquisitions made in 2006 achieved real cost savings of $56 million in 2006, in a very challenging environment.

In addition, EBIT in 2006 was impacted by the absence of $21 million of equity-accounted income from Xstratas 20% share in Falconbridge and the absence of gains on sales of assets included in the prior year.

Copper prices reached a high of $8,800 per tonne in May 2006 and remained strong throughout the year.
Nickel prices repeatedly reached new historical highs due to strong demand and critically low stocks, and this trend has continued into 2007.
Zinc prices also significantly outstripped the previous years averages, increasing in the second half of the year as stocks fell and demand remained strong.
Received export thermal coal prices were marginally lower than the prior year, but remained well above long run average prices and have rebounded strongly in early 2007.
Coking coal prices remained at a similar level to 2005, albeit with greater price differential between high quality hard coking coal, such as Xstratas Oaky Creek product, and lower grade semi-soft coal.
Average ferrochrome prices were lower year-on-year, but robust demand for stainless steel from the second quarter supported price increases throughout the year, with ferrochrome prices ending 2006 at 78 per pound.
Whilst ferrovanadium prices dropped substantially from their peaks of early 2005, prices remain above historical levels.

The greatest impact of the stronger US dollar was seen in South Africa, where the average South African rand exchange rate was 6% weaker against the US dollar compared to 2005.

Minority interests rose steeply due to increased profitability at Alumbrera during the period.
Statutory net interest before exceptional items increased from $92 million to $534 million, reflecting the higher levels of borrowings as a result of the Falconbridge acquisition.
The statutory tax charge before exceptional items of $1,574 million represents an effective rate of 29% against 23% for 2005.
The increase in 2006 is mainly due to the higher effective tax rates of the acquired Falconbridge operations and increased profitability in higher rate tax jurisdictions.
Statutory attributable profit before exceptional items doubled, increasing by $1,690 million to $3,350 million.

On a pro forma basis, the Group generated $9.4 billion of operating cash flow during the period.
After funding sustaining capital expenditure of $893 million, the operations generated some $6 billion of free cash flow.
On a statutory basis, cash generated from operations increased by 141% from $2.8 billion to $6.7 billion.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 | 49 During the period, $386 million of Xstratas convertible debentures were converted to equity.
As at 5 March 2007, less than $15 million of convertible debentures remained outstanding.
Acquisitions In the first half of 2006, Xstrata made two major acquisitions at a total value of $2.5 billion.
On 20 April, the Xstrata coal business acquired a one third share of the Cerrejn thermal coal business for $1.7 billion.
The acquisition of the Tintaya copper mine in Peru was completed on 21 June 2006 at a cost of $811 million, net of cash acquired.
In the second half of 2006, Xstrata acquired the remaining 80% of Falconbridge it did not already own, at a cost of $17.1 billion.
Xstrata assumed control of Falconbridge on 15 August and completed the purchase of the remaining outstanding shares on 1 November 2006.
The purchase of a 20% stake in August 2005 for $1.7 billion brought the total acquisition cost to $18.8 billion or C$56.44 per share.
This acquisition has transformed Xstrata, bringing with it a suite of organic growth opportunities, diversification into nickel and aluminium, exposure to North America and a significantly enhanced South American copper business, together with additional scale for the zinc business, now the largest listed producer globally.
Funding and Capital Structure Xstrata was transformed in 2006.
During the year the Group financed three major acquisitions at a total cost of $19.6 billion.
These acquisitions were financed through a combination of operational cash flows, debt and issued equity, maintaining Xstratas investment grade credit rating throughout.
On 17 May 2006, the day that Xstrata announced its offer for Falconbridge, Xstrata placed 62 million shares in the market at a price of 21.00 per share, raising $2.5 billion slightly in excess of the combined purchase price for the acquisitions of Cerrejn and Tintaya that were concluded earlier in the period.
The placement comprised 32.5 million new shares and 29.5 million shares that were previously held by Batiss Investments under Xstratas Equity Capital Management Programme.
The shares held by Batiss had been acquired over time in the market at an average price of 10.72 per share, resulting in a gain of $549 million, recognised directly in equity.
The Groups subsequent acquisition of Falconbridge in August 2006 was funded through a $19 billion financing package.
This package was split equally between acquisition debt of $9.5 billion and bridging facilities of $9.5 billion.
The acquisition further enhanced the Groups risk profile through increased diversification by commodity, currency and geographic spread, together with increased scale and an exceptional suite of cash generative assets.
Xstratas existing credit rating of BBB stable was reaffirmed by Standard & Poors following completion of the transaction and Moodys commenced coverage of the group with a Baa2 stable rating, confirming Xstratas investment grade balance sheet and strong financial outlook.
In October, a successful equity rights issue was completed to raise $5.5 billion, with the proceeds used to repay a portion of the $9.5 billion bridging facilities put in place at the time of the acquisition.
The balance of these facilities was repaid prior to year end, through strong free operating cash flow from operations, together with the proceeds of an inaugural US global bond offering, which was heavily oversubscribed and raised $2.25 billion in November 2006.
Total equity issuance during the year of $8 billion underlines Xstratas commitment to maintain an investment grade credit rating through a conservative capital structure.
Despite undertaking three large acquisitions, funding all capital expenditure programmes and increasing dividend distributions, the Group remains well positioned to take advantage of its many internal growth options and to pursue value-adding external growth opportunities as they arise.
From a pro forma net debt position at 30 June 2006 of $16.1 billion, Xstratas robust free cash flow generation has enabled net debt to decrease to $13.6 billion at year end.
Net debt to equity calculated as net debt to net debt plus equity has correspondingly decreased from 47% to 41% over the same period.
50 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 Financial Review Net debt summary The net indebtedness figures and working capital tables below are shown on a statutory basis.
The debt position at 31 December 2005 is therefore that of the Group excluding the Falconbridge operations.
The debt figures for 31 December 2006 include the impact of additional debt raising for the purchase of Falconbridge, net of substantial debt repayments from strong cash generation in 2006.

The three major acquisitions resulted in a material increase in trade receivables, inventories and trade payables.
Trade receivables increased further as metals sales prices rallied over the period.
Inventories on hand at year end were also higher due to the higher cost of European smelter feedstock.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 | 51 Treasury Management and Financial Instruments The Group is generally exposed to US dollars through its revenue stream.
The Group will seek to source debt capital in US dollars directly or by borrowing in other currencies and swapping them into US dollars, thus matching the negative exposure of debt service obligations against the positive exposure of revenue.
Currency Hedging Currency cash flow hedging may be used to reduce the Groups short-term exposure to fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates to the US dollar, Sterling and Euro.
Net currency hedging gains amounted to less than $1 million in the income statement for the period ended 31 December 2006, compared to gains of $45 million for the corresponding period in 2005.
The unrealised mark-to-market gain for currency hedging maturing in 2007 as at 31 December 2006 was $7 million.

Expansionary capital expenditure for Xstrata on a standalone basis excluding Falconbridge rose to $485 million, broadly in line with the guidance given last year of approximately $500 million.
Major items of expansionary capital expenditure included the Project Lion ferrochrome smelter in South Africa, continued development of the Mototolo PGM project a joint venture with Anglo Platinum and Kagiso Trust Investments, Goedgevonden thermal coal, ongoing expansions to the copper smelter and zinc-lead concentrator at Mount Isa, a new coal wash plant at Collinsville coal mine and the acquisition of a further dragline at the Rolleston operation in Queensland.
The acquisition of Falconbridge brought with it a significant number of high quality projects undergoing development or feasibility studies.
54 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2006 Financial Review In 2006, expenditure on expansionary nickel projects was in excess of $200 million.
