In the therapeutic area of CNS, Shire in-licensed the global rights to Valrocemide SPD493 and other related compounds from Yissum Research and Development Company Yissum in July 2006.
SPD493 is being developed for the treatment of a number of CNS disorders.
In the therapeutic areas of renal and HGT, Shire in-licensed the global rights to Tissue Protective Cytokines SPD500 from Warren Pharmaceuticals Inc Warren in September 2006.
SPD500 is being developed pre-clinically in non-nervous systems indications including renal and genetic disease areas.
In August 2006, Shire entered the Womens Health therapeutic area with the acquisition of rights to the transvaginal ring technology of Duramed Pharmaceuticals Inc Duramed, a subsidiary of Barr, in a number of markets outside North America including the larger European markets together with a license in the same countries to Durameds oral contraceptive, SEASONIQUE.
SEASONIQUE, which is in Phase 3 studies in Europe, is already approved and marketed by Duramed in the US.
As part of its strategy of focusing on drugs with long-term patent protection in its core therapeutic areas, the Group continued its disposal program of non-core assets with the sale to Duramed of ADDERALL for $63 million in August 2006.
ADDERALL was Shires immediate-release ADHD product which has been subject to generic competition since 2002.
Shire also licensed the US and Canadian rights for the investigational HIV compound, SPD754 also known as apricitabine, to the Australian biotechnology company Avexa Limited Avexa on January 23, 2007.
Shire received an up-front cash payment of $10 million, 8 million additional Avexa shares taking its shareholding in Avexa to just over 8% and may receive further milestones and royalties.
Recent developments Acquisition of New River On February 20, 2007 Shire announced that it has agreed to acquire New River for $64 per New River share, or approximately $2.6 billion for the fully diluted equity interest, in an all cash transaction unanimously recommended by the Boards of both companies.
The acquisition is structured as a tender offer for all outstanding shares of New River followed by a merger.
The acquisition is subject to the approval of Shire plcs shareholders as well as the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including the tender of a majority of the outstanding New River shares on a fully-diluted basis.
On March 19, 2007 the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired, satisfying one of the conditions of the tender offer.
For accounting purposes, the acquisition of New River will be accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with IFRS 3.
The total consideration for the acquisition of New River amounts to approximately $2.6 billion in cash.
Shire has entered into new bank facilities of $2.3 billion to provide part of the nancing for the acquisition.
This new facility is conditional upon, amongst other things, approval being given by Shire plcs shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting EGM for Shire plc to exceed the limit on its aggregate borrowings set out in Shire plcs Articles of Association.
Shire plc has also raised approximately $900 million through the private placement of 42,883,721 new Ordinary shares to certain institutional investors worldwide at a price of 1,075 pence per share.
The newly issued shares represent approximately 8.4% of Shire plcs issued Ordinary share capital prior to the placing.
ELAPRASE On January 8, 2007 the EMEA granted marketing authorization for the use of ELAPRASE for the long-term treatment of patients with Hunters syndrome.
Pricing and reimbursement procedures are already underway for ELAPRASE in many European countries and it will be launched across the majority of European countries in 2007.

The following discussion includes references to US prescription and US market share data for key products.
The source of this data is IMS, December 2006.
Annual report and accounts for the 9 year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 10 Financial review ADDERALL XR ADDERALL XR is the leading brand in the US ADHD market, with an average market share of 26% in 2006 2005: 25%.
US ADHD market growth of 4% and the 1% increase in average market share contributed to an 8% increase in US prescriptions for ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005.
Sales of ADDERALL XR for the year to December 31, 2006 were $863.6 million, an increase of 18% compared to the same period in 2005 2005: $730.8 million.
Product sales growth was signicantly higher than prescription growth due primarily to price increases in August 2005 and April 2006.
During October 2005 Shire led a Citizen Petition with the FDA requesting that the FDA require more rigorous bioequivalence testing or additional clinical testing for generic or follow-on drug products that reference ADDERALL XR before they can be approved.
Shire received correspondence from the FDA in April 2006 stating that, due to the complex issues raised requiring extensive review and analysis by the FDAs ofcials, a decision cannot yet be reached by the FDA.
The FDA did not provide any guidance as to when that decision may be reached.
On August 14, 2006 Shire and Barr announced that all pending litigation in connection with Barrs Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA and its attempt to market generic versions of Shires ADDERALL XR had been settled.
As part of the settlement, Barr entered into consent judgments and agreed to permanent injunctions conrming the validity and enforceability of Shires US Patents Nos.
Barr has also admitted that any generic product made under its ANDA would infringe the 768 patent.
Under the terms of the settlement, Barr will not be permitted to market a generic version of ADDERALL XR in the US until April 1, 2009, except in certain limited circumstances, such as the launch of another partys generic version of ADDERALL XR.
No payments to Barr are involved in the settlement agreement.
In January 2006, Shire settled its ADDERALL XR patent infringement lawsuits with Impax.
Under the terms of the settlement, Impax will be permitted to market generic versions of ADDERALL XR in the US no later than January 1, 2010 and will pay Shire a royalty from those sales.
In certain situations, such as the launch of another generic version of ADDERALL XR, Impax may be permitted to enter the market as the Groups authorized generic.
No payments to Impax are involved in the settlement agreement.
Patent litigation proceedings relating to ADDERALL XR are in progress.
See Note 37 for further details.
ADDERALL In September 2006, Shire sold to Duramed the product rights to ADDERALL for $63.0 million.
The sales in the year of $23.6 million occurred prior to the sale of the product rights.
DAYTRANA Following its launch in June 2006, DAYTRANA achieved a 2% share of the ADHD market by December 31, 2006.
Sales for the year to December 31, 2006 were $25.1 million, a level of sales which triggered the first of three potential $25.0 million sales milestone payments to Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. Noven.
This milestone, which was paid on February 14, 2007, has been capitalized and will be amortized over ten years.
Net sales for 2006 were impacted by the redemption of $14 million of coupons issued to support the product launch.
The addition of DAYTRANA, combined with growth in ADDERALL XR market share has helped Shire grow its total share of the ADHD market to 28% at December 31, 2006 compared to 26% which included a 1% share relating to ADDERALL at December 31, 2005.
Shire has received reports concerning difficulty removing the release liner from a small percentage of DAYTRANA patches.
Although the product meets specications, during the first quarter of 2007 Noven implemented manufacturing enhancements intended to make DAYTRANA easier to use.
CARBATROL US prescriptions for the year ending December 31, 2006 were down 9% compared to the same period in 2005.
This was primarily due to a 6% decline in the US extended release carbamazepine prescription market.
CARBATROLs US market share remained at 42%.
Sales of CARBATROL for the year ending December 31, 2006 were $68.3 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the same period in 2005 2005: $72.1 million.
The fall in sales is due to the decrease in the extended release carbamezapine market and a reduction of pipeline inventory in 2006 compared to stocking in 2005, offset by price increases in October 2005 and July 2006.
In July 2006 Impax deployed a sales force to begin promotion of CARBATROL under a promotional services agreement for the US market signed in January 2006.
Patent litigation proceedings with Nostrum and Corepharma relating to CARBATROL are in-progress.
PENTASA US prescriptions for the year ending December 31, 2006 were up 2% compared to the same period in 2005 primarily due to a 4% increase in the US oral mesalamine prescription market.
PENTASAs US market share remained at 18%.
Sales of PENTASA for the year ending December 31, 2006 were $137.8 million, an increase of 1% compared to the same period in 2005 2005: $136.1 million.
Sales growth is marginally lower than prescription growth due to the lower levels of pipeline stocking in 2006, partly offset by the impact of price increases in January 2006 and November 2006.
10 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 11 Financial review XAGRID Sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $53.3 million, an increase of 14% compared to the same period in 2005 2005: $46.8 million.
Expressed in transaction currencies XAGRID is primarily sold in Euros, sales increased by 13% due mainly to strong growth in France and Spain.
In addition there was a benefit of 1% from favorable exchange rate movements against the US Dollar.
AGRYLIN sales in North America US and Canada were $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 2005: $46.0 million.
This reduction was expected following the approval of generic versions of AGRYLIN in the US market in April 2005.
FOSRENOL US prescriptions for the year ending December 31, 2006 were up 34% compared to 2005 due to FOSRENOL increasing its average share of the total US phosphate binding market to 9% 2005: 7% and market growth of 9% over the same period.
FOSRENOL was launched in the US in January 2005.
US sales of FOSRENOL for the year ending December 31, 2006 were $40.2 million 2005: $53.0 million.
The decrease in net sales of 16% compared to prescription growth of 34% is primarily due to destocking in 2006 compared to significant stocking of higher strength formulations at the end of 2005.
An agreement with Abbott was signed in December 2006 for the co-promotion of FOSRENOL in the US.
Abbotts US renal care sales team will co-promote FOSRENOL with its own renal product ZEMPLAR.
Shires US sales force will also continue to promote FOSRENOL.
This agreement began in Q1 2007 and will continue for a term of five years.
European sales of FOSRENOL for the year ending December 31, 2006 were $4.6 million 2005: $0.5 million, giving total FOSRENOL sales worldwide of $44.8 million 2005: $53.5 million.
FOSRENOL has now been launched in Germany, France and a number of other European countries, including the UK which launched in February 2007.
Launches will continue throughout 2007 in the EU including Italy and Spain, subject to nalization of national licensing and conclusion of pricing and re-imbursement negotiations.
On October 18, 2006 Health Canada granted a marketing license application for FOSRENOL.
The Canadian launch is planned for Q2 2007.
REPLAGAL Sales for the year ending December 31, 2006 were $117.7 million, of which 88% were in Europe and 12% in the rest of the world excluding the US.
Sales for REPLAGAL for the year ending December 31, 2005 were $94.6 million, including pre-acquisition sales of $53.3 million.
This represents a like-for-like increase in sales of 24% which was due to greater European coverage by an increased number of sales representatives and strong growth in the rest of the world market.
ELAPRASE ELAPRASE was launched in the US in August 2006 and has had a strong start with over 110 patients receiving treatment by the end of December 2006.
In addition, through the pre-approval process, over 100 patients were receiving treatment in Europe by the end of the year.
Sales reached $23.6 million by December 31, 2006.
Foreign exchange effect As many of the Groups sales revenues are earned in currencies other than US Dollars primarily Canadian Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Swedish Krona and Euros, revenue growth reported in US Dollars includes the impact of translating the sales made in the transaction currency, into US Dollars.
With the US Dollar weakening against these currencies over the last 12 months, the translation of sales made in these currencies into US Dollars has benefited reported growth rates.
The table below shows the effect of foreign exchange translations on the revenue growth of the key affected products as well as the underlying performance of key products in their transaction currencies: 2006 sales 2006 sales in growth in Impact of 2006 sales US Dollars transaction translation to growth in Year to December 31, $ million currency US Dollars US Dollars XAGRID sales in Euros 32.5 12% 1% 13% XAGRID sales in Pounds Sterling 20.8 14% 2% 16% CALCICHEW sales in Pounds Sterling 41.0 15% 2% 17% REMINYL and REMINYL XL sales in Pounds Sterling 19.8 64% 3% 67% Revenue growth analysis does not include REPLAGAL sales of $104.3 million in Euros and Swedish Krona.

GSKs worldwide sales of 3TC for the year to December 31, 2006 were $1,138 million, a decrease of 6% compared to prior year 2005: $1,211 million.
The nucleoside analogue market for HIV has continued to grow: however competitive pressures within the market have increased, leading to a decline in 3TC sales.
ZEFFIX Royalties from sales of ZEFFIX for the year to December 31, 2006 were $34.8 million, an increase of 14% compared to the prior year 2005: $30.5 million.

GSKs worldwide sales of ZEFFIX for the year to December 31, 2006 were $301 million, an increase of 13% compared to prior year 2005: $266 million.
This increase was mainly due to strong growth in the Korean, Japanese and Chinese markets.
Other Other royalties are primarily in respect of REMINYL and REMINYL ER known as RAZADYNE and RAZADYNE ER in the US, a product marketed worldwide excluding the UK and the Republic of Ireland by Janssen Pharmaceutical N. V. Janssen, an afliate of Johnson & Johnson.
Shire has the exclusive marketing rights in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Sales of the REMINYL RAZADYNE range, for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia of the Alzheimers type, continue to grow.
In June 2006 Janssen and Synaptech led a law suit against Barr for infringement of their patent rights relating to RAZADYNE ER as a result of Barr ling an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of RAZADYNE ER.
No court date has been set.
Barr and other companies have led ANDAs with the FDA for generic versions of RAZADYNE and Janssen and Synaptech have led law suits against some of those ANDA lers.
The court date for the first of these proceedings is May 2007.
Cost of product sales For the year to December 31, 2006 the cost of product sales was 16% of product sales 2005: 16%.
For the year to December 31, 2006 the cost of product sales for REPLAGAL included a $47.0 million adjustment in respect of acquired inventories 2005: $41.9 million.

ii Excludes depreciation from manufacturing plants of $4.8 million 2005: $3.5 million which is included in cost of product sales.
As a percentage of product sales, these expenses were 79% 2005: 96%.
The decrease was primarily due to a lower impairment charge in respect of goodwill in 2006 of $271.9 million 2005: $527.0 million.
Excluding depreciation, amortization and goodwill impairment charges, SG&A costs increased by 25% to $829.4 million 2005: $663.8 million, and represented 54% of product sales 2005: 50%.
The increase in SG&A expenses was expected, with additional expenditure required for: the promotion and launch of DAYTRANA including an increase in the ADHD sales force : the recruitment of a new GI sales force in the US: the recruitment of new US and European sales forces to launch ELAPRASE: and pre-launch activities relating to the 2007 launches of DYNEPO, LIALDA and VYVANSE.
The depreciation charge within SG&A for the year to December 31, 2006 was $36.1 million 2005: $26.0 million, which in 2006 included property, plant and equipment write-downs of $0.5 million 2005: $6.5 million.
Amortization charges, including the amortization on acquired products, were $82.5 million for the year to December 31, 2006 2005: $55.7 million, which included intangible asset impairments for the year to December 31, 2006 of $1.1 million 2005: $4.4 million.
In 2006 the impairment charge resulted from a decision to stop selling a non-core product.
In 2005 the impairment charge resulted from the approval of generic versions of AGRYLIN in April 2005 and the decision not to support and promote certain non-core products going forward, which resulted in changes to the estimate of the Groups future cash ows.
In 2005, within SG&A costs the Group recorded reorganization costs of $9.4 million as a result of a consolidation of its North American sites.
No reorganization costs were incurred in 2006.
For the year to December 31, 2006 the Group incurred $5.6 million of costs associated with the integration of the TKT business into the Shire Group 2005: $9.7 million.
This included retention payments for key staff of $3.0 million, IT costs of $1.2 million and other costs of $1.4 million.
These costs have been recorded within SG&A.
Gain on sale of product rights For the year to December 31, 2006 the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $63.0 million 2005: $nil on the disposal of ADDERALL to Duramed for $63.0 million in cash.
Investment revenues For the year to December 31, 2006 the Group received interest income of $50.5 million 2005: $35.3 million.
This income primarily related to interest received on Shires cash balances.
Interest income for the year ending December 31, 2006 is higher than for the year ending December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of increases in US Dollar interest rates.
Finance costs For the year to December 31, 2006 the Group incurred interest expense of $27.0 million 2005: $12.4 million.
In 2006, this expense included a $24.7 million 2005: $7.7 million provision for interest, which may be awarded by the court in respect of amounts due to former holders of approximately 11.3 million shares of TKT common stock who have submitted written demands for appraisal of these shares.
See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Share of post tax loss profit from associates and joint ventures Net earnings of equity method investees of $5.8 million were recorded for the year to December 31, 2006 2005: net losses of $1.0 million.
This comprised earnings of $6.3 million from the 50% share of the antiviral commercialization partnership with GSK in Canada 2005: $5.3 million, offset by losses of $0.5 million being the Groups share of losses in the GeneChem and EGS Healthcare Funds 2005: losses of $6.3 million.
Taxation The effective tax rate for the year to December 31, 2006 was 88.0% 2005: 26.8%.
The effective rate has increased as a result of an increase in the current tax charge, offset by an increase in deferred tax credits.
The increase in the current tax charge was primarily a result of additional tax contingencies of $187 million recognized in relation to ongoing tax audits, partially offset by the decrease in non-deductible goodwill impairment in the current year.
The increase in the deferred tax credit is due to increases in deferred tax assets primarily as a result of a reversal of valuation allowances following changes in estimates as to the realization, and by the crystallization of additional losses.
No tax deduction is available on the impairment of goodwill that was created on the acquisition of BioChem Pharma Inc. A full reconciliation of the effective tax rate for 2006 to the UK statutory tax rate of 30% is given in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Discontinued operations During the year to December 31, 2006 the gain on disposal of discontinued operations totaled $40.6 million 2005: $3.1 million.
During 2006, ID Biomedical Corporation IDB repaid $70.6 million, being the injectable u development tranche of the $100.0 million development loan facility provided to IDB as part of their acquisition of Shires vaccine business.
The repayment followed GSKs acquisition of IDB, after which IDB was provided with resources by GSK to fund the early repayment of the injectable u tranche.
The $29.4 million pipeline development tranche of the loan facility is still outstanding.
At the time of the disposal, a provision of $70.0 million was charged to discontinued operations on the basis that there was no certainty of recovery of this amount.
The $70.0 million provision was allocated against all of the pipeline development tranche $29.4 million and against $40.6 million of the $70.6 million injectable u development tranche.
Accordingly, a gain on disposition of discontinued operations of $40.6 million 2005: $3.1 million was recognized on repayment of the loan by IDB.
The repayment of the $70.6 million injectable u tranche had no tax effect.
Liquidity and capital resources General The Groups funding requirements depend on a number of factors, including its development programs: corporate, business and product acquisitions: the level of resources required for the expansion of manufacturing and marketing capabilities as the product base expands: increases in accounts receivable and inventory which may arise as sales levels increase: competitive and technological developments: the timing and cost of obtaining required regulatory approvals for new products: the timing and quantum of milestone payments on collaborative projects: the timing of and quantum of tax and dividend payments: the timing and quantum of purchases of Shire shares in the market to satisfy option exercises and the continuing cash generated from sales of Shires key products.
An important part of Shires business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available.
The Group intends to defend its intellectual property and as a result may need cash for funding litigation expenses incurred.
The Company ordinarily nances its activities through cash generated from operating activities, credit facilities, private and public offerings of equity and debt securities and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals.

The RCF and Term Loan A mature on February 20, 2012.
Term Loan A is repaid in annual installments on the anniversary of the New Facilities Agreement in the following amounts: $150 million in 2008, $150 million in 2009, $200 million in 2010, $200 million in 2011 and the balance on maturity.
Term Loan B matures on February 19, 2008.
As noted above, at Shires request, the maturity date of Term Loan B may be extended for a further 364 days.
The availability of loans under the New Facilities is subject to customary conditions, including the absence of any defaults thereunder and the accuracy in all material respects of Shires representations and warranties contained therein.
The New Facilities include representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including i requirements that Shires ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA as dened in the New Facilities Agreement does not exceed 3.50:1 for the 12 month period ending December 31, 2007: 3.25:1 for the 12 month period ending June 30, 2008: and 3.00:1 for each 12 month period ending December 31, and June 30, thereafter and ii that the ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest as dened in the New Facilities Agreement must not be less than 4.0 to 1, for each 12 month period ending December 31, or June 30, and additional limitations on the creation of liens, disposal of assets, incurrence of indebtedness, making of loans and giving of guarantees.
Interest on loans under the New Facilities will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which period may be one week or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire or as otherwise agreed with the Lenders.
The interest rate on each loan drawn under the RCF or Term Loan A for each interest period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin initially set at 0.80% per annum until delivery of the compliance certicate for the year ending December 31, 2007 and thereafter ranging from 0.40 to 0.80% per annum, depending on the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA, LIBOR, and mandatory cost, if any as calculated in accordance with Schedule 5 of the New Facilities Agreement.
The interest rate on each loan drawn under Term Loan B for each interest period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin being from 0.50% for the first six months from the date of the New Facilities Agreement, 0.75% for the second six months and 1.00% per annum thereafter, LIBOR, and mandatory cost, if any as calculated in accordance with Schedule 5 of the New Facilities Agreement.
Shire shall also pay fees equal to 35% per annum of the applicable margin on available commitments under the RCF for the availability period applicable to the RCF and 20% per annum of the applicable margin on available commitments under Term Loan A and Term Loan B for the availability period applicable to Term Loan A and Term Loan B.
Interest on overdue amounts under the New Facilities will accrue at a rate, which is one percentage point higher than the rates otherwise applicable to the loans under the New Facilities.
The New Facilities Agreement restricts subject to certain carve-outs Shires ability to incur additional financial indebtedness, grant security over its assets or provide or guarantee loans.
Further any lender may require mandatory prepayment of its participation if there is a change in control of the Company.
In addition, in certain circumstances, the net proceeds of certain asset disposals by Shire must be applied towards mandatory prepayment of the facilities, subject to certain exceptions.
Upon a change of control of the Company or upon the occurrence of an event of default and the expiration of any applicable cure period, the total commitments under the New Facilities may be cancelled, all or part of the loans, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued or outstanding may become immediately due and payable.
Events of default under the New Facilities Agreement include: i non-payment of any amounts due under the New Facilities: ii failure to satisfy any financial covenants: iii material misrepresentation in any of the finance documents: iv failure to pay, or certain other defaults under other financial indebtedness: v certain insolvency events or proceedings: vi material adverse changes in the business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Group: vii certain ERISA breaches which would have a material adverse effect: viii if it becomes illegal for Shire plc or any of its subsidiaries that are parties to the New Facilities Agreement to perform their obligations or ix if Shire plc or any subsidiary of the Company which is party to the New Facilities Agreement repudiates the New Facilities Agreement or any Finance Document as dened in the New Facilities Agreement.
The New Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.
Equity nancing Shire also raised approximately $900 million through the private placement of 42,883,721 new Ordinary shares to certain institutional investors at a price of 1075 pence per share.
The newly issued shares represent approximately 8.4% of the Companys issued Ordinary share capital prior to the placing.
Annual report and accounts for the 15 year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 16 Financial review Shire anticipates that its operating cash ow together with available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the above-mentioned New Facilities will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future operating expenses, any costs arising as a result of the acquisition of New River, outstanding costs related to the acquisition of TKT, capital expenditures, dividends, tax payments, share repurchases and debt service and lease obligations as they become due over the next twelve months.
If the Company decides to acquire other businesses, it expects to fund these acquisitions from existing cash resources, the New Facilities Agreement discussed above and possibly through new borrowings and or the issue of new equity if necessary.
Sources and uses of cash The following table provides an analysis of the Groups gross and net cash funds excluding restricted cash as at December 31, 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 Change December 31, $ million $ million % Cash and cash equivalents 1,126.9 656.5 72 Short-term investments 6.9 n a Gross cash funds 1,126.9 663.4 70 Finance lease liabilities 10.4 7.3 42 2% guaranteed convertible loan notes 2011 0.1 n a Total debt 10.4 7.4 41 Net cash funds 1,116.5 656.0 70 Cash ow activity Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to December 31, 2006, was $565.0 million, an increase of $163.8 million compared to the previous year.
The increase in cash generation is primarily due to favorable movements in working capital, in particular the timing of sales within the final quarter of 2006 coupled with a reduction in the net tax paid of $48.5 million due to the utilization of tax losses acquired as part of the TKT acquisition.
Net cash used in investing activities was $54.5 million in the year to December 31, 2006.
This included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $68.7 million, intangibles of $173.6 million and long-term investments of $9.8 million respectively, offset by proceeds from sale of the ADDERALL product rights for $63.0 million, proceeds from loans repaid by IDB of $70.6 million and interest received on cash balances of $47.2 million.
Capital expenditure on tangible xed assets included $8.0 million on building improvements and $8.2 million on IT at the Basingstoke, UK, headquarters: $9.9 million on construction work at Shires manufacturing facility at Owings Mills, Maryland: and $8.8 million and $12.0 on leasehold improvements and IT equipment, respectively at Shires site in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Capital expenditure on intangible assets included $50.0 million paid to Noven on the approval of DAYTRANA, $50 million paid to New River in respect of VYVANSE milestones, other product and milestone payments of $33.2 million and software purchases, principally $32.2 million on IT projects at the Wayne, Pennsylvania US headquarters.
Net cash used in nancing activities was $48.0 million for the year to December 31, 2006.
This was primarily due to the cost to purchase treasury shares of $92.0 million and dividend payments of $32.4 million, offset by inows of $82.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options.
Outstanding letters of credit As at December 31, 2006, the Group had irrevocable standby letters of credit with Barclays Bank plc in the amount of $14.2 million providing security on the recoverability of insurance claims and with Bank of America in the amount of $7.8 million, providing security on the payment of lease obligations.
16 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 17 Financial review Cash requirements Aggregate contractual obligations As at December 31, 2006, the Groups contractual obligations were as follows: Payments due by period Less than More than Total 1 year 13 years 35 years 5 years Contractual obligations $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million i Operating leases 143.8 26.1 38.4 35.6 43.7 ii Purchase obligations 155.1 117.8 27.7 8.3 1.3 iii Other long-term liabilities reected on the Balance Sheet 500.7 481.6 10.9 1.8 6.4 Total  i The Group leases certain properties, motor vehicles and equipment under operating leases expiring through 2025. ii Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.
Shire expects to fund these commitments with cash ows from operations.
iii Other long-term liabilities include the liability to dissenting shareholders.
As at December 31, 2006, appraisal rights had been asserted in respect of approximately 11.3 million shares of TKT common stock.
As at December 31, 2006 the Group recorded a liability of $419.9 million based on the merger consideration of $37 per share for the 11.3 million shares outstanding at that time plus a provision for interest of $32.4 million that may be awarded by the Court see Note 13.
Until such time as the appraisal process is complete, the Group is unable to determine the extent of its liability.
For every $1 increase decrease in the merger consideration applicable to those TKT shareholders who have asserted appraisal rights, the total estimated purchase price would increase decrease by approximately $11.3 million.
The contractual obligations table above does not include payments yet to fall due upon the occurrence of certain milestones and other contractual commitments.
The most significant payments are as follows: i DAYTRANA In connection with the Groups acquisition in 2003 from Noven of the worldwide sales and marketing rights to DAYTRANA, as at December 31, 2006 Shire has a remaining obligation to pay Noven up to $50 million, contingent on future sales performance.
DAYTRANA received final regulatory approval from the US FDA on April 6, 2006 and as a result Shire paid a $50 million milestone to Noven.
During the year, the Group also reached a sales milestone for DAYTRANA and as a result, Shire made a payment to Noven of $25 million in February 2007.
Both amounts have been capitalized during the year to December 31, 2006 and amortization of these amounts, together with the upfront milestone payment of $25 million made in 2003, will continue over the estimated life of the product of approximately ten years.
ii VYVANSE In January 2005, the Group entered into an agreement with New River to collaborate in developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling VYVANSE in the US.
In the rest of the world, the Group acquired the license to develop and commercialize VYVANSE, in consideration of a low double-digit royalty.
Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will collaborate on VYVANSE development, manufacturing, marketing and sales in the US.
New River will be nancially and operationally responsible for clinical and manufacturing development.
Shire will book the product sales and New River will supply up to 25% of the sales effort under a co-promotion right.
Shire is obligated to give VYVANSE marketing and promotional priority over its other oral ADHD stimulants should VYVANSEs label contain a claim that it has decreased potential for abuse or increased overdose protection.
Shire paid an initial sum of $50 million on signing and a further $50 million was paid to New River following acceptance of the ling of a New Drug Application NDA by the FDA in January 2006.
If VYVANSE is approved with a Schedule III, IV or V classication or is unscheduled favorable scheduling, Shire will pay New River a $300 million milestone payment.
US operating profit will be divided as follows: Shire will retain 75% of profits for the first two years following launch, and the parties will share the profits equally thereafter.
In the event that VYVANSE receives a final Schedule II classication, no milestone payment will be payable by Shire to New River upon approval.
Division of profits will be calculated under an alternative profit sharing scheme.
New Rivers share of US product profits for the first two years will be at least 25%, though it may increase to a value determined by a preset sales based formula: for following years, it will be at least 50%, though it may increase to a value determined by a preset sales based formula thereafter.
These formulas, which include yearly threshold sales, were included in an 8-K led with the SEC on October 10, 2006.
If VYVANSE is classied as Schedule II on approval and then gets favorable scheduling within one year of the first commercial sale, Shire will pay New River a $200 million milestone payment: if favorable scheduling occurs by the third anniversary, the milestone payment will be $100 million.
Upon favorable scheduling being achieved under each of these scenarios, the profit sharing formula reverts to that applicable to favorable scheduling.
Annual report and accounts for the 17 year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 18 Financial review In addition, New River will be entitled to a $100 million milestone payment at the end of the first calendar year in which cumulative worldwide net sales of all collaboration products during that calendar year exceed $1 billion.
A $5 million milestone payment is payable following the first commercial sale in specified European countries.
Shire intends to capitalize and amortize any milestone payments over the life of the product.
Shire is entitled to terminate the agreement until 30 days following approval of VYVANSE.
If Shire terminates before regulatory approval, no payment would be due to Shire.
If Shire terminates after approval and VYVANSE has received a favorable scheduling assignment, no payment would be due to Shire.
If the approved VYVANSE has received a Schedule II classication, Shire would be entitled to a $50 million termination payment, payable in cash, New River common stock, or an unsecured, five-year promissory note, as will be agreed upon by Shire and New River.
On February 20, 2007 Shire announced that it had agreed to acquire New River for $2.6 billion in cash.
On completion of the acquisition of New River, these commitments are extinguished.
For further information see Note 41 of the Group consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
iii Womens health products Shire and Duramed entered into an agreement related to Durameds transvaginal ring technology that will be applied to at least five womens health products, as well as a license in a number of markets outside of North America, including the larger European markets to Durameds oral contraceptive, SEASONIQUE.
This agreement became effective on September 6, 2006.
Under this agreement, Shire will reimburse Duramed for US development expenses incurred going forward up to a maximum of $140 million over eight years.
US development expenditure reimbursement for the year ended December 31, 2006, totalled $2.5 million, with $2.0 million due for reimbursement at December 31, 2006.
At December 31, 2006, the maximum future reimbursement for Duramed incurred US development expenditure is therefore $137.5 million.
Shire will separately be responsible for development costs in its licensed territories.
iv Tissue Protective Cytokine TPC development rights In connection with the Groups licence of TPC rights in non-nervous system indications from Warren, the Group is committed to making payments on achievement of certain milestones.
The Group is not required to make any payments to Warren upon regulatory approval of the first product for the first indication.
However, it is obligated to make milestone payments to Warren of $25 million upon regulatory approval in up to five subsequent major indications.
v Other R&D and sales milestones In addition to the commitments set out in i to iv above, at December 31, 2006 the Group had commitments payable on achievement of specified milestones and fees payable for products under development in-licensed from third parties of $75.6 million December 31, 2005: $18.0 million, of which $12.9 million could be paid in 2007. Business risk management The Group has adopted a risk management strategy that enables it to identify, assess and manage the significant risks that it faces.
While the Group aims to identify and manage such risks, no risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss.
Set out below are the key risk factors, associated with the business, that have been identied through the Groups approach to risk management.
These risk factors apply equally to the Group and, therefore, they should all be carefully considered before any investment is made in Shire.
Any decrease in the sales of ADDERALL XR will signicantly reduce revenues and earnings In 2006, sales of ADDERALL XR were $863.6 million, representing approximately 48% of the Groups revenues.
Any factors that decrease sales of ADDERALL XR could signicantly reduce revenue and earnings and have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
These include: issues impacting the production of ADDERALL XR or the supply of amphetamine salts: development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals, including generic versions: technological advances including the approval of new competing products for ADHD treatments : loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent the Groups patents: changes in reimbursement policies of third-party payers: government action intervention: marketing or pricing actions by competitors: public opinion towards ADHD treatments: 18 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 19 Financial review any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention: product liability claims: or changes in prescription-writing practices.
Any decrease in the sales of 3TC could signicantly reduce revenues and earnings The Group receives royalties from GSK on the worldwide sales of 3TC.
In 2006, the Groups royalty income relating to 3TC sales was $150.9 million, representing approximately 8% of total revenues.
This income stream generates a larger proportion of net income relative to the Groups own product sales as there are minimal costs associated with this income.
Any factors that decrease sales of 3TC by GSK could signicantly reduce the Groups revenues and earnings.
These include: reduction in production of 3TC: development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals: technological advances: loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents: government action intervention: marketing or pricing actions by GSKs competitors: any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention: public opinion towards AIDS treatments: or product liability claims.
VYVANSE and the Companys other new products may not be a commercial success The commercial success of the Groups new products will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians, patients and other key decision-makers, as well as the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals, the scope of marketing approval as reected in the products label, the countries in which such approvals are obtained, the authorization of price and reimbursement in those countries where price and reimbursement is negotiated, and safety, efcacy, convenience and cost-effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products.
In particular, the Company may not be able to transition patients successfully from ADDERALL XR to VYVANSE, especially if any or all of the following occur: if physicians who are comfortable with an existing product are unwilling to prescribe a new product in its place: if patients who are comfortable with an existing product do not wish to take a new product in its place: if parents or caregivers who are comfortable with an existing product do not want their children to take a new product in its place: if third-party payors are unwilling to pay for a new product: if the sales and marketing efforts behind VYVANSE are not effective in positioning VYVANSE and differentiating it from ADDERALL XR: if the FDA approved label for VYVANSE is not seen as signicantly differentiating VYVANSE from currently marketed treatments for ADHD: or if competitive products are genericized and the impact on the market negatively affects the prescribing of branded treatments for ADHD.
Further, if VYVANSE is not a commercial success, Shire will not experience the anticipated economic benets from VYVANSE or from Shires proposed acquisition of New River.
If the Group is unable to commercialize VYVANSE or any other new product successfully, there may be an adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.

Many of the Groups competitors are large, well-known pharmaceutical, biotechnology, chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources.
Companies with more resources and larger R&D expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications.
They may also be more successful than the Group in acquiring or licensing new products for development and commercialization.
Further, they may also have an improved likelihood of obtaining approval of drugs that may compete with those marketed or under development by the Group.
If any product that competes with one of the Groups principal drugs is approved, the Groups sales of that drug could fall.
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change.
The Groups products could, therefore, be rendered obsolete or uneconomic, through the development of new products, technological advances in manufacturing or production by its competitors.
The failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, or an adequate level of reimbursement, by third-party payers in a timely manner for certain of the Groups products may impact future revenues The prices for certain of the Groups products when commercialised, including, in particular, products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases, may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products.
The Group may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for its products, including those that are likely to have a high annual cost of therapy.
The failure to obtain and maintain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect revenues.
A disruption to the product supply chain may result in the Group being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the Group being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis The Group has its own manufacturing capability for certain products and has also entered into supply agreements with third party contract manufacturers.
In the event of either the Groups failure or the failure of any third party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards often referred to as Current Good Manufacturing Standards or CGMP in the countries in which the Group intends to sell or have its products sold, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
The Group dual-sources certain key products and or active ingredients.
However, there is currently reliance on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of CARBATROL, AGRYLIN, XAGRID, REMINYL, DYNEPO, DAYTRANA and ELAPRASE and reliance on a single active ingredient source for each of PENTASA, REPLAGAL, FOSRENOL, AGRYLIN, XAGRID, DAYTRANA, DYNEPO, ELAPRASE and REMINYL.
In the event of financial failure of a third party contract manufacturer, the Group may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products.
This could have a material adverse affect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
There is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms, or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements.
The Group is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements The Group has its own warehousing and distribution capability for certain products and has entered into distribution agreements with third party distributors for certain services.
The failure of either the Groups or a third partys service could result in the Group being unable to continue to distribute its products.
The development and approval of the Groups products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities.
As the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications, regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the marketing approval.
The need to qualify a new supplier could delay the Groups development and commercialization efforts.
The Group uses bovine-derived serum sourced from New Zealand and North America in some of its manufacturing processes.
The discovery of additional cattle in North America or the discovery of cattle in New Zealand with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on certain of the Groups products, or prohibit the Group from using its products at all in such countries.
Fluctuations in wholesale buying patterns may inuence net sales and growth comparisons A significant portion of the Groups product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the US and Europe.
Consequently, product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by uctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers.
These uctuations may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors.
In the event of financial failure of certain customers, the Group may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues For the scal year to December 31, 2006, the three largest trade customers, McKesson Corp. Cardinal Health Inc. and Amerisource Bergen Corp. accounted for approximately 43%, 29% and 11% of the Groups product sales, respectively.
The financial failure of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
The actions of certain customers can affect the Groups ability to sell or market products profitably A small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the US and European markets.
In 2006, for example, approximately 83% of the Groups product sales were attributable to three customers.
In addition, the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred.
Consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels, or otherwise reduce purchases of the Groups products.
Such actions could have an adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
20 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 21 Financial review A significant portion of the Groups revenues for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are concentrated with a small number of customers.
Changes in the buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on the Groups financial condition and results of operations.
The actions of governments, industry regulators and the economic environments in which the Group operates may adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products profitably Changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry, which are made in any country in which the Group conducts its business, may adversely impact the Groups sales, financial condition and results of operations.
In particular, changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation.
Changes in the general economic conditions in any of the Groups major markets may also affect the Groups sales, financial condition and results of operations.
The Groups revenues are partly dependent on the level of reimbursement provided to the Group by governmental reimbursement schemes for pharmaceutical products.
Changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the Groups sales, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the cost of treatment established by health care providers, private health insurers and other organisations, such as health maintenance organisations and managed care organisations are under downward pressure and this, in turn, could impact on the prices at which the Group can sell its products.
The market for pharmaceutical products could be signicantly inuenced by the following, which could result in lower prices for the Groups products and or a reduced demand for the Groups products: the ongoing trend toward managed healthcare, particularly in the US: legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs in many of the Groups markets: or price controls and non-reimbursement of new and highly priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established.
Parallel importation occurs when an importer nds a cheaper price for a product or equivalent product on the world market and imports that product from the lower price jurisdiction to the higher price jurisdiction.
If the parallel importation of lower priced drugs is permitted in the US, it could have the effect of reducing sales of equivalent drugs in the US.
To the extent that parallel importation increases, the Group may receive less revenue from its commercialised products.
The parallel importation of prescription drugs is relatively common within the EU.
If the Groups projects or clinical trials for the development of products are unsuccessful, its products will not receive authorization for manufacture and sale Due to the complexity of the formulation and development of pharmaceuticals, the Group cannot be certain that it will successfully complete the development of new products, or, if successful, that such products will be commercially viable.
Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development, the Group must demonstrate through clinical and other studies that the product is of appropriate quality and is safe and effective for the claimed use.
Clinical trials of any product under development may not demonstrate the quality, safety and efcacy required to result in an approvable or a marketable product.
Failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efcacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product.
In addition, regulatory authorities in Europe, the US, Canada and other countries may require additional studies, which could result in a increased costs and significant development delays, or b termination of a project if it would no longer be economically viable.
The completion rate of clinical trials is dependent upon, among other factors, obtaining adequate clinical supplies and recruiting patients.
Delays in patient enrolment in clinical trials may also result in increased costs and program delays.
Additional delays can occur in instances in which the Group shares control over the planning and execution of product development with collaborative partners.
The Group cannot be certain that, if clinical trials are completed, either the Group or its collaborative partners will le for, or receive, required authorizations to manufacture and or market potential products in a timely manner.
If the Group is unable to meet the requirements of regulators in relation to a particular product, it may be unable to develop the product or obtain or retain the necessary marketing approvals Drug companies are required to obtain regulatory approval before manufacturing and marketing most drug products.
Regulatory approval is generally based on the results of: quality testing chemistry, manufacturing and controls : non-clinical testing: and clinical testing.
The clinical development, manufacture, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive regulation, including separate regulation by each member state of the EU, the EMEA itself and federal, state and local regulation in the US.
Unanticipated legislative and other regulatory actions and developments concerning various aspects of the Groups operations and products may restrict its ability to sell one or more of its products or to sell those products at a profit.
The generation of data is regulated and any generated data is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
Required regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all.
In addition, other regulatory requirements for any such proposed products may not be met.
Annual report and accounts for the 21 year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 22 Financial review Even if the Group obtains regulatory approvals, the terms of any product approval, including labelling, may be more restrictive than desired and could affect the marketability of its products.
Regulatory authorities have the power amongst other things, to: revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products: require the recall of products that fail to meet regulatory requirements: and close manufacturing plants that do not operate in conformity with cGMP and or other regulatory requirements or approvals.
Such delays or actions could affect the Groups ability to manufacture and sell its products.
The failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue The Group enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing.
In these partnerships, the Group is dependent on its partner to deliver results.
While these partnerships are supported by contracts, the Group does not exercise direct control.
If a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties, the Group may suffer a delay in the development, a delay in the approval or a reduction in sales or royalties of a product.
The failure to secure new products or compounds for development, either through in-licensing, acquisition or internal research and development efforts, may have an adverse impact on the Groups future results The Groups future results will depend, to a significant extent, upon its ability to in-license, acquire or develop new products or compounds.
The failure to in-license or acquire new products or compounds, on a commercially viable basis, could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
The Group also expends significant resources on research and development.
The failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
The Group may fail to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business The Groups success depends upon its ability and the ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights.
Where possible, the Groups strategy is to register intellectual property rights, such as patents and trademarks.
The Group also relies variously on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain its competitive position.
Patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the Group have been granted, or are pending in various countries, including the US, Canada, major European countries and Japan.
The Group intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the Group.
However, patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the Groups products or technologies or processes for formulating or manufacturing similar or functionally equivalent products.
The Groups patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn.
The Group cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufciently broad to protect the Groups products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by third parties.
In the regular course of business, the Group is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.
Additionally, the Groups products, or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may now, or in the future, infringe the patent rights of third parties.
It is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or sale of the Groups products.
If third parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology, it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufciently broad to prevent the Group or its strategic partners from developing, manufacturing or selling its products.
The Group may need to obtain licences for intellectual property rights from others to develop, manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licences on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
In addition, any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable.
The Group also relies on trade secrets and other un-patented proprietary information, which it generally seeks to protect by condentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors and partners.
These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of condential information and may not provide the Group with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorised disclosure of such information.
If the Groups employees, scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the Groups products under development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the Groups property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers.
Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the Groups proprietary rights.
The failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection, for any reason, could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the Groups product sales.
The Group has led applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with its products in various countries including the US and countries in Europe and Latin America and intends to trademark new product names as new products are developed.
In addition, with respect to certain products, the Group relies on the trademarks of third parties.
These trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the Group or the third parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks.
The Groups inability or the inability of these third parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the Groups trademarks and dilute their value.
22 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 23 Financial review If a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side effects, this could result in damage to the Groups reputation, the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the Group The Groups ability to sell pharmaceutical products after the receipt of regulatory approval will depend on the acceptance of those products by physicians and patients.
Unanticipated side effects or unfavourable publicity concerning any of the Groups products, or those of its competitors, could have an adverse effect on the Groups ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products.
Future results of operations will also depend on continued market acceptance of current products and the lack of substitutes that are cheaper or more effective.
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims, product recalls, litigation and associated adverse publicity.
The cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited.
A successful product liability claim against the Group could require the Group to pay a substantial monetary award.
If, in the absence of adequate insurance coverage, the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defence of such a claim, it could become insolvent.
Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms.
Although the Group carries product liability insurance, this coverage may not be adequate.
In addition, it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will be available.
Moreover, an adverse judgment in a product liability suit, even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal, could generate substantial negative publicity about the Groups products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products.
Monitoring or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies in the highly regulated markets in which the Group operates may result in the distraction of senior management, significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines The Group engages in various marketing, promotional and educational activities pertaining to, as well the sale of, pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
The promotion, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and the operations of market participants, such as the Group, are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, including the FDA, the US Department of Justice and the DEA in the US.
Any inquiries or investigations into the operations of, or enforcement or other regulatory action against, the Group by such regulatory authorities could result in the distraction of senior management for prolonged periods of time, significant defence costs and substantial monetary penalties.
The outsourcing of services can create a significant dependency on third parties, the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate the Groups business and to develop and market products The Group has entered into many agreements with third parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business.
If the third party can no longer provide the service on the agreed basis, the Group may not be able to continue the development or commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis.
Additionally, it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships with the suppliers.
The Group has also entered into licensing and co-development agreements with a number of parties.
There is a risk that, upon expiration or termination of a third party agreement, the Group may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third party as commercial interests may no longer coincide.
In such circumstances, the Group may be unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and could be required to abandon or divest a product line.
Loss of highly qualied management and scientific personnel could cause the Group subsequent financial loss The Group faces intense competition for highly qualied management and scientific personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organisations.
It may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel.
The Group has agreements with a number of its key scientific and management personnel for periods of one year or less.
The loss of such personnel, or the inability to attract and retain the additional, highly skilled employees required for its activities could have an adverse effect on the Groups business.
In the event of breakdown, failure or breach of security on any of the Groups IT systems, the Group may be unable to maintain its business operations The Group operates several complex information systems upon which it is dependent.
The Group has back-up procedures and disaster recovery plans in place to enable the business to continue its normal operations and to mitigate any loss in the event of a failure.
However, in the event of breakdown, failure or breach of security of any of these systems or the associated suppliers, the Group may be unable to maintain its business operations.
This could lead to loss of revenue and delay in product development.
In addition, the Group is in the process of installing enterprise-wide information systems in its operations throughout the world.
Any failure in the operation of this system could have an adverse effect on the Groups business operations.
The Group may incur unexpected expenditure in order to comply with US environmental laws The Groups manufacturing sites are situated in the US and are subject to national, state and local environmental laws.
Compliance with environmental laws requires ongoing expenditure and any spillage or contamination found to be caused by the Group may result in clean up costs and financial penalties for the Group which could adversely affect the Groups revenues, financial condition and results of operations.
Contracts are used in all areas of operation of the business.
They may contain provisions that do not protect the Groups position or with which it cannot comply Contracts form the basis of agreement in many key activities such as mergers and acquisitions, arrangements with suppliers, outsourcing, product licensing and marketing.
These contracts may contain provisions that impose duties on the parties involved or may fail to contain adequate conditions to protect the Groups position.
The Group may be unable to meet its obligations under a contract or may be unable to require other parties to comply with their obligations and, therefore, may suffer financial loss or penalty.
Annual report and accounts for the 23 year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 24 Financial review Treasury policies and financial risk management Shires principal treasury operations are coordinated by its corporate treasury function, which is based in the UK.
All treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved by the Board.
As a matter of policy, the Group does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk As at December 31, 2006, the Group had no material debt outstanding.
Therefore, the Groups interest charge on its debt obligations is low and consequently the Groups interest expense charge has limited exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates affecting interest income.
This exposure is primarily to US Dollar interest rates.
As the Group maintains all of its investments on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes this risk is not actively managed.
In the year ended December 31, 2006 the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was approximately 4.7% 2005: 2.9%.
The largest proportion of investments was in US Dollar money market and liquidity funds.
The acquisition of New River will change the financial prole of the Group and will lead to a net liability driven interest rate exposure, still primarily to US Dollar interest rates.
The Companys Treasury Committee will review the impact of the change and implement an appropriate policy to manage this risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against the US Dollar for trading transactions and the translation of net assets, liabilities and earnings of non-US subsidiaries.
The main trading currencies of the Group are the US Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, Pounds Sterling, the Euro and Swedish Krona.
The consolidated financial statements of foreign entities are translated using the accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Groups consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk is managed and monitored by the treasury function.
Exposures are generally managed through natural hedging via the currency denomination of cash balances.
As at December 31, 2006 the Group had 18 outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with a total principal amount of $98.3 million equivalent to manage the currency risk associated with certain inter-company loans.
As at December 31, 2006 there were net unrealized losses of $8.1 million on these contracts.
Market risk of investments As at December 31, 2006, the Group had $55.8 million of investments comprising equity investment funds $24.2 million, private companies $15.1 million and publicly quoted equities $16.5 million.
The investment in public quoted companies and equity investments funds are exposed to market risk.
No financial instruments or derivatives have been employed to hedge this risk.
Off-balance sheet arrangements There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Groups financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Foreign currency uctuations A number of operating units in the Group have functional currencies other than the US Dollar.
As such, the consolidated financial results are subject to uctuations in exchange rates, particularly those between the US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Swedish Krona.
The accumulated foreign currency translation differences of $31.9 million 2005: $5.2 million are reported within retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet and a $3.1 million 2005: $1.4 million loss gain is reported in the consolidated income statement.
Concentration of credit risk The Groups revenues from product sales are mainly derived from agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and relationships with pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy chains.
For the year to December 31, 2006 there were three customers who accounted for 71% of the Groups total revenues.
However, such clients typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered minimal.
The Group has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly dened credit evaluation procedures.
Financial instruments that potentially expose Shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short-term cash investments and trade accounts receivable.
Excess cash is invested in short-term money market instruments, including bank term deposits, money market and liquidity funds and other debt securities from a variety of financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
These investments typically bear minimal risk.
Ination Although at reduced levels in recent years, ination continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business.
However, the Group believes that the net effect of ination on its operations has been minimal.
24 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2006 Shire plc 6746 UK Report Section 2006. qxd 16 5 07 15:14 Page 25 Financial review Dividend policy A first interim dividend for the first half of 2006 of 1.9346 US per Ordinary share 1.0475 pence per share, equivalent to 5.804 US per ADS and 6.584 Canadian per exchangeable share, was paid in October 2006.
The Board has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 5.2455 US 2.6933 pence per share per Ordinary share equivalent to 15.736 US per ADS and 18.4086 Canadian per exchangeable share for the six months to December 31, 2006.
A first interim dividend for the first half of 2005 of 1.8246 US 1.0475 pence per Ordinary share equivalent to 5.4738 US per ADS and 6.7629 Canadian per exchangeable share was paid in October 2005.
A second interim dividend for the second half of 2005 of 4.419 US 2.5356 pence per Ordinary share equivalent to 13.257 US per ADS and 15.2217 Canadian per exchangeable share was paid in April 2006.
This is consistent with Shires stated policy of paying a dividend semi-annually, set in US per share ADS, with the first interim payment in each year being maintained at a consistent level.
Any growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year.
Shire intends to pursue a progressive dividend policy.
As a matter of English law, Shire plc may pay dividends only out of its distributable profits, which are the accumulated realized profits under generally accepted accounting principles in the UK including reserves arising from a reduction of share capital, of Shire plc and not the consolidated Group, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less accumulated realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made.
At December 31, 2006, Shire plc had distributable profits of $2,899.0 million.
Future dividend policy will be dependent upon distributable profits, financial condition, the terms of any then existing debt facilities and other relevant factors existing at that time.
