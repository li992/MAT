JKX Sect3 AW:JKX-report 30 4 07 12:22 Page 19 19 FINANCIAL REVIEW Realisations for 2006 for both oil and gas were the highest ever achieved by the Group.
This, combined with the success of the intensive drilling programme in Ukraine, enabled JKX to generate record revenue, profitability, cash flow and cash resources.
Revenue Record levels of both production and realisations saw Group revenue increase by 59% to $131.7m 2005: $82.9m.
Average daily production in the period increased by 20% to an average of 11,146 boepd 2005: 9,309 boepd.
Gas production rose 9% to 38 MMcfd 2005: 35 MMcfd and the average daily production of oil rose by 37% to 4,895 bopd 2005: 3,561 bopd.
The oil gas mix changed to oil representing 44% of average daily production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis 2005: 38%.
This results mainly from the success of three oil wells drilled in the Ignatovskoye field in the year, and three gas condensate wells drilled in the northern part of the Molchanovskoye field.
The gas condensate wells also tested significant volumes of gas.
Due to infrastructure restrictions, which are being addressed, gas production from other wells had to be restricted for a portion of the second half of the year, which further contributed to the change in oil gas mix.
The increased proportion of oil, the continued growth in international oil prices and the high realisation of $54.31 bbl 2005: $46.43 bbl for JKXs oil, further amplified the positive effect on Group revenue.
Realisations for the Groups Ukrainian gas production also reached another record, averaging $2.83 Mcf for the period 2005: $1.82 Mcf.
This growth in gas realisations followed from the continued strengthening in the Ukrainian domestic market, itself a function of the Russia Ukraine gas price agreement reached in January 2006.
As of 1 January 2007, the agreed price between Russia and Ukraine for gas imported into Ukraine has again increased.
Currently the price achieved for the Groups Ukrainian gas production is approximately $4.00 Mcf, a 40% increase on the 2006 average.
Bruce J Burrows Operating profit Profit before tax increased by 113% to $109.2m 2005: $51.3m.
Finance Director Excluding the reversal of the impairment provision $15.2m, the profit before tax of $94.0m was 83% above the 2005 result.
The increase in DD&A results from the increased overall production in the year along with a revision to the estimated capital costs associated with the future PPC field development programme.
Operating costs are higher than in 2006 due to increased production volumes and general price inflation in Ukraine, but nevertheless, remain within budget.
Impairment reversal The Group previously recognised an impairment charge in respect of certain producing assets in Ukraine.
The impairment reflected uncertainty regarding the political and regulatory environment in Ukraine together with the relatively low Ukrainian oil and gas prices.
In 2006, following a step change in Ukrainian gas prices and easing of political and regulatory uncertainty, it was determined that the factors giving rise to the impairment have reversed and the impairment has been reversed also.
The amount of the reversal is determined by reference to the recoverable amount of the associated assets.
Recoverable amount was calculated based on expected future cash flows of the cash generating unit discounted at a rate of 10%.
The cash generating unit is the Group's NovoNikolaevskoye Complex in Ukraine.
Consideration was given to the amount of depreciation that would have been suffered in the period since the impairment charge was taken.
The carrying value has been reinstated at a value not higher than the carrying value had the impairment not been made.
90 80 75.6 Taxation The Groups effective tax rate increased in the 81.1 year to 28.8% 2005: 27.4% because of the increasing profitability and the effect on the deferred tax position on 56.9 the reversal of the impairment provision of the Groups 60 primary operating subsidiary, PPC.

As noted above, there were no Up 38% borrowings in 2006.
It is Group policy that throughout the year, the Groups working capital cycle be rigorously monitored so that cash from trade and other receivables is collected promptly.
Foreign currency risk The Groups operations are attended with foreign currency risks.
Sales within Ukraine by PPC are by law denominated in local currency Hryvna.
Funds for repatriation back to the United Kingdom are then converted to, and transmitted in, US Dollars.
The Group manages this exposure by matching, as far as is practical, receipts and payments in the same currency and by following a range of commercial policies to minimise exposure to the Hryvna denominated sales.
The Group also acted to keep balances held in Hryvna at as low a level as possible.
Regulations imposed by the Ukrainian authorities are subject to ongoing change, and accordingly the flow of funds to the Groups UK bank accounts is subject to possible interruption, despite this not having occurred for more than five years.
