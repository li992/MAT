the introduction of a UK REIT regime carefully, and have concluded that at present conversion is not in the interests of our William Sunnucks shareholders.
The main reasons are: Group Finance Director We would fail the 75% balance of business test because much of our profit comes from management fees, performance fees and SNO!zone.
Our business might be damaged by operational constraints imposed by rules that are orientated towards passively managed property: we fear that we would be forced into complex structuring if we want to continue to run our own car parks, market halls and ski slopes.
Our co-investments in the three funds would still be subject to Capital Gains Tax under current REIT legislation, although this anomaly may be corrected in the future.
The 22% withholding tax would be an administrative burden for many of our shareholders, and in many cases a cost.
