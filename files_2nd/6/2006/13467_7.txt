This, together with modifications to the molybdenum circuit Net earnings 7,438 5,215 3,297 at the concentrator, boosted production volumes by 130 per cent.
Excluding the effects of inflation, higher costs reduced earnings by US$598 million.
Of this, US$130 million was due to higher energy costs and US$46 million was attributable to increased exploration expenditure from brownfield exploration and further evaluation work.
More generally, costs were influenced by the strong price environment being enjoyed by the mining industry.
This led to rising mining input costs caused by supply constraints for skilled labour, steel, tyres, explosives, freight and other mining related goods and services.
Costs at KUC were affected by a scheduled 17 day smelter maintenance shutdown in the first half of 2005 whilst continued port congestion at Dalrymple Bay, Queensland, fed through to higher demurrage charges.
Higher non cash costs reflected increased depreciation at KUC following the changes in the mine plan at the end of 2004.
Increases in closure cost provisions resulted in higher depreciation charges on the amounts capitalised.
One-off costs included restructuring costs of US$30 million relating to the formation of the Rio Tinto Minerals organisation.
The effective tax rate on underlying earnings, excluding equity accounted units, was 29.2 per cent compared with 27.1 per cent in 2004 because of higher rates on increased profits in Canada and Indonesia and higher withholding taxes.
In total Other items improved by US$31 million.
Within that total, the net after tax interest expense of US$44 million was US$25 million lower than in 2004 due to lower levels of net debt.
Also within Other items, 2004 underlying earnings included contributions totalling US$88 million from the operations of businesses that were sold during that year.
Earnings in 2005 benefited from an improvement in the net impact of insurance items, including lower claims on the captive insurers due to the absence of cyclone related damages experienced in 2004.
Exclusions in arriving at underlying earnings In 2005 the net profit on the disposal of interests in businesses was US$311 million relating mainly to the sale of Rio Tintos interests in the Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Income Fund and in Lihir Gold.
Disposals in 2004, principally the holding in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, resulted in gains of US$1,175 million.
Net earnings in 2005 include a reduction of US$84 million in an environmental remediation provision at Kennecott Utah Copper, reversing part of an exceptional charge taken up in 2002 which was excluded from adjusted earnings in that year.
Net earnings in 2004 included an impairment charge of US$160 million relating to the Colowyo coal operation and of US$161 million for the write down of Palaboras copper assets.
Exchange gains and losses on external net debt and intragroup balances that are recorded in the US dollar income statement, together with gains and losses on currency and interest rate derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedges under EU IFRS, are excluded from underlying earnings.

Since the Copper group beginning of 2006, the group acquired the La Granja project in Peru and took an ownership stake in Ivanhoe Mines and Northern Dynasty Minerals which have the Oyu Tolgoi and Pebble deposits in Mongolia and the US respectively.
Historically, the Copper group built the majority of its portfolio through acquisitions Kennecott or joint ventures Escondida, Grasberg followed by expansions.
The current pipeline of projects Oyu Tolgoi, Resolution, La Granja and Pebble represents a transition with a greater proportion of opportunities created through exploration and acquisitions at an early stage of development.
In addition to the Copper groups interests in these four world class orebodies, the group is developing the E48 underground deposit at Northparkes and undertaking a prefeasibility study at Kennecott Utah Copper to extend the mines life, either through a further pushback of the open pit or a transition to underground mining.
The Copper groups long term development plans are not just confined to its principal product.
Rio Tinto has a number of nickel development opportunities which are currently being evaluated.
At the small, high grade Eagle nickel deposit Rio Tinto: 100 per cent in Michigan in the US, feasibility studies have been undertaken and a decision on developing the deposit is expected in 2007.
At 31 December 2006, the Copper group, which also produces gold and molybdenum as significant coproducts, accounted for 16 per cent of the Groups operating assets and in 2006 contributed approximately 28 per cent of Rio Tintos gross sales revenue, of which 74 per cent was from copper, 13 per cent from molybdenum and the remainder mostly from gold.
It accounted for 49 per cent of underlying earnings in 2006.
Bret Clayton succeeded Tom Albanese as chief executive Copper, and is based in London.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2006 compared with 2005 The Copper groups contribution to underlying earnings was US$3,562 million, US$1,542 million higher than in 2005.
The average price of copper was 306 US cents per pound during 2006, 84 per cent higher than in 2005.
The average gold price of US$602 per ounce increased by 36 per cent.
The average price of molybdenum was US$24.60 per pound compared with US$30.70 per pound in 2005.
Kennecott Utah Coppers contribution to underlying earnings of US$1,804 million was US$767 million higher than in 2005, with the operation benefiting from higher prices and volumes and a tax credit of US$289 million following recognition of deferred tax assets.
Record molybdenum production was achieved during the year, offsetting the impact of lower refined copper production due to a scheduled smelter shutdown in the second half of 2006.
An increase in the groups long term copper price assumption triggered an assessment of the amount of recoverable copper at Kennecott Utah Copper.
As a result, the impairment made in 2001 and 2002 was reversed in 2006.
Rio Tintos share of underlying earnings from Escondida increased by US$648 million to US$1,250 million.
Higher prices and the commencement of sulphide leaching counterbalanced higher mining costs and input prices.
The Grasberg joint venture contributed US$122 million to underlying earnings, US$110 million below 2005.
Lower grades of copper, gold and silver, the result of mine sequencing, led to significantly lower production of all three metals.
Palaboras 2006 earnings of US$52 million were US$33 million above the prior year, benefiting from higher copper prices and sales volumes and the sale of some smelter stocks.
Northparkes contribution to underlying earnings of US$229 million represents a US$172 million increase from 2005.
In addition to higher prices, better grades, increased throughput and improved recoveries all contributed to a 54 per cent increase in production of copper contained in concentrates.

Permitting depleted Magma Superior copper mine.
The project team is currently approvals are under way while exploration continues in the area around working through a prefeasibility study, including a proposed land Eagle and the wider district.
A decision on developing the deposit is exchange, an environmental impact study, further resource drilling and expected in 2007. the sinking of two shafts to gain access to the mineralisation.
Expenditure to the end of feasibility in 2011, if approved, is expected to be approximately US$700 million, with total capital to initiate production forecast to be about US$2.5 billion.
While there are technical challenges with regard to depth and rock temperature, Resolution would be a mine producing copper at twice the rate of Kennecott Utah Copper for over 35 years.
The Act supporting a land exchange programme was introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives during 2006, but the timing did not allow the Act to progress to point of Presidential signature.
It will be re-introduced in both Houses in early 2007.
Oyu Tolgoi Rio Tinto: 9.9 per cent stake in Ivanhoe Mines Rio Tinto acquired a 9.9 per cent holding of Ivanhoe Mines in order to jointly develop and operate Ivanhoes Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold complex in Mongolias South Gobi region.
A joint Ivanhoe-Rio Tinto technical committee will engineer, construct and operate the project.
Subject to reaching a satisfactory long term investment agreement with the Mongolian government, an open pit mine would be in operation by the end of the decade followed by an underground mine several years later.
Rio Tintos holding in Ivanhoe Mines will rise to 19.9 per cent upon completion of the long term investment agreement.
The Group has an option to increase its stake in due course to 33.35 per cent, and potentially take it up to 40 per cent via open market transactions.
As part of the investment arrangements, Ivanhoe Mines has agreed with Rio Tinto to divest its joint venture interest in the Myanmar Copper Project located in the Union of Myanmar, together with any other rights, interests or investments relating to the country.
Pending their sale, the Myanmar based assets are, in accordance with the terms of the agreement between Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe Mines, currently in the process of being transferred to an independent third party trust, the sole purpose of which is to sell the assets.
Ivanhoe Mines will have no interest in the trust, other than as an unsecured creditor under a promissory note issued by trust on the transfer of the Myanmar based assets which is to be repaid once the assets are sold.
La Granja Rio Tinto: 100 per cent Rio Tinto won the state privatisation tender for the La Granja copper project, located in the Cajamarca region of northern Peru.
The bid comprised staged payments to the Peruvian government of US$22 million and US$60 million in investment in exploration and feasibility work.
In late 2006, Rio Tinto approved expenditure up to US$95 million, most of which will be spent over 20072009.
The La Granja project is technically challenging and has modest copper grades.
However, the deposit contains significant mineralisation of more than two billion tonnes.
Instead of looking at La Granja as a conventional milling operation producing concentrates for export, the prefeasibility study is aimed at demonstrating the possibility of recovering copper metal using bioleaching and electrowinning.
Pebble Rio Tinto: 9.9 per cent stake in Northern Dynasty Minerals Rio Tinto acquired a 9.9 per cent interest in Northern Dynasty Minerals during the year and increased its interest to 19.8 per cent during February 2007.
Northern Dynasty Minerals is advancing the Pebble  deposit in southwestern Alaska, which is another world class ore body that is amenable to block caving.

At the end of 2006 Diamonds employed 1,500 people and had 930 contractors.
Keith Johnson, chief executive Diamonds, is based in London.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 2006 compared with 2005 Diamonds contributed US$205 million to Rio Tintos underlying earnings in 2006, a decrease of US$76 million from 2005.
Sales revenue for 2006 was US$838 million, US$238 million lower than in 2005.
The lower earnings and sales revenue arose mainly from a downturn in the rough diamond market in the second half of 2006.
This resulted in lower prices for most product types, with Rio Tinto Diamonds stocking some lower priced product, which will be sold in future periods.
Diamond production remained at similar levels to 2005 across all operations.
Argyle produced 29.1 million carats in 2006, approximately 1.4 million carats less than in 2005.
This was in line with expectations of a decreasing diamond production profile as the open pit winds down and underground production ramps up over the next five years.
Diavik produced 5.9 million carats in 2006, 0.9 million carats more than in 2005.
Murowa produced 0.2 million carats in 2006, slightly less than in 2005.
The rough diamond market started strong in the first half of 2006 but deteriorated into the second half.
Year end prices closed at similar levels to the start of 2006.
A number of factors influenced this mid year correction including a congested processing pipeline, tight liquidity in the manufacturing sector and extensive flooding in Indias major cutting centre, Surat, which forced the shutdown of many cutting and manufacturing centres for several weeks.
Polished diamond prices remained constant through 2006 with reasonable demand experienced for most products, particularly for larger better quality white diamonds.
2005 compared with 2004 Diamonds contributed US$281million to underlying earnings, an increase of US$93 million from 2004, assisted by a strong diamond market and the solid performance by Argyle, Diavik and Murowa.
The rough diamond market remained strong for most of 2005 with the Rio Tinto product offering in great demand.
Seasonal softening toward the end of the year was mainly due to holidays and festivals in the key customer markets.
The Diamonds group comprises Rio Tintos 60 per cent interest in the Prices for polished diamonds increased in 2005, with the majority Diavik Diamonds mine located in the Northwest Territories of Canada, of gains made in the first half of the year.

Production from Argyles AK1 open pit mine is expected Diavik has been brought to full production and Murowa has been added to continue until 2008, when the mine will transition to underground to the portfolio and as the Argyle product has benefited from improved operations which are expected to extend the life of the mine to pricing.
Over the past five years, sales revenues and underlying earnings about 2018. have tripled.
This has positioned Diamonds as a strong contributor to Rio Tinto overall.

thanks to higher ore grade, excellent operational performance throughout the year and ore blending strategies employed to maximise process plant throughput.
This was achieved during a massive winter road recovery operation.
Freight and construction materials scheduled for trucking to the mine up the 2006 winter road could not be transported on surface due to a shorter season of cold winter conditions necessary for maintenance of the ice road.
The recovery operation included the air lifting of fuel, bentonite, explosives and consumables to site.
Open pit mining is expected to be predominantly from A154 in 2007 with some A418 open pit ore commencing in 2008.
Murowa Rio Tinto: 77.8 per cent Production at Murowa commenced in late 2004 after US$11 million was spent on constructing a 200,000 tonnes per year plant and supporting infrastructure.
Chain of custody safeguards put in place at the commencement of production have performed without incident.
Murowas 2006 safety performance was exceptional with no lost time injuries reported in 2006 and the all injury frequency rate down by more than 80 per cent.
2006 operating performance A start was made on upgrading the 200,000 tonnes per year processing plant to increase throughput, improve recoveries and protect against power outages.
The modification was scheduled for completion in early 2007 giving Murowa several more years of operation.
DIAMOND GROUP PROJECTS Argyle Rio Tinto: 100 per cent Rio Tinto approved the development of an underground block cave mine under the AK1 open pit in late 2005.
It also approved an open pit cutback on the Northern Bowl to facilitate the transition from open pit to underground mining.
The capital cost of the underground mine is expected to be US$760 million, and the cutback US$150 million.
By the end of 2006, 10,600 metres of underground development in four main access declines had been completed.
In late 2006 the first of the underground declines reached the required depth for ore extraction.
The underground block cave undercut is expected to be initiated on schedule in 2008.
Diavik Rio Tinto: 60 per cent In late 2004 the joint venture approved a study of the feasibility of underground mining of the A154N, A154S and A418 kimberlites.
This study includes the development of a 3.3 kilometre exploratory decline, at an estimated cost of US$75 million.
In 2006 a three phase underground development funding model, totalling some US$265 million, was approved.
If underground mining is given the go ahead, the first ore is planned to be extracted in 2008.
Meanwhile, a US$190 million project, involving the construction of a dyke round the A418 kimberlite to allow open pit mining beneath the lake bed, is well advanced.
The construction and dewatering of the dyke was completed in 2006 and pre-stripping began in December.
The A418 ore is softer than that of the A154 pipes and will allow ore blending strategies to maintain the high process plant throughput achieved in 2006.
The first ore from the A418 open pit is scheduled to be mined in late 2007 and will continue through to 2012.

Kennecott Lands holdings are around 53 per cent of the remaining undeveloped land in Utahs Salt Lake Valley.
Approximately 16,000 hectares of the 37,200 hectares owned is developable land and is all within 20 miles 32km of downtown Salt Lake City.
The initial Daybreak community encompasses 1,800 hectares and is entitled to develop nearly 14,000 residential units and nine million square feet of commercial space.
Kennecott Land develops the required infrastructure and prepares the land for sale to home builders.
The project is well advanced, with over 1,200 home sales completed since opening in June 2004.
At full build out, the community will house 30,000 to 40,000 residents.
Revenues in 2006 were US$60 million.
Kennecott Land is in the process of securing development rights from Salt Lake County for the remaining landholdings.
Current development potential for this land is in excess of 150,000 residential units and 50 million square feet of commercial space.
Securing entitlement is a long term public process that will culminate in a plan being submitted for approval by the Salt Lake County Council in the next one to two years.
Marketing Marketing and sales of the Groups various metal and mineral products are handled either by the specific business concerned, or in some cases are undertaken at a product group level.
In 2006, Rio Tinto established a small central marketing team based in London to develop and share leading marketing practices across the Group.
The team supports the Groups businesses by helping to identify new ways of adding value in meeting customers needs.
Rio Tinto has numerous marketing channels, which include electronic marketplaces, with differing characteristics and pricing mechanisms depending on the nature of the commodity and markets being served.
Rio Tintos businesses contract their metal and mineral production direct with end users under both short and long term supply contracts.
Long term contracts typically specify annual volume commitments and an agreed mechanism for determining prices at prevailing market prices.
For example, businesses producing non ferrous metals and minerals reference their sales prices to the London Metal Exchange LME or other metal exchanges such as the Commodity Exchange Inc Comex in New York.
Ocean freight Ocean freight has become an important part of Rio Tintos marketing.
It is managed by Rio Tinto Marine, which is based in Melbourne.
In 2006, Rio Tinto Marine handled 70 million tonnes of dry bulk cargo, a significant increase on the 51 million tonnes transported in 2005.
Rio Tinto Marine leverages the Groups substantial cargo base to obtain a low cost mix of short, medium and long term freight cover.
It seeks to create enterprise value from its freight by creating competitive advantage for the Groups products rather than by trading freight.
Rio Tinto Marine sets and maintains the Groups HSE and vessel assurance standards for freight and is one of three equal shareholders in Rightship, a ship vetting specialist, promoting safety and efficiency in the global maritime industry.

Sustainable development Rio Tinto has made a strategic commitment to sustainable development, in the belief that acting responsibly will result in long term business benefits such as lowering risks, reducing costs, creating options, and leveraging reputation.
It is corporate policy that Group businesses, projects, operations and products should contribute constructively to the global transition to sustainable development.
Details of our policy, programmes and results are provided in our Sustainable development review, available on the website.
During the course of 2006, our Sustainable Development Leadership Panel SDLP, composed of senior executives from all six product groups and corporate functions, focused on Rio Tintos sustainable development strategy.
Input was sought from a wide range of sources, both within Rio Tinto and outside.
The panel assessed the current status of sustainable development practice in the Group, decided that Rio Tinto should strive to be the sector leader in its contribution to sustainable development, and defined the areas we need to focus on in order to accomplish that goal.
The focus areas include developing a sustainable development culture, similar to that already in place on safety, key performance indicators, effective communication, supply chain management, and taking account of sustainable development in risk management, long term, planning and mines of the future.
To help explain the concepts of sustainable development, both to existing employees and newcomers, we introduced training and awareness raising tools throughout the Group.
In addition, we are using another, more detailed programme for managers, based on the e-learning tool, Chronos, developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and Cambridge University in the UK.
By the end of 2006 more than 700 managers had participated in the programme.
As a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals, Rio Tinto is committed to superior business practices in sustainable development.
We have committed to implement the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework and comply with policy statements of the ICMM Council.
Openness and accountability Rio Tinto conducts the Groups affairs in an accountable and transparent manner, reflecting the interests of Rio Tinto shareholders, employees, host communities and customers as well as others affected by the Groups activities.
Policies on transparency, business integrity, corporate governance and internal controls and reporting procedures are outlined in The way we work.
In 2003, a Compliance guidance was issued to provide a framework to enable each Group business to implement and maintain a best practice compliance programme which should identify and manage risks associated with non compliance with laws, regulations, codes, standards and Rio Tinto policies.

The adjustments made to net earnings to arrive at overall decrease of 5% in benefit obligation 11 underlying earnings are explained above in the section on underlying earnings.
The figures in the above table only show the impact on net earnings.
Changing the assumptions would also have an impact on the balance sheet.
The impact on cash flow in 2006 of the Groups pension plans, being the employer contributions to defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, was US$172 million.
In addition there were contributions of US$19 million in respect of unfunded healthcare schemes.
Contributions to pension plans for 2007 are estimated to be around US$8m higher than for 2006.
Healthcare plans are unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments and therefore cannot be predetermined.
Further information on pensions and other post retirement benefits is given on pages 147 to 150.
US deferred tax potentially recoverable Rio Tintos US tax group have Alternative Minimum Tax AMT credits and temporary differences, which have the potential to reduce tax charges in future years.
These potential reductions in future tax charges possible tax assets totalled US$577 million at 31 December 2005.
An asset of US$10 million was recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2005 based on utilisation of AMT credits projected for 2006.
Principally as a result of current high commodity prices, US$140 million of these possible tax assets were realised in 2006.
Updated projections of future taxable profits for the operations that form part of Rio Tintos US tax group resulted in the recognition of a further deferred tax asset of US$335 million during 2006.
Having taken account of other adjustments this leaves possible tax assets of US$65 million.
Recoveries are dependent on future commodity prices, costs, financing arrangements and business developments in future years.
Exploration During the year the Group changed its policy on accounting for exploration and evaluation expenditure.
Previously, the Group capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure from acquisition of a beneficial interest or option in mineral rights.
Full provision was made for impairment unless there was a high degree of confidence in the projects viability and hence it was considered probable that future economic benefits would flow to the Group.
If, as a result of developments in subsequent periods, the expenditure was considered to be recoverable, such provisions were reversed.
Under the Groups revised policy, exploration and evaluation expenditure is not capitalised until the point is reached at which there is a high degree of confidence in the projects viability and it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
