minimum guarantees, which are linked to the proportion of the total number of subscribers receiving specific packages.
Our costs for carriage of the Sky Distributed Channels will where a monthly per subscriber fee is payable continue to be dependent on changes in the subscriber base, contractual rates and or the number of channels distributed.
Transmission and related functions costs, including other technical costs, are primarily dependent upon the number and annual cost of the satellite transponder capacity which we use.
The most significant components of transmission and related functions costs are transponder capacity costs relating to the SES Astra satellites and Eutelsat Eurobird satellite and costs associated with our transmission, uplink and telemetry facilities.
Transmission and related functions costs also include the cost of operating the existing Easynet network.
Marketing costs include: i above-the-line spend which promotes our brand and range of products and services generally : ii below-the-line spend which relates to growth and maintenance of the subscriber base, including commissions payable to retailers and other agents for the sale of subscriptions and the costs of our own direct marketing to our existing and potential subscribers : and iii the cost of providing free or subsidised digital satellite reception equipment to new customers and the installation cost in excess of the relevant amount actually received from the customer.
Subscriber management costs include customer management costs, supply chain costs and associated depreciation.
Customer management costs are those associated with managing new and existing subscribers, including subscriber handling and subscriber bad debt costs.
Supply chain costs relate to systems and infrastructure and the installation costs of satellite reception equipment and installation costs of new products purchased by subscribers such as Sky and Multiroom digiboxes, including smart card costs.
Customer management costs and supply chain costs are largely dependent on DTH subscriber levels.
Subscriber management costs exclude both the cost of free or subsidised digital satellite reception equipment and the installation cost to us in excess of the amount actually received from the customer for such equipment and installation, as these costs are included within marketing costs.
Administration costs include channel management, facilities and other operational overhead and central costs, and the cost of awards granted under our employee share option schemes.
For certain trend information related to our operating expenses, see the Trends and other information section below.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING REVIEW Revenues The Groups revenues can be analysed as follows: Revenues For the year to 30 June 2006 2005 m % m % DTH subscribers 3,154 76 2,968 77 Cable subscribers 224 6 219 6 Advertising 342 8 329 9 Sky Bet 37 1 32 1 Sky Active 91 2 92 2 Other 300 7 202 5 4,148 100 3,842 100 DTH subscriber revenues The increase of 6% in DTH subscriber revenues in the year was driven by a 5% increase in the average number of DTH subscribers and an increase in average DTH revenue per subscriber to 375 in the year from 374 in the prior year.
The total number of UK and Ireland DTH subscribers increased by 389,000 in the year to 8,176,000.
This was a result of an increase in gross subscriber additions by 50,000 to 1,275,000 in the current year, partly offset by DTH churn for the year of 11.1% 2005: 10.3%.
The increase in average DTH revenue per subscriber reflected the change in our UK retail prices in September 2005.
Cable subscriber revenues Cable subscriber revenues increased by 5 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to the increase in wholesale prices in September 2005, which has been partly offset by the decline in the absolute number of pay-TV cable customers taking one or more Premium Channels.
At 30 June 2006, there were 3,898,000 2005: 3,872,000 UK and Ireland cable subscribers to our programming.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 39 Advertising revenues The increase in advertising revenues of 4% reflects a further one percentage point increase in Skys share of the UK television advertising sector during the year to 13.0%.
Sky Bet revenues Sky Bet revenues increased by 5 million compared to the prior year as a result of strong growth in stakes placed by customers.
Sky Active revenues Sky Active revenues of 91 million fell by 1% compared to the prior year.
Growth in interactive advertising and enhanced TV service revenue were more than offset by the absence of SkyBuy revenue, following the closure of the business in the final quarter of the prior year.
Other revenues Other revenues increased by 49% compared to the prior year.
This increase was as a result of the inclusion of 76 million of revenue generated by the corporate business of Easynet which was acquired during the current year, the first full year effect of Sky credit card revenues and the Sky News channel five contract.
Operating expenses The Groups operating expenses can be analysed as follows: Operating expenses For the year to 30 June 2006 2005 m % m % Programming 1,599 49 1,635 54 Transmission and related functions 234 7 171 6 Marketing 622 19 527 17 Subscriber management 468 14 392 13 Administration 348 11 295 10 3,271 100 3,020 100 Programming Sky Sports channels programming costs increased by 2% to 766 million in the current year from 750 million in the prior year due to an increased level of live coverage and a wider sports offering following the addition of the new ECB cricket contract and an additional cricket tour during the year.
The associated increase in costs was partially offset by the absence of the Ryder Cup, a biennial event, in the year.
Sky Movies channels programming costs decreased by 10% to 310 million in the current year from 343 million in the prior year, reflecting savings generated from contract renewals, the phasing of title delivery and a foreign exchange benefit of 8 million from a more favourable average exchange rate at which US dollars were purchased.
Third party channel costs, which include our costs in relation to the distribution agreements for the Sky Distributed Channels and Premium Sky Distributed Channels, decreased by 11% to 323 million in the current year from 362 million in the prior year.
This reflects a 15% reduction in the cost per subscriber, partly offset by a 5% increase in the average number of DTH subscribers.
This saving has been generated by the renewal of a number of our contracts on improved terms during the current year.
News and entertainment programming costs increased by 11% to 200 million in the current year from 180 million in the prior year, due to an increase in expenditure on commissioned programming for Sky One and increased investment in Sky News.
Transmission and related functions Transmission and related costs increased by 37%, as a result of the consolidation of Easynet network costs since acquisition in January 2006 and broadband costs.
Marketing Marketing costs increased by 18% compared to the prior year.
Marketing costs to new customers grew by 51 million to 359 million reflecting an increased number of gross additions during the year and a higher proportion of new customers taking new products.
During the current year, 18% 40 of new customers chose to take Sky from day one, compared to 13% in the prior year.
Above the line marketing costs for the current year remained broadly flat at 75 million and retention and other marketing costs increased by 18 million on the prior year to 110 million.
Subscriber management Subscriber management costs increased by 76 million.
This reflects the first time consolidation of Easynet and broadband expenses of 12 million, depreciation of the new customer management systems of 26 million and growth of 38 million due to the expansion of the Groups customer management operation to further improve customer service levels and manage the increase in sales activity.
During the current year, Sky expanded its existing customer service operations in Scotland, adding 1,500 new customer advisor positions and 600 new home installation engineers in preparation for the roll-out of broadband and providing the Group with one of the largest customer service and home installation workforces in the UK.
Administration Administration costs increased by 18% compared to the prior year.
This is a result of the consolidation of 29 million of Easynet and broadband administration expenses and a higher depreciation charge of 16 million resulting from the infrastructure investment programme, which commenced in August 2004.
The prior year administration expense was offset by a 13 million receipt following the settlement of ITV Digital programming receivables.
Operating profit and operating margin Operating profit increased by 7% to 877 million in the current year from 822 million in the prior year.
This increase was driven by the increase in DTH subscribers, advertising and other revenues, as detailed above, partly offset by the increase in operating expenses as detailed above.
Operating margin calculated as total revenues less all operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the current year was 21%, in line with the prior year.
Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are entities in which we hold a long-term interest and share control under a contractual arrangement.
Our share of the net operating results from joint ventures and associates decreased from a 14 million net profit in the prior year to a 12 million net profit in the current year due to the disposal of the Groups holding in Granada Sky Broadcasting GSB during the prior year, the disposal of the Groups holding in Music Choice Europe during the current year, and lower profits from the History Channel, partly offset by improved profits from National Geographic and Attheraces.
Investment income Investment income increased by 79% to 52 million in the current year from 29 million in the prior year.
This increase was primarily due to higher levels of cash on deposit, subsequent to the issue of Guaranteed Notes in October 2005.
Finance costs Finance costs increased by 64% to 143 million in the current year from 87 million in the prior year.
This increase was primarily a result of the increase in our total borrowings, which increased from 982 million at 30 June 2005 to 1,988 million at 30 June 2006, following the issue of Guaranteed Notes in October 2005.
For details of the issue of Guaranteed Notes, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below.
The higher charge also reflects an 18 million non-cash movement in the mark-to-market valuation of non-hedge accounted derivatives and the net impact on interest following the acquisition of Easynet.
Profit on disposal of joint venture On 1 November 2004, we sold our 49.5% investment in GSB to ITV plc for 14 million cash consideration.
After deducting the carrying value of the investment in GSB, the disposal generated a profit of 9 million.
Taxation The total tax charge for the current year of 247 million comprises a current tax charge of 141 million and a deferred tax charge of 106 million.
The mainstream corporation tax liability for the period was 147 million and in accordance with the quarterly payment regime, 95 million was paid during the year in respect of this liability.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 41 As a result of the acquisition of Easynet, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset of 83 million during the year, representing timing differences on fixed assets.
The current tax charge has benefited from a partial unwind of this asset in the current year of 59 million, reducing the cash tax liability due in respect of the current year profits accordingly.
The balance is expected to unwind in future periods.
Profit for the year Profit for the year was 551 million compared with 578 million in the prior year, mainly as a result of an increase in finance costs of 56 million, an increase in taxation of 38 million as a result of increased profitability, and a profit on disposal of a joint venture in the prior year of 9 million, offset by an increase in operating profit of 55 million and an increase in investment income of 23 million.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share were 30.2p in the current year, in line with the prior year.
The decrease in profit for the year was offset by the effect of our share buy-back programmes.
During the prior year, a total of 74.3 million shares were repurchased for cancellation, and during the current year 76.4 million shares were repurchased.
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 30.7p in the current year, a 9% increase compared to the prior year.
For a reconciliation from earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Balance sheet Goodwill increased by 206 million, from 417 million at 30 June 2005 to 623 million at 30 June 2006, primarily due to the purchase of Easynet.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets increased by 200 million, from 537 million at 30 June 2005 to 737 million at 30 June 2006, due to 232 million of additions in the year, including refurbishment of leasehold properties, investment in the broadband network, IT infrastructure and further investment in customer management systems, assets acquired on the purchase of Easynet of 108 million, partly offset by depreciation and amortisation of 140 million.
Current assets increased by 920 million from 1,363 million at 30 June 2005 to 2,283 million at 30 June 2006, predominantly due to an increase in short-term deposits of 453 million and cash and cash equivalents of 313 million principally due to the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of Guaranteed Notes on 20 October 2005.
Current liabilities increased by 383 million from 1,150 million at 30 June 2005 to 1,533 million at 30 June 2006.
This increase was due to the reclassification of 162 million of borrowings from non-current to current liabilities relating to a Guaranteed Note that is repayable in October 2006 and the timing of payments.
Non-current borrowings increased by 843 million, from 982 million at 30 June 2005 to 1,825 million at 30 June 2006, primarily due to the issuance of new Guaranteed Notes.
The new Guaranteed Notes, which were issued on 20 October 2005, consist of i US $750 million aggregate principal amount of notes paying 5.625% interest and maturing on 15 October 2015, ii US $350 million aggregate principal amount of notes paying 6.500% interest and maturing on 15 October 2035 and iii 400 million aggregate principal amount of notes paying 5.750% interest and maturing on 20 October 2017.
Foreign exchange For details of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations, see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
Contingent assets Under the terms of one of the Groups channel distribution agreements, British Sky Broadcasting Limited is entitled to a payment, expected to be received between July and December 2006, relating to a proportion of the fair market value of certain of the channels under that distribution agreement.
The fair market value of the channels has not yet been determined.
Accordingly, it is not yet possible to determine the value of the payment which may be received.
The Group has served a claim for a material amount against an information and technology solutions provider, which provided services to the Group as part of the Groups investment in customer management systems software and infrastructure.
The amount which may be recovered by the Group will not be finally determined until resolution of the claim.
Contingent liabilities The Group has contingent liabilities by virtue of its investments in joint ventures and associates that are unlimited companies, or partnerships, which include Nickelodeon UK, The History Channel UK, Paramount UK and National Geographic Channel UK.
The Groups share of contingent liabilities of its joint ventures and associates incurred jointly with other investors is nil 2005: nil.
42 We do not expect any material loss to arise from the above contingent liabilities.
Liquidity and capital resources An analysis of the movement in our net debt is as follows: As at 1 July Cash Non-cash As at 30 June 2005 movements Movements 2006 m m m m Current borrowings 163 163 Non-current borrowings 982 1,014 171 1,825 Debt 982 1,014 8 1,988 Borrowings-related derivative financial instruments 103 133 236 Cash and cash equivalents 503 312 1 816 Short-term deposits 194 453 647 Net debt 388 249 124 761 In addition to our cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits balance of 1,463 million 2005: 697 million, our long-term funding comes primarily from US dollar and sterling-denominated public bond debt, which was raised in 1996, 1999 and 2005.
The public bond debt issued in 2005 which is repayable in 2015, 2017 and 2035 will be used for general corporate purposes, for the refinancing of maturing debt and to extend the maturity profile of our debt.
In addition, we may use proceeds of the offering for acquisitions of business and or assets in support of our strategy including in relation to content, technology and distribution.
As at 30 June 2006, net debt was 761 million.
The public bond debt issued in 1996 and 1999 is partly repayable in 2006, with the remainder repayable in 2009, and we currently believe that our financial position at those dates will enable us to meet our repayment requirements.
For details of our facilities and long-term funding see note 21 of the consolidated financial statements.
For details of our treasury policy and use of financial instruments see note 22 of the consolidated financial statements.
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure that has been provided as we believe that it gives a more relevant indication of our underlying financial position.
Our principal source of liquidity is our cash generated from operations combined with access to the 1 billion 2005: 1 billion RCF, which we entered into in November 2004.
Our cash generated from operations for the current year was 1,004 million 2005: 989 million for further details, see Cash flows below.
We expect to continue to generate significant operating cash inflow in the year ending 30 June 2007 for further details, see Trends and other information and Tabular disclosure of contractual obligations below, subject to the factors described in Review of the Business Risk Factors.
As at 30 June 2006, our RCF was undrawn 2005: undrawn.
Cash flows During the current year, cash generated from operations was 1,004 million, compared with an inflow of 989 million in the prior year.
The increased operating cash inflow was driven by an improvement in operating profit of 55 million, offset by a working capital outflow of 13 million.
During the current year, interest receipts were 43 million, compared to 28 million in the prior year.
This increase was primarily due to higher levels of cash on deposit.
During the current year, tax payments were 172 million, compared to 103 million in the prior year.
This increase in payments is due to the increased profitability of the Group in the prior year, as our payments made during the year relate in part to the tax charge in the prior year.
During the prior year, receipts from the sale of a joint venture of 14 million comprised proceeds from the sale of our shareholding in GSB.
During the current year, payments for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were 212 million, compared with 241 million in the prior year, following completion of a number of capital expenditure and infrastructure projects.
We spent 38 million completing the final stages of the project to upgrade and implement new customer management systems, which went live for all DTH customers on 31 March 2006.
A total of 37 million was spent unbundling telephone exchanges and readying the business for the launch of Sky Broadband, and 16 million was invested to progress the Groups property, business continuity and infrastructure projects.
We invested 10 million to upgrade our production and broadcast facilities ahead of the launch of high definition services.
We also made payments totalling 14 million in the year to a third party for development of encryption technology, which have been capitalised as intangible assets.
The remaining 97 million was spent on a number of projects, such as IS infrastructure, broadcast equipment and the development of new products and services.
During the current year, payments for the purchase of subsidiaries amounting to 209 million principally comprised the acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Easynet, net of cash and cash equivalents purchased.
On 20 October 2005, the Group issued Guaranteed Notes consisting of US $750 million aggregate principal amount of Guaranteed Notes paying 5.625% interest and maturing on 15 October 2015: US $350 million aggregate principal amount of Guaranteed Notes paying 6.500% interest and BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 43 maturing on 15 October 2035: and 400 million aggregate principal amount of Guaranteed Notes paying 5.750% interest and maturing on 20 October 2017, resulting in a net cash inflow of 1,014 million.
On 12 November 2004, the Companys shareholders approved a resolution at the Annual General Meeting for the Company to purchase up to 97 million Ordinary Shares of the Company.
On 4 November 2005, the Companys shareholders approved a resolution at the Annual General Meeting for the Company to further purchase up to 92 million Ordinary Shares of the Company.
During the current year, the Company purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 76.4 million Ordinary Shares at an average price of 530 pence per share, with a nominal value of 38 million, for a consideration of 408 million including stamp duty and commissions.
This represents 4% of called-up share capital at the beginning of the current year.
The Company has announced that the Board will not be proposing to renew the buy-back authority at its next Annual General Meeting in November 2006.
During the current year, interest payments were 105 million, compared to 91 million in the prior year.
This increase in payments was primarily due to increased levels of indebtedness following the issue of new Guaranteed Notes in October 2005, offset in part by the timing of certain interest payments.
During the current year, we made equity dividend payments of 191 million, compared to 138 million in the prior year.
We expect that future payments will increase in line with the Boards expected dividend policy described in the Trends and other information section below.
The above cash flows, in addition to other net movements of 1 million, and non-cash movements of 124 million resulted in an increase in net debt of 373 million to 761 million.
Major non-cash transactions 2005 Corporate reorganisation On 13 April 2005, the High Court approved a reduction in the share capital of BSkyB Investments Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary.
This formed part of a corporate reorganisation, allowing the Company access to significant additional distributable reserves.
Tabular disclosure of contractual obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at 30 June 2006 is shown below: Payments due by period Less than Between Between More than Total 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years m m m m m Obligation or commitment Purchase obligations: 1 Television programme rights 3,260 907 1,695 655 3 Digiboxes and related equipment 91 91 2 Third party payments 30 9 12 9 3 Transponder capacity 420 83 132 69 136 Capital expenditure 25 25 Other 31 26 5 4 Long-term debt 1,921 163 326 451 981 Interest costs 1,187 138 258 132 659 5 Operating lease obligations 144 28 40 27 49 6 Capital lease obligations 67 1 2 1 63 Total cash obligations 7,176 1,471 2,470 1,344 1,891 For the avoidance of doubt, this table does not include commitments relating to employee costs.
1 Purchase obligations Television programme rights At 30 June 2006 we had minimum television programming rights commitments of 3,260 million 2005: 2,260 million, of which 667 million 2005: 642 million related to commitments payable in US dollars for periods of up to six years 2005: eight years.
In addition, in the prior year, there were 45 million of commitments payable in Swiss francs and 3 million of commitments payable in Euros.
44 An additional 363 million US$671 million of commitments 2005: 302 million US$535 million would also be payable in US dollars, assuming that movie subscriber numbers remained unchanged from current levels.
The pounds sterling television programme rights commitments include similar per subscriber based price clauses that would result in additional commitments of 2 million 2005: 10 million, assuming that movie subscriber numbers remained unchanged from current levels.
The total increase in our minimum television programming rights commitments of 1,000 million compared to 30 June 2005, is the result of the acquisition of the A1 Grand Prix rights, a new three-year agreement to broadcast the UEFA Champions League for the 2006 07 to 2008 09 football seasons, and our successful bid for four of the six available packages of exclusive live UK audio visual rights to FAPL football, from the beginning of the 2007 08 season to the end of the 2009 10 season, partly offset by a decreased average period remaining on our commitments for movie channels programming.
2 Purchase obligations Third party payments The third party payment commitments are in respect of distribution agreements for Sky Distributed Channels and are for periods of up to five years 2005: four years.
The extent of the commitment is largely dependent upon the number of DTH subscribers to the relevant Sky Distributed Channels, and in certain cases, upon inflationary increases.
If both the DTH subscriber levels to these channels and the rate payable for each Sky Distributed Channel were to remain at 30 June 2006 levels, the additional commitment would be 491 million 2005: 522 million.
3 Purchase obligations Transponder capacity Transponder capacity commitments are in respect of the Astra and Eurobird satellites that the Group uses for digital transmissions to both DTH subscribers and cable operators.
The commitments are for periods of up to fourteen years 2005: nine years.
Three additional transponder agreements were entered into in the year ended 30 June 2006 to provide capacity to facilitate the launch of the Groups HD services.
4 Long-term debt Further information concerning long-term debt is given in note 21 of the consolidated financial statements.
5 Operating lease obligations At 30 June 2006, our operating lease obligations totalled 144 million 2005: 129 million, the majority of which related to property leases.
6 Capital lease obligations At 30 June 2006, our obligations under capital leases were 67 million 2005: 7 million.
This primarily represents financing arrangements in connection with the customer management centre in Dunfermline, Scotland and the broadband network infrastructure purchased in the current year through a business combination.
For further details see note 21 of the consolidated financial statements.
Trends and other information The significant trends which have a material effect on our financial performance are outlined below.
The number of DTH homes increased by 389,000 in the current year to 8,176,000, compared to growth of 432,000 in the prior year.
We expect growth in subscriber numbers to continue as a result of the implementation of our current marketing strategy, with the aim of achieving our target of 10,000,000 DTH subscribers in 2010.
Sky and Multiroom subscribers both increased substantially in the current year by 75% and 62% respectively, representing a penetration of total DTH subscribers of 19% and 13% respectively.
Given the success of Sky over the last two years, we expect to reach our target of 25% Sky penetration of DTH subscribers in 2010 by the end of 2007, three years early.
We expect Multiroom subscriber growth to continue, consistent with achieving our target of 30% Multiroom penetration of DTH subscribers in 2010.
During the current year we launched our HD service, and at 30 June 2006, there were 38,000 subscribers to our HD service.
We expect there to be substantial growth in the number of HD subscribers in the future.
Retail price increases, the increased number of subscribers to our Multiroom and HD products and the launch of new services, including residential broadband, are expected to generate additional revenue on a per subscriber basis.
The operating margin for the current year was 21%, consistent with the prior year.
We currently expect our operating margin to grow in the longterm, as a result of the operational gearing of our business as we expect total revenues to increase at a faster rate than operating costs.
In the shorter term our operating margin will decline, primarily due to the development and launch of our residential broadband services.
The associated increase in costs as we invest in the new services will outweigh the positive contribution they will have on subscriber revenues in the earlier years.
During the current year, the number of cable homes receiving Sky Channels in the UK and Ireland increased by 26,000 to 3,898,000 following a decrease of 23,000 in the prior year.
We currently expect cable subscriber numbers to remain stable in the foreseeable future, although this is dependent on the strategies of the relevant cable companies, as they relate to the distribution of our channels for further details see Review of the BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 45 business Risk factors.
We currently have agreements with ntl and Telewest for the distribution of certain of our channels which expire during calendar 2006.
We do, however, expect to renew these agreements.
Advertising revenues increased in the current and prior years.
The increase in the current year reflects continued growth in our share of UK television advertising revenue.
We expect that our share of UK television advertising revenue will continue to increase, primarily as a result of increasing commercial impacts for those channels for which we sell airtime.
Sky Bet revenues increased by 16% in the current year.
We expect Sky Bet revenues to continue to grow driven by interactive betting and gaming via television and the internet, and the launch of a poker product during fiscal 2007.
Sky Bet is well positioned to take advantage of the changes in UK gambling laws and regulations following the passing of the Gambling Act in April 2005 and the issuing of UK remote gambling licenses which are expected in late 2007.
Sky Active revenues in the current year decreased by 1% compared to the prior year.
We currently expect increases in Sky Active revenues from growth in online advertising, mobile TV and TV by broadband services.
Programming costs decreased during the current year.
Following our successful bid for four of the six available packages each of 23 games of exclusive live UK television rights to FAPL football from the beginning of the 2007 08 season to the end of the 2009 10 season our expenditure on FAPL programming costs will increase in the future: however we currently expect that total programming costs will increase at a slower rate than our revenues.
We will continue to seek to reduce the per subscriber cost in relation to the Sky Distributed Channels, as and when the contracts for these are renewed.
However, we do expect minor fluctuations depending upon the timing of individual programming agreements.
Transmission and related functions costs increased during the current year, and are expected to continue to increase in future years at a higher rate than the growth in subscribers, resulting in an increased cost per subscriber, reflecting the costs of operating our HDTV service, the launch of residential broadband services, higher forecast utilities costs and increased depreciation charges.
Marketing costs increased in the current and prior years.
As a percentage of revenues, we expect marketing costs to increase in the shorter term, principally due to costs associated with the launch of our residential broadband services.
Also included within marketing costs are the costs of providing free or subsidised digital satellite reception equipment and installation costs in excess of the relevant amount actually received from customers.
It remains our current intention to continue the practice of providing free or subsidised digital satellite reception equipment and subsidising installation to new subscribers.
Subscriber management costs increased during the current year at a higher rate than in the prior year.
We expect that subscriber management costs will increase at a higher rate over the next few years due to a greater proportion of Sky and HD customers, whose installations carry higher hardware costs than the standard installations, and increased costs associated with the launch of residential broadband services, partly offset by a reduction in the cost of standard digiboxes.
Additionally, the new customer management systems which went into use in September 2005 will result in increased amortisation charges going forward.
We are also investing in increasing the capacity of our contact centres, which is expected to result in an associated increase in the cost of subscriber management.
Administration costs increased in the current and prior years, and are expected to continue increasing in the foreseeable future due to the growth in our overall business and higher depreciation charges relating to investment in our properties, including expenditure on broadcasting infrastructure.
The Directors are proposing a final dividend for 2005 06 of 6.7 pence per share, which, combined with the interim dividend of 5.5 pence per share, will result in total dividend growth of 36% on the prior year.
The Group continues to be cash generative despite the projected reduction in short term earnings per share as a result of the investment in broadband.
It is therefore the Boards aim to maintain a progressive dividend policy throughout the broadband investment phase, resulting in continued real growth in dividend per share.
Dividends are paid between Group companies out of profits available for distribution subject to, inter alia, the provisions of our Articles of Association and the Companies Act 1985 as amended.
There are restrictions over the distribution of any profits which are not generated from external cash receipts as defined in Technical Release 7 03, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The interim dividend of the Company of 99 million in January 2006, relating to the period ended 31 December 2005, and the final dividend of 120 million proposed in July 2006, relating to the year ended 30 June 2006, were resolved or proposed to be paid out of profits available for distribution generated from external cash receipts.
We currently believe that our existing external financing, together with internally generated cash inflows, will continue to be sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our current operations, including our contractual obligations and commercial commitments described above, our approved capital expenditure requirements and any dividends proposed.
Off-balance sheet arrangements At 30 June 2006, the Company did not have any undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that require disclosure as defined under the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
46 Research and development During the current year, the Group made payments totalling 15 million to a third party for development of encryption technology 2005: 11 million.
The Group did not incur any other significant research and development expenditure in the current or prior year.
Related party transactions The Group conducts all business transactions with companies which are part of the News Corporation group News Corporation, a major shareholder, on an arms length basis.
During the year the Group made purchases of goods services from News Corporation totalling 175 million 2005: 163 million, 2004: 146 million and supplied services to News Corporation totalling 21 million 2005: 18 million, 2004: 16 million.
During the year the Group made purchases of goods services from joint ventures and associates totalling 46 million 2005: 54 million, 2004: 64 million and supplied services to joint ventures and associates totalling 14 million 2005: 20 million, 2004: 19 million.
For further details of transactions with related parties, see note 29 of the consolidated financial statements.
US GAAP reconciliation Profit for the period under IFRS was 551 million 2005: 578 million.
Under US GAAP, net income was 551 million 2005: 577 million.
Net assets under IFRS at 30 June 2006 were 121 million 2005: 187 million.
Under US GAAP, net assets were 759 million 2005: 818 million.
The principal differences between US GAAP and IFRS, as they relate to the Group, arise from the methods of accounting for goodwill, employee stock-based compensation, capitalisation of interest, derivatives, pre-consolidation results, debt issue costs and deferred taxation.
For a further explanation of the differences between US GAAP and IFRS, see note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
Critical accounting policies The application of IFRS often requires our judgement when we formulate our accounting policies and when presenting fairly our financial position and results in our consolidated financial statements.
Often, judgement is required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy to be followed can materially affect our reported results or net asset position, in particular through estimating the lives of recoverability of particular assets, or in the timing of when a transaction is recognised.
A description of our significant accounting policies is disclosed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
We do not believe that we have any critical accounting policies which are specific to US GAAP, as any US GAAP accounting policies that we have deemed to be critical are also critical under IFRS.
We consider that our accounting policies in respect of the following are critical: Goodwill Business combinations that have occurred since the IFRS Transition Date 1 July 2004 IFRS Transition Date are accounted for by applying the purchase method of accounting.
Following this method, goodwill is initially recognised on consolidation, representing the difference between the cost of the business combination and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
Judgement is required in determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent assets assumed in a business combination.
Calculating the fair values involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including expectations about future cash flows, discount rates and the lives of assets following purchase.
In respect of business combinations that occurred prior to the IFRS Transition Date, goodwill has been included at its deemed cost, as permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
Deemed cost represents the goodwills carrying value under the Groups UK GAAP accounting policies on the IFRS Transition Date.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses and is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Any impairment identified is recognised immediately in the income statement and may not subsequently be reversed.
The carrying amount of goodwill in respect of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture.
At 30 June 2006, the carrying value of goodwill amounted to 623 million 2005: 417 million and represented 17% 2005: 17% of our total assets.
Applying the impairment tests has not resulted in a charge for impairment in either the current or prior years.
Judgement is required in evaluating whether any impairment loss has arisen against the carrying amount of goodwill.
This may require calculation of the recoverable amount of cash generating units to which the goodwill is associated.
Such a calculation may involve estimates of the net present value of future forecast cash flows and selecting the appropriate discount rate.
Alternatively, it may involve a calculation of the fair value less costs to sell of the applicable cash generating unit.
BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2006 47 The main difference between IFRS and US GAAP with respect to goodwill relates to the deemed cost of the goodwill in our balance sheets see note 32 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Revenues and bad debt provisions Selecting the appropriate timing and amount of revenue to be recognised requires judgement.
This may involve estimating the fair value of consideration before it is received and determining the stage of completion of a transaction at the balance sheet date.
The main source of our revenue is revenue from subscribers.
Revenues from the provision of DTH subscription services are charged to contract customers on a monthly basis.
Revenues are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle, and are recognised as the services are provided.
Pay-per-view revenue is recognised when the event, movie or football match is viewed.
Cable revenue is recognised as the services are provided to the cable companies and is based on the number of subscribers taking the Sky Channels, as reported to us by the cable companies, and the applicable wholesale prices.
During the current year, subscription revenues from DTH subscribers and cable companies comprised 82% of total revenue 2005: 83%.
Judgement is also required in evaluating the likelihood of collection of customer debt after revenue has been recognised.
This evaluation requires estimates to be made, including the level of provision to be made for amounts with uncertain recovery profiles.
Provisions are based on historical trends in the percentage of debts which are not recovered or on more detailed reviews of individually significant balances.
As DTH subscriber revenues are billed in advance and corrective action is taken early within the billing cycle, bad debts are a relatively low percentage of sales.
The remaining 18% of revenue 2005: 17% comprises advertising, Sky Bet, Sky Active and other revenues.
Recognition of these revenues takes place once the advertising is broadcast, or when the relevant goods or services have been delivered or provided.
Sky Bet revenues represent our income in the period for betting and gaming activities, defined as amounts staked by customers less betting payouts.
There is no difference in the Groups revenue and bad debt provisions between IFRS and US GAAP.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets At 30 June 2006, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets represented 20% of our total assets 2005: 22%.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortisation and any impairment losses, other than those that are classified as held for sale, which are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
When an item comprises major components having different useful lives, each component is accounted for as a separate asset.
The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected.
This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.
Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires judgement.
If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows forecast to be derived from the asset.
This forecast involves cash flow projections and selecting the appropriate discount rate.
There have been no material impairments in the period.
38, Intangible Assets, specifies criteria for the recognition of intangible assets, including a detailed definition of costs that are capitalised in relation to internally generated assets.
Assessing whether assets meet the required criteria for initial capitalisation requires judgement.
This requires a determination of whether the assets will result in future benefits to the Group.
In particular, internally generated intangible assets must be assessed during the development phase to identify whether the Group has the ability and intention to complete the development successfully.
The only difference between IFRS and US GAAP relates to the capitalisation of interest costs on funds invested in the construction of major capital assets see note 32 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Amortisation of programming inventory A significant proportion of programming costs relate to the amortisation of television programme rights.
Programming costs constituted 49% of operating expenses in the current year 2005: 54%.
The key area of accounting for programming inventory requiring judgement is the assessment of the appropriate period over which to recognise the expense associated with the inventory in the income statement.
This assessment requires consideration of the period over which the Group will benefit from the programming inventory, which may not be certain on initial recognition of the inventory.
Acquired movie rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the transmission rights.
Where contracts for sports rights provide for multiple seasons or competitions, they are amortised on a straight-line basis across the season or competition as our estimate of the benefits received from these rights is determined to be most appropriately aligned with a straight-line amortisation profile.
Provisions are made for any programme rights which are surplus to our requirements or will not be shown for any other reason.
There is no difference in the Groups treatment of amortisation of programme stock between IFRS and US GAAP.
