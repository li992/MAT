11 Group Finance Directors Review OVERVIEW The year to 30 April 2006 showed strong progress in the Group, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by 29% to 6.10p per share 2005: 4.73p per share.
In the first half of the year we completed the integration of Sx3 in to Northgate.
In the second half of the year, revenue growth was impacted by the explosion at the Buncefield oil storage depot which destroyed the Groups headquarters and its principal data centre.
Our recovery programme worked well with no critical systems either internally or for clients being lost for any length of time.
This did however consume considerable staff and management time, which would have otherwise been focused on increasing revenue.
As we look forwards our recovery programme is largely complete, allowing management to concentrate again on growth.
Cash flow has been strong, with the Group generating 48.8m of cash from an operating profit before one-off items, amortisation of capitalised customer relationships and option costs of 55.0m.
This has demonstrated our continuing ability to generate substantial amounts of cash from the Group, which will help fund further growth.
Net cash flow before financing and acquisitions was 24.2m 19.1m.
Work carried out under long-term contracts continues to underpin our business.
The order book at 30 April 2006 was broadly flat at 366.0m 2005: 370.0m.
The loss of our head office and data centre impacted on the amount of revenue taken in the second half of the year, but overall order intake remained strong.
Post year end order intake has continued to be good, with a number of large contracts signed.
The most notable of these was a contract with Bristol Building Schools for the Future for 9.0m, which has boosted our order book.
50% 183.0m of the order book will unwind in the current financial year.
Northgates client retention rate remains at over 98.5% leading to a substantial amount of contract renewal activity during the year.
When this is added to our year end order book, it provides management with high levels of revenue visibility.
Before we start a financial year, this plus the contracted order book amounts to around 85% of the following years revenue.
This helps to support Northgates earnings stability and allows the Group to plan with confidence.
