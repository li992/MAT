Operating and financial review.......................................................................... Introduction Information presented Diageo is the worlds leading premium drinks business and operates on an international scale selling all types of beverage alcohol.
It is one of a small number of premium drinks companies that operate across beer, wine and spirits.
Diageos brands have broad consumer appeal across geographies: as a result, the business is organised under the regions of North America, Europe and International and the business analysis is presented on this basis.
The following discussion is based on Diageos results for the year ended 30 June 2006 compared with the year ended 30 June 2005.
The financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
There are a number of accounting differences between IFRS and US GAAP.
A reconciliation of net income from IFRS to US GAAP and an explanation of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP are set out in the US GAAP information in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
In the discussion of the performance of the business, net sales after deducting excise duties is presented in addition to sales, since sales reflects significant components of excise duties which are set by external regulators and over which Diageo has no control.
Diageo incurs excise duties throughout the world.
In some countries, excise duties are based on sales and are separately identified on the face of the invoice to the external customer.
In others, it is effectively a production tax, which is incurred when the spirit is removed from bonded warehouses.
In these countries it is part of the invoiced cost and is not separately identified on the sales invoice.
Changes in the level of excise duties can significantly affect the level of reported sales and costs, without directly reflecting changes in volume, mix or profitability that are the variables which impact on the element of sales retained by the group.
Percentage movements presented below in Operating results 2006 compared with 2005 analysis by brand and geographical region are organic movements unless otherwise stated.
These movements and operating margins are before exceptional items.
Commentary, unless otherwise stated, refers to organic movements.
Share, unless otherwise stated, refers to volume share.
Presentation of information in relation to the business In addition to describing the significant factors impacting on the income statement compared to the prior year for the year ended 30 June 2006, additional information is also presented on the operating performance and cash flows of the group.
There are eight principal key performance indicators that the groups management use to assess the performance of the group in addition to income statement measures of performance.
These are volume, the organic movements in volume, sales, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items, return on average total invested capital, economic profit and free cash flow.
These key performance indicators are described below: Volume has been measured on an equivalent units basis to nine litre cases of spirits.
An equivalent unit represents one nine litre case of spirits, which is approximately 272 servings.
A serving comprises 33ml of spirits, 165ml of wine, or 330ml of ready to drink or beer.
Therefore, to convert volume of products, other than spirits, to equivalent units, the following guide has been used: beer in hectolitres divide by 0.9, wine in nine litre cases divide by five, and ready to drink in nine litre cases divide by 10, with certain pre-mixed products that are classified as ready to drink divided by five.
Organic movements in volume, sales, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items are measures not specifically used in the consolidated financial statements themselves.
The performance of the group is discussed using these measures.
In the discussion of the performance of the business, certain information is presented using pounds sterling amounts on a constant currency basis.
This strips out the effect of exchange rate movements and enables an understanding of the underlying performance of the market that is most closely influenced by the actions of that markets management.
The risk from exchange rate movements is managed centrally and is not a factor over which local managers have any control.
Acquisitions and disposals also impact the reported performance and therefore the reported movement in any period in which they arise.
Management adjusts for the impact of such transactions in assessing the performance of the underlying business.
The underlying performance on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals is referred to as organic performance, and further information on the calculation of organic measures as used in the discussion of the business is included in the organic movements calculation and in the notes to that calculation.
Diageos strategic planning and budgeting process is based on organic movement in volume, sales, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items, and these measures closely reflect the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by the groups management.
These measures are chosen for planning, budgeting, reporting and incentive purposes since they represent those measures which local managers are most directly able to influence and they enable consideration of the underlying business performance without the distortion caused by fluctuating exchange rates, acquisitions and disposals.
The groups management believe these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the groups performance since they provide information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to influence and they focus on that element of the core brand portfolio which is common to both periods.
They should be viewed as complementary to, and not replacements for, the comparable GAAP measures: sales, net sales after deducting excise duties and reported movements in individual income statement captions.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 23 Operating and financial review continued.......................................................................... Return on average total invested capital is used by management to assess the return obtained from the groups asset base.
This measure is not specifically used in the consolidated financial statements, but is calculated to aid comparison of the performance of the business.
The profit used in assessing the return on total invested capital reflects the operating performance of the business after the effective tax rate for the period stated before exceptional items and interest.
Average total invested capital is calculated using the average derived from the consolidated balance sheets at the beginning, middle and the end of the period.
Capital employed comprises net assets for the period, excluding post employment benefit liabilities net of deferred tax and net borrowings.
This average capital employed is then aggregated with the average restructuring and integration costs net of tax, which have been charged to exceptional items, and goodwill written off to reserves at 1 July 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, to obtain the average total invested capital.
Economic profit is used by management to assess the groups return from its asset base compared to a 9% cost of capital charge.
The measure is not specifically used in the consolidated financial statements, but is calculated to aid comparison of the performance of the business.
Economic profit is calculated as the difference between a 9% capital charge on the average invested assets and the actual return achieved by the group on those assets.
The profit used in assessing the return from the groups asset base and the asset base itself is the same as that used in the calculation for the return on average total invested capital.
Free cash flow comprises the net cash flow from operating activities as well as the net purchase and disposal of investments and property, plant and equipment that form part of net cash from investing activities.
The groups management believes the measure assists users of the financial statements in understanding the groups cash generating performance as it comprises items which arise from the running of the ongoing business.
Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The remaining components of net cash flow from investing activities that do not form part of free cash flow, as defined by the groups management, relate to the purchase and disposal of subsidiaries, associates and businesses.
The groups management regards the purchase and disposal of property, plant and equipment as ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant and machinery is required to support the day-to-day operations, whereas acquisitions and disposals of businesses are discretionary.
However, free cash flow does not necessarily reflect all amounts which the group either has a constructive or legal obligation to incur.
Where appropriate, separate discussion is given for the impacts of acquisitions and disposals of businesses, equity dividends paid and the purchase of own shares each of which arises from decisions that are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.
The free cash flow measure is also used by management for their own planning, budgeting, reporting and incentive purposes since it provides information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to influence.

The results for the comparative year ended 30 June 2005 are also presented in accordance with IFRS.
Further information on the conversion to IFRS is set out in Accounting policies of the group Basis of preparation and in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements.
Sales and net sales after deducting excise duties On a reported basis, sales increased by 736 million 8% from 8,968 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 to 9,704 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
On a reported basis, net sales, after deducting excise duties, increased by 583 million 9% from 6,677 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 to 7,260 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Acquisitions and disposals contributed a net increase to reported sales and net sales, after deducting excise duties, of 46 million and 27 million respectively in the year and foreign exchange rate movements also beneficially impacted reported sales by 186 million and reported net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 140 million, principally arising from strengthening of the US dollar.
Operating costs On a reported basis operating costs before exceptional items increased by 471 million, principally due to an increase in cost of goods sold of 318 million and an increase in marketing costs of 11% from 1,013 million to 1,127 million.
Overall, the impact of exchange rate movements increased total operating costs before exceptional items by 165 million.
There were no exceptional operating costs in the year 2005 201 million.
In the prior year, exceptional operating costs comprised 149 million in respect of contributions to be made to the Thalidomide Trust, 29 million of accelerated depreciation and 30 million of Seagram integration costs, less 7 million in respect of the disposal of property, plant and equipment.
On a reported basis, operating costs increased by 270 million 5% from 4,946 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 to 5,216 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Post employment plans Post employment costs for the year ended 30 June 2006 of 87 million 2005 80 million comprised amounts charged to operating profit of 106 million 2005 89 million and finance income of 19 million 2005 9 million.
At 30 June 2006, Diageos deficit before taxation for all post employment plans was 801 million 2005 1,294 million.
Operating profit Operating profit before exceptional items for the year increased by 112 million to 2,044 million from 1,932 million in the prior year.
Exchange rate movements reduced operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2006 by 25 million.
There were no exceptional operating charges in the year ended 30 June 2006, compared to costs in respect of the year ended 30 June 2005 of 201 million.
Non-operating exceptional items Non-operating exceptional items before taxation were a gain of 157 million in the year ended 30 June 2006 compared with a gain of 214 million in the year ended 30 June 2005.
The gain in the year to 30 June 2006 represents a gain of 151 million on sale of the groups remaining 25 million shares of common stock of General Mills and a gain on sale of other businesses of 6 million.
In the year ended 30 June 2005, non-operating exceptional items included a gain of 221 million on the disposal of 54 million shares of common stock of General Mills and a net charge of 7 million in respect of the disposal of other businesses.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 25 Operating and financial review continued.......................................................................... Net finance charges Net finance charges increased by 45 million from 141 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 to 186 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
The net interest charge increased by 43 million from 150 million in the prior year to 193 million in the year ended 30 June 2006: 23 million of this increase resulted from higher debt and higher interest rates year on year, 13 million resulted from the loss of interest income on the Burger King subordinated debt repaid in July 2005 and 10 million from the termination of certain financing arrangements.
In addition, the interest charge increased by 6 million as a result of exchange rate movements.
Partly offsetting these increases, net interest also includes an interest credit of 9 million related to derivative instruments arising on the application of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Other net finance income of 7 million 2005 income of 9 million included income in respect of the groups post employment plans of 19 million 2005 income of 9 million which year on year improvement principally results from lower interest costs in the pension plans from the unwinding of discounted liabilities.
In addition, other net finance charges include a charge of 15 million 2005 7 million in respect of the unwinding of discounted liabilities, a 2 million charge 2005 charge of 8 million in respect of foreign exchange translation differences on inter company funding arrangements that do not meet the accounting criteria for recognition in equity, and investment income of 5 million 2005 17 million in respect of dividends on General Mills shares.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates after interest and tax was 131 million for the year compared to 121 million last year.
Diageos 34% equity interest in Mot Hennessy contributed 122 million to share of profits of associates after interest and tax 2005 113 million.
Profit before taxation After exceptional items, profit before taxation increased by 221 million from 1,925 million to 2,146 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Taxation The effective tax rate before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2006 is 24.9% compared with 35.4% for the year ended 30 June 2005.
The higher effective tax rate in the year ended 30 June 2005 mainly resulted from the reduction in the carrying value of deferred tax assets following a change in tax rate in the relevant territory.
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended 30 June 2006 after exceptional items is 8.4% compared with 31.1% for the year ended 30 June 2005.
The effective tax rate in the current year has been reduced following the agreement of certain brand values with fiscal authorities that resulted in recognising an increase in the groups deferred tax assets of 313 million.
This amount has been accounted for as exceptional income.
The profit arising on the sale of General Mills shares in the year and the comparative year is not subject to tax.
Profit after tax from disposal of businesses Profit after tax from the disposal of businesses in the prior year of 73 million is in respect of the release of provisions established on the disposal of Burger King and Pillsbury.
Exchange rates Diageo does not hedge the translation of its foreign currency results into sterling.
Transactional exchange rate risk is hedged for those currencies in which there is an active market.
The group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in equity to the extent the hedge is effective and subsequently recognised in the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction effects the income statement.
For the year ending 30 June 2007, the impact of exchange rate movements based on current exchange rates is estimated to have an adverse impact of 75 million on operating profit and a positive impact of between 5 million to 10 million on interest.
For the full year, each one cent movement from current rates for either the US dollar or the euro impacts on profit before exceptional items and taxation by approximately 3 million respectively.
Dividend The directors recommend a final dividend of 19.15 pence per share, an increase of 5% on last years final dividend.
The full dividend would therefore be 31.1 pence per share, an increase of 5% from the year ended 30 June 2005.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 23 October 2006 to shareholders on the register on 15 September 2006.
Payment to ADR holders will be made on 27 October 2006.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend and the plan notice date is 2 October 2006.
26 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... Return on average total invested capital Calculations for the return on average total invested capital for the years ended 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005 were as follows: 2006 2005 million million Operating profit before exceptional items 2,044 1,932 Associates after interest and taxation 131 121 Dividends receivable from investments 5 17 Effective tax rate 24.9% 2005 25.0% 543 518 1,637 1,552 Average net assets 5,527 5,835 Average net borrowings 3,899 3,781 Average integration costs net of tax 931 921 Average goodwill 1,562 1,562 Average total invested capital 11,919 12,099 Return on average total invested capital 13.7% 12.8% The effective tax rate for 2005 has been adjusted to 25% to achieve a comparable measure in the year of IFRS adoption 2005 effective rate of tax on profit before tax and exceptional items under IFRS was 35.4%.

Operating results 2006 compared with 2005 analysis by brand and geographical region In order to assist the reader of the financial statements, the following comparison of 2006 with 2005 includes tables which present the exchange, acquisitions and disposals and organic components of the year-on-year movement for each of sales, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items.
Organic movements in the tables below are calculated as follows: The organic movement percentage is the amount in the column headed Organic movement expressed as a percentage of the aggregate of the columns headed 2005 Reported, Transfers, Exchange and the amounts in respect of disposals see note 4 to the tables below included in the column headed Acquisitions and disposals.
The inclusion of the column headed Exchange in the organic movement calculation reflects the adjustment to exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior period results as if they had been generated at the current periods exchange rates.
Organic movement percentages are calculated as the organic movement amount in million, expressed as the percentage of the prior period results at current year exchange rates and after adjusting for disposals.
The basis of calculation means that the results used to measure organic movement for a given period will be adjusted when used to measure organic movement in the subsequent period.
Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of, or terminated, in the current period, the group, in organic movement calculations, adjusts the results for the comparable prior period to exclude the amount the group earned in that period that it could not have earned in the current period ie the period between the date in the prior period, equivalent to the date of the disposal in the current period, and the end of the prior period.
As a result, the organic movement numbers reflect only comparable performance.
Similarly, if a business was disposed of part way through the equivalent prior period then its contribution would be completely excluded from that prior periods performance in the organic movement calculation, since the group recognised no contribution from that business in the current period.
In the calculation of operating profit before exceptional items the overheads Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 27 Operating and financial review continued.......................................................................... included in disposals were only those directly attributable to the businesses disposed, and do not result from subjective judgements of management.
For acquisitions, a similar adjustment is made in the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions subsequent to the end of the equivalent prior period, the post acquisition results in the current period are excluded from the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the prior period, post acquisition results are included in full in the prior period but are only included from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current period.
The organic movement calculations for sales, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2006 were as follows: 2005 Acquisitions Organic 2006 Organic Reported Transfers Exchange and disposals movement Reported movement million million million million million million % Sales North America 2,622 3 129 41 173 2,968 6 Europe 3,860 23 1 7 3 3,834 International 2,424 5 56 12 329 2,826 13 Corporate and other 62 15 1 76 2 Total 8,968 186 46 504 9,704 6 Net sales after deducting excise duties North America 2,194 3 110 34 169 2,510 7 Europe 2,499 23 1 16 4 2,455 International 1,922 5 31 9 252 2,219 13 Corporate and other 62 15 1 76 2 Total net sales 6,677 140 27 416 7,260 6 Excise duties 2,291 2,444 Sales 8,968 9,704 Operating profit before exceptional items North America 779 2 1 47 829 6 Europe 702 3 5 4 39 737 6 International 615 3 23 1 54 644 9 Corporate and other 164 6 1 9 166 6 Total 1,932 25 6 131 2,044 7 Notes 1 Results for 2005 have been restated for the impacts of implementing IFRS.
2 Transfers represent the movement between operating units of certain activities, the most significant of which were the reallocation of the Guinness Storehouse visitor centre in Dublin from Europe into the Corporate business segment and the transfer of the costs in respect of a global information technology project from Corporate into Europe and International.
3 The exchange adjustments for sales, net sales after deducting excise duties, and operating profit before exceptional items are principally in respect of the US dollar.
4 The only acquisition in the year ended 30 June 2006 was the acquisition of The Old Bushmills Distillery Company Limited.
Other acquisitions impacting on the calculation of organic growth in the year were in respect of the acquisition of The Chalone Wine Group North America, Ursus Vodka Holdings B. V. Europe and Ghana Breweries Limited International.
Disposals affecting the year were principally the disposal of United Beverages Limited Europe and contributed sales, net sales after deducting excise duties, and operating profit before exceptional items of 35 million, 35 million and nil, respectively, in the year ended 30 June 2005.

Diageo continued to outperform the market in an industry where the increase in the US legal drinking age population and the trend towards more premium products across all beverage alcohol categories are helping to drive growth.
The global priority brands again led the growth with volume up 7% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 8%.
The spirits brands, excluding ready to drink, delivered 8% growth in net sales, after deducting excise duties, reflecting strong performances from Smirnoff, Captain Morgan and Jos Cuervo.
Smirnoff benefited from targeted profile raising activity.
In the off trade, volume was driven by concentrated activity on high visibility feature and display initiatives across Smirnoff vodka, as well as innovation in flavours.
These activities and the focus on proven growth drivers, such as quality account management, delivered strong growth for Smirnoff vodka with volume up 9% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 11%.
Johnnie Walker continued to outperform the scotch category with volume up 1% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 5%.
Both Johnnie Walker Red Label and Johnnie Walker Black Label grew share.
Higher marketing and public relations investment behind the successful Mentor programme and increased relationship marketing underpinned these strong results.
Captain Morgan had a good year.
Excluding ready to drink, volume was up 9% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, were up 14%, benefiting from increased media spending, particularly in television to drive awareness and trial, strong display executions and the launch of Tattoo.
Baileys continued its turnaround from last year with volume and net sales, after deducting excise duties, both up 7%.
The Jos Cuervo Tradicional and Reserva variants delivered double-digit growth benefiting from the trend towards premium tequila.
Product innovation also made a strong contribution to growth as the super premium range was further extended with the introduction of Black Medallion in February.
A range of flavours was also introduced during the year.
Excluding ready to drink, Jos Cuervo volume increased 9% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, rose 11%.
A strong second half performance from Crown Royal resulted in full year volume up 6% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 8% as the investment behind NASCAR was increased.
The second half also saw the launch of an ultra premium offering, Crown Royal Extra Rare.
The Tony Sinclair Ready to Tanqueray campaign has reinvigorated the Tanqueray brand with volume up 5%.
Price increases, taken over the year in certain markets, have led to an increase in net sales, after deducting excise duties, of 7%.
In line with the trend towards premium beers, Guinness continued to show strong performance with volume up 7%.
A price increase across all variants in October 2005 meant that net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 9%.
In wine, Beaulieu Vineyard volume was flat, but net sales, after deducting excise duties, increased 1%.
Sterling Wines volume was up 3% with net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 10% as price increases were taken across a variety of labels.
The Chalone wine brands are delivering ahead of expectations, as a result of a strong contribution from innovation with the introduction of new varietals.
Total ready to drink volume was up 2% led by the continued growth of Jos Cuervos pre-mixed margarita offerings and the launch of the Captain Morgans Parrot Bay ready to drink product.
The introduction of new Smirnoff Twisted V flavours, strong growth of Smirnoff Ice in Canada and the regional launch of Smirnoff Raw Tea partially offset declines in the Smirnoff Ice brand in the US.
In category brands, volume decreased by 1% but net sales, after deducting excise duties, were up 7%.
This reflected the decision to shift operational focus toward the more profitable reserve brands such as Croc and Don Julio and away from the high volume standard brands such as Popov and Gordons vodka.
Marketing spend for the year was up 6% and excluding ready to drink, up 9%.
This reflects an accelerated investment in spirits, offset by a reduction in spend on ready to drink.

The shift from the on to the off trade in Ireland again negatively impacted overall beer performance.
Wine volume grew 7% driven by Blossom Hills robust growth in Great Britain and Ireland.
Smirnoff vodka, excluding ready to drink, continued to grow strongly, delivering volume growth of 8% and growth of net sales, after deducting excise duties, of 7%.
A pan-European advertising campaign, focusing on the quality credentials of Smirnoff, continued to build the distinctiveness of the brand, although marketing spend was reduced by 9%.
Johnnie Walker Red Label volume grew 1% while net sales, after deducting excise duties, were flat.
However, very strong volume growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label, up 14%, and Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe, up 21%, delivered overall growth in Johnnie Walker, with volume up 3%, and had a positive mix impact as net sales, after deducting excise duties, increased 6%.
Growth was driven mainly by increased demand in Southern Europe, Russia and Eastern Europe and the favourable impact of advertising, especially the sponsorship of Team McLaren Mercedes Formula One.
Marketing spend was up 19% as a result of increased activities in sports sponsorship.
Europe accounts for over half of Baileys volume worldwide and brand volume was up a further 1% year on year, driven by growth in France, Italy, Russia and Central and Eastern Europe.

Excluding ready to drink, both volume and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew by 1%.
The majority of J&Bs volume in Europe is sold in Spain, where the decline of the scotch category led to a 3% decrease in overall volume of J&B.
However, elsewhere in Europe, especially in France and Eastern Europe, J&B performed well.
Guinness volume declined 3% although pricing offset weak volumes and net sales, after deducting excise duties, were flat year on year.
Guinness sales progressed well in Russia during the year following Diageos agreement in July 2005 with Heineken NV for the production and distribution of Guinness in Russia.

The total spirits market in Great Britain was broadly flat as growth in the off trade offset declines in the on trade.
Diageo maintained leadership across all key categories and, excluding ready to drink, grew spirits volume by 2%.
Growth in spirits was attributable to Smirnoff vodka in particular, which continued to gain share as volume grew 6% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 8%.

Smirnoff ready to drink volume declined 19%, a rate similar to the prior year.
Total Baileys volume declined 2% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, declined by 4%.
Excluding Baileys Glide, Baileys volume declined 1% whilst net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 1%.
The majority of Baileys is sold in the off trade where there has been increased competition from value brands, however while volume declined, the brand maintained its value share.
Baileys grew in the on trade driven by distribution gains and price increases.
Total Guinness volume declined 1% whilst net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 1% driven by a price increase on Guinness Draught.

Bells Extra Special volume grew 2% although net sales, after deducting excise duties, were down.
Category brand volume grew 4% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, increased 2% driven by Blossom Hill, which continued to grow strongly with volume up 13%, and the launch in May 2006 of a new product, Quinns, an alcoholic fruit ferment blended drink, into the on and off trade.
Ireland The performance in Ireland reflects the continuing change in market dynamics from on to off trade, high levels of competitor investment, and consumer migration to value brands.
While the total beverage alcohol market grew 2%, the on trade was down 3% and the off trade was up 7%.
The on trade now represents 51% of the total market.
Volume declined 3% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, were down 1%.
This was due to weak performance in beer, where volumes were down 6%, partly offset by growth in wine and spirits, where volume grew 18% and 7% respectively.
The impact on net sales, after deducting excise duties, of declining beer volume was partly offset by price increases.
Guinness volume declined 8% whilst net sales, after deducting excise duties, declined 3% as a result of price increases introduced in June 2005 and May 2006.
Guinness was impacted by increased levels of competitor investment and the movement to the off trade where Guinness share is lower.
In the year there was innovation on the Guinness brand with positive consumer response to the launch of the limited edition Brewhouse Series.
In the second half, Guinness Mid-Strength, a lower alcohol by volume format, began consumer trials in 80 outlets.
The introduction of new packaging on Harp, new marketing executions on Carlsberg and Harp and increased distribution have helped reinvigorate both brands.

Smirnoff continued to be the number one vodka in Ireland and outperformed the vodka category in both the on and off trade.
Baileys volume declined 2% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, fell 8% due to increased competition from lower value brands.
Iberia In Iberia, volume and net sales, after deducting excise duties, both declined 3%.
In Spain, spirits penetration is declining in all age groups versus other leisure categories and this has negatively impacted the Spanish business, whilst in Portugal trading conditions continued to be tough as a result of tightening consumer expenditure.
J&B faced increased pressure as the standard whisky segment in Spain continued to decline as consumers continued to switch to dark rums.
Therefore, while J&B gained share in the Spanish on trade, overall Iberian volume declined 7% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, fell 10%.
Marketing spend increased 3% behind J&B driven by investment in Spain.
Johnnie Walker volume declined 2%, however net sales, after deducting excise duties, were up 2% driven by the growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label, Super Deluxe and price increases throughout Iberia.
Johnnie Walker Black Label and Super Deluxe combined grew volume by 4% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 11%.
Johnnie Walker Red Label volume declined 3% despite a good performance in Spain, where it is the only standard whisky brand growing volume and share in the on trade.

Good economic conditions in many markets, further investment in the brands and the organisation and a focus on market place execution have resulted in the International business growing strongly in all regions.
Growth has been driven by the global priority brands, with Johnnie Walker in particular experiencing strong growth on the back of upweighted investment.
This investment has been focused around the sponsorship of Team McLaren Mercedes Formula One, which has been particularly successful in driving growth of Johnnie Walker Black Label and Super Deluxe variants, where net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 17%.
The sponsorship has also provided a strong platform for Diageos responsible drinking programmes.
Smirnoff vodka grew net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 13% with particularly strong growth in India and Brazil.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume grew over 40%.
This performance has been delivered through strengthened distribution and sales execution and advertising campaigns on Smirnoff Ice in Brazil and Australia, as well as the launch of Smirnoff Ice in Venezuela and Smirnoff Storm in South Africa.
Baileys grew volume by 11% driven by growth in Global Duty Free and Japan.
Promotional activity in Global Duty Free and the decline of Baileys Glide in Australia have, however, resulted in adverse mix with net sales, after deducting excise duties, growing by 6%.
Guinness volume declined 2% whilst net sales, after deducting excise duties, were up 3%.
Performance was held back as a result of a decline in Cameroon, although this was partly offset by strong performances in Nigeria and Ghana where price increases accelerated the growth of net sales, after deducting excise duties, ahead of volume.
South East Asia and Japan also experienced good growth.
Local priority brand performance was led by the growth of Buchanans in Venezuela, and the return to growth of Windsor in Korea, driven in particular by new packaging on the 12 and 17-year-old variants.
Growth of Bundaberg in Australia and Bells in South Africa were offset by declines in Dimple in Korea, and Tusker and Pilsner in Kenya.
The growth of the scotch category across the region has been the main driver of the growth in category brands.
Investment behind Diageos scotch brands has enabled the International region to capitalise on market opportunities.
Amongst the successes was Old Parr, which grew significantly across Latin America with volume and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up nearly 60%.
The newly launched whisky brands continued to perform strongly in Thailand and the successful relaunch of Harp in Nigeria also contributed to the overall growth in category brands.
Ready to drink grew volume by 22% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 21%.
This was led by the growth of Smirnoff throughout International and Bundaberg and Johnnie Walker in Australia.
Asia Pacific Increased marketing investment, growing markets in India and China, share gains in Korea and Thailand and continued growth in ready to drink in Australia led to volume up 15%, and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 11% in Asia Pacific.
In Australia, ready to drink has driven growth of 6% in net sales, after deducting excise duties, with Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker and Bundaberg all showing good growth.
Smirnoff ready to drink delivered share gains of 3.4 percentage points, boosted by the successful launch of Smirnoff Twist ready to drink.
In spirits, whilst Baileys has declined in volume and lost share, Johnnie Walker Red Label, Johnnie Walker Black Label, Bundaberg and Smirnoff have all gained share in a spirits market that was up 6% in the year.
In Korea, the trading environment for spirits has stabilised as a result of improved economic conditions, however Diageos strong performance was the result of gaining share, most notably on Windsor.
The brand has been revitalised with new packaging and the introduction of a 21-year-old variant and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 9%.
Johnnie Walker volume grew 36% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 52%.
Johnnie Walker Super Deluxe grew volume 58% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 82%, albeit off a small base, as it gained from the new focus on modern on trade outlets and marketing activities to build brand equity.
Dimple volume declined by 22% in the year, as renovations on the brand failed to turn around performance.
In Japan, volume grew 3% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew by 1%.
Strong performances from Baileys, which grew volume by 65%, and Guinness, up 14%, offset a 45% volume decline in Smirnoff ready to drink as a result of a temporary withdrawal in the first half.
The brand performed well following the relaunch in the second half.
In Thailand, Diageo clearly outperformed the market and the competition, with growth in each of its brands despite the decline in the imported whisky segment.
Benmore and Golden Knight together account for over 450,000 cases and have made significant share gains in the standard and economy whisky segments respectively, although this strong growth has resulted in an adverse mix.
Johnnie Walker recorded volume growth of 32% and growth in net sales, after deducting excise duties, of 20% driven by Johnnie Walker Red Label.
Performance in Taiwan improved as volume and net sales, after deducting excise duties, both grew 11%.
Johnnie Walker Green Label in particular has performed well, benefiting from a new campaign and a market where malt whisky is growing strongly.
Performance in China has continued strongly with volume up 57% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 81%, albeit from a small base.
Johnnie Walker Black Label represents a significant proportion of Diageos business in China, and has driven this growth with volume up 89% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 124%, supported by a significant upweight in investment.
This investment included activities surrounding the sponsorship of Team McLaren Mercedes Formula One at the Shanghai Grand Prix, as well as three new local advertising executions.
The Indian business benefited from activities surrounding Johnnie Walkers sponsorship of the cricket Super Series in Australia, and the Smirnoff Life is Calling campaign.
Volume grew 29% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 37%.
While there is increasing evidence of consumers upgrading to premium and branded products, competitive activity is becoming more intense, with evidence of increased consolidation in the sector, and an increasing number of new brand launches.
This was the result of strong performances in Nigeria and South Africa, offset by a decline in Cameroon.
In Nigeria volume grew 20% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 13%.
Harp was relaunched in 2005 and as a result share has increased by 3.7 percentage points.
This growth has, however, led to adverse mix.
Guinness delivered volume growth of 4% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 9% as a result of a price increase in October 2004.
In East Africa, difficult economic conditions due to drought and rising fuel prices, together with a duty increase, saw consumers trade down to lower value brands.
Volume grew 20% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 11% with Senator, a low priced beer introduced in 2005, having performed well.
South Africa saw significant mix improvement as volume grew 6% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 19%.
This mix improvement was the result of a strong performance by Diageos scotch brands as Johnnie Walker volume increased by 36% and Bells grew volume by 15%.
The switch in consumer preference towards dark spirits resulted in Smirnoff vodka volume declining by 7%, although Smirnoff ready to drink grew by 48%, driven by the launch of Smirnoff Storm.
In Ghana, volume grew 6% whilst price increases and a change in invoicing arrangements agreed with the authorities following the acquisition of Ghana Breweries Ltd led net sales, after deducting excise duties, to grow by 17%.
Guinness volume for the year was flat with net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 13%.
Volume of Malta increased by 13% as it continued to enjoy an advantaged price position over its competitive set.
Trading in Cameroon was heavily impacted by aggressive promotional activity by a competitor.
As a result, Guinness volumes were down 37% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, were down by 35%.
Latin America and the Caribbean Diageo has continued to invest behind brand building programmes, improvements in customer relationships and sales execution to capitalise on the growth in consumer demand from buoyant economies across Latin America.
Volume grew by 17% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 21%.
In the Brazilian hub, which includes Paraguay and Uruguay, growth was driven by scotch and ready to drink.
Johnnie Walker grew net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 40%.
In Brazil, Johnnie Walker benefited from investment both above and below the line as Johnnie Walker Red Label share grew 3.4 percentage points and Johnnie Walker Black Label delivered share gains of 1.8 percentage points.
Smirnoff ready to drink grew net sales, after deducting excise duties, over 100% as the continued success of Smirnoff Ice has extended Smirnoffs leadership in the buoyant ready to drink segment.
Volume grew 23% and net sales, after deducting excise duties, grew 36% in Venezuela, as strong economic fundamentals have translated into increased consumer demand across all sectors.
Diageo leads the super deluxe, deluxe and standard scotch segments.
Johnnie Walker Red Label performed strongly with volume and net sales, after deducting excise duties, up 25% and Buchanans delivered growth in net sales, after deducting excise duties, of 40%.
A new campaign for Smirnoff Ice has driven significant growth in volume and net sales, after deducting excise duties, albeit off a small base.

As a result Diageo gained 4.9 percentage points of share in the scotch category.
Johnnie Walker Red Label grew volume 32% and Buchanans volume increased 51% as a result of strengthened customer relationships, sustained brand building investment and a particular focus on the on trade.
Global Duty Free The focus on sales execution and innovation within Global Duty Free has driven strong volume growth of 16% and growth in net sales, after deducting excise duties, of 18%.
Packaging innovation such as the Johnnie Walker Blue Label Magnum and marketing activity around the sponsorship of Team McLaren Mercedes Formula One has led to a 21% growth in net sales, after deducting excise duties, for Johnnie Walker.
Baileys delivered growth of 29% in net sales, after deducting excise duties, as major sampling activities were carried out in Europe and Asia associated with the launch of the new flavour innovations.
Corporate revenue and costs Reported performance Net sales, after deducting excise duties, were 76 million in the year ended 30 June 2006, up by 14 million from 62 million in the prior year.
Net operating costs before exceptional items increased by 2 million to 166 million in the year ended 30 June 2006.
Organic performance Transfers between business segments increased prior year net sales, after deducting excise duties, by 15 million, and there was an organic decrease in net sales, after deducting excise duties, of 1 million.
Net corporate operating costs before exceptional items decreased by 6 million as a result of transfers between business segments and there was a decrease of 1 million as a result of foreign exchange impacts.
An organic increase of 9 million in corporate net operating costs, before exceptional items, was driven mainly by an increase in investment behind innovation.
Trend information The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 31 August 2006: Diageos strong full year performance is the result of brand building marketing campaigns, better sales execution to build superior relationships with our customers and successful new product launches.
North America continues to deliver industry beating top line growth: a more cost effective European business is driving operating profit and margin growth: and the rate of sales growth in International has accelerated following new brand introductions and increased investment.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 35 Operating and financial review continued.......................................................................... Strong top line growth has delivered organic operating margin expansion and organic operating profit growth in line with our guidance at the beginning of the year despite pressure on input costs.
At the same time we have increased marketing investment creating a stronger platform for future growth.
We have delivered another year of strong free cash flow and through our dividends and share buybacks we have returned a further 2.3 billion to our shareholders.
With well-positioned brands and a more efficient and effective organisation, we enter the new financial year with confidence.
We expect that organic net sales growth will be in line with that achieved in the current year and we plan to deliver organic operating profit growth of at least 7% for the year and to return a further 1.4 billion to shareholders through our continuing buyback programme.
Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow A summary of the cash flow and reconciliation to movement in net borrowings for the two years ended 30 June 2006 is as follows: Year ended 30 June 2006 2005 million million Profit for the year 1,965 1,399 Profit after tax from disposal of discontinued businesses 73 Taxation 181 599 Share of associates profits after tax 131 121 Net interest and other finance income and charges 186 141 Net non-operating exceptional gains 157 214 Depreciation and amortisation 214 241 Movements in working capital 192 89 Dividend income 115 134 Other items 18 78 Cash generated from operations 2,199 2,273 Interest received 64 146 Interest paid 235 325 Dividends paid to equity minority interests 40 49 Taxation paid 393 320 Net cash from operating activities 1,595 1,725 Net disposal purchase of investments 7 6 Net investment in property, plant and equipment 241 276 Free cash flow 1,361 1,443 Disposal of shares in General Mills 651 1,210 Other disposals 121 16 Acquisitions 209 258 Proceeds from issue of share capital 3 6 Net purchase of own shares for share trusts 11 29 Own shares repurchased 1,428 710 Increase decrease in loans 309 379 Redemption of guaranteed preferred securities 302 Equity dividends paid 864 849 Net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 67 116 Cash flows from loans excluding overdrafts 309 379 Exchange differences 15 136 Non-cash items 18 91 Increase decrease in net borrowings 379 450 The primary sources of the groups liquidity over the last two financial years have been cash generated from operations and cash received from disposals.
A portion of these funds has been used to fund acquisitions, share repurchases, to pay interest, dividends and taxes, and to fund capital expenditure.
Cash generated from operations decreased by 74 million to 2,199 million in the year to 30 June 2006.
There was an increase of 566 million in profit for the year to 1,965 million for the year ended 30 June 2006, which was offset by the year-on-year impact of working capital movements on the cash flow of 281 million an outflow of 192 million in the year to 30 June 2006 and an inflow of 89 million in the prior year.
Of this year-on-year movement in working capital, 179 million reflects the presentation of exceptional non-cash charges within working capital movements in the prior year following the implementation of IFRS, thus operating working capital impact on cash flow was 102 million.
The decrease in cash generated from operations was partially offset by reduced interest payments down 8 million to 171 million and reduced capital expenditure down 35 million to 241 million.
However, increased tax payments up 73 million to 393 million contributed to an overall decrease in free cash flow of 82 million to 1,361 million from 1,443 million in the prior year.
In the year ended 30 June 2006, the group generated proceeds from the disposal of shares of General Mills of 651 million 2005 1,210 million and issued new share capital under employee share schemes generating proceeds of 3 million 2005 6 million.
These inflows were mainly offset by payments of 1,428 million to repurchase shares to be held as treasury shares including 21 million in respect of treasury shares to be held for hedging employee share scheme grants, the payment of 209 million to acquire Bushmills Irish whiskey in August 2005 and 864 million equity dividends paid.
Capital structure and credit rating The groups management is committed to enhancing shareholder value, both by investing in the businesses and brands so as to improve the return on investment and by managing capital structure.
Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency, maximise flexibility and give the appropriate level of access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
This is achieved by targeting a range of ratios which are currently broadly consistent with a single A credit rating.
Capital repayments The company acquired 164 million 2005 86 million, 2004 nil ordinary shares to be held as treasury shares as part of its share buyback programme during the year ended 30 June 2006, for a total consideration of 1,407 million including expenses 2005 649 million, 2004 nil.
The company did not acquire any shares for cancellation during the year 2005 8 million shares, consideration 61 million, 2004 43 million shares, consideration 306 million.
The group regularly assesses its debt and equity capital levels against its stated policy for capital structure and will continue to repurchase shares when appropriate.
In the period from the balance sheet date to 30 August 2006 the company acquired 18.3 million shares to be held as treasury shares for a total consideration of 170 million including expenses.

Borrowings The group policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of borrowings of group financing companies is to limit the proportion of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits, and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
In addition, it is group policy to maintain backstop facility terms from relationship banks to support commercial paper obligations.
The groups net borrowings and gross borrowings in the tables below are measured at amortised cost with the exception, in relation to the year ended 30 June 2006, of borrowings designated in a fair value hedge, interest rate fair value hedging instruments and foreign currency swaps and forwards which are measured at fair value.
From 1 July 2005 the group has applied IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
The comparative figures for the year ended 30 June 2005 have not been restated for compliance with IAS 39 under the exemptions permitted under IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
Net borrowings, reported on this basis, comprise the following: As at 30 June 2006 2005 million million Overdrafts 48 58 Other borrowings due within one year 711 811 Borrowings due within one year 759 869 Borrowings due between one and three years 1,790 1,744 Borrowings due between three and five years 831 974 Borrowings due after five years 1,380 959 Interest rate fair value hedging instruments 44 Foreign currency swaps and forwards 17 Finance leases 9 9 Gross borrowings 4,830 4,555 Offset by: Cash and cash equivalents 699 787 Other liquid resources 49 30 Foreign currency swaps and forwards 32 Net borrowings 4,082 3,706 The effective interest rate for the year ended 30 June 2006, based on average monthly net borrowings and interest charge, excluding finance charges unrelated to net borrowings, was 4.8% 2005 4.1%.
Borrowings due within one year including foreign currency swaps and forwards as at 30 June 2006 were 776 million 30 June 2005 837 million.
The groups gross borrowings were denominated in the following currencies: Total US dollar Sterling Euro Other million % % % % Gross borrowings 2006 4,830 47 8 30 15 2005 4,555 84 1 12 3 Cash and cash equivalents and other liquid resources were denominated in the following currencies: Total US dollar Sterling Euro Other million % % % % Cash and cash equivalents and other liquid resources 2006 748 21 20 12 47 2005 817 31 37 2 30 38 | Diageo Annual Report 2006..........................................................................
The following table summarises the groups gross borrowings, excluding overdrafts, finance leases, interest rate fair value hedging instruments and foreign currency swaps and forwards.
As at 30 June 2006 2005 million million Global bonds 2,751 2,086 Yankee bonds 279 Guaranteed notes 216 225 Medium term notes 1,280 930 Commercial paper 458 Others 465 510 4,712 4,488 During the year ended 30 June 2006, the group borrowed $250 million 135 million in the form of a medium term note that matures in 2008, $400 million 216 million in the form of a medium term note that matures in 2009, $600 million 324 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2013 and $750 million 405 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2015.
During the year ended 30 June 2005, the group borrowed $750 million 418 million in the form of a global bond that matures in 2010.
The proceeds of all issuances have been used in the ongoing cash management and funding activities of the group.
At 30 June 2006, the group had available undrawn committed bank facilities of 1,746 million 2005 1,788 million.
Of the facilities, 676 million expire in May 2007, 486 million expire in May 2010 and 584 million expire in May 2011.
Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates plus an agreed margin, which is dependent on the period of drawdown.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being a minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items aggregated with share of associates profits to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with all of its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.
Capital commitments not provided for at 30 June 2006 were estimated at 56 million 2005 53 million.
Diageo management believes that it has sufficient funding for its working capital requirements.
Contractual obligations Payments due by period Less than More than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total As at 30 June 2006 million million million million million Long term debt obligations 711 1,790 831 1,380 4,712 Operating leases 78 129 102 258 567 Purchase obligations 709 612 371 357 2,049 Provisions and other non-current payables 48 69 28 123 268 1,546 2,600 1,332 2,118 7,596 Long term debt obligations comprise borrowings excluding interest rate and foreign currency swaps with an original maturity of greater than one year.
Purchase obligations include various long term purchase contracts entered into for the supply of certain raw materials, principally grapes, cans and glass bottles.
The contracts are used to guarantee supply of raw materials over the long term and to enable more accurate predictions of future costs.
Provisions and other non-current payables exclude 29 million in respect of vacant properties and 102 million for onerous contracts, which are included in operating leases and purchase obligations, respectively.
Deferred tax and post employment benefit liabilities are not included in the table above.
The group makes service-based cash contributions to the Diageo pension scheme in the United Kingdom.
In the year ending 30 June 2007, the contribution is expected to be 52 million.
In addition, the group has agreed to make payments estimated at 50 million in each of the four years to 30 June 2010 into escrow bank accounts to reduce the deficit on the Diageo pension scheme in the United Kingdom.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 39 Operating and financial review continued.......................................................................... Off-balance sheet arrangements In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in October 2001, Diageo has guaranteed debt of International Multifoods Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The JM Smucker Company as from 18 June 2004, to the amount of $200 million 108 million, repayable in November 2009.
The directors are not aware of any instances of default by the borrower at present, but the ability of the borrower to continue to be in compliance with the guaranteed debt instrument, and in particular remaining current on payments of interest and repayments of principal, is significantly dependent on the current and future operations of the borrower and its affiliates.
In addition, certain of the acquired Seagram businesses had pre-existing guarantees at the date of acquisition in relation to the solvency of a third party partnership.
This partnership has outstanding loans of $100 million 54 million.
Vivendi has indemnified the group against any losses relating to these arrangements.
The above guarantees are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the groups business.
Save as disclosed above, neither Diageo plc nor any member of the Diageo group has any off-balance sheet financing arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on the groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.
Risk management The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the groups treasury department.
The treasury department uses a combination of derivative and conventional financial instruments to manage these underlying risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board-approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the finance committee.
This committee is described in the corporate governance report.
These include benchmark exposure and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The benchmarks, hedge cover and overall appropriateness of Diageos risk management policies are reviewed by the board following, for example, significant business, strategic or accounting changes.
The framework provides for limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the optimal application of the board-approved strategies.
Transactions giving rise to exposures away from the defined benchmark levels arising on the application of this flexibility are separately monitored on a daily basis using value at risk analysis.
These derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and gains or losses are taken to the income statement as they arise.
At 30 June 2006 gains and losses on these transactions were not material.
The finance committee receives bi-monthly reports on the activities of the treasury department, including any exposures away from the defined benchmarks.
Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the groups transaction costs and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards.
The groups policy where a liquid foreign exchange market exists is to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net operations before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net operations before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
Diageo introduced from 1 July 2005 additional processes to determine, monitor and document the effectiveness of these hedges in the context of the underlying exposure under IAS 39.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of relevant foreign currency borrowings including foreign exchange swaps and forwards, to the extent that they are in an effective hedge relationship, are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, in accordance with IAS 39.
Transaction exposure hedging For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to the extent it is highly effective, and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Under IFRS, the degree of confidence in forecast future cash flows required to achieve hedge accounting has increased.
This has led to a reduction in the coverage levels initially placed up to 21 months in advance, but with coverage levels being increased nearer to the forecast transaction date.
Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Diageo expects hedges entered into to continue to be highly effective and therefore does not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the income statement to be material.
Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing long term fixed rate bonds, medium term notes and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate swaps.
The profile of fixed rate to floating rate net borrowings is targeted according to a duration measure that is equivalent to an approximate 50% fixed and 50% floating amortising profile.
The number of years within the amortising profile depends on a template approved by the board.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the groups reported financial performance.
Following the implementation of IAS 39 from 1 July 2005 the majority of Diageos existing interest rate hedges are designated as hedges under IAS 39.
Designated hedges are expected to be highly effective, and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on the income statement is not expected to be material.
Liquidity risk The groups policy with regard to the expected maturity profile of group financing companies borrowings is to limit the proportion of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
Credit risk The group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure that they are within board approved limits and that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The counterparties to the financial instruments transacted by the group are major international financial institutions.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long term credit rating of A or better.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
Commodity price risk The group uses commodity futures and options to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity futures and options contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures or options are then either closed out at the time the raw material is purchased or they are exchanged with the company manufacturing the raw material to determine the contract price.
Commodity contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value and to the extent that they are considered as an effective hedge under IAS 39, fair value movements are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Gains and losses realised in the year in respect of open contracts at the balance sheet date were not significant.
Insurance The group purchases insurance for commercial or, where required, for legal or contractual reasons.
In addition, the group retains insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of mitigating these risks.
Market risk sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 sensitivity analysis The group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 30 June 2006, for each class of financial instrument with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Interest rate risks The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments.
Changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are recognised at their fair value.
Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and all interest rate hedges are expected to be highly effective.
Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
Under these assumptions, a 1% increase or decrease in market interest rates for all currencies in which the group had borrowings and derivative financial instruments at 30 June 2006 would increase or decrease profit before tax by approximately 15 million and equity by 6 million before tax.
Currency risks The currency risk sensitivity analysis is based on the assumption that all net investment and cash flow hedges are highly effective.
Under this assumption, with a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates, profit before tax would have decreased by 17 million or increased by 21 million, respectively, and equity before tax effects would have decreased by 543 million or increased by 444 million, respectively.
Other price risks As at 30 June 2006, hypothetical changes in other risk variables would not significantly affect the price of financial instruments at that date.
Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 41 Operating and financial review continued.......................................................................... Fair value sensitivity analysis The IFRS 7 sensitivity analysis has been prepared as at 30 June 2006 and expresses information about potential changes in earnings and equity based on the accounting policies applied by Diageo following the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1 July 2005.
It is not possible to provide information on the same basis for dates prior to the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
This fair value sensitivity analysis expresses information about changes in fair values of financial instruments for both 30 June 2006 and 2005 on a comparable basis.
For financial instruments held, the group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of the groups financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes in the fair values of borrowings and the associated derivative financial instruments are set out in the tables below.
The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
These are based on rates obtained from third parties.
The estimated changes in fair values for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease of 1% 100 basis points in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 30 June, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 30 June, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only as, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
Sensitivity analysis table at 30 June 2006 Fair value changes arising from: 1% fall in 10% Estimated interestweakening fair value rates in sterling million million million Borrowings 4,817 278 512 Interest rate contracts 51 35 6 Foreign exchange contracts: Transaction 27 117 Balance sheet translation 17 7 Other financial net liabilities 251 4 16 Sensitivity analysis table at 30 June 2005 Fair value changes arising from: 1% fall in 10% Estimated interest weakening fair value rates in sterling million million million Borrowings 4,746 161 505 Interest rate contracts 51 100 6 Foreign exchange contracts: Transaction 23 138 Balance sheet translation 38 57 Written call options re General Mills shares 8 1 Other financial net assets 530 4 66 At 30 June 2004, General Mills had call options to purchase 29 million of General Mills shares held by Diageo, subject to certain limitations.
On 4 October 2004, 4 million of the shares over which the options were exercisable were transferred to the groups UK pension fund, together with the relevant portion of the options.
The remaining 25 million call options had a strike price of $51.56 and an expiry date in October 2005.
The estimated fair value of the call options was derived using a Black Scholes model using market volatility, share price and interest rates as at 30 June 2005.
It was estimated that a 5% increase in the share price of General Mills would have increased the negative fair value by 9 million.
42 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... Critical accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Diageos accounting policies are set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report.
In applying these policies the directors are required to make estimates and subjective judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit for the year.
The directors base these on a combination of past experience and any other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The actual outcome could differ from those estimates.
Of Diageos accounting policies, the directors consider that policies in relation to the following areas are of greater complexity and or particularly subject to the exercise of judgement.
Brands, goodwill and other intangibles Acquired brands are held on the consolidated balance sheet at cost.
Where brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.
Assessment of the useful economic life of an asset, or that an asset has an indefinite life, requires considerable management judgement.
Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that intangible assets, including brands, are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
In particular, the group performs a discounted cash flow analysis annually to compare discounted estimated future operating cash flows to the net carrying value of each acquired brand.
The analysis is based on forecast cash flows with terminal values being calculated using the long term growth rate the real GDP growth rate of the country plus its inflation rate of the principal countries in which the majority of the profits of each brand are generated.
The estimated cash flows are discounted at the groups weighted average cost of capital in the relevant country.
Any impairment write downs identified are charged to the income statement.
In assessing whether goodwill is carried at above its recoverable amount, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed annually to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash flows of cash generating units of the group to the net assets attributable to the cash generating units including goodwill.
The discounted cash flow review is consistent with the brand review in its use of estimated future operating cash flows, weighted average cost of capital for the cash generating unit concerned and long term growth rates.
The tests are dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, long term growth rates and the discount rate applied to these cash flows.
Post employment benefits Diageo accounts for post employment benefits in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits.
Application of IAS 19 requires the exercise of judgement in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises in excess of inflation, employee and pensioner demographics and the future expected returns on assets.
Diageo determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with its actuaries, and believes these assumptions to be in line with UK practice generally, but the application of different assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reflected in the income statement, statement of recognised income and expense and balance sheet in respect of post employment benefits.
The assumptions vary among the countries in which the group operates, and there may be an interdependency between some of the assumptions.
The major assumptions used by the group for the two years ended 30 June 2006 are set out in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
It would be impracticable to give the impact of the effect of changes in all of the assumptions used to calculate the post employment charges in the income statement, statement of recognised income and expense and balance sheet, but the following disclosures are provided to assist the reader in assessing the impact of changes in the more critical assumptions.
The finance income and charges included in the income statement for post employment benefits are partly calculated by assuming an estimated rate of return on the assets held by the post employment plans.
For the year ended 30 June 2006, this was based on the assumption that equities would outperform fixed interest government bonds by three and a quarter percentage points.
A one percentage point decrease in this assumption would have reduced profit before taxation by approximately 40 million.
The rates used to discount the liabilities of the post employment plans are determined by using rates of return on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the income statement charge in the year ended 30 June 2006 would have reduced profit before taxation by approximately 8 million.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the post employment liability at 30 June 2006 would have increased the liabilities before tax by approximately 400 million.
The net liability for post employment benefits is partly determined by the fair value at the end of the year of the assets owned by the post employment plans.
A 10% movement in worldwide equity values would increase decrease the net post employment liability before tax at 30 June 2006 by approximately 350 million.
The mortality assumptions used in the UK plan were reassessed in 2006 and are based on the recent mortality experience of the plan and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
For example, it is assumed that members who retire in 2026 at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater, the charge to profit before taxation would have increased by approximately 14 million and the net post employment liability before tax would have increased by approximately 180 million.
Exceptional items The group presents certain items separately as exceptional.
These are items which, in managements judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information.
The determination of which items are separately disclosed as exceptional items requires a significant degree of judgement.
Exceptional items, as reported, do not represent extraordinary items under US GAAP.
Taxation The group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included within the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
The group operates in many countries in the world and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules.
As a consequence the group is subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Management judgement is required to determine the total provision for income tax.
Amounts accrued are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
However the actual tax liabilities could differ from the provision and in such event the group would be required to make an adjustment in a subsequent period which could have a material impact on the groups profit and loss and or cash position.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
Any interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realised in the future.
This evaluation requires judgements to be made including the forecast of future taxable income.
Differences between IFRS and US GAAP From 1 July 2004, Diageo has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS which differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards permits certain optional exemptions from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies and the options adopted by Diageo are summarised below together with an indication as to their impacts.
Business combinations Business combinations prior to the date of transition have not been restated on an IFRS basis.
There are two main impacts of this approach.
The merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group in the groups primary financial statements has been accounted for under merger accounting principles pooling of interests, where the results, cash flows and balance sheets of both entities, having made adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, were aggregated with no adjustment to fair value.
Under purchase accounting, the merger would have been accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet.
Under this scenario, the group would have recognised additional intangible assets relating mainly to the fair value on acquisition of acquired brands and an adjustment upwards to the fair value of inventories.
These adjustments would have been offset by the recognition of related deferred tax liabilities.
Goodwill would have arisen on the acquisition.
The recognition of intangible assets and higher inventory values would have resulted in increased amortisation and an increase in the charge to cost of sales as the inventories are sold, net of effects of taxation.
Under US GAAP, the merger has been accounted for as a purchase accounting acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet.
The group has written off goodwill and other intangible assets acquired up to 30 June 1998, direct to reserves in the period when acquired.
Under IFRS 3 all separately identifiable intangible assets are required to be capitalised in the balance sheet, with subsequent annual impairment tests.
Under this scenario, net assets would increase in respect of the goodwill capitalised with no change to net income in the year ended 30 June 2006 or the comparative year.
Under US GAAP, the goodwill was capitalised and further information in this respect can be found in the US GAAP financial information in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
Cumulative translation differences The cumulative translation difference arising on consolidation has been deemed to be zero at the date of transition.
Share-based payments Full retrospective application has been adopted.
This option is available to the group because the fair value of applicable equity instruments granted was previously disclosed.
As a result, all years presented have a charge in respect of share-based payments on the basis of full retrospective application.
Financial instruments The group has adopted the provisions of IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement from 1 July 2005.
Financial instruments in the year ended 30 June 2005 remain recorded in accordance with previous UK GAAP accounting policies, and the adjustment to IAS 39 is reflected in the balance sheet at 1 July 2005.
Under IFRS, prior to the adoption of IAS 39 on 1 July 2005, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and derivatives hedging forecast transactions were not recognised until realised.
Since 1 July 2005, all such derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, prior to 1 July 2005, for derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations in respect of foreign exchange differences arising on translation to closing rates, changes in their fair value were taken to the statement of recognised income and expense.
The impact on net income for the year ended 30 June 2005 cannot be estimated reliably.
The impact on net assets at 1 July 2005 was to increase net assets by 164 million.
Reconciliations between IFRS and US GAAP, and details of the impact of the differences between IFRS and US GAAP, are set out in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
Those that are of relevance to the group are discussed below: IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease In December 2004, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued IFRIC 4, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
The interpretation requires arrangements which may have the nature, but not the legal form, of a lease to be accounted for in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
This interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies In November 2005, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 7, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006.
The interpretation provides guidance on how to apply the requirements of IAS 29 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies in a reporting period in which an entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the economy of its functional currency, when that economy was not hyperinflationary in the prior period, and the entity therefore restates its financial statements in accordance with IAS 29.
The group will apply the guidance of the IFRIC as and when it is appropriate to do so.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 In January 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 8, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
IFRS 2 applies to the provision of goods or services as well as shares as consideration for equity instruments in the issuing entity.
These goods or services should be measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share based payments at the grant date unless cash in which case liability should be re-measured at reporting date.
If not possible to specifically identify goods received, fair value of equity instruments granted should be used.
The issue addressed in the interpretation is whether IFRS 2 applies to transactions in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives In March 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 9, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006.
IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement requires an entity to assess whether any embedded derivatives contained in a contract need to be separated and fair valued.
IFRIC 9 requires this assessment to be carried out only when the entity first enters into the contract and not to be reassessed subsequently unless there is a change in terms in the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows.
IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment In July 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 10 which is effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
The interpretation addresses the interaction between the requirements of IAS 34 Interim reporting and the recognition of impairment losses on goodwill in IAS 36 and certain financial assets in IAS 39, and the effect of that interaction on subsequent interim and annual financial statements.
The group will apply the interpretation of the IFRIC in respect of future interim reporting periods.
The following US GAAP standards and pronouncements have recently been issued: SFAS No.
154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
This statement replaces APB Opinion No.
20 Accounting Changes APB 20 and SFAS No.
3 Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
