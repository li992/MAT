Galiform Annual Report 2006 21 Financial Review continued Operating review Howden Joinery Howden Joinery sells kitchens and joinery products to the building trade, predominantly small local builders, via a nationwide network of depots.

9.2m Gross margin rose by 110 basis points.
Excluding the impact of costs directly associated with the higher sales, operating costs rose by 23.1m.
This was primarily due to employee costs increasing by 9.4m and rent and rates rising by 5.2m: 4.2m and 2.1m respectively of these costs related to new depots openings.
Accordingly, operating profit 2005 2006 before exceptional items rose by 9.2m to 132.6m graph 2.
As planned, 40 new depots were opened during 2006, across all parts of Great Howden Joinery operating performance Britain, bringing the total number to 382 at the end of the year.
In addition, one existing depot was relocated and 11 were extended.
A more extensive range of doors was introduced during the autumn, which was showcased in a new joinery catalogue: and the introduction of a range of Bosch cooking appliances has been completed.
The business also introduced a range of Inclusive kitchens for people with specific physical needs at the beginning of 2007.
To help builders who may be unfamiliar with such kitchens, an assembly and installation guide has also been produced.
Supply Supply sources products for Howden Joinery and, following the disposal of Hygena Cuisines and MFI Retail in 2006, these businesses on an interim basis.
The products are either manufactured, in the case of kitchen cabinets and worktops, or sourced from third parties by Supply.
External turnover of Supply was 50.8m 2005: 3.1m, reflecting sales to MFI Retail and Hygena Cuisines since their respective disposals.
Supply acts as a cost centre and its net costs before exceptional items decreased Cost of supply reduced from 48.8m to 39.6m to 39.6m in 2006 2005: 48.8m.
This reflected the lower costs associated with the move in the first half of the year from manufacturing to buying-in fascias and ownbrand appliances: this being the first part of the drive to bring a new commercial focus to Supply.
Supply continues to be focused on the development of an efficient, cost-effective and appropriately scaled business that provides critical support to Howden Joinery.
The transition away from MFI Retail will remove a large degree of the complexity that currently exists within the Group.

We have chosen a transition date to IFRS of 26 December 2004, which means we have comparable data under IFRS for both 2005 and 2006 displayed in our financial statements.
This has resulted in changes to the format of presentation but has had no impact on the cash resources available to the Group.
A full list of IFRS accounting policies can be found in note 2 to our accounts.
There are a number of relatively minor statutory presentation and disclosure changes under IFRS which are treated consistently across our 2006 actual IFRS reported numbers and our 2005 restated comparatives.
The total impact of these changes on previously reported profits can be seen in note 33 to our accounts.
Managing our commercial risks Defined benefit pension scheme Accounting for pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves judgement about uncertain events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels, mortality rates, rates of return on scheme assets and determination of discount rates for measuring plan obligations.
The assumptions used from year to year may vary, which will affect future results of operations.
Any difference between these assumptions and the actual outcome also affect future results of operations.
Pension assumptions are discussed and agreed with the independent actuaries in December each year.
These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the liability or asset recorded on the Groups balance sheet.
The assumptions for 2006 are disclosed in note 23 to our accounts, along with the year-end deficits in our defined benefit schemes.
We recognise actuarial gains and losses arising when assumptions diverge from reality through the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
Our charge to profit in respect of pensions under IAS 19 amounted to 25.9m in 2006 2005: 33.1m of which a charge of 20.9m 2005: 23.9m was reported in operating profit and the net finance charge of 5.0m 2005: 9.2m was reported against interest.
Graph 3: Our total gross deficit for retirement benefits was 189.2m Pension scheme deficit at 31 December 2006 2005: 297.1m, a reduction of 107.9m over the year as a result of good investment performance and Change the change of the final salary defined benefit scheme to a career 108m average salary defined benefit scheme in September 2006 see graph 3.
As part of the new secured lending facilities announced on 17 February 2006, the Company and the Trustees together with The Pensions Regulator reached agreement with regard to the Dec 05 Dec 06 funding of the remaining deficit.
It is intended to clear it over a IAS 19 basis April 2005 actuarial valuation 182m period of 10 years.
The Trustees have been granted security over the Groups shares in Howden Joinery Limited.
An amount of 28m per year has been included within the budgeted 2007 cash flows for ongoing pension costs and clearance of the deficit over ten years.

Exposure to potential claims under the warranties: ii.
Terms of supply agreement with Supply: iii.
Failure to make overhead reductions: iv.
Contingent liabilities in relation to retail leases guaranteed by the Group: and v. Terms of transitional services provided pursuant to the ancillary agreements.
Failure to implement the Howdens strategy The future success of the Howdens business depends on the successful implementation of the Companys strategy for that business.
In particular, if the Our aim is to grow the Howden Joinery business and reduce the Group fails to expand the Howdens business in the manner contemplated or fails cost of supply to develop a streamlined supply function for Howdens, there may be an adverse effect on the Groups future financial condition and results of operations.
Single manufacturing facility The Group manufactures rigid cabinets and other products, comprising a significant proportion of its annual sales value, at a single manufacturing facility.
If manufacturing at this facility is interrupted or terminated, the Group might not be able to locate alternative manufacturing sources on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms.
The Group currently has insurance cover at levels which the Group believes are appropriate to mitigate this risk.
Product design leadership If there was a misalignment between the products we offer and the requirements of our customers and the current trends in the market, there may be an adverse change to the Groups future financial condition and results of operations.
Active engagement with suppliers, independent research and, critically, depot managers and their designers encourages and enables product development activity.
Loss of key personnel The Groups success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of some key members of its management.
The loss of any key members of the Groups management may adversely affect the Groups financial condition and result of operations.
The Group utilises the remuneration committee to ensure that team members are appropriately compensated for their roles.
Managing our financial risks The Group holds financial instruments for two principal purposes: to finance its operations and to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from its operations and its sources of finance.
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of cash flows from operations and longer term loans from banks.
Treasury operations are managed within policies and procedures approved by the Board.
24 Galiform Annual Report 2006 The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are funding and liquidity risk, interest rate risk, counterparty risk and foreign currency risk.
Where appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments to manage these risks.
No speculative use of derivatives, currency or other instruments is permitted.
The Treasury function does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
Funding and liquidity The Groups objective is to procure continuity of funding at a reasonable cost.
To do this it seeks to arrange committed funding.
The Group has a 175m secured facility with a maturity date of May 2009.
This has been negotiated with the approval of The Pensions Regulator.
At 30 December 2006 the Group had net borrowings of 7.2m 2005: net Net debt reduced from 55.5m to 4.1m borrowings of 61.0m.
This shows a reduction of net borrowings of 53.8m during the year.
In addition the Group held 3.1m 2005: 5.5m on short-term deposit, held in escrow for future insurance claims.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings is managed when necessary by borrowings on a fixed rate basis by entering into rate swaps, rate caps and forward rate agreements.
The Groups policy objective has been to only undertake transactions of this nature when net debt exceeds 150m.
Net debt has not exceeded 150m during the year.
Counterparty risk Group Treasury policy on investment restricts counterparties to those with a minimum Standard & Poors Moodys long-term credit rating of AA and a short-term credit rating of A1 P1.
Investments mainly consist of bank deposits and certificates of deposit.
The Group continuously reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the limits placed on individual credit exposures and categories of investments.
Foreign currency risk The most significant currencies for the Group are the US dollar and the Euro.
It has become very difficult to pass the prescribed tests under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to ensure the ability to hedge account for derivative currency transactions through the profit and loss account.
As the resultant volatility cannot be avoided in the profit and loss account, it is the view of the Board that routine transactional conversions between currencies are completed at the relevant spot exchange rate.
This policy is reviewed on a regular basis.
