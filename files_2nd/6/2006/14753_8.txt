Analysis of results The commentary on performance below relates solely to our continuing business and comparatives have been restated to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation to aid understanding.
Sales Sales of our total continuing business were 450.6 million, 4.6 per cent ahead of last year after excluding favourable foreign currency movements.
Sales of our branded consumer business comprising Durex, Scholl footcare, Scholl footwear and locally owned brands were 397.8 million, representing growth of 5.5 per cent against last year.
Sales are analysed in the table below.
Durex Durex sales were 162.3 million, 9.2 per cent ahead of last year on an underlying basis.
Global market share is in excess of 30 per cent with significant growth particularly in the Eastern European markets and the USA.
Our positioning of Durex to provide not only safe sex, but also to help people have better sex has been a key driver of sales growth as we have evolved our product offering into three clearly defined groups condoms, lubricants and devices all under the Durex banner.
Condoms continue to be the largest product group, representing over 90 per cent of Durex sales.
Our latest condoms clearly reflect the brand positioning and include Pleasuremax with combined ribs and dots and Tingle which provides a novel sensation.

SSL International plc Annual Report and Accounts Financial Review 2006 The Durex Play range of personal lubricants and devices has been particularly successful, with sales of 12.2 million in the year.
One of our notable successes was the wide distribution and consumer acceptance of Play Vibrations, an innovative vibrating ring launched during the year.
Scholl footcare Sales of Scholl footcare grew over 11 per cent to 95.8 million on an underlying basis.
The most recent market data indicates that Scholl footcare has around a quarter of the global footcare market.
The launch of Scholl Party Feet in Continental Europe in the first half of the year has been a driver of sales growth.
However, we have also seen a pleasing performance from new product introductions such as Cracked Heel Cream, Moisturising Foot Cream Mousse and Freeze Verruca & Wart Remover.
Scholl footwear Underlying sales of Scholl footwear declined by 3.2 per cent to 66.3 million driven by the decline in autumn winter sales we reported for the first half of the year.
However, in the important second half, sales of our spring summer range increased to 38.3 million, almost 2 per cent ahead of last year.
Our strategy for footwear is to ensure that we provide well-designed, stylish shoes that take care of feet whilst extending distribution beyond our traditional channel of pharmacy into high street footwear retailers.
Locally owned brands Sales from our portfolio of locally owned brands were 73.4 million, marginally lower than last year as a result of the flat retail environment in the UK, as we reported in the first half.
However, this decline was offset by a strong performance from Mister Baby a range of mother and baby products in Italy following a product range overhaul and an effective TV campaign.
Other sales Sales of our other consumer products were 40.2 million, 9.3 per cent below last year, on an underlying basis, as a result of lower sales of our low margin unbranded condom business.
Sales under contract manufacturing arrangements increased by 3 million to 12.6 million.
24 25 SSL International plc Annual Report and Accounts Financial Review 2006 Gross margin The gross margin for the Group was in line with last year at 61 per cent.
We continually challenge our product sourcing to help us achieve a consistently high level of customer service at the lowest overall cost to the business.
Last year we announced the transfer of the Scholl footcare packing operations from Derby, UK to our joint venture in India and this is now close to completion.
Market development expenditure The Group spent 69.2 million on market development.
This is an increase of 3 million which reflects our commitment to investing in advertising our consumer brands.

Selling, General & Administration Costs SG&A SG&A costs were 128.8 million, lower than last year 2005: 129.3 million.

Financing costs and taxation Total interest cost for the year was 13.4 million 2005: 13.3 million.

The impact of reflecting accounting changes relating to IAS 19 Employee Benefits has increased the interest charge by 3.4 million 2005: 2.7 million.
The introduction for the first time of IAS 39 Financial Instruments resulted in a non-cash charge of 2.1 million 2005: nil reflecting the divergence of the US$ bond yield during the year.
The tax charge of 9.7 million represents a tax rate of 28.9 per cent of operating profit pre-associate income 2005: 29.2 per cent.
SSL International plc Annual Report and Accounts Financial Review 2006 Earnings and Financial Condition Profit after tax and minority interests was 24.2 million 2005: 23.9 million which generated basic earnings per share of 12.8 pence 2005: 9.5 pence.

Cash outflows from restructuring of 7.3 million 2005: cash inflows of 14.6 million result in cash generated from the operations of 33.3 million 2005: 27.1 million.
Litigation This is detailed in note 27 on page 77.
Capital structure and treasury policy International Accounting Standards 32 and 39 IAS 32 and 39 requires that certain disclosures relating to financial instruments are given in the financial statements, in order to provide information on the impact of such instruments on the Groups risk profile, how this may affect the Groups performance and financial position, and how those risks are managed.
The impact of those financial instruments is considered in note 24.
Foreign exchange risk objective The nature of the Groups trading activities generates transactional foreign exchange rate risks.
These arise from the sourcing of raw materials from different countries, the location of Group production facilities throughout the world and the sale and distribution of finished goods in many locations.
The objective of the Groups foreign exchange policy is to minimise the trade exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the overseas entities and manage the risk from the centre.
This requires that all trading-related exposures should be centralised in accordance with prescribed procedures and timetables under the direction of the Group Treasury Function, which hedges the major exposures using forward contracts and options, usually up to a period of 12 months.
Interest rate exposure objective The interest rate risk management policy aims to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Groups net interest expense to acceptable levels.
This is achieved through balancing the ratio of fixed or hedged debt to those financial liabilities with floating interest rates.
Board approved instruments available to hedge this exposure include interest rate swaps, interest rate options and forward rate agreements.
Details of the interest rate analysis are given in note 24.
Liquidity risk The primary objective of the Group Treasury Policy is to ensure that the Group is able at all times to meet its financial commitments as they fall due.
To facilitate this, the Group Treasury department is responsible for the management of cash and liquid resources for the whole Group, and ensures that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet any reasonable change in funding requirements.
The Groups liquidity as defined as the aggregate of the Groups cash, liquid resources and central undrawn committed facilities as at 31 March 2006, amounted to 61.0 million.
