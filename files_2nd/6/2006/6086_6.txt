Financial review Overview Group turnover from continuing activities during the period was 1,273.4 million 2005: 1,118.8 million.
This increase in turnover comprised a sales increase from trading of 125.8 million assisted by a favourable currency translation effect of 28.8 million.
Operating profit before special items increased to 100.0 million 2005: 91.6 million.
After adjusting for the favourable foreign exchange impact of 3.0 million, operating profit before special items grew by 5.9%.
Special items amounting to a loss of 0.4 million 2005: a loss of 8.5 million included a 4.1 million profit, before taxation and finance costs, on the sale of a number of surplus properties, offset by a 4.3 million loss on the sale of White Systems, a small unintegrated Neil Bamford Finance Director part of North American FKI Logistex activities.
Profit from continuing operations before taxation increased by 19.9% to 99.6 million 2005: 83.1 million.
Net finance costs were 29.4 million 2005: 25.1 million.
The increase over the corresponding period last year is principally a result of a rise in short-term US interest rates.
The effect of these increases was partially offset by a reduction of 0.6 million in net finance costs on pension schemes and fair value gains on financial instruments of 0.9 million.
For comparative purposes, underlying operating profit, based on operating profit before special items after adjusting for the pre-tax trading impact of discontinued operations, rose by 14.2% from 94.6 million to 108.0 million.
The profit for the year from discontinued operations of 41.3 million 2005 loss: 84.2 million comprised a 36.9 million net profit on the sale of businesses plus profits after taxation of 4.4 million generated up to the dates each disposal occurred.
The principal contributory transaction was the sale of Bristol Babcock with figures of 39.9 million and 5.6 million respectively.
16 FKI plc Operating and financial review Impact of exchange rates With 74% of FKIs continuing turnover originating from outside the UK, the Groups results are sensitive to changes in exchange rates.
Trading results and cash flow of overseas operations have been converted into sterling at average rates of exchange whilst balance sheets are converted at year end rates.
The most significant rates for the Group were as follows: 2006 2005 At Average At Average 31 March rates of 31 March rates of 2006 exchange 2005 exchange to 1 to 1 to 1 to 1 US dollar 1.73 1.78 1.89 1.85 Canadian dollar 2.02 2.11 2.29 2.36 1,273m Euro 1.43 1.46 1.45 1.46 Turnover 2005: 1,118.8m Danish krone 10.70 10.91 10.83 10.90 The average exchange rate of the US dollar to sterling strengthened by 3.8% compared with last year which primarily affected the Hardware division, whose operations are in the US, and Lifting Products and Services whose US operations are particularly successful and have a significant exposure to energy markets.
Underlying Operating Turnover profit increase increase Currency effect on results m m FKI Logistex 10.1 0.3 Lifting Products and Services 10.5 1.6 Hardware 7.9 1.2 Energy Technology 0.3 Discontinued 2.1 0.5 Head Office 0.1 30.9 3.5 17 FKI plc Operating and financial review Interest The Groups net finance cost increased to 29.4 million 2005: 25.1 million as a result of higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of the Groups debt and currency translation effects.
These net finance costs primarily consist of 29.1 million 2005: 23.3 million of net interest costs arising on the Groups net debt.
The remaining cost of 0.3 million 2005: 1.8 million consists of net pension scheme interest of 1.2 million 2005: 1.8 million offset by other financing net gains of 0.9 million 2005: nil being mainly net gains and losses on foreign exchange and fair values of financial instruments.
On a pre-IFRS basis consistent with the Groups loan covenants, the net interest expense was 3.8 times covered 2005: 4.1 times by profit before interest, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, and represented a rate of 6.6% 2005: 5.2% on the years average weekly net debt, measured before IFRS adjustments, of 443 million 2005: 448 million.
IFRS reporting adjustments increased the years average net debt from 443 million to 481 million.
Taxation The Groups effective tax charge on profits from continuing operations after net finance costs was 25.2% 2005: 24.8%.
A reconciliation of the actual total tax charge to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% is set out in note 13 to the financial statements.
Return on invested capital The Return on Invested Capital, rebased for the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards and calculated as profit after tax from continuing and discontinued operations before exceptional items, interest and finance charges, divided by the average of opening and closing shareholders equity, net debt and previously written off goodwill, was 8.4% 2005 restated: 7.1%.
Earnings per share and dividends The profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company amounted to 93.8 million 2005: loss of 40.6 million, and basic profit per share 9.7p was 16.1p 2005: basic loss per share 7.0p.
Adjusted earnings per share of 9.7p 2005: 8.9p is calculated by dividing the operating profit loss for Adjusted earnings per share 2005: 8.9p the period, before special items, profit loss on disposal of discontinued operations, fair value gains losses on financial instruments and exchange gains losses included within net finance costs and income and taxation related to those items by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Reflecting the Groups underlying performance, the Board has proposed to pay a final dividend for the year of 3.0p per share which, with the interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share paid on 24 February 2006, brings the total dividends for the year to 4.5p per share, the same level as last year.
The total paid out to shareholders in respect of these dividends will amount to 26.3 million.
18 FKI plc Operating and financial review Net debt and cash flow Reported net debt at 31 March 2006 was 304.7 million, a reduction since March 2005 of 46.0 million.
This represented a gross reduction 69.3m of 110.6 million offset by increases of 40.3 million resulting from the Net operating cash flow adoption of IAS 32 and 39 and 24.3 million from the effect of adverse 2005: 26.0m exchange translation.
Net operating cash flow in the period after interest and taxation payments was 69.3 million 2005: 26.0 million which included a 10.0 million outflow in respect of the run down of the Wind Turbine business prior to sale.
Capital expenditure was 26.2 million representing 84% of depreciation and amortisation charges.
There was a cash outflow of 12.5 million relating to termination and closure costs of businesses.
Disposals During the year the Group disposed of 5 businesses, the proceeds of which amounted to 83.1 million net of cash disposed of with the operations.
The principal transactions in the year were: Sale of Laurence Scott and Electromotors on 25 April 2005 Sale of Certex European operations on 14 June 2005 Sale of Wind Turbine business on 5 July 2005 Sale of Bristol Babcock on 17 March 2006 Financing The Group is financed by a mix of equity, retained earnings, a eurobond, US private placement loan notes and a syndicated bank facility.
Funding for operating subsidiaries, apart from small local overdraft facilities, is raised centrally and lent internally on commercial terms.
Gross debt, inclusive of derivative financial assets and liabilities, at the year end amounted to 541.8 million and 78% of the Groups committed borrowing facilities of 692 million were drawn.
These committed borrowing facilities are available for 3.4 years on average.
19 FKI plc Operating and financial review The Groups net debt included 1.4 million of debt 2005: 6.5 million of net cash in respect of businesses classified as held for sale.
304.7m The N600 million eurobond, which matures in February 2010, is carried Net debt 2005: 350m at a value of 442.2 million 2005: 354.7million.
The reason for the increased carrying value of the eurobond is primarily due to the recognition of 25.8 million 2005: nil of IFRS valuation adjustments and the 2006 transition to reporting cross-currency swaps as derivative financial instruments rather than netting against the value of the eurobond.
US$173.5 million is drawn under a series of US private placements issued in 1994, 1996 and 1997 with maturities ranging between 2006 and 2016.
Surplus cash was applied to redeeming US$10 million of US private placements that matured during the year and a further US$66 million that matured immediately after the year end.
At the year-end the 150 million syndicated bank facility, which matures in July 2007 and is primarily used to fund working capital requirements, was undrawn 2005: 47.7 million drawn.
The fixed rate eurobond and US private placements are substantially swapped into floating rate obligations and other currencies.
These swaps maintain approximately three-quarters of gross borrowings at floating rates and one-quarter at fixed rates.
The cross-currency swaps provide a partial hedge of the foreign exchange exposures described below under Financial risk management.
Floating rate borrowings are principally linked to LIBOR for periods of between one and six months.
Year-end cash and marketable securities and deposits totalled 237.1 million 2005: 155.9 million.
41.1 million 2005: 39.8 million of cash and deposits are held and managed by the Groups captive insurance company in Guernsey.
The adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 April 2005, without the requirement to restate the year to 31 March 2005, means that it is more meaningful to compare the net debt shown in the balance sheet at 31 March 2006 with that at 1 April 2005 rather than 31 March 2005.
20 FKI plc Operating and financial review The reporting of net debt under IFRS includes certain financial derivatives and other debt valuation adjustments.
These changes are illustrated below.
31 March 1 April 2006 2005 m m Net borrowings 270.1 405.2 Derivative financial instruments Cross-currency swaps 19.2 54.5 Interest rate swaps 9.9 3.3 Other foreign exchange 0.5 Eurobond fair valuation adjustments 25.8 43.6 Reported net debt 304.7 391.0 Derivative financial instruments comprise instruments relating to net borrowings eg cross-currency and interest rate swaps and those related to other business transactions eg forward foreign exchange deals.
All these instruments are required, with effect from 1 April 2005, under IAS 32 and IAS 39, to be reflected on the balance sheet, as illustrated above.
The reduction in cross-currency swaps can be mainly attributed to the strengthening US dollar and resetting the exchange rate on a swap.
Financial risk management FKIs financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
Derivative and other financial instruments are used to manage trading exposures, liabilities and assets under parameters laid down by the Board.
The Groups major hedging activities are to mitigate the following risks: i Currency transaction risks for trading exposures denominated in other currencies.
ii Fair value and cash flow interest rate risks associated with the Eurobond.
iii Currency translation risks of net assets in overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has not used derivative financial instruments for purposes other than for hedging its exposures.
21 FKI plc Operating and financial review The Group adopted accounting standard IAS 39 on 1 April 2005, resulting in the recognition at fair value of all derivative financial instruments previously held off balance sheet under UK GAAP.
To avoid income statement volatility, and where such benefits outweigh the costs of compliance, the Group has designated many of its economic hedges as hedging instruments under IAS 39.
However, for certain effective economic hedging relationships such hedge accounting treatment is not permitted under IFRS.
Where hedge accounting is not achieved, fair value movements on derivatives are recorded in the consolidated income statement which could give rise to earnings volatility.
In 2006, this resulted in a net gain of under 1 million.
It is the Groups policy to maintain a range of maturity dates for its borrowings, and to refinance them at the appropriate time so as to reduce refinancing risk.
The treasury function provides the Group with cash and risk management services by investing surplus funds and managing and reducing financial risks purely in relation to underlying trading transactions.
It does not operate as a profit centre and no speculative transactions are permitted.
Counterparty credit limits are established for all banks used by the Group, taking account of the credit standing of each bank.
A large proportion of the Groups trading is carried out within the domestic territory of each business unit.
Consequently, foreign exchange transaction exposures, which arise when sales and purchases are made by a business unit in a currency other than its own functional currency, are generally not significant.
The Groups policy is to hedge using forward foreign exchange contracts as soon as commitment has been given to the underlying transaction.
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange for the period concerned.
As this translation has no impact on cash flow, the Group chooses not to hedge its foreign subsidiaries earnings, other than any dividends which are dealt with as transaction exposures.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing exchange rates.
Any gains or losses on the translation of these balance sheets into sterling are recorded in reserves against the gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings that are effective as net investment hedges.
22 FKI plc Operating and financial review The Groups net assets and net debt by currency at 31 March 2006 are shown in the table below: Net assets Net Net liabilities deposits assets before debt liabilities financing mmm Currency Sterling 25.0 49.5 24.5 US dollar 315.5 187.4 128.1 Canadian dollar 40.1 15.7 24.4 Euro 102.0 70.6 31.4 Danish krone 91.4 92.0 0.6 Other currencies 42.7 11.5 54.2 Total 566.7 304.7 262.0 Pensions The Groups IAS 19 aggregate pensions deficit in respect of all pension and post retirement plans decreased to 156.0 million as of 31 March 2006 from 177.2 million a year earlier.
The most significant element of this deficit relates to the Groups main UK scheme which has decreased from 130.3 million to 110.7 million as of 31 March 2006.
The valuation of this deficit is based on the full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2002, updated at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries, and is consistent with the preliminary valuation results of the full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2005.
The aggregate deficit net of associated deferred tax assets has reduced from 121.9 million to 107.0 million.
As part of the triennial funding review and in line with the ongoing strategy of reducing the pensions deficit, the Company is in active discussions with the trustees regarding contributing surplus properties to the fund as part of its ongoing strategy of reducing the pension deficit.
23 FKI plc Operating and financial review International Financial Reporting Standards International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS were adopted by FKI with effect from 1 April 2004.
Adoption included the restatement of the 2004 05 results, the balance sheet at 1 April 2004, the balance sheet at 30 September 2004, the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 and further adjustments to the balance sheet at 1 April 2005 to reflect the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 increased the valuation of reported net debt at 1 April 2005 by 40.3 million.
In accordance with IFRS, the carrying value of the fixed-rate Eurobond was increased by 35.7 million, representing the gain realised in closing out interest rate hedging instruments: this gain was previously recorded under UK GAAP as part of creditors.
The remaining 4.6 million relates to other adjustments arising from the recognition of the fair value of the underlying Eurobond debt and other financial instruments.
There is no cash impact in connection with this restatement.
The 40.3 million is substantially a fair value adjustment that reverses fully by 31 March 2010.
Risks and Uncertainties The Group has adopted a standard process for the identification, assessment, treatment, monitoring and reporting of risk.
This process helps support business objectives by linking into business strategy, identifying and reacting to emerging risks and developing cost effective solutions to risk exposures.
A detailed description of the Groups risk management process is included within the Corporate Governance Report on pages 37 to 39 of the Annual Report.
The Groups financial risk management practices are discussed earlier in the report on pages 21 and 22 and in note 28 to the accounts.
Some 56% of continuing sales are to customers in North America and the Group is therefore particularly affected by economic conditions in North America.
However, the diverse nature of the Groups products, services and customers help mitigate the effects of changes in political and economic risk on the demand that the Group experiences.
24 FKI plc Operating and financial review The Groups products and manufacturing processes require a variety of raw materials including steel, copper and zinc.
Any increase or volatility in the price of these commodities and energy together with shortages in supply can affect the Groups performance.
The diversity of operations both in terms of product area and geography reduces the dependence on any single item and supplier.
Purchasing policies and practices take into account and seek to mitigate such risks where practicable.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes as detailed in note 33 to the accounts, the most significant of which is the main UK scheme which had a pre-tax deficit of 110.7 million at 31 March 2006.
The funding of that scheme is 65% by long dated bonds and 35% by equities.
The Group is exposed to various funding risks principally increased longevity of members and poor performance of equity investments which could result in increased cash contributions by the Group to the schemes.
In addition to the above the Groups involvement and operating in global markets creates an exposure to other risk factors that are both external and internal to the Group.
These risks include but are not limited to failure to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements including environmental and litigation risk, equipment failures, business continuity and the actions of customers and competitors.
The Group has, as previously described, implemented risk controls and loss mitigation plans but cannot give absolute assurance that such procedures will be effective in identifying or controlling each of the operational risks faced by the Group.
Neil Bamford Finance Director NB The Business Review and Finance Review comprise the Groups compliance with s243ZZB of the Companies Act.
