Asia UK 5% 42% France 31% Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 25 Treasury risk management Kingfishers Treasury function has primary responsibility for managing certain financial risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Board reviews the levels of exposure regularly and approves Treasury policies covering the use of financial instruments required to manage these risks.
Liquidity risk Treasury manages the Groups exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives and by promoting a diversity of funding sources and debt maturities.
Credit risk Credit risk of third parties that the Group deals with is managed by setting a credit limit using published credit ratings.
The exposure against this limit is determined by taking account of the full value of deposits and a proportion of the value of derivative contracts.
Interest rate risk The Group manages its interest rate risk by entering into certain interest rate derivative contracts which modify the interest rate payable on the Groups underlying debt instruments, principally the Medium Term Notes.
Currency risk The Groups principal currency exposures are to the euro, the US dollar and the Chinese Renminbi.
The euro exposure is operational and arises through the ownership of the retail businesses in France, Italy, Ireland and Spain.
Balance sheet euro translation exposure is substantially hedged by maintaining a proportion of the Groups debt in euro.
Following the acquisition of the OBI China business, the Groups exposure to the Chinese Renminbi has increased significantly.
This balance sheet translation exposure is partly hedged by local debt in China and partly by forward foreign exchange contracts entered into to hedge this exposure.
However, it is the Groups policy not to hedge the translation of overseas earnings primarily euro into Sterling.
In addition, the Group has a significant transaction exposure arising on the purchase of products for re-sale denominated in US dollars.
Under Group policies, the Group companies are required to hedge committed product purchases and a proportion of forecast product purchases arising in the next 12 months.
Use and fair value of financial instruments In the normal course of business the Group uses financial instruments including derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The main types of financial instruments used are Medium Term Notes, loans and deposits, interest rate derivative contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, spot and forward currency contracts, and currency options.
Further disclosure on derivative financial instruments is provided in note 24.
