Earnings per Share and Dividend Basic earnings per share was 0.7 pence per share compared with a 0.6 pence loss per share in the previous year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share which removes the effect of xed rental uplifts, intangible amortisation relating to the creation of 2entertain and exceptional items was 2.8 pence per share compared with 3.3 pence per share last year.
A final dividend of 1.34 pence per share has been recommended by the Board.

Adjusted profits from Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing increased to 56.4 million from 49.1 million.
This reects an increase in profits at Entertainment UK and from the shareholding in 2entertain, our joint venture with BBC Worldwide, along with a 5.1 million credit, predominantly from clearing old VCI accrual balances.
Cash Flow and Net Funds Net funds increased year-on-year by 32.2 million to 147.7 million.

Disposals On 30 July 2005 the Group disposed of its interest in MVC for 5.5 million, generating a loss on disposal before tax of 25.6 million.
This removed from the Group a loss-making business that faced many strategic challenges.
Pensions The Group retains a Final Salary Pension Scheme open to all employees who have been with the Group for a minimum period of 12 months.
The Scheme was created at the time of demerger and only comprised active members at that time.
It is therefore a much less mature scheme than most.
It has 6,051 active members, 3,046 deferred members but only 743 current pensioners and therefore the Scheme receives more in contributions from the Group and members than it pays out in pensions.
This is likely to continue to be the case for approximately 13 years.
The assets of the Scheme are managed by external Fund Managers and at 28 January 2006 were 285.9 million 2005: 223.3 million.
The allocation of Scheme assets is kept under regular review by the Trustees of the Scheme.
The liabilities calculated at the current low level of xed rate bond yields were 416.8 million 2005: 320.8 million giving an IAS 19 deficit of 91.6 million, net of tax relief.
However, the proportion of current active members and the timescales until pensions are due to be payable does not make the calculation particularly meaningful.

existing committed bank facilities increasing the amount committed to 250 million and extending the term.
The amended facilities are sufficient to renance the 100 million Bond due in November 2006 and to cover the Groups projected remaining liquidity requirements for the next four years.
Stephen East In addition to core nancing arrangements, the Treasury Finance Director function manages trade finance facilities to support the import 28 March 2006 of product and overdraft facilities associated with its day-to-day banking activities.
Currency The Groups main currency translation exposure is limited to movements in exchange rates to the extent that they affect balances held on its currency bank accounts and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities in the books of its Hong Kong-based product sourcing company, Woolworths Group Asia Limited.
Foreign currency bank balances are controlled by the Treasury function and are actively managed to a level that minimises currency translation exposures.
The Groups main currency exposure is its transaction exposure through movements in exchange rates on its purchases overseas that are not denominated in Sterling.
These are mainly imports from Asia denominated in US dollars and imports from Europe denominated in Euros.
The Treasury Policy sets out a framework through which the majority of the Groups forecasted foreign currency transactions are hedged.
Interest The Treasury Policy requires that an interest hedging plan for each year is approved by the Finance Director at the time of the annual budget.
The Treasury function is permitted to hedge in accordance with this plan using interest rate products such as swaps, options, forward rate agreements and futures.
The Group continues to take a reasonably cautious approach to hedging its interest expense.
The Group has swapped 30 per cent of its interest obligation under the 100 million bond which matures in November 2006, from xed to oating rate, to hedge its interest exposure.
The remaining 70 per cent is a straight xed rate obligation.
To date, the interest payable on drawings from the Groups Revolving Credit facility has been at oating rates driven by market conditions, the relatively short borrowing period that the Groups businesses require each year and the variation in amounts borrowed during the period.
Interest receivable on investments has also been at oating rates for short maturities given the seasonality of the Groups cash ows.
