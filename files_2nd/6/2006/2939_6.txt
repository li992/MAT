The increase of 36 million in intangible assets relating to the acquisition of Mowlem since the half-year 30 June 2006: 496 million is due entirely to the application of IAS 12 Income Taxes.

Under IAS 12, a deferred tax provision equal to 30 per cent of the value of assets to be amortised 35.7 million has been established with a corresponding increase in the total value of intangible assets.

Dividend payments in 2006 were 23.2 million and net corporate tax refunds of 1.7 million were received.
An important part of our strategy for Public Private Partnership PPP and large construction projects is the development of jointly controlled businesses that enable us to structure the resource and risk profiles of these activities to generate reliable returns.
In 2006, these businesses generated 528.5 million of revenue 2005: 258.7 million and 47.7 million of operating profit 2005: 20.3 million for Carillion.

Revenue in Construction Services increased by 55 per cent, due primarily to the acquisition of Mowlem.
Operating profit increased by 92 per cent and the operating margin increased from 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent.
Margins improved despite the effects of lower margins in the businesses acquired with Mowlem as these were more than offset by margin improvements in other businesses, both in the UK and our International Regions.
The approach Carillion takes to recognising profit on major construction contracts has been extended to the enlarged Group.
No profit is taken on the first 20 per cent of revenue on such contracts and this profit is deferred until contracts are completed.
On revenues between 20 per cent and 100 per cent, profit is recognised broadly in proportion to revenue after taking account of risks and uncertainties.
The effect of this approach in 2006 has been to reduce reported operating profit by a net 2.2 million 2005: 5.4 million, comprising 5.6 million of profit deferred and 3.4 million of profit released in respect of contracts completed successfully during the year.
Total deferred profit carried forward at 31 December was 10.9 million December 2005: 8.7 million.

Treasury policy and risk management.
The Group has a Chris Girling centralised Treasury function whose primary role is to manage Finance Director funding, liquidity and financial risks.
In addition, Treasury 7 March 2007 sources and administers contract bond and guarantee facilities for the Group.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
The Board sets policies within which Treasury operates that ensure the most effective financing of the Groups operations and limit exposure to financial risk.
The areas of significant financial risk facing the Group relate to funding and liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates.
The Groups policy is to avoid carrying significant net debt over the long term.
Carillion plcs principal borrowing facility is a syndicated loan facility led by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and short-term overdraft and money market facilities are provided by a group of relationship banks.
Finance and operating leases are also employed to fund longer-term assets.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is regularly reviewed and is designed to satisfy the requirements of the Groups business plan.
The Group hedges all significant currency transaction exposures using foreign exchange risk management techniques.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of exchange rate volatility, foreign currency net assets are hedged using matching currency loans, where these assets exceed the equivalent of 10 million.
Profits arising within overseas subsidiaries are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
