MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL Finance Directors Review Income statement Turnover 2006 was another successful year for the Group with all regions delivering strong growth.
Turnover for the year increased by 23.9% to 649.1m 2005: 523.8m.
Turnover from temporary placements increased by 17.1% to 372.7m 2005: 318.3m and represented 57.4% 2005: 60.8% of Group turnover.
Turnover from permanent placements was 276.3m 2005: 205.5m, an increase of 34.5%.
Gross profit Gross profit for the year increased by 30.4% to 348.8m 2005: 267.6m representing an overall gross margin of 53.7% 2005: 51.1%.
The percentage increase in gross profit is greater than the increase in turnover due primarily to the higher proportion of gross profit derived from permanent placements in 2006, together with a higher volume of temporary placements at a slightly higher gross margin.
Gross profit from temporary placements was 87.8m 2005: 72.6m and represented 25.2% 2005: 27.1% of Group gross profit.
The gross margin achieved on temporary placements was 23.6% 2005: 22.8%.
Operating profit As a result of the Groups organic growth strategy, tight control on costs and profit-based bonuses, we have a business which is operationally geared as evidenced by the 46.4% increase in operating profits from a 30.4% increase in gross profit.
This strategy means the Group incurs start-up costs and operating losses as investments are made to grow existing and new businesses, by opening new offices or launching in new countries.
The Chief Executives review describes a number of these investments including new businesses in Russia, Mexico, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Ireland.
As a result of the increased numbers of staff and offices, plus start-up costs and higher bonuses due to the increased profits, administrative expenses in the year increased by 25.1% to 251.5m 2005: 201.1m.
Administrative expenses also includes a 4.6m charge 2005: 2.9m in respect of executive share option schemes, the increase over the 2005 charge being largely due to the impact of employers social charges as a consequence of the 68% increase in the share price from 270p at the end of 2005 to 452.25p at the end of 2006.
22 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 The Groups largest category of expenditure, approximately 75%, is the remuneration of our consultants and support staff.
Headcount of the Group was 2,926 at 1 January 2006 and increased during the year by 28% to 3,758 consultants and support staff.
One of the anticipated benefits of the roll-out of our new recruitment system, which started in 2003 and was completed in 2005, was a reduction in the ratio of support staff to fee earners.
The proportion of support staff has reduced from 36% in 2003 to 26% in 2006.
Net interest While we started the year with net cash of 13.1m, there is a substantial cash outflow in January every year as fourth-quarter and annual bonuses are paid, and as the profits increased by 46% the bonuses have increased by a similar proportion.
We aim to manage the balance sheet with a broadly neutral cash debt position using surplus cash to repurchase shares and, as necessary, drawing on borrowing facilities.
As a consequence, a net interest charge similar to last year was incurred of 0.4m 2005: 0.4m.
Taxation Tax on profits was 31.5m 2005: 16.5m, representing an effective tax rate of 32.5% 2005: 25.0%.
The rate is higher than the UK Corporation Tax rate of 30% due to disallowable items of expenditure and profits being generated in countries where the corporate tax rates are higher than 30%.
The effective rate was lower in 2005 as a result of utilising and recognising tax losses incurred in earlier years.
Share repurchases and share options During the year, 23.3m shares were repurchased at an average price of 355.8p.
These shares have all been cancelled.
At the beginning of 2006, the Group had options outstanding over 38.1m shares, 21.2m of which were granted at the time of the IPO in 2001, the balance being accumulated by annual grants since 2001 with a further grant of 2.1m shares during the year under review.
In 2006, on achieving performance targets, 27.3m share options vested, including 15.9m of the IPO grant referred to above.
At 31 December 2006, option holders had exercised 23.9m of these share options.
At the end of 2006, 14.5m share options remain outstanding of which 3.5m have vested, but not yet been exercised by option holders.
23 MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL Earnings per share and dividends In 2006, basic earnings per share were 19.6p 2005: 14.8p and diluted earnings per share were 19.0p 2005: 14.4p.
The weighted average number of shares for the year was 334.7m 2005: 336.3m reflecting the impact of the shares repurchased during the year and the new shares issued to satisfy option exercises.
An increase in the final dividend to 4.2p 2005: 3.5p per ordinary share has been proposed which, together with the interim dividend of 1.8p 2005: 1.5p per ordinary share, makes a total dividend for the year of 6.0p 2005: 5.0p per ordinary share, an increase of 20%.
The proposed final dividend, which amounts to 13.9m, will be paid on 5 June 2007 to those shareholders on the register as at 4 May 2007.
Balance sheet The Group had net assets of 80.4m at 31 December 2006 2005: 68.9m.
The increase in net assets principally relates to the profit of 65.4m, the credit relating to share schemes of 12.4m and the exercise of share options of 38.2m, offset by share repurchases of 83.4m and dividends paid of 18.1m.
Our capital expenditure is driven primarily by two main factors: headcount, in terms of office accommodation and infrastructure: the maintenance and enhancement of our IT systems.
Capital expenditure, net of disposal proceeds, increased to 8.7m 2005: 6.8m reflecting the 28% increase in headcount and the opening and expansion of a number of offices.
The most significant item in the balance sheet is trade receivables which were 118.2m at 31 December 2006 2005: 82.7m representing debtor days of 55 2005: 49 days.
Cash flow At the start of the year, the Group had net cash of 13.1m.
During the year, the Group generated net cash from operating activities of 78.8m 2005: 65.4m being 103.8m 2005: 72.7m of EBITDA, an increase in working capital requirements of 28.7m 2005: 8.5m and movements in provisions of 0.4m 2005: 0.6m.
2 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 The principal payments have been: 8.7m 2005: 6.8m of capital expenditure, net of disposal proceeds, on property, infrastructure, information systems and motor vehicles for staff: taxes on profits of 21.7m 2005: 10.1m : dividends of 18.1m 2005: 14.4m : and share repurchases of 83.4m 2005: 34.2m.
38.2m 2005: nil was received in the year from the issue of new shares to satisfy share option exercises.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had net debt of 3.6m.
Treasury management and currency risk It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings, and to operate the Groups business while maintaining the cash debt position within a relatively narrow band.
Cash generated in excess of these requirements will be used to buyback the Companys shares for which renewal of the existing general authority is being sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro, US Dollar and Australian Dollar.
The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures, nor is there a material exposure to foreigndenominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations although our policy is not to hedge this exposure.
Key Performance Indicators KPIs Financial and non-financial key performance indicators KPIs used by the Board to monitor progress are listed in the table below.
Certain of these indicators are used in the appraisal of senior management on a global basis.
The source of data and calculation methods year-on-year are on a consistent basis.
This is the first year this information has been presented.
2 MICHAEL PAGE INTERNATIONAL KPI 2006 2005 Definition, method of calculation and analysis Job count 35,336 24,496 Represents the number of live jobs on the Michael Page website.
It is not necessarily an indication data of the financial performance or prospects of Michael Page International and should not be considered in isolation: the global figure does not include all business lines Accountancy Additions and Page Personnel vacancies are not included.
Gross margin 53.7% 51.1% Gross profit as a percentage of revenue.
Gross margin has slightly improved on last year as a result of the mix of permanent and temporary placements, and improvements in the gross margins on temporary placements.
Source: Consolidated income statement in the financial statements.
Conversion 27.9% 24.9% Operating profit as a percentage of revenue showing how effective the Group is at controlling the costs and expenses associated with its normal business operations and the level of investment for the future.
Conversion has improved over last year as a result of better utilisation of existing capacity, and improved pricing.
Productivity 126.2k 129.0k Represents how productive fee earners are in the business and is calculated by dividing the gross revenue per profit for the year by the number of fee earners and directors at the year end.
The higher the fee earner number, the higher their productivity.
Productivity is a function of the rate of investment in new fee earners, the impact of pricing and the general conditions of the recruitment market.
Fee earner: 74:26 71:29 Represents the balance between operational and non-operational staff.
The movement this year support staff demonstrates faster growth in fee earners in relation to support staff.
Source: Internal data ratio Return 119.4% 95.2% A measure of the returns that a company is making from its capital.
Calculated as profit before on capital interest, tax and dividends, divided by total assets less current liabilities.
The ratio shows how employed efficiently capital is being used to generate revenue.
ROCE Current ratio 1.3 1.4 This ratio is derived by dividing current assets by current liabilities, and is a good indicator of a companys ability to meet short-term debt obligations: the higher the ratio, the more liquid the company is.
The current ratio is in line with our expectations and broadly consistent with last year.
We achieved a higher level of organic operating profit growth than gross profit growth as a result of our high operational gearing.
The decrease in productivity is as a result of the large increase in headcount particularly in the second half of the year, as new fee earners can take a number of months to become fully productive.
Our ROCE increased this year with the current ratio remaining broadly in line with expectations.
These are important measures of our creation of value for shareholders.
The increase in the ratio of number of fee earners to the number of support staff has increased as a result of efficiencies made from enhancing our IT systems.

26 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 Principal risks and uncertainties The management of the business and the execution of the Companys strategy are subject to a number of risks.
The following section comprises a summary of what Michael Page International plc believes are the main risks that could potentially impact the Groups operating and financial performance.
People To continue to attract, train and retain high calibre individuals who are key to achieving these objectives.
The resignation of key individuals and the inability to recruit talented people with the right skill-sets could adversely affect the Groups results.
This is further compounded by the Groups organic growth strategy and its policy of not externally hiring senior positions.
Mitigation of this risk is achieved by succession planning, training of staff, competitive pay structures linked to the Groups results and career progression.
Economic cycle Recruitment is largely driven by economic cycles and the levels of business confidence.
The Board looks to reduce the cyclical risk by expanding geographically, by increasing the number of disciplines, by building partqualified and clerical businesses and by continuing to build the temporary business.
Competition The Group operates in a highly competitive market around the world.
If the Group does not continue to compete in its market effectively by hiring new staff, opening and expanding offices and continuing the discipline roll-outs, there is a risk that our competitors may beat us to key strategic opportunities, which may result in lost business and a reduction in market share.
This risk is mitigated by meetings of the Main Board and Executive Committee where Group strategy is continually reviewed and discussed.
Technology To utilise new technology or enhance existing technology to support the opening of new offices and the roll-out of new disciplines around the world.
Due to the rapid advancement of technology, there is a risk that systems could become outdated with the potential to affect efficiency and have an impact on revenue and client service.
This risk is mitigated by the appointment of a new Chief Information Officer in 2005 to oversee all IT strategy and innovation to support the wider business strategy.
Legal risks The Group operates in a large number of jurisdictions which have varying legal and compliance regulations.
In order to reduce the legal and compliance risks, fee earners and support staff receive regular training and updates of changes in legal and compliance requirements.
