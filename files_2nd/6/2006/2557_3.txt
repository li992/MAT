Kevin Higginson Operating Results Group Finance Director The Group has had another good year, showing continued growth over the prior year, and a return to making selected acquisitions in order to: Support our drive for increased market share - Warrens 16th December 2005 - Industrial Division: and Complement our existing market offering - Price Tools 9th March 2006 - Domestic Division.
Group sales increased by 15.7% from 746.5m to 863.6m.
There was an increase in sales from both the Industrial and Domestic Divisions - Industrial sales The Board recommend rose 13.7% and Domestic sales rose 16.6%.
Domestic sales were increased by strong organic sales growth, the effect of new branches opened as well as inflation an increase in the final of around 3.0% across the Group as a whole.
The gross margin of the Group has dropped compared with the prior year at 22.7% 2005: 23.3%.
This decrease is attributed to a greater proportion of the sales from the Domestic Division and the number of large contracts that we have won.
Strong working capital controls combined with lower borrowing costs have led to loan and bank interest charges dropping from 4.1m to 3.7m.
Profit before tax increased by 12.2% to 36.9m from 32.9m.
Shareholders Return Total equity at 31st March 2006 was 122.0m 2005: 94.2m equating to some 102 pence per share 2005: 80 pence.
The share price on 31st March 2006 was 358.0 pence 31st March 2005: 267.5 pence, having been at a high in the year of 385.3 pence and a low of 245.0 pence.
The share price on 26th May 2006, the latest practical day before the publishing of these accounts was 335.75 pence.
Earnings per Share Earnings per share on a statutory basis increased by 6.6% to 21.0 pence 2005: 19.7 pence.
There is no material difference between earnings per share and the diluted earnings per share.
The continued improvement of the trading prospects of the Group and our confidence in the future have allowed the Board to recommend an increase in the final dividend for the year of 20.0%, making a total for the year of 4.950 pence 2005: 4.125 pence.
9 Financial Review continued Taxation The tax charge for the year was 11.8m 2005: 9.6m.
Tax is charged at basic rate of 30% in the UK and 12.5% in Ireland, and there have been no significant changes to the tax rates during the year under review.
The total tax charge is increased above the normal marginal rate by expenditure not eligible for tax relief.
Cash Flow Net debt increased by 15.6m from 62.3m to 77.9m during the year, after expenditure of 23.1m on the acquisition of Warrens and Price Tools.
Working capital controls have remained tight and capital expenditure remains focused on the branch expansion programme.
Debt Facilities On 11th May 2006 the Group raised $125m through a private placement of fixed rate guaranteed unsecured notes with a number of US financial institutions.
The notes, which are unsecured and in addition to the existing Revolving Credit Facility, further enhance the maturity profile of the Groups debt.
$75m of the notes are repayable in 7 years and $50m in 10 years.
All principal and interest payments have been swapped into pounds sterling.
The additional facility was used to partly repay the existing Revolving Credit Facility.
The Group had unutilised credit facilities in excess of 30.0m as at 31st March 2006: on a proforma basis this increases to 102.0m.
Capital Expenditure During the year the Group spent 6.6m 2005: 6.0m, of which 0.4m relates to finance leases, of which the largest amount was 2.6m on opening new PTS branches.
Capital expenditure and significant disposals are subject to stringent levels of authorisation and clearly defined authority levels are in place throughout the Group.
Pension Funds Total Group deficit calculated on an IAS 19 basis for the defined benefit schemes was 46.3m at 31st March 2006 2005: 50.1m.
10 Treasury and Financial Risk Management The central Treasury function continues to co-ordinate the Groups banking and borrowing requirements, and controls exposure to foreign exchange and interest movements.
The Group does not operate an active hedging policy in relation to foreign exchange risk, but given the relative stability of the euro exchange, this is not considered significant to the Groups business.
As at the year end, around 41% of the Groups net debt is subject to interest rate fixing through swap transactions, or is capped.
The Group uses these interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to variable interest rates.
Further information is set out in note 18 to the accounts.
Appropriate hedging arrangements have been put in place on the new US dollar private placement.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The borrowings are denominated primarily in pounds sterling.
Financial assets are placed with banks at floating rates on periods ranging from overnight to monthly to quarterly depending on forecast cash flow requirements and earn interest at prevailing rates in the money market.
The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 18 to the accounts.
The Group maintains the mixture of long term and short term committed facilities as part of its liquidity risk management, which enables the Group to ensure that it is able to meet any planned expansion of the business.
The Groups wholly owned Irish subsidiarys revenues and expenses are denominated in euros.
The Group faces currency exposure on the translation of profits earned within the subsidiary, and is subject to currency exposure on the translation of its net assets.
The Group finances its investment in this subsidiary by means of borrowings in pounds sterling, together with a euro overdraft facility.
Dividends are paid by the Irish subsidiary to the Group at spot exchange rates.
The Group does not consider it appropriate to hedge its net investment due to the relative insignificance of the Irish operation.
The Groups trade purchases include 2% from overseas suppliers.
These are either purchased in pounds sterling or in the relevant foreign currency at spot exchange rate as at the transaction date.
The Groups balance sheet transaction exposure relates primarily to foreign currency trade creditors and is not material to the Group.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk and limits the amount of credit exposure to any particular customer across all trading divisions.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of product are made to customers only with an appropriate credit standing and history.
Regular credit review meetings are held to manage key debtors and overdue debts.
Due to this, management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of normal provision for doubtful debtors.
11 Financial Review continued Accounting Standards In 2002, the European Commission adopted a regulation requiring all listed companies to prepare their consolidated accounts in accordance with International Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards IAS IFRS from 31st December 2005.

The principal areas of difference are: Leases, with some IT operating leases being capitalised in the balance sheet: Share based payment, a fair value charge for the outstanding options in the profit and loss account: Non-amortisation of goodwill: Pension deficit impact on profit and loss account and balance sheet: Timing of recognition of proposed dividends in the accounts no longer accrued at the year end : Treatment of financial instruments eg, interest rate derivatives : and Valuation and separate disclosure of intangible assets as opposed to goodwill arising as a result of a business combination.
It is important to note that although the value of the net assets and reported earnings are affected by the implementation of IFRS, there is no effect on the cash flows of the business.
Kevin Higginson, GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR 30th May 2006 12 The Groups product base has been further strengthened by acquisitions during the past year.
