In 2006 free cash ow was 60.0 million for our continuing operations 2005: 62.8 million which represents 99% of our adjusted profit for the year 103%.
Cash generated by our operations was 216.9 million compared with 219.5 million last year.
Note 27 sets out the impact of discontinued operations within these numbers.
Cash generated by our continuing operations was 216.4 million compared with 209.2 million last year reecting higher operating profits and the add back of higher amortisation at 7.7 million 3.0 million and depreciation charges at 125.2 million up from 118.5 million in 2005.
Interest and tax payments combined were 5.9 million lower in 2006.
In particular, our cash tax reected the benefit of the special pension fund payments we made in 2006, from which we also expect benefit in 2007.
Overall net cash generated from operating activities was 193.5 million 190.2 million.
We used 184.1 million in our investing activities with net cash spend on Kevin Quinn Finance Director acquisitions of 36.0 million.
The total cost of investments is 40.4 million taking into account 4.4 million of financial liabilities assumed with acquisitions.
We are targeting good returns on these investments once they are integrated.
In 2005 our net cash investment on acquisitions was 19.3 million.
Capital expenditure on tangible and intangible assets was 144.6 million 136.7 million and disposal of assets realised 11.0 million 11.1 million.
Capital expenditures for discontinued operations were 0.6 million in 2006 and 8.2 million in 2005.
The increase in capital expenditure for our continuing operations therefore was 15.5 million reecting the investments we are making in plants for Poland and Norway, linen investments for new contract wins and the capital expenditure requirements for the acquisitions we have made, which is partly funded by the cash they generate from operating activities.
Within our investing activities is the 17.5 million 23.0 million in relation to special pension contributions, which is discussed below.
In 2005, we received cash proceeds of 153.2 million for the sale of the Elliott business, together with a total of 25.5 million from loan notes associated with the sale of the HSS business in 2004.
Overall, 10.8 million was generated from investing activities last year.
Cash generated from nancing activities was 23.4 million.
This includes outows of 6.5 million for the final redemption of the B shares we issued in 2005, as the conclusion of the capital return to shareholders.
The greater part of this return, 144.4 million, was made in 2005.
We also purchased 825,000 Davis shares in total for 3.6 million in the market in May and June 2006 and hold these as treasury shares.
Dividends paid to shareholders amounted to 30.2 million.
This is lower than the 32.2 million in 2005 and reects the reduced number of shares following share consolidation which accompanied the return of capital in 2005.

Finance expense Net finance expense for the year was 9.6 million compared with 7.2 million for our continuing business in 2005.
The increase resulted from a higher average net debt reecting the investments we have made in the business and the increase in interest rates that we saw in 2006.

The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2006 24 Pensions Actuaries to the groups dened benefit pension schemes in the UK, Ireland, Sweden and Germany continued to advise the respective Trustees on the required funding rates.
In total the group has charged 8.3 million for the year in respect of all pension arrangements for staff.
During 2006 the group made payments to the main UK pension plan of 17.5 million in respect of past service and has made a further payment of 12.5 million in January 2007.
The deficit on this UK plan was 25.3 million at 31 December 2006, before we made a further payment into the plan of 12.5 million in January 2007.
Treasury policy The group uses foreign currency borrowings and financial instruments to finance its operation and to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from those operations and sources of finance.
WE HAVE The groups strategy for nancing its operations and managing risks is summarised below.
FURTHER Financing FUNDED The group nances its operations primarily through its banking facilities, private placement notes and cash generated though its operations.
In planning OUR MAIN the maturity of debt, the groups policy is to seek a balance between continuity of funding and exibility.
UK PENSION In addition the group has overdraft facilities with certain clearing banks.
PLAN The groups UK current accounts are subject to set-off arrangements covered by cross guarantees and there is also a cash pooling arrangement taking in the cash generated by the Berendsen businesses.
All the groups borrowings are unsecured.
The group evaluates potential sources of funding on a continuous basis with a view to obtaining alternative sources when and where appropriate.
Interest rates The interest rate exposure of the group arising from its bank borrowings has been managed by the use of interest rate instruments as described above.
The groups policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures and are not speculative.
Currency Rates The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of capital equipment.
These risks are typically not material and, where any transactions exposure is significant in the context of the trading company concerned, a forward foreign exchange contract may be entered into by that company: this would be dependent upon the certainty of the exposure as to timing and amount and the exchange rate at the relevant time.
There were no such trading contracts outstanding at the year end.
It continues to be the groups policy not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profits to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investments in overseas net assets.
Post tax return on invested capital % Going concern After reviewing the groups budgeted cash ows and having made appropriate 2005 8.2 enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and 2006 8.4 the group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
