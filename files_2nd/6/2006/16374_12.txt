It is therefore not used as a liquidity measure reviewed and understood by investors.
Investors should be aware within Unilever.
The movement in UFCF is used by Unilever to that their application may vary in practice and therefore these measure progress against our longer-term value creation goals as measures may not be fully comparable between companies.
