Retirement benefit obligations In order to protect the pension benefits of members, important changes were made during the year to the Arriva sponsored pension scheme with the largest active membership.
Following consultation with the trustees, trade union representatives and employees, special contributions of 17 million were made to the Arriva Passenger Services Pension Plan during the year both to improve its financial position 11 million and also to facilitate the merger of the scheme with the Arriva Scotland West scheme 6 million.
At the same time contributions to the scheme from employers and employees were increased.
Partly as a result of the foregoing changes, total liabilities in respect of retirement benefit obligations fell to 173.8 million 2005: 207.4 million.
The retirement benefit obligation in respect of the Arriva Trains Wales section of the Railways pension scheme is 9.5 million 2005: 13.2 million.
The reduction was due to investment returns being higher than expected as well as the one-off contributions of 17 million.
The related deferred tax asset recognised in the balance sheet was 49.3 million 2005: 58.6 million.
