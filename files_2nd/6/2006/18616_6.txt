The chart below shows the major movements in NAV in the year.

The major variables in calculating the Grainger NAV are: 800 anticipated house price ination over the 750 728m 96p reversionary period: 700 the discount rate used to calculate the present value: 650 whether deferred taxation on the revaluation surpluses recognised in our market value balance sheet is 563p 677p 600 discounted: and m the average period it will take to obtain vacancy.
The base case Grainger NAV takes a very prudent approach to these key assumptions as follows: house price ination is taken as zero over the entire expected remaining period of occupation by the tenants: we have used a discount rate of 8.67% our weighted Triple Net Assets Per Share NNNAV average cost of capital plus 3% : Up 25.0% to 487p from 389p.
