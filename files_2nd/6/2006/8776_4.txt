Financial review Serious About Quality The annual results shown in this Annual report and Financial statements are the first to be prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The comparative results shown throughout this Annual report and Financial statements have been restated to comply with IFRS accounting standards.
Details of the effect of changes in accounting policies arising from the adoption of IFRS, together with restated information for the accounting period of 53 weeks to 30 January 2005, were published on our website, www.
co. uk, on 12 October 2005 and are detailed in note 42 in the Notes to the Financial statements on pages 71 to 77.
Interest and taxation Net finance costs of 602,000 for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 compare to 344,000 net finance income in the comparative period.
This adverse movement results from a higher average level of borrowings because of the lower net cash flow and the higher expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment.
The effective rate of taxation on the profit of the Group is 10.4 per cent compared to a restated 27.7 per cent in the comparative period last year.
The low effective rate of taxation in the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 arose partly from a prior year adjustment to current tax of 2,692,000 which has arisen as a result of the recent finalisation of a number of years corporation tax liabilities with the Inland Revenue.
Following the agreement of these corporation tax liabilities, the deferred tax liability arising on the difference between the net book value of property, plant and equipment and their tax written down value, has been recalculated and the provision has been reduced by 4,635,000 in the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
We anticipate that the effective rate of taxation for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007 will be approximately 30 per cent.
Balance Sheet Capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 was 47.4 million compared to 43.0 million in the comparative accounting period, and included 31.6 million of expenditure on combined health club superstores opened either during the accounting period or to be opened during 2006 and 5.4 million on our stand-alone retail stores.
A total of 5.3 million was expended on the refurbishment of retail stores.
Capital expenditure on intangible assets totalled 10.2 million being principally the 10.0 million spent on the acquisition of a 999 year licence for the Slazenger golf brand.
The value of inventories at 29 January 2006 of 120.3 million was 6.7 per cent higher than at 30 January 2005.
Whilst this increase partly arises from the achieved level of revenue being slightly lower than that planned and from the increase in the retail store selling area of 3.9 per cent, the ratio of current to non-current stocks has improved.
Net debt at 29 January 2006 was 25.0 million compared to net funds of 4.4 million at 30 January 2005, resulting in part from the lower net cash flow from operating activities achieved during the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 when compared to the previous accounting period but also from higher expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment.
Financial risks and treasury policies The key financial risks faced by the Group are the security of existing funds, the ongoing availability of new funds and fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
The following treasury policies, approved by the Board of Directors, are adopted in order that these risks are effectively managed.
Liquidity risk management The Group manages its cash and funding requirements centrally with the objective of maximising interest income and minimising interest expense.
Investments of cash surpluses are made with banks which must satisfy credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board of Directors.
In June 2005, the Groups existing 100 million committed revolving bank credit facility expired.
This was replaced by a new five year 60 million revolving bank credit facility which commenced in June 2005.
Both the original facility and the new facility were arranged at floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR and expose the Group to interest rate risk.
A further facility of 18 million was arranged to finance the purchase of the Rangers FC licensing agreement in June 2006.
Interest rate risk management The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and the revolving credit bank facility.
Interest chargeable on the bank facility is based on floating rates linked to LIBOR.
No interest rate hedging agreement is in place over the bank facility because the Board continues to believe that, given the current interest rate environment, fluctuations in interest rates do not pose a significant risk to the Group.
10 Financial review continued Serious About Choice Foreign currency risk management A significant proportion of the Groups trading activities are payable and receivable in sterling and only approximately 28 million per annum is payable in dollars.
The Group manages its dollar requirements through a series of forward contracts which secure dollars at a fixed rate of exchange to meet the Groups requirements for approximately six months in advance.
Share buy-backs At the 2005 Annual General Meeting held on 6 July 2005, the Company was granted authority by its shareholders to make market purchases of up to 5 per cent of its ordinary shares.
No such market purchases have yet been made because the Board has made the decision to use the Groups net cash flow to finance the acquisition of the licence for the Slazenger golf brand and the continuing expansion of our combined health club superstores chain.
The authority will expire at the date of the 2006 Annual General Meeting and it is our intention to ask the shareholders at that Meeting to approve the renewal of the authority to make market purchases.
Dividend The Board is conscious that the maintenance of dividends is of major importance to all shareholders and, despite the reduced level of profits, has proposed to maintain the rate of the final dividend at 7.0 pence net per ordinary share.
The final dividend will be paid on 9 August 2006 to shareholders on the share register at the close of business on 26 May 2006 and the shares will trade ex-dividend from 24 May 2006. Dividend cover on the interim dividend already paid, together with the proposed final dividend, based on earnings per ordinary share for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006 was 1.3 times and the yield, based on the share price of 172 pence at 27 January 2006, was 5.8 per cent.
The Board has also made a decision to offer a scrip dividend alternative to shareholders, giving them the opportunity of taking their final dividend in the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Details of the terms and conditions applicable to this scrip dividend alternative, and the resolutions which will require to be passed at this years AGM for its implementation, will be given in the Circular which accompanies this Annual report and Financial statements.
Share capital Details of the share capital and recent movements are described in note 28 in the Notes to the Financial statements on page 61.
The share price of the ordinary shares at the close of business on 27 January 2006 was 172 pence, representing an equity market capitalisation of approximately 397 million.
This represents a decrease of 17 per cent from the price of 208 pence at 28 January 2005.
Following the announcement of the Preliminary results on 20 April 2006, the closing share price was 170 pence.
On 30 May 2006, the date on which declarable interests have been disclosed in the Directors report, the share price was 174 pence.
Office of Fair Trading The appeal that we made to the independent Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT against the decision of the Office of Fair Trading OFT regarding the price-fixing of certain replica kit products has resulted in a reduction in the amount of the penalty claimed of 8.4 million to 6.7 million.
We are disappointed with the CATs judgement on liability and the consequent amount of the reduction in the penalty and have applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against those aspects that it was possible to appeal.
We have now been granted permission to appeal by the Court of Appeal on these matters.
This appeal has been heard in May 2006 but the judgement is not expected to be handed down until after the date of the publication of this Annual report and Financial statements.
On the basis of legal advice regarding the grounds of our appeal to the Court of Appeal, we decided to make a provision against the penalty of 2 million in the accounts for the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005.
Acknowledging the specific grounds on which we have appealed and the inherent uncertainty of the appeal process, we have decided, on the basis of further legal advice, to increase the provision against the penalty by 1.88 million in the Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
