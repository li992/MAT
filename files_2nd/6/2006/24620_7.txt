21 The contribution from new business under the Full EV basis increased by 38% in 2006 to 461m 2005 333m, re ecting strong growth in new business volumes in all channels and increased overall margins.
Increased sales of bonds and funds through Bancassurance was the primary driver of this growth, but strong sales growth through Wealth Management and increased volumes and margins in Intermediary also made important contributions.
The contribution from existing business decreased by 5% in 2006 to 213m 2005 225m, the 12% increase in the expected contribution being more than offset by a 75m adverse impact of actual vs expected experience.
The major driver of this was worsened persistency in respect of Intermediary business as a result of replacement activity associated with Pensions A-Day and higher lapses on with-pro t bonds.
Reconciliation of IFRS to Full EV A reconciliation of underlying pro t before tax on the Full EV basis with the reported IFRS basis is set out below: Year ended 31.12.2006 Year ended 31.12.2005 Life & Life & Mutual Life & Life & Mutual Pensions Pensions Funds Pensions Pensions Funds Insurance Investment Investment Insurance Investment Investment Contracts Contracts Contracts Total Contracts Contracts Contracts Total m m m m m m m m Underlying pro t before tax IFRS basis 227 18 32 277 237 1 3 235 Additional contribution from new business 270 204 474 210 155 365 Lower contribution from existing business 131 91 222 122 69 191 Additional investment earnings on net assets 6 4 10 4 1 5 Increase in underlying pro t before tax 145 117 262 92 87 179 Underlying pro t before tax Full EV basis 227 163 149 539 237 93 84 414 Development costs, overheads, other income and costs and nancing costs have been attributed to Life & Pensions Insurance Contracts business for presentational purposes only.
Moving to the Full EV basis results in earlier recognition of pro ts from sales of new investment contracts, offset in part by the subsequent recognition of lower pro ts on existing investment contracts.
The Full EV basis, unlike the IFRS basis, recognises pro ts on new business at the point of sale with the contribution from existing business consisting only of subsequent changes in the net present value of future cash ows and changes in experience compared to that initially modelled at the point of sale.
Financial Review continued Growing the UK franchise Targeted international growth Cost leadership Colleague development Capital discipline 38% New business contribution under the Full EV basis increased by 38% to 461m.
22 The contribution from new investment contracts in 2006 under the Full EV basis was 474m higher than under the reported IFRS result, the Full EV contribution being 245m compared to a loss of 229m under the IFRS basis.
Under the Full EV basis, the contribution from existing investment contracts in 2006 was 222m lower than under the IFRS basis, the Full EV basis contribution being 57m compared to 279m under the IFRS basis.
The lower contribution from existing business under the Full EV basis includes 91m of actual vs expected experience on investment contracts, which largely re ects worse than expected persistency on Intermediary business.
New Business Pro tability With the publication of this supplementary information and also with the industry-wide demise of the Achieved Pro ts basis new business pro tability will, from now onwards, be reported by reference to the Full EV basis rather than the Achieved Pro ts basis.
This results in new business pro tability for 2005 which is 2% APE lower than previously reported because the Full EV basis allocates a higher proportion of overhead expenses to new business.
The contribution from new business includes direct costs of writing new business and an appropriate allocation of overheads.
Other overheads are allocated to the contribution from existing business or are recorded as overheads associated with development activity.
New business pro tability for the UK Investment Business including both Life & Pensions and Mutual Funds calculated by reference to the Full EV basis is set out below: Year ended 31.12.2006 Year ended 31.12.2005 New New New New New New Business Business Business Business Business Business APE Contribution Pro tability APE Contribution Pro tability m m %APE m m %APE Bancassurance 916 304 33 813 233 29 Intermediary 511 49 10 389 32 8 Wealth Management 304 108 36 185 68 37 Total 1,731 461 27 1,387 333 24 Life & Pensions 1,299 337 26 1,004 258 26 Mutual Funds 432 124 29 383 75 20 Total 1,731 461 27 1,387 333 24 Excluding business 86m APE in 2006, 86m in 2005 distributed but not manufactured by the Group.
23 New business pro tability increased strongly in 2006 to 27% 2005 24% re ecting our continued focus on value creation.
In Wealth Management, pro tability remains strong at 36% 2005 37%, with the decrease in margin being due to higher sales of pensions business post Pensions A-Day.
Our Bancassurance channel continues to deliver strong margins through the ef ciency of our model and the productivity of our sales forces, and margins in this channel increased to 33% 2005 29%.
There has also been an increase in pro tability in the Intermediary channel to 10% 2005 8% re ecting reducing unit costs and increased average policy sizes.
Overall Life & Pensions margins remained at at 26%.
The increase in Mutual Funds pro tability largely re ects ef ciencies from increased scale, larger case sizes and changes in the mix of funds.
