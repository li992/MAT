Business Review Financial Review David Bennett Group Finance Director Progress Against Strategic Objectives 2005-2007 Financial Outlook Our strategic objectives for the period 2005-2007 are to grow our franchise, We plan to grow our core operating profit in 2007. improve our cost efficiency, and deliver a strong return on equity, whilst Total revenues in 2007 are planned to be higher than the 1,468m in 2006. maintaining above average asset quality.
We expect the Group net interest margin in 2007 to reduce by less than the We have achieved each of these objectives in 2006: 16 basis point fall in 2006.
The impact of this fall on net interest income is our underlying return on equity tier 1 capital was 21.5%, within anticipated to be more than offset by asset growth.
We will continue to our targeted range of 20% plus or minus 3%: maintain our focus on costs, whilst ensuring that we undertake the investment required to continue the Groups transformation and maintain we delivered strong franchise growth in our core markets: our customer service standards.
we improved our cost efficiency, with the Group cost:income ratio The Group will continue to see a significant amount of change as we simplify reducing from 55.2% in 2005 to 53.0%: and automate processes and increase the use of self service technology for our asset quality remained strong and better than industry averages.
This is likely to result in some redundancies, although we have no specific programmes planned at this time, and any cost in 2007 New Strategic Objectives would be significantly lower than the 24m incurred in 2006.
Any redundancy Our confidence in our business model and the transformation currently costs would continue to be excluded from core operating profit.

underlying basic earnings per share to grow by at least RPI 9% by 2009.
During 2007 we will be undertaking a share buyback programme of up to 300m.
In addition we will continue to target: franchise growth: improved cost efficiency: above average asset quality: and a Group cost:income ratio of below 50% by 2010.
In assessing each of these, we will exclude any impact arising from fair value accounting volatility and any redundancy costs.
