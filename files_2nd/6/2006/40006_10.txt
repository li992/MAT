Operating and Financial Review continued Financial Review 22.
REIT conversion and dividend policy A major event in the year was the EGM on 14 December 2006 which approved the Groups election to become a REIT.
This took effect from 1 January 2007 after many months of hard work and careful preparation.
In financial terms, the one-off conversion charge amounts to approximately 82 million and this will be paid in four quarterly instalments commencing July 2007.
REIT conversion means that income and capital gains from the Groups eligible UK investment activities will be tax exempt.
This includes development gains provided that the properties are retained for at least three years following completion.
Accordingly, whilst the 2006 accounts include provision for the conversion charge, they also include the release of 416 million of previously provided deferred tax which is no longer payable.
Following its December 2006 listing on Euronext, the Group also intends to elect into Frances tax exempt regime for real estate companies to become a SIIC with similar benefits to REIT status in the UK.
This should be with retrospective effect from 1 January 2007.
With REIT status in the UK, SIIC status in France and prudent tax planning in respect of other taxable activities, we believe we will be able to operate a very efficient international structure with a low overall tax charge.
Operating as a REIT will require us to distribute, in the form of dividends, at least 90 per cent of the eligible UK property rental profits, after certain deductions.
However, the Board has taken the opportunity to review its overall dividend policy, recognising that the Group is now operating in a market in which there is global competition for capital.
The Boards aim will be to achieve a sustainable, progressive policy which satisfies shareholders expectations of a relatively high pay-out of recurring property rental income, whilst supporting the ongoing needs for capital.
The precise proportion of recurring property rental income that the Group distributes may vary between years and will be flexed as appropriate, according to the needs of the business.
Ordinarily, however, the Board would expect the total dividend to exceed the mandatory 90 per cent PID Property Income Distribution element, and to comprise between 85 per cent and 95 per cent of worldwide recurring property rental earnings plus a proportion of trading property profits and other income from non-property activities.

life to that of the unexpired remaining term of the lease portfolio.
Foreign currency translation exposure Due to the nature of the Groups business it has no cross-border trading transactions and therefore, foreign exchange transaction exposure is negligible.
However, it does have operations located overseas which transact business in the domestic currency of the country in which the business is located mostly in US dollars and Euros.
The Groups main currency exposure therefore is the translation risk associated with converting net currency assets back into sterling in the Group consolidated accounts at each balance sheet date.
As mentioned above the policy is that between 75 per cent 90 per cent of currency denominated assets must be matched with liabilities of the same currency.
At 31 December 2006, 223.5 million or 14 per cent of currency denominated net assets were exposed to exchange movements.
A 10 per cent movement in the value of sterling against all currencies in which the Group operates would therefore change net assets by 22.3 million and net assets per share by 5 pence or 0.6 per cent.
The strongest valuation gains experienced were in the USA 15.2 per cent, Central Europe 22.3 per cent, the UK industrial 11.5 per cent and France 10.7 per cent, in all cases driven mainly by further significant yield compression due to the weight of money being targeted at prime real estate assets in most sectors.
