5 Autonomy Corporation plc Financial Review for the year ended 31 December 2006 Key Risks The key risks to which the business is exposed are summarized as follows: Our business depends on our core technology, currently marketed under the brand IDOL Server, and our strategy has been, and for the foreseeable future will continue to be, to concentrate our efforts on developing and marketing software based on our proprietary technology.
Technology which significantly competes with the companys technology, or material legal claims against our technology, would present a material risk to the company.
Expenditures increasing without a commensurate increase in revenues, and rapid changes in market conditions, could result in poor operating results.
The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact revenues and gross margins.
The return of unfavorable economic and market conditions.
Our reliance on sales of our products by third parties such as value added resellers makes it difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.
Our ability to expand sales through indirect sellers.
The continued service of our executive directors.
The hiring and retention of qualified personnel.
Errors or defects in our products, which could negatively affect our revenues and the market acceptance of our products and increase our costs.
Problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions.
Claims by others that we infringe on their intellectual property rights.
The companys policies applicable to employees addressing key business risks, including financial, communications, whistle blowing and health and safety, are made available through policy manuals and the companys intranet site.
The processes to identify and manage the key risks to the success of the company are an integral part of the internal control environment.
Such processes, in addition to those discussed above, include strategic planning, appointing highly skilled managers with accountability, regular monitoring of performance and setting and communicating high standards and targets for ethics, safety and health.
Key Performance Indicators The company has several key performance measures used internally to monitor and challenge performance and to assist investment decisions.
The slight overall decrease in gross margins during 2006 reflects the impact of lower-margin services business acquired as part of 2005 acquisitions.
Throughout 2006 gross margins continued to rise, reflecting increased license revenues versus other revenues.
The increase in operating margins is a reflection of significantly increased revenue, due to a combination of strong organic growth and the full year impact of acquisitions, versus the companys relatively fixed cost-base.
