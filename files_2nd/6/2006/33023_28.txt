Symbicort has not been launched in the US.
The performance data shown in the therapy area reviews on pages 16, 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 and the geographic sales performance in the geographic review on page 33 are shown in both reported and underlying performance.
Reported performance takes into account all the factors including those which we cannot influence, principally currency exchange rates that have affected the results of our business.
Underlying performance shows sales growth at constant exchange rates CER to reflect the volume and price changes of the geographic and therapy areas and individual products by excluding the effects of exchange rate movements.
Underlying CER growth is calculated by retranslating the current year performance at the previous years exchange rates and adjusting for other exchange effects, including hedging.
