AMEC is not dependent The maintenance of high standards of safety and service remain important on any one customer in securing repeat business from customers.
Principal business opportunities include continued high oil and gas and commodity prices, which would result in continued strength in AMECs Energy and Process businesses, and continued strength in government spending on public sector assets, which would provide continued opportunities in the Built Environment businesses.
AMEC has invested 3-4 million per annum in developing its portfolio of wind energy projects.
Should any of the major projects receive planning approval, this business is expected to begin to make a contribution to the group.
The price of oil and gas, commodity prices and levels of business confidence across power and process markets are key drivers for AMECs businesses.
A sustained and significant reduction in oil and gas or commodity prices and or a reduction in business confidence could have an adverse impact on the level of client spending in AMECs core markets.
The UK Building and Civil Engineering business has been the subject of major restructuring as described on pages 26-27.
AMEC is not aware of any issues within projects under construction that are likely to have a material impact on the company.
In the US, AMEC has exited certain construction management activities.
The company is involved in ongoing litigation relating to these former activities and other construction related activities and has made provisions which are believed to be adequate, but the outcome of litigation is not certain, as summarised in note 30 on page 99.
In recent years, AMEC has moved away from certain construction activities and the level of lump-sum at risk work across the company has been significantly reduced, but not eliminated.
