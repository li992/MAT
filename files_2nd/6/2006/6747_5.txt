This is an investment in the business, designed to optimise the number of waiting staff in the restaurants at all times, thus maintaining high levels of customer service and satisfaction and at the same time, generating additional sales.
In order to ensure that best practice restaurant operations are used consistently across the estate, PizzaExpress has recently established a number of restaurants as regional centres of excellence and developed a series of How To cards as a useful tool to promote consistency in staff training.

They include the results for a small number of restaurants that were disposed of prior to IPO and certain non-recurring exceptional costs.
For clarity, the core business results presented below exclude both the restaurants disposed of prior to the IPO and the exceptional costs mentioned above.
Unless otherwise stated, all sales, profit and other income statement references are to a 52 week basis: all cash flow references are to a 53 week basis.

qxd 28 9 06 17:08 Page 31 Financial Review continued Pro forma analysis of earnings per share The financial results for 2005 06 were impacted by the significant change in capital structure and the refinancing which took place in November 2005.
Management believe that a clearer picture of the Group's underlying performance is given by the following pro forma analysis, which shows what the finance and tax costs and resulting earnings per share would have been, had the current capital structure and financing arrangements been in place from the start of both accounting periods.
1 Pro Forma 2 Core Business Results Statutory Results Earnings 2005 06 2004 05 2005 06 2004 05 per share 52 wks 52 wks 52 wks 53 wks 52 wks Pro Forma Pro Forma Change Reported Reported m m % m m Operating profit 71.0 68.5 3.6 59.1 53.5 Net finance costs 22.3 22.3 - 40.9 72.7 Profit loss before tax 48.7 46.2 5.4 18.2 19.2 Taxation 15.1 14.3 5.6 6.0 11.0 Profit loss after tax 33.6 31.9 5.3 12.2 8.2 Attributable to equity holders 33.5m 31.8m Number of shares in issue 134.7m 134.7m Earnings per share 24.9p 23.6p 1 Pro forma adjustments that have been made are as follows: to reduce the net interest charge, as the Group has paid a lower rate of interest on a lower level of borrowings following the refinancing.
The same level of pro forma net borrowings has been assumed for 2004 05 for comparability purposes to exclude the impact of non-deductible costs associated with the IPO on the taxation charge and other one-off items, bringing it into line with the Groups effective tax rate for 2005 06 of approximately 31% to reduce minority interests to reflect the nominal interests retained following the IPO to increase the number of shares to reflect the number of shares currently in issue, as a result of the IPO 2 Core excludes restaurants disposed of prior to the IPO, with the 2005 06 core results based on the 52 weeks to 25 June 2006 for comparability against the prior 52 week financial year 28 GONDOLA HOLDINGS PLC - ANNUAL REPORT 20O6 3502 - Financial Rep 06 Start Q7.

qxd 28 9 06 17:08 Page 33 Financial Review continued Sales momentum The Groups positive sales momentum continued throughout the year, with like for like sales growth in the core business improving from 4.0% for the first 28 weeks, to 4.1% for 52 weeks.
The improvement in the second half was achieved despite the combined impact of the World Cup and the exceptionally hot summer weather, which reduced the rate of revenue growth in the final weeks of the financial year.
Total restaurant sales growth in the core business was 7.0% for the financial year.
Total sales including retail and other sales in the core business grew by 6.3% in the same period.
Management of cost base Effective management of the Groups cost base has been a critical factor in maintaining margins, despite a series of industry wide cost pressures that would otherwise have impacted the business more heavily.
The most notable increases have occurred in utilities costs, minimum wage levels, higher rent reviews and some specific food price increases such as olive oil.
These have all been mitigated by the Groups ability to generate substantial savings across a range of cost categories, whilst also enabling investment in the quality of its products.
EBITDA for the core business grew by 6.3% in 2005 06 to 89.2m.
The overall EBITDA as a percentage of sales was maintained at 22.6% throughout the year.
IFRS impacts As indicated in the Groups IPO prospectus and reported previously, the Group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the first time in preparing its results for 2005 06.
A summary of the impact of conversion to IFRS is included in the notes to the financial statements.
In summary, EBITDA is shown after: charging 0.7m in 2005 06 and 0.2m in 2004 05 in relation to the employee incentive scheme which operated prior to the IPO.
charging 0.1m in 2005 06 and 0.2m in 2004 05 as an adjustment to the treatment of rent free periods.
re-classifying 0.5m of amortisation of lease premiums in both years which, under IFRS, is treated as a rental charge, thus impacting EBITDA.
Exceptional costs Exceptional costs for 2005 06 amounted to 12.6m, down from 14.2m in the previous year.
Of the 12.6m, 7.8m were costs associated with the IPO, and 4.8m was incurred as a result of the disposal of non-core restaurants prior to the IPO.
Exceptional costs in 2004 05 comprised 6.0m of supply chain reorganisation costs, 4.7m of costs associated with the acquisition of ASK Central, and 2.0m of accelerated depreciation, together with other amounts totalling 1.5m.
The Groups positive sales momentum continued throughout the year, with like for like sales growth in the core business improving from 4.0% for the first 28 weeks, to 4.1% for 52 weeks.

The refinancing undertaken in conjunction with the IPO significantly changed the nature of the Groups debt.
As a result, this expense reflects the twenty week period up to the refinancing which came into effect on 8 November 2005, combined with a period of thirty three weeks of significantly lower net debt and reduced rates of interest on the new facilities.
After interest income, net finance expense was 40.9m.
New debt refinancing costs of 3.2m were incurred, and these will be amortised over the five year term of the new facilities.
The total amortisation charge in 2005 06 amounted to 2.7m, the majority of which represented an additional write-off of costs associated with the previous debt facilities.

qxd 28 9 06 17:09 Page 37 Financial Review continued Taxation The actual level of taxation expense for 2005 06 was impacted by a proportion of the exceptional costs associated with the IPO being non-deductible for taxation purposes, partly offset by certain prior year items.
On a pro forma basis, tax is estimated as follows, incorporating an amount of non-deductible expenses, together with a proportion of capital expenditure which is not allowable for capital allowances.
2005 06 52 wks Pro forma m Pro forma profit before tax 48.7 Add: non-deductible expenses and non-qualifying capital expenditure 1.5 Taxable profit 50.2 Standard tax charge @ 30% 15.1 Tax charge as % of pro forma profit before tax 31% Minority interests and earnings per share For 2005 06, 1.1m was attributable to minority interests as a result of shares held by investors in PizzaExpress Limited.
The majority of this amount related to the period prior to the IPO, at which point the external shareholdings in this subsidiary were reduced to a nominal level.
Basic reported earnings per share attributable to equity holders for the period were 10.7p, compared to a loss per share in the prior comparable period of 25.1p.
On a pro forma basis, profit after tax would have increased by 5.3% to 33.5m and earnings per share after minority interests would have increased by 5.3% to 24.9p for the core business.
Cash flow and net borrowings Reported cash flow from operations increased by 56.8% to 87.8m.
Net cash generated from operating activities, after tax, was 83.5m, an increase of 47.0%.
2005 06 2004 05 53 wks 52 wks Reported Reported m m Cash generated from operations 87.8 56.0 Taxation paid received 4.3 0.8 Net cash flow from operating activities 83.5 56.8 Net cash used in investing activities 60.5 18.1 Net cash used in financing activities 16.2 89.4 Net increase decrease in cash & cash equivalents 6.8 50.7 This strong and consistent cash generation underpins the Groups ability to continually invest in the existing portfolio of restaurants, fund the expansion of the core estate and meet the Groups financing obligations.
Net cash used in investing activities of 60.5m primarily reflected the 32.5m buy out of certain minority interests in PizzaExpress Limited prior to the IPO and 28.3m investment in property, plant and equipment for the expansion of the business.

This primarily reflected the impact of refinancing and corporate restructuring in both financial years, together with net interest payments.
Free cash flow defined as cash generated from operations, less net interest paid, tax paid and maintenance capital expenditure was 15.6m, due to the part year impact of the pre-IPO capital structure with significantly higher interest costs.
In 2005 06, the Groups net borrowings decreased from 557.8m to 340.8m.
This was primarily due to the significant reduction in the first half of 2005 06 as a result of the impact of the refinancing and the Groups IPO, which raised proceeds of 135.1m.

To assist with this process, the Group recently commissioned an independent review of its strategic and operational risks.
Gondolas Executive Directors and the senior executives from both PizzaExpress and ASK Central participated fully in the review.
Its outcomes have been used as the basis from which to develop a Group risk management strategy and process.
It is envisaged that a similar review will be conducted on an annual basis.
Given the nature of the Groups businesses, the principal business risks relate to the following: consumer demand and prevailing economic conditions consumer tastes, relating to preferences and perceptions of eating out choices sourcing of fresh ingredients and maintenance of high standards of food safety cost pressures associated with labour, lease rentals, food supplies, utilities and other inputs securing of suitable new sites to achieve roll-out plans Chris Heath Group CFO and Commercial Director 20 September 2006 38 GONDOLA HOLDINGS PLC - ANNUAL REPORT 20O6 3502 - Financial Rep 06 Start Q7.
