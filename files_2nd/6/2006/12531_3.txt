The Brent oil price, which began the year at US$58.9 per barrel bbl, averaged US$65.4 bbl reaching a peak of US$78.6 bbl during August.
Gas prices worldwide were also boosted according to the degree of linkage with crude pricing.
The early part of 2007 has seen some weakness in spot pricing with a relatively warm start to the year.
Forward prices have remained above US$60 bbl.
Strong commodity prices and increased industry activity levels have continued to put pressure on both operating and development costs.
Rig rates and other drilling service costs remain at historically high levels and shortages of key vessels and equipment are contributing to project delays.
The industry is responding to cost and availability issues by seeking out new engineering and commercial approaches to optimise use of available resources.
