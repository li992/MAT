i Unit lifting costs and unit operating expenditure per boe.
These ratios are used by management to monitor the overall operating efficiency over time of E&P producing assets.
Unit lifting costs per boe, which excludes royalty, tariff and insurance costs, is used by management to monitor those field production costs which are directly controlled by field management, and allows investors to monitor those costs for BG Group over time although not necessarily on a comparable basis with other exploration and production companies.
Unit operating expenditure per boe is used by management to monitor the total ongoing unit cost of operating producing assets, and allows investors to compare BG Groups aggregated unit operating expenditure with that of other exploration and production companies.
The usefulness of these ratios is limited because they provide only historical trend information at an aggregated level and are not necessarily a guide to future costs.
