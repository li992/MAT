For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going Hedging strategy concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Whilst a substantial proportion of the Groups revenue and profit is earned outside the UK, subsidiaries generally only trade in their own currency.
The Group is therefore not subject to any significant foreign exchange transactional exposure.
The Groups principal exposure to foreign currency, therefore, lies in the translation of overseas profits into sterling.
This exposure is hedged to the extent that these profits are offset by interest charges in the same currency, arising from the financing of the investment cost of overseas acquisitions by borrowings in the same currency.
The Group treasury management policy provides that the Group will seek to fix interest rates on a proportion of its debt when market conditions make this desirable.
At 30 September 2006 net debt was held at variable interest rates.
In light of the nature and level of the exposures identified above, the Group does not hold any sophisticated financial instruments such as derivatives.
