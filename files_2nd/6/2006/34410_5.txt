This excess, We believe that the reduction in yields is likely to end shortly and on a pre-tax basis, of 5.2m, compares with a figure of 77.3m at that maintaining a relatively low level of gearing at this stage of the the end of 2005.
On a post-tax basis the 2006 excess is equivalent property cycle is appropriate.
This, together with our unsecured to 1p per share, compared with 54.1m, equivalent to 20p per funding strategy, gives us the financial flexibility to react to share, for 2005.
The reduction during the year is mainly due to the opportunities as they arise.
We have been prepared in the past, redemption of the Debentures and the increase in market interest as demonstrated by the 675m Industrious acquisition in 2005, rates.
This amount is not recognised in the balance sheet unlike to substantially increase our gearing when the opportunity arises to the change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
As well as increasing the scale of the development programme, we believe that there will be future opportunities to use our balance sheet capacity.
The main financial risks for the Group are liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Group maintains a mixture of short term funding through, typically, 5 year unsecured bank facilities and longer term funding through the unsecured bond market.
Steven Owen Deputy Chief Executive As part of the Companys unsecured funding strategy all of the outstanding Debentures, originally issued between 1983 and 1986, were redeemed in November 2006.
Consequently all of its on-balance sheet debt is now unsecured and all of its wholly owned properties are unencumbered.
Since 1995 all debt on the balance sheet has been raised on an unsecured basis and this is a fundamental part of our liability strategy.
At the end of 2006 the Group had 375m of committed, bilateral bank facilities available all of which were undrawn.
Bank facilities continue to be an important source of short term finance for the Group providing it with flexibility on competitive terms to fund its current and future business requirements.
The weighted average maturity of all borrowings at the end of 2006 was 8 years with 57% of gross debt repayable after more than 5 years and 43% repayable in 3 to 4 years.
It is the Groups policy to extend and spread maturities whenever possible as part of the process of managing its funding risk.
The average cost of Group debt at the end of 2006 was 5.3% compared with 5.4% at the end of 2005.
This reflects the reduction in the average cost arising from the redemption of the Debentures offset by the increase in market rates during the year.
The proportion of floating rate debt to total debt was 44% at the year end compared with 65% at the end of 2005.
Including cash on deposit of 145.5m at the year end, which acts as a natural hedge for floating rate debt, the proportion of floating rate debt reduces to 28% from 44%.
Following the 25bp increase in base rates in January 2007 the average cost of debt is currently 5.4%.
