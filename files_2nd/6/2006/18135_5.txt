PROFIT BEFORE TAX Profit before tax increased to 176.6 million from 84.7 million, an increase of 108.5 per cent.

TAX The charge for current tax was 1.2 million being mainly incurred within the French division.
The charge to deferred tax of 19.1 million has been mitigated during the year by the release of a deferred tax provision of 27.9 million, which resulted principally from the sale of the corporate structure owning Solna Business Park.
