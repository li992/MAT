1 8 f I N A N C I A L R e v I e W Financial review Key financial highlights The Groups pre-tax profit showed another significant increase in 2006 rising 23% from 119.5m to 147.3m.
Earnings per share grew by 22% from 32.7p to 39.8p.
The results of the four key elements of the Groups business were as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Underwriting profit 28,351 32,361 Profit commission 19,926 14,735 Ancillary and other net income 75,985 65,516 Confused.
com profit 23,080 6,882 Pre-tax profit 147,342 119,494 During 2006 the Group retained 25% of the UK motor business it generated, and hence limited downside exposure to the motor cycle.
The Group participates in the upside through the profit commission arrangements within these contracts.
Using co-insurance and reinsurance significantly reduces the amount of capital the Group is required to hold and frees up resources either for distribution to shareholders or growing the business.
Ownership of the 1.2m UK policy base remains with the Group and significant non-insurance profits continue to be generated.
These ancillary profits continue to be the single largest contributor to the Groups result.
The Group is able to deliver continued and significant profit growth even at times when the motor insurance cycle is in its worst years because of the significant contribution made by nonunderwriting income, and also the fact that the Groups underwriting has returned superior results compared to the market as a whole.
The proportion of the profit earned from non-underwriting activity continues to rise, moving up from 73% in 2005 to over 80% in 2006.
This is partly a factor of the further deterioration of the UK motor insurance cycle, but is more a reflection of the continued absolute growth in nonunderwriting profits, most notably ancillaries and Confused.
Turnover which comprises total premiums written, gross other income and net investment return and measures the combined size of the Groups businesses continued to show double digit growth: 800 800 700 700 a D m i R a L G R O u P p l c 1 9 600 600 500 500 2006 2005 400 400 000 000 Total premium written 566,608 533,616 300 300 Other revenue 131,621 93,405 200 200 Net investment return 9,925 11,342 100 100 0 0 Group turnover 708,154 638,363 Other revenue which is made up predominantly of ancillary revenue and Confused.

35% of the business was underwritten by the Group through Admiral Insurance Gibraltar Limited AIGL and Admiral Insurance Company Limited AICL.
10% of the total business was ceded via quota share contracts that qualify for deductions in required solvency capital 5% to Axis Re Europe and 5% to Swiss Reinsurance Company UK Limited.
The Group retained 25% of 2006 underwriting on a net basis.
As well as proportional reinsurance, the Group has also arranged an excess of loss reinsurance programme with a number of reinsurers to protect itself against very large claims.
For the 2000 to 2002 underwriting years, the Groups retained share of the motor business was underwritten through the Groups Syndicate Syndicate 2004 at Lloyds of London.
During early July 2006, the Group achieved the release of a significant proportion of the profits earned by the Groups Syndicate amounting to around 24m, net of amounts retained to meet corporation tax liabilities.
m m Financial Review 18 - 27 2 0 f I N A N C I A L R e v I e W New co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements, 2007 onwards During 2007, the Group concluded the successful renegotiation of the long-term UK motor reinsurance treaty with Great Lakes, and also put in place new quota share reinsurance arrangements for 2007 and beyond.
The new Great Lakes contract will run until the end of 2014 at the earliest, and the percentage of business underwritten under the contract will decline by 5% per annum until 2011, so that in that year and beyond, Great Lakes will underwrite 40% of the total.
The declining share passed to Great Lakes allows the Group to position itself for an upturn in the cycle and retain more of the profitable business it has historically generated.
Flexible use of quota share reinsurance allows the Group to reduce its own retention to a minimum of 25% after 2007 where this is appropriate.
The new contract is also on improved terms most notably: A more flexible growth cap, allowing the Group to vary the speed of policy growth in response to cyclical changes in underwriting profitability Revision of the profit commission structure: Although these new terms are not expected to have a material impact on the results from 2007 to 2009, they could potentially lead to substantial increases in the level of profit commission earned in 2010 and beyond, should the cycle turn as expected The new quota share contracts with Swiss Re and Partner Re provide protection against a negative insurance result.
Whilst there is a cap on the extent of protection provided by the Swiss Re contract, cover exists throughout the range of probable loss ratio outcomes.
The profit commission arrangements under these two contracts allow Admiral a greater share of the underwriting result than the 2006 quota share contracts with Swiss Re and Axis Re.
The potential split of the net UK motor business over the next three years is as follows: 2007 2008 2009 Great Lakes 60.0% 55.0% 50.0% Swiss Re 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% Partner Re 7.5% 7.5% - Maximum available to Admiral 22.5% 27.5% 40.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% The Group retains 35% of the Spanish motor risks, with 65% being reinsured by Munich Re under a long term treaty on similar terms to the UK contract.
A D M I R A L G R O U P p l c 2 1 Underwriting results Total premiums increased by 6% from 534m to 567m, and all Group brands again increased in size.
Premium growth was somewhat lower than policy count growth, due primarily to lower average premiums resulting from a mix effect.
Premium rates were again broadly flat across the year.
The Groups Spanish motor insurance business generated around 0.6m of premium during 2006, in two months of trading.
The number of quotes the UK direct brands gave showed another large increase in 2006 up almost 60% from 9.7m to 15.4m.
Continued and substantial growth in Confused.
com further detail below and other aggregator volume were the principal reasons.
Net insurance premium revenue increased by around 4% from 139.5m to 145.0m.
This increase was lower than the rise in written premiums due to the reduction in the retention of premium from 30% in 2005 to 25% in 2006.
The reported loss ratio increased by around 2 points from 70% to 72%.
Reserve releases continued to form a significant part of the underwriting result, rising from 17.3m to 20.9m in 2006 refer to note 19.
In relative terms, the 2006 release improves the loss ratio by around 14 points, whereas 2005s release contributed 12 points.
This means the pure year loss ratio has worsened by around 4 points, from 82% to 86%.
This increase is broadly in line with claims inflation experience.
Movements in loss ratios are 120 further discussed in the Chief Executives statement.
100 The motor expense ratio increased from 15.1% to 15.8% in 2006, reflecting expense inflation with little movement in premium rates.
Excluding regulatory levies, the figures are 12.3% in 2005 and 12.9% in 2006.
80 The expense ratio is reconciled to the figures included in the income statement in note 9 below, whilst 60 the underwriting result is reconciled later in this review.
40 Combined ratio development The Groups combined ratio being the aggregation of the loss and expense ratios above has 20 risen by around 2 points, from 85% to 87%.
This compares to an expected combined ratio for the overall UK motor market in 2006 of around 109% source Deloitte - an outperformance 0 consistent with previous years of around 20 points.
Further detail on market results is set out in the Chief Executives statement.

This was due to the increased combined ratio 87% v 85% and also a fall in investment income.
Some additional ratios are noted in the Chief Executives statement firstly the ratio of total outgoings to net income at 58% 2005: 60% and secondly the ratio of profit to net income at 53% 2005: 51%.
Reconciliations to the figures in the accounts are set out at the end of this review.
Profit commission The Group earns profit commission through its co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements.
The amount receivable is dependent on the volume and profitability of the insurance business, measured by reference to loss and expense ratios.
Profit commission co-insurance The principal source of profit commission is the long-term co-insurance contract with Great Lakes.
15.4m has been recognised in 2006, compared to 11.1m in 2005.
The increase compared to last year reflects additional income recognised resulting from improvements in reported loss ratios on earlier underwriting years predominantly 2003 and 2004.
A further 2.0m of profit commission 2005: 0.5m relating to earlier underwriting years 2000 2002 contracts with Hibernian Re has also been recognised in these results.
No further material amounts are anticipated relating to these contracts due to the relative maturity of the underwriting results of these years.
Profit commission quota share reinsurance A total of 2.5m has been recognised during 2006 2005: 3.1m from quota share profit commission arrangements.
As noted above, the new quota share deals for 2007 and beyond include scope for the Group to earn a larger share of the underwriting result than the 2006 and earlier contracts.
Ancillary and other net income This figure can be broken down as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Ancillary profit 67,022 59,092 Interest income 4,539 4,176 Instalment income 5,676 3,768 Gladiator profit 2,025 1,871 Other expenses and share scheme costs 3,277 3,391 Ancillary and other net income 75,985 65,516 Ancillary profit and instalment income This primarily involves commissions and fees earned on sales of insurance products and services complementing the motor policy, but which are underwritten by external parties.
Net contribution from these sales grew by 13% in 2006 from 59.1m to 67.0m.
Average gross income per motor policy sold in the UK increased from 56 in 2005 to just under 58 in 2006.
Ancillary income per average active vehicle rose from 68.5 to 69.3.
A D M I R A L G R O U P p l c 2 Gladiator Gladiator enjoyed another good year, contributing 2.0m to the Group, up from 1.9m in 2005.
2006 was a transitional year for Gladiator as the commercial vehicle market shifted towards a predominately internet based distribution channel.
This has predictably led to increased competition within the sector, which has in turn led to increases in acquisition costs and softening of premium rates.
Gladiator successfully managed this change and increased new business volumes by 27% whilst maintaining its expense ratio.
During 2006, Gladiator also grew its overall active policy base by 16% and returned a 34% net operating margin 36% in 2005.
com earns a proportion of its revenue from Group brands in the form of commission charged at normal commercial rates.
The 2006 Confused result includes these transactions, with a corresponding reduction in the underwriting profit.
Previously an adjustment was made for these intra-group sales.
The impact of this adjustment on the 2005 figures was to decrease Confused profit by 1.9m.
Confused enjoyed a year of substantial growth in 2006.
Increased media activity led to an increase in the number of quotes provided by Confused of almost 120%, from 4.1m in 2005 to 9.0m in 2006.
Revenue including payments from Admiral Group brands increased by around 150% to 38.5m.
Profit including intra-Group sales rose 162% to 23.1m from 8.8m in 2005.
The 2005 figure differs from that in the table due to the 1.9m adjustment referred to above.
Despite a number of new entrants entering the market during 2006, Confused has successfully maintained its share of total motor sales generated by aggregators and remains the market leader in motor insurance aggregation.
In addition to its core motor insurance offering, Confuseds home insurance product also grew significantly in 2006 quotes rising almost fivefold to 0.5m.
New price comparison solutions for breakdown, travel insurance and utilities were also added to the Confused website.
es At the end of October 2006, the Group successfully launched its first operation outside of the UK.
es, a direct motor insurer based on the Groups UK model, is located in Seville, Spain and generated around 0.6m of premium in the short period before the year-end, making a pre-tax loss including start-up costs of around 0.6m.
Balumba trades via two branches of UK companies EUI Limited and Admiral Insurance Company Limited.
Whilst it is still very early days for Balumba, management are encouraged by the results to date, and hope to replicate the model in other markets in the future.
Financial Review 18 - 27 2 4 f I N A N C I A L R e v I e W Earnings per share EPS Earnings per share rose 22% from 32.7p to 39.8p in 2006, broadly in line with the increase in profits.
Taxation The total taxation charge reported in the income statement is 43.6m 2005: 34.8m, representing 29.6% 2005: 29.1% of pre-tax profit.
The lower effective rate in 2005 arose from utilisation of losses brought forward.
Refer to note 13 to the accounts for further detail on taxation.
Investments and cash The Group continues to generate significant amounts of cash from all aspects of its operations.
At the end of the year, the Group held a total of 448.9m in cash and investments an increase of 11% on the 406.1m held at the end of 2005.
This increase is after distributions to shareholders of 70.1m during 2006 49.2m in 2005.
The balances making up this total can be analysed as follows: 2006 2005 Liquid funds in underwriting companies: 000 000 Money market funds 257,634 - Government and sovereign bond holdings - 83,071 Corporate bonds and similar instruments - 172,866 Deposits with credit institutions 26,253 40,646 Cash at bank 63,337 39,824 347,224 336,407 Liquid funds held outside underwriting companies: Cash at bank 101,652 69,682 448,876 406,089 During the last quarter of 2006, the Group changed its investment strategy, moving away from fixed income mandates and into money market funds.
This decision was motivated by the disappointing and volatile returns generated by the bond portfolios during 2006 and a desire for stable, relatively risk free returns in 2007 as the UK motor market cycle potentially hits its worst point.
To this end, a number of money market fund accounts have been set up, into which the existing funds were transferred and future cashflows will be invested.
The bond portfolios were fully liquidated before the year-end.
A D M I R A L G R O U P p l c 2 5 Dividends There has been no change in dividend policy, which is based on the principle of returning excess cash to shareholders.
The Directors expect to make a normal distribution of at least 45% of posttax profits each half-year, and will regularly review the Groups available resources to determine whether it is appropriate for the Company to pay further special dividends.
Having regard to this policy, as outlined in the Chairmans statement, the Directors have declared a final dividend for 2006 of 24.0p per share, which is made up of 9.6p per share normal element, plus 14.4p per share special distribution based on the Groups resources at the end of the year.
The distribution includes 13.5m 5.2p relating to the release of capital previously held at Lloyds, which was achieved during the second half of the year.
10m of this release has been retained in order to assess the potential need for additional capital to support growth over the short term.
Taken together with the interim dividend 12.1p, this final payment results in a total distribution for 2006 of 36.1p 2005: 24.6p per share.
Employee share schemes The Board continues to take the view that actual or prospective share ownership plays a vital role in staff incentivisation across all levels of employee.
The Group has two share schemes an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP and the Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan - The Unapproved Free Share Scheme.
The Approved Share Incentive Plan SIP This SIP is open to all staff of Admiral Group plc Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have declined to be included in the plan.
The maximum award under the SIP is 3,000 per employee per annum, those shares being forfeited if staff leave within three years of the award.
As the scheme is Inland Revenue approved, awards will be free of income tax after five years.
The 3,000 limit is based on the market value of the shares at the date of award.
Awards are made twice a year, based on the results of each half-year.
During 2005 and 2006, the Groups results have meant that qualifying staff have received maximum awards in both years.
Inland Revenue rules dictate that staff must hold the shares for three years before being able to sell them, but dividends will be payable during the vesting period.
If a member of staff leaves the Group before the end of the three year period, without being a good leaver, they get no benefit from the shares not yet vested.
Further details of the awards - actual and anticipated - are included in note 26 below.
Financial Review 18 - 27 2 6 f I N A N C I A L R e v I e W 2 The Unapproved Free Share Scheme UFSS The UFSS is not Inland Revenue approved.
Awards under the plan are made at the discretion of the Chief Executive and Senior Managers, with approval being obtained from the Remuneration Committee.
Awards under the plan are distributed on a wider basis than most plans of this type.
The Board believes that as the UFSS develops and awards begin to vest in 2008, it will have the effect of reducing staff attrition and creating a definite alignment of the interests of staff and shareholders.
Of the Groups current Executive Directors, only Kevin Chidwick participates in this scheme.
The main performance criterion in determining awards under the Unapproved Plan will be the growth in earnings per share EPS in excess of a risk free return, defined as average 3-month LIBOR, over a three year period.
The Board feels that this is a good indicator of long-term shareholder return with which to align staff incentivisation.
Although no shares have yet vested under the UFSS, awards totalling 685,000 shares were made in 2005 and 681,000 in 2006.
This represents 0.5% of the Groups issued share capital over the two years.
The EPS targets are such that for full vesting of shares to occur, the average EPS growth over the three year performance period would have to be approximately 16% per annum, assuming LIBOR averages 5%.
Only 10% of shares vest for matching LIBOR over the three year period.
The Board is conscious of the maximum allowable awards under both schemes and controls are in place to ensure that neither scheme issues shares in excess of 5% of the Groups issued share capital over the 10 year period from 1 January 2005.
