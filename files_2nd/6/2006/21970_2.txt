Introduction The financial results for the 2006 and 2005 financial years reect the continued strong growth in new wave services as we drive value from transforming the business.
Our results reect the continuing transformation of our business operations and markets in an environment where the pace of change is accelerating.
We are driving the change by providing our customers with new technology and services with greater capabilities and lower cost.
The focus on delivering the strategy continued and the groups performance benefited from the growth in new wave activities, such as networked IT services, broadband and mobility, and our continued cost efficiency programmes.
Our global networked IT services business has grown and our global capabilities have been strengthened by the successful acquisitions of Infonet and Albacom in 2005 and Radianz and Atlanet in 2006.
In this Financial review the commentary is focused principally on the trading results of the group before specic items.
Specic items, by virtue of their size or nature, are excluded because they predominantly relate to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group.
This is also consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management.
Hence trading results before specic items are key financial performance indicators since they allow a meaningful comparison to be made of the trading results of the group during the period under review.
Specic items are therefore analysed and discussed separately from the line of business results in this Financial review because they are considered to be a reection of the corporate activity rather than the trading activity of the lines of business.
The commentary in this Financial review also discusses trading results including and excluding the impact of acquisitions.
In discussing underlying performance excluding the impact of acquisitions we exclude the results of the Albacom and Infonet acquisitions made in the 2005 financial year.
The Radianz and Atlanet acquisitions made in the 2006 financial year do not have a significant impact on the group results for the year and hence are not excluded when discussing underlying performance in 2006.
The following table shows the summarised income statement which includes a reconciliation of the key performance measures before and after specic items and is discussed further in this Financial review.
The operating results by line of business are discussed in addition to the overall group results as we believe the activities and markets they serve are distinct and this analysis provides a greater degree of insight to investors.
