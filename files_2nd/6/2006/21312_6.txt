Goals Barclays primary focus is to deliver superior value to its shareholders.
The primary goal remains to achieve top quartile total shareholder return TSR relative to a peer group of 11 other UK and international financial services institutions.
TSR is defined as the value created for shareholders through share price appreciation, plus reinvested dividend payments.
In 2004, we announced a new performance cycle TSR goal for the 2004 to 2007 period.
The TSR peer group is reviewed annually to ensure it aligns with our business mix and the direction and scale of our ambition.
The peer group for 2006 was: ABN Amro, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HBOS, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.
For 2007 the peer group is unchanged.
For the first three years of the new goal period, from 31st December 2003 to 31st December 2006, Barclays was positioned sixth within its peer group, which is second quartile TSR performance.
In addition, economic profit EP is used to support the pursuit of the top quartile TSR goal.
The strategies we follow and the actions we take are aligned to value creation for all stakeholders.
Barclays uses EP, a non-IFRS measure, as a key indicator of performance because it believes that it provides important discipline in decisionmaking.
Barclays believes that EP encourages both profitable growth and the efficient use of capital.
More information on the reconciliation of EP to profit before tax can be found on page 51.
At the time of setting the TSR goal, we estimated that achieving top quartile TSR would require the achievement of compound annual growth in economic profit of 10% to 13% per annum 6.5bn to 7.0bn cumulative economic profit over the 2004 to 2007 goal period.
Economic profit for 2006 was 2.7bn, which, added to the 3.3bn generated in 2004 and 2005, delivered a cumulative total of 6.0bn for the goal period to date.
This equates to compound annual growth in economic profit of 28% per annum for the goal period to date.

Barclays PLC 58 Annual Report 2006 Operating review 1 Capital ratios Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Group, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision the Basel Committee and European Union Directives, as implemented by the Financial Services Authority FSA for supervisory purposes.
These techniques include the risk asset ratio calculation, which the FSA regards as a key supervisory tool.
The FSA sets ratio requirements for individual banks in the UK at or above the internationally agreed minimum of 8%.
The ratio calculation involves the application of designated risk weightings to reflect an estimate of credit, market and other risks associated with broad categories of transactions and counterparties.
Regulatory guidelines define three Tiers of capital resources.
Tier 1 capital, comprising mainly shareholders funds and including Reserve Capital Instruments and Tier One Notes, is the highest tier and can be used to meet trading and banking activity requirements.
Tier 2 includes perpetual, medium-term and long-term subordinated debt and collectively assessed impairment allowances.
Tier 2 capital can also be used to support both trading and banking activities.
Tier 3 capital also comprises short-term subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of two years.
The use of tier 3 capital is restricted to trading activities only and it is not eligible to support counterparty or settlement risk.
The aggregate of Tiers 2 and 3 capital included in the risk asset ratio calculation may not exceed Tier 1 capital.
From 31st December 2005, total net capital resources rose 4.2bn and risk weighted assets increased 28.7bn.
Tier 1 capital rose 4.1bn, including 2.8bn arising from profits attributable to equity shareholders net of dividends paid.
Minority interests within Tier 1 capital increased 1.3bn primarily due to the issuance of 1.2bn of Reserve Capital Instruments and 0.7bn of Preference Shares partially offset by a decrease in regulatory associates of 0.4bn driven by the sale of FirstCaribbean International Bank and exchange rate movements of 0.5bn.
Tier 2 capital increased 0.7bn mainly as a result of the issuance of 1.5bn of loan capital partially offset by exchange rate movements of 0.6bn and redemptions of 0.4bn.
Similar movements are reflected in the risk weighted assets and total net capital resources of Barclays Bank PLC Group, however the retention by Barclays PLC of dividends paid by Barclays Bank PLC gave rise to a reduction in the capital of Barclays Bank PLC Group relative to that of Barclays PLC Group, resulting in Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 7.5% and 11.5% respectively.
The weakening of the Rand against Sterling had a positive impact on capital ratios in 2006.
Note a Regulatory capital, risk weighted assets and resultant capital ratios for 2004 are based on UK GAAP and have not been restated as these remain as reported to the FSA.
As at 1st January 2005, for Barclays PLC Group and Barclays Bank PLC Group the tier 1 ratio was 7.1% and the risk asset ratio was 11.8% reflecting the impact of IFRS including the adoption of IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 4.
