38 Operating and financial review continued Financial Review Headline results profit before tax increased by 80.4% to 2,359.2m as compared to 1,307.5m for 2005.
Revenue profit, our measure of underlying profit before tax, increased by 8.2% from 361.8m to 391.3m.
Earnings per share were 357.95p, up 57.5% 2005: 227.32p with adjusted, diluted earnings per share at 70.47p showing a 5.4% increase on the prior year 2005: 66.87p.
The combined portfolio rose in value from 9.4bn to 12.9bn, which included a valuation surplus of 1,683.1m or 15.3%.
More detail of this performance is contained in the Investment Property Business review.
Net assets per share rose by 23.5% to 1597p from 1293p, with adjusted diluted net assets per share rising by 28.5% to 1912p 2005: 1488p.
profit before tax Under IFRS, profit before tax effectively represents the total pre-tax return to shareholders for the year, including both realised and unrealised gains and losses on the value of our investment properties.
Previously, unrealised gains and losses were taken directly to reserves without being recognised in the income statement.
In 2006, profit before tax increased by 80.4% to 2,359.2m, representing a pre-tax return of 39.0% on shareholders equity at the beginning of the year.

B The disposal of our interest in the Telereal joint venture was completed on 30 September 2005.
C Distributions from Telereal were signicantly higher in 2005, reecting a full year and higher levels of property sales.
D This represents a full years reduction in interest charges compared to a part year in the prior period resulting from the debt restructuring in November 2004.
E Capitalised interest is higher than last year due to greater levels of investment in developments, principally at Cardinal Place and Bankside 2 and 3.
F The debt instruments issued as part of the renancing in November 2004 do not meet the requirements of IAS 39 as they are not deemed to be substantially different from the debt they replaced.
As a result, the book value of the new instruments is reduced to the book value of the debt it replaced and the difference is amortised over the life of the new instruments.
This years charge was for the full year compared to five months in the prior period.
G Higher levels of activity, primarily the recognition of profits from the development contract to build Bankside 1 for IPC.
H Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Tops Estates PLC in June 2005, against which full provision has been made, is principally attributable to deferred tax on the revaluation of its investment properties.
I Better performance on DWP contract, largely offset by the lower unitary charge from the BBC contract.

Land Securities Annual Report 2006 39 Operating and financial review continued Revenue profit Table 7: Reconciliation of profit before tax to revenue profit Revenue profit is our measure of the underlying pre-tax income of the Group.
It is a financial measure we use internally to report our results and includes the pre-tax results of our joint ventures 2006 2005 m m but excludes capital and other one-off items such as the valuation surplus and gains on disposals.
profit before tax 2,359.2 1,307.5 For this year end, we have amended our denition of revenue profit to exclude trading profits and Revaluation surpluses Group 1,579.5 827.9 long-term contract income as both of these are considered more capital in nature than revenue.

The main reasons for this Mark-to-market adjustment on interest rate swaps 2.2 2.7 increase are detailed in Table 6.
Under our old denition, revenue profit including trading profits Eliminate effect of bond exchange and long-term contract income increased by 8.4% from 401.3m to 434.9m.

The growth in earnings Joint venture tax adjustment 37.5 45.7 per share, however, has also been impacted by a rise in the tax rate.

The adjustments to earnings per share are set out in note 11 to the financial statements and are based on the guidance given by EPRA with a limited number of further adjustments to reect better our underlying earnings.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose from 66.87p per share in 2005 to 70.47p per share in 2006, a 5.4% increase.
The growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share is largely due to the items related to changes in revenue profit as well as the lower profits on sale of trading properties and higher long-term contract income.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share has not grown as strongly as revenue profit because of the higher current tax rate discussed below.
Dividend We are recommending a final dividend of 28.55p per share this year, compared to 32.85p in 2005.
Taken together with the interim dividend of 18.15p 2005: 10.40p, the total dividend of 46.70p represents an increase of 8% over last years total of 43.25p.
The lower proposed final dividend is more than offset by this years higher interim dividend, which reected our move to pay approximately 40% of our total dividend at the interim stage.
This dividend for 2006 is covered 1.5 times by adjusted earnings 2005: 1.6 times.
Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 19 July 2006, the final dividend will be paid on 24 July 2006 to shareholders on the register on 23 June 2006.
The decision to increase our dividend by 8% is both a reection of the growth in revenue profit and our view that the introduction of REITs will increase the focus of listed property companies on dividend payout ratios, irrespective of whether or not they convert to REIT status.
Our aim will continue to be to deliver steady dividend growth, although we recognise the quantum of future dividends will be inuenced by whether or not we choose to become a REIT.

In total we invested 2,353.4m in our properties including 1,429.2m on direct acquisitions and 579.1m on corporate acquisitions.
From our joint ventures, we received a net 133.8m, largely as a result of new nancing that was put in place during the year.
The factors contributing to this increase in net debt are shown in Table 9.

investment in our development programme and suitable investment properties.
As noted above, we have successfully invested in the business but strong growth in the valuation of our portfolio has limited the increase in gearing.
It is important, however, to put our gearing ratio into context.
The gearing ratio only reects our year end net debt position and not the average net debt during the period, which was 3.1bn 2005: 2.7bn.
Furthermore, the increase in value of our Land Securities Annual Report 2006 41 Operating and financial review continued properties is largely driven by yield shift as opposed to increased rental income.
The gearing ratio Figure 1: Funding structure is not the key measure of our ability to service the increase in debt.
The more appropriate measure is interest cover.
3 Secured Group Total property assets: 9.4bn Land Securities PLC Fixed and Despite the increase in our year end net debt, our interest cover ratio, excluding our share of joint floating Subsidiaries of Land Securities PLC charges over ventures, has improved from 2.39 times in 2005 to 2.65 times in 2006.

loans secured debt Secured lenders Other lenders While Land Securities may have lower financial gearing than some other listed property companies, it has significant operational gearing through its exposure to a large development pipeline.
Asset transfers and Developments tend to provide a greater percentage valuation change than conventional investment inter-company funding permitted properties, with this being magnied by any change in yields or in occupier demand.
Developments also carry a higher risk around timing, cost to completion and subsequent letting.
Non-restricted Group On the basis of our interest cover ratio and the significant amount of funds available to us we would be prepared to see our financial gearing rise modestly from its current position.

Both of these issues were addressed in the last financial year with the introduction of a new funding structure as illustrated in Figure 1.
Operational exibility is afforded through provisions which allow us to buy and sell assets easily as well as maintain our development programme.
A committed revolving credit facility as part of the funding structure provides us with the financial exibility to draw and repay loans at will, and react swiftly to investment opportunities.
The cost effectiveness of the structure is achieved by providing lenders with security over a large proportion of our investment properties, resulting in lower interest margins than an unsecured structure.
During the course of the year, we issued our first two new sterling bonds within the secured Figure 2: Expected debt maturities nominal structure through our 4bn Note programme.
The first was an issue of 400m with a xed coupon m of 4.875% and an expected maturity of 2017.
The second was a 300m 4.625% xed rate bond 1000 with an expected maturity of 2011.
To illustrate the efficiency and exibility of our funding structure, the more recent of the two bond issues took four working days from Board approval 900 to pricing at an effective spread to the prevailing LIBOR of 0.09%.

Committed 600 but undrawn facilities amounted to 1,252.0m.
The Group also has 123.5m of uncommitted 500 facilities.
The maturity prole of the Groups debt is shown in Figure 2.
The majority of debt in less 400 than one year relates to drawings under the committed facility which has a final maturity in November 2009.

At the year end we had 858.2m of hedges in place, and our debt was 92% xed.
Consequently, based on year end debt levels, a 1% rise in interest rates would increase full year interest charges by only 3.2m.
Future funding The Groups modest gearing levels and interest cover provide significant debt capacity to meet its projected capital requirements.
Market capacity remains in Sterling and the Group has the exibility if necessary to tap other markets such as the Euro.
With 1.25bn of committed but undrawn facilities, the Group is confident that it will be able to finance its planned capital commitments.
Taxation Table 11: Taxation The tax charge for the year is 683.3m, giving an effective rate of 29.0% 2005: 18.9%.
The lower Effective tax rate Ordinary Exceptional Total tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to higher prior year adjustments and a lower effective rate of tax profit before tax 2,130.7 228.5 2,359.2 on property disposals.
The tax rate on profit before exceptional items is lower at 27.8% 2005: Tax charge 593.3 90.0 683.3 19.2%.
The tax rate on exceptional items is higher than the standard rate largely due to the impact Effective tax rate 27.8% 39.4% 29.0% of the Tops Estates goodwill impairment, which cannot be offset against taxable profits.
IFRS requires that full provision is made for the deferred tax liability associated with the revaluation of investment properties.
Accordingly, the tax charge includes deferred tax of 473.9m on revaluation gains arising in the period 2005: 248.3m.
The current or cash tax charge for the year, before tax on exceptional items and property disposals, is 76.9m.
If we adjust this for tax related to prior years and the IFRS bond amortisation which is not tax deductible, we have an effective rate of 23.2%.
This rate reects the benets of approximately 80m of gross capital allowances on developments as well as tax deductions available for capitalised interest.
The equivalent rate for 2005 is not comparable due to the losses generated by the Group renancing in the period.
Pension schemes The Group operates a number of dened benefit pension schemes which are closed to new members.
At 31 March 2006 the schemes had a combined deficit, net of deferred tax of 4.5m 2005: 7.6m.
During the year we made a further special contribution of 1.5m 2005: 11.5m to the principal dened benefit pension scheme and we are maintaining our enhanced contribution rate to address the relatively small deficit.
During the year we introduced amendments to the main scheme which were adopted by the Trustees for active members who have given their consent.
As a result, active members will have their accrued entitlement at 31 March 2006 linked to ination, with future benets accruing according to annual earnings.
The effect of this has been a reduction of approximately 8.3m 5.8m net of tax in the Groups pension liability associated with funding future anticipated salary increases.
Key financial risks Table 12 outlines the main tax, treasury and accounting risks facing the business.
The first three risks are discussed elsewhere in the report as indicated in the table.
The risk around IFRS mainly relates to uncertainty within the accounting community on how the new standards should be applied to specic circumstances.
An example of this is our treatment of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Tops Estates, where an alternative view of the relevant accounting standard may require us, initially at least, to retain the goodwill arising on the acquisition as opposed to impairing it immediately.
The potential for uncertainty in accounting treatment, however, is more likely to occur in Land Securities Trillium where the complicated nature and interaction of the risks being borne under each contract can result in different views on accounting treatment.
On potential new contracts, differences in interpretation of, or future amendments to, IFRS present some risk to profit recognition.
However, the primary consideration for all new contracts is cashow which is unaffected by accounting treatment.
