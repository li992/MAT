We do not trade in financial instruments.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.

On a daily basis, we aggregate the bank balances or borrowings in all the Groups operating companies into a total cash or borrowing figure, so we can obtain the most advantageous offset arrangements and interest rate.
Construction maintains significant cash balances, while housebuilding requires net investment.
Combined, the two businesses minimise the need for external finance.
