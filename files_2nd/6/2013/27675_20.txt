Group capital resources is the sum of all the business units net capital resources, calculated as each business units stand-alone capital resources less the book value of the Groups investment: the Group capital resources requirement is the sum of all the business units capital requirements.
Both the capital resources and the capital requirements fluctuate with changes in exchange rates.
The contribution made by each business unit to the Groups regulatory surplus is different from the locally reported surplus as the latter is determined without the deduction for the book value of the Groups investment.
Thus, although all the Groups major business units have robust local solvency surpluses, not all make a positive contribution to the Groups FGD position.
