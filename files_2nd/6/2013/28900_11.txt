36 FINANCIAL REVIEW INTRODUCTION STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL REVIEW RICHARD HOUGHTON THE GROUP FACED A VERY Group Chief Financial Officer CHALLENGING YEAR IN 2013.
DESPITE THIS, THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESSES REMAINS ENCOURAGING.
RESULTS OVERVIEW 2013 was an extremely disappointing year for the Group.
The loss after tax of 338m 2012: 327m profit reflected the impact of the issues we faced in Ireland during the year, adverse weather across Scandinavia, Canada and the UK, as well as write downs of software intangible assets and goodwill.
Despite this, there have been some good underlying performances, and on a 1 normalised basis the result was a post-tax profit of 304m.
In December, following a detailed review of the capital position of the Group, the Board agreed that a full review of the business should be undertaken.
The progress of this review, which was announced together with the Groups preliminary results on 27 February 2014, has enabled us to strengthen our capital position, and begin focusing the Group for 2014 and beyond.
NET WRITTEN PREMIUMS Net written premiums were up 3% at constant exchange to 8.7bn up 4% as reported.
Continued good growth in Canada and Emerging Markets, up 11% and 16% respectively, was offset by the UK and Western Europe which was down 4%, whilst Scandinavia was flat.
