Revenue in Direct Energy increased, predominantly reflecting the impact of higher gas which will benefit and power volumes and the acquisition of the Hess Energy Marketing business which completed in November.
Revenue around 700,000 increased in Centrica Energy, with higher gas and liquids production due to the full-year impact of the 2012 asset purchases and higher achieved gas and liquids prices in individual shareholders Europe.

34 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Performance Measures Shareholder Information Adjusted operating profit continued In Direct Energy, overall profitability decreased, as increases in residential energy supply and residential and business services operating profit, resulting from previous acquisitions and services account growth, were more than offset by decreased profitability in the business energy supply segment, which experienced margin pressure on power sales in a competitive environment.
In Centrica Energy, overall profitability increased, with higher operating profit in the gas segment more than offsetting lower power operating profit.
In the gas segment, higher gas and liquids production and higher achieved prices in Europe more than offset the impact of increased unit costs.
In the power segment, profitability decreased following the loss of free carbon allowances.
In Centrica Storage, reduced seasonal gas price differentials led to lower profitability.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 | 35 Strategic Report Statutory profit and basic EPS Group Financial Review The statutory profit for the year was 950 million 2012: 1,245 continued million.
The reconciling items between Group profit for the year 950m from business performance and statutory profit are related to 2012: 1,245 million exceptional items and certain re-measurements.
The decrease compared with 2012 is principally due to an increased net exceptional charge of 667 million 2012: 481 million and a reduced gain from certain re-measurements of 284 million 2012: 404 million.
The Group reported a statutory basic EPS of 18.4 pence 2012: 24.0 pence.
Dividend In addition to the interim dividend of 4.92 pence per share, we propose a final dividend of 12.08 pence, giving a total ordinary 17.0p dividend of 17.0 pence for the year 2012: 16.4 pence, an 2012: 16.4 pence increase of 4%.
Cash flow Group operating cash flow before movements in working capital was higher at 3,737 million 2012: 3,542 million, with 2,940m the full year impact of the 2012 upstream asset purchases being 2012: 2,820 million the main contributing factor.
After working capital adjustments, tax and payments relating to exceptional charges, net cash flow from operating activities was 2,940 million 2012: 2,820 million.
The net cash outflow from investing activities was lower at 2,351million 2012: 2,558 million, predominantly reflecting the receipt of a larger nuclear dividend and increased proceeds from the disposal of businesses.
The net cash outflow from financing activities was 791million 2012: inflow of 190 million.
The outflow mainly reflects the impact of the Groups 500 million share repurchase programme, fully undertaken during the year and a reduced net issuance of debt during the period of 809 million 2012: 1,196 million.
net debt and net assets Reflecting all of the above, the Groups net debt at 31 December 2013 was 5,049 million 2012: 4,047 million.
5,049m During the year net assets decreased to 5,257 million 2012: 4,047 million 2012: 5,927 million, reflecting the impact of the Groups share net debt repurchase programme, actuarial losses on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and foreign currency movements on the retranslation of foreign subsidiaries.

Taxation on these charges generated a credit of 397 million 2012: 93 million while there was a 40 million exceptional tax charge in 2012 related to the effect of a change in upstream UK tax rates.
This resulted in exceptional post-tax charges of 667 million 2012: 481 million.
Following reserve and resources downgrades and increases in expected costs on the Seven Seas, York and Ensign fields in the Southern North Sea and a weaker outlook for North American natural gas prices and an increase in the discount rate applicable to North American assets, the Group recognised pre-tax impairment charges of 699 million relating to UK and Canadian exploration and production assets.
Taxation on these charges generated a credit of 381 million, resulting in exceptional post-tax charges of 318million.
In September, in the light of weak economics for new storage projects and the UK Governments announcement ruling out incentivisation for gas storage capacity to be built in the UK, Centrica announced its decision not to proceed with the Baird offshore gas storage project and to put the onshore project at Caythorpe on hold indefinitely.
As a result, the Group has recorded 240 million of impairments and provision charges as exceptional operating costs.
Taxation on these charges generated a credit of 16 million resulting in exceptional post-tax charges of 224 million.
The Group also recognised a further onerous contract charge of 125 million no tax impact for the Rijnmond power tolling contract in theNetherlands as a result of decreases in expected future revenues.
Certain re-measurements As an integrated energy business the Group enters into a number of forward energy trades to protect and optimise the value of its underlying production, generation, storage and transportation assets and similar capacity or off-take contracts, as well as to meet the future needs of our customers.
A number of these arrangements are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are required to be fair-valued under IAS39.
The Group has shown the fair value adjustments on these commodity derivative trades separately as certain re-measurements, as they do not reflect the underlying performance of the business because they are economically related to our upstream assets, capacity off-take contracts or downstream demand, which are typically not fair valued.
The operating profit in the statutory results includes net gains of 438 million 2012: 597 million relating to these re-measurements, of which there are a number of elements.
The Group recognises the realised gains and losses on these contracts in business performance when the underlying transaction occurs.
The profits arising from the physical purchase and sale of commodities during the year, which reflect the prices in the underlying contracts, are not impacted by these re-measurements.
