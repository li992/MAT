20 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Balance sheet Fixed Assets Capital expenditure in the year was 580m 2012: 476m with 521m invested in the rental fleet 2012: 426m.
Capital expenditure by division is as follows: 2013 2012 replacement Growth total Total Sunbelt in $m 330.3 383.4 713.7 596.2 Sunbelt in m 212.2 246.3 458.5 367.2 A-Plant 50.7 11.8 62.5 59.0 Total rental equipment 262.9 258.1 521.0 426.2 Delivery vehicles, property improvements and IT equipment 59.4 50.2 Total additions 580.4 476.4 Expenditure on rental equipment was 90% of total capital expenditure with the balance relating to the delivery vehicle fleet, property improvements and IT equipment.
US demand remained strong and, as a result, $383m of rental equipment capital expenditure was spent on growth while $330m was invested in replacement of existing fleet.
The growth proportion is estimated on the basis of the assumption that maintenance capital expenditure in any period is equal to the original cost of equipment sold.
Reflecting the strong market conditions, we pulled forward around $100m of capital expenditure into the fourth quarter.
The average age of the Groups serialised rental equipment, which constitutes the substantial majority of our fleet, at 30 April 2013 was 32 months 2012: 37 months on a net book value basis.
Sunbelts fleet had an average age of 30 months 2012: 36 months while A-Plants fleet had an average age of 40 months 2012: 41 months.
Our preliminary capital expenditure plan for next year is for gross additions of around 560m, a similar level to this year.
However, we expect a greater proportion of next years spend will be directed to growth rather than replacement as we keep fleet age broadly stable rather than continuing to fide-age.
As always, our capital expenditure plans remain flexible depending on market conditions and we will adjust our plans appropriately during the course of the year.
This level of expenditure is consistent with our strategy at this stage in the cycle of investing in organic growth, opening greenfield sites and continuing to reduce our leverage.
