We also made significant progress with key operating goals of advancing our pipeline and building our capabilities.
Specifically, we intend to invest in a third specialist sales team to support our PEM product, which we anticipate could be approved and launched in the first half of 2014.
We also plan to initiate a number of clinical studies to support expansion of the approved uses of our Bead products.
A core part of our strategy is to acquire products and programmes: we continue to review opportunities and we are in a strong position financially and in terms of capabilities to expand our portfolio with complementary products.
Overall, the business is in good shape: we have the financial resources, capabilities and opportunities to enable us to continue building value and to deliver further profitable growth.
