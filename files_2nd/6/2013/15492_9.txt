34 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Operating and financial review continued Review of key performance indicators KPIs During the year the Group undertook a review of its operational KPIs.
It was concluded that EBITA per sold kW should be a reported KPI as the Group focuses on maximising returns on investment.
As the new KPI uses a power rather than a space metric, it re ects the standard pricing mechanism used within the business and can be more consistently measured than sellable physical space.
The Group is therefore, for the first time, publicly reporting EBITA per sold kW.
Similarly, utilisation and capacity have been reported on a kW rather than a sq.

m, it is not in uenced by the power density of sales.

m are reported for the last time with these results on a like-for-like basis for comparative purposes with previous years.
These metrics were designed at the Groups IPO to give a directional view of changes in occupancy and average revenue per unit, without articulating information directly around pricing, which at the time was considered to be commercially sensitive.
There are a variety of factors that have in uenced trends around these metrics, including: changes in data centre power density: foreign exchange rates: pricing: the mix of sales between different geographies and maturity of data centres: sales of services other than colocation: the pass through of power sales at cost plus zero margin: and methods of occupancy measurement within individual datacentres, which are not homogenous in their design and have therefore been measured on a case-by-case basis.
