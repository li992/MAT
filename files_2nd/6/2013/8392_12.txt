It is expected that the reservoir trust will remove any need for the Group to make future fide cit reduction payments for the foreseeable future.
In addition to the main pension scheme funding arrangements, we have continued to manage other pension liabilities.
Around 180 million of gross liabilities have been transferred on the disposal.
