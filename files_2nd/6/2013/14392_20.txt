com supply relationship, David Galopin, for more information Technical Director at Titeflex Europe, and his team were able to satisfy a range of new technical requirements specific to the A350.
Having already developed the TM lightweight, high-pressure Kevlar hose for Airbus, Titeflex was able to fully meet the A350 requirements.
Advances in our engineering, technology and supply chain, plus a good relationship with Airbus, have allowed us to establish a platform supply contract that we hope to build on over the next 20 years, says Galopin.
This kind of opportunity is rare in the aerospace market.
With around 1,000 A350s due to TM be built, revenues from Titeflexs Kevlar high-pressure hosing could total as much as 30m over the life of the programme.
Thanks to this important project, we are now developing new types of hose for other customers, adds Galopin.
