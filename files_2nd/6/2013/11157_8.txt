Financial review NMC Health delivered a strong performance in 2013 at both the Group and divisional level.
Consolidated Group Revenues increased from US$490.1m in FY2012 to US$550.9m in FY2013, a growth of 12.4%.
After elimination of US$38.6m of intra-group trading revenue, Consolidated Group EBITDA improved from US$79.6m in FY2012 to US$92.9m in FY2013, a growth of 16.7%.
Group Net profit reached US$69.1m in FY2013, yielding Earnings per share EPS of US$ 0.367 compared to US$0.343 for the same period in 2012.
Excluding the effects of one-off items: IPO costs of US$3.4m in 2012 and writeoff of unamortised finance fees of US$3.4m in 2013, the increase in EPS would have been US$ 0.390 in 2013, representing an adjusted increase of 13.7%.
Healthcare division Revenue in the Healthcare division increased from US$ 251.6m in FY2012 to US$289.3m in FY2013, a growth of 15.0%.
EBITDA increased from US$ 68.2m in FY2012 to US$81.7m in FY2013, a growth of 19.8%.
EBITDA margin improved from 27.1% in FY2012 to 28.2% in FY2013.
Distribution division Within the Distribution division, revenues increased from US$271.1m in FY2012 to US$ 300.2m in FY2013, a growth of 10.7%.
EBITDA increased from US$26.2m in FY2012 to US$29.9m in FY2013, a growth of 14.1%.
EBITDA margin improved from 9.7% in FY2012 to 10.0% in FY2013.
Capital Expenditure Capital expenditure incurred for the year was US$82.7m FY2012: US$118.9m.
This encompassed US$72.2m on the Groups capital projects.
The Group also incurred US$7.3m on equipment required across the existing operations.
The Company was able to capitalise certain expenses, in accordance with IFRS and the Companys accounting policies.
We expect this to continue in relation to costs for example lease costs arising during the construction of future projects.
Although pre-operating expenses were nil in the year to 31 December 2013, we expect a small level of pre-operating costs which will be expensed in the 2014 financial year as a result of the opening of new facilities.
As a result of the delays in the opening of certain facilities discussed in Business overview, additional costs in respect of loan interest and leases have been capitalised.
Had these facilities opened in line with original plan these costs would have been expensed.
Other than these items the delays have not resulted in an increase in budgeted capital costs.
A table outlining original estimated capital expenditure and other budgeted costs for each of our current development projects, and a further table setting out costs to date on these projects is set out below.

Following a review certain of these costs have been capitalised in line with the Companys accounting policies for example lease rent paid and finance costs.
The Group expects such costs will continue to be capitalised on these projects during the construction phase.
27 2: The lease in respect of Brightpoint contains a rent free period as well as specified rent increases.
In line with IFRS and the Companys accounting policies, the rental cost of the lease has been adjusted to appropriately account for these items over the length of the lease.
Accounting policies stipulate that the total lease value for the full lease period is divided evenly over the years.
Apart from the projects mentioned above, the Group had spent US$9m on the acquisition of BR Medical Suites during the last financial year as part of the projects announced during the IPO.
The Group has not spent any amount towards the development of the Al Ain Medical Centre as at 31-December- 2013.
The company has reviewed all significant capital expenditure projects including the delayed projects for impairments and have concluded that the projects have sufficient headroom and that none of the assets are impaired.
Cash Net cash inflow from operating activities for the 2013 financial year was US$85.1m, compared with US$35.3m for the comparative period in 2012.
This was mainly due to: improved performance of the Group: and effective management of working capital.
Including funds held on deposit, cash as at 31 December 2013 was at US$268.7m compared to US$ 257.5m at the end of FY 2012.
The company had allocated the funds raised through the IPO as well as through the JP Morgan syndicated loan against the capital cost of the five expansion projects announced during the IPO.
As a result, together with positive operating cashflow, the Company is well financed to complete its capital expenditure program.
As expected, the Group had a net debt position of US$63.7m at 31 December 2013 compared with US$46.1m at 31 December 2012.
As the Group continues with its capital project development program, and the Companys cash is committed to such projects, the level of net debt is expected to increase during FY 2014.
28 Movement in net debt The movement in cash and the level of capital expenditure have had a significant effect on the movement in net debt during the 2013 financial year.
A summary of the principal drivers is shown as follows: Movement of Net Debt Total Debt as at 1 January Total Cash as at 1 January Net Debt as at 1 January 303.6 257.5 46.1 2013 2013 2013 Add: Add: JP Morgan Loan 225.0 Operational cash inflow 85.1 Finance Incomes 5.3 JPM Loan 225.0 315.4 Less: Less: Other Bank facilities & JP Morgan Loan Repayments 21.4 174.8 refinancing Net Movement Other Bank facilities & 174.8 Finance Fee 3.4 refinancing Net Movement JPM Loan Repayments 21.4 Additions & Disposals to 78.6 Property Finance Costs 14.5 Dividends Paid 11.5 304.2 Total Debt as at 31 December Total Cash as at 31 December Net Debt as at 31 December 332.4 268.7 63.7 2013 2013 2013 Working Capital Working capital for our two operating business divisions is funded differently due to the nature of their business models.
The Group is able to fund its working capital requirements for its Healthcare division from operational cash flow, and we do not expect this position to change in the 2014 financial year.
In relation to our Distribution division, the working capital requirement is dependent on a number of factors including the timing of receipt of debtors and the timing of payment of creditors as well as inventory flow during the year and the timing of re-imbursement of promotional expenses agreed with our Principals in relation to the sale and marketing of their products.
The Distribution division requires external working capital facilities throughout the year, the level of which is dependent on business seasonality.
These working capital facilities are arranged through a number of banking providers and in general terms the level of working capital required is between 30%-40% of the Groups total debt facilities.
Long term debt facilities A five year debt facility of up to US$ 300m was made available to the Group during the year by a syndicate of lenders led by J. P. Morgan Chase Bank, to refinance high interest bearing credit lines.
A total of US$ 225m has been drawn down from this facility to date.
The cost of funds for this facility is 3.0% over one month LIBOR.
This rate is substantially lower than the credit lines replaced.
We expect this change to yield a total saving of around US$ 10m over the five year tenure of the loan compared to the previous arrangement, net of the one off of US$3.4m written off in the current year of unamortised finance costs, 29 The total debt of the Group, excluding accounts payable and accruals, was US$332.4m as at 31 December 2013 compared to US$303.6m on 31 December 2012.
Finance costs and income Total finance costs for 2013 were US$14.3m compared to US$ 13.7m in 2012.
This was mainly on account of the increased utilization of working capital lines commensurate with the increase in the activity levels in both the Groups operating segments.
The Groups replacement of high interest bearing credit lines during the year limited, to some extent, the increase in finance costs.
Dividend The Board is proposing to continue with its policy of annual dividend payments of between 20% and 30% of Profit After Tax, outlined in the Companys IPO prospectus in 2012.
The Board is therefore recommending that a final dividend of 4.4 pence per share be paid in cash in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 FY2012: 4.1 pence per share.
