successful integration of the acquisitions completed this year, particularly STW and Cazenove Capital.
As a result of these acquisitions, we have included exceptional items this year to help the reader gain a better understanding of the Groups financial performance.
In line with the recent report from the UKs Financial Reporting Review Panel FRRP of the Financial Report Council FRC, we have looked to ensure that these are presented consistently and disclosed clearly.
The graphs and commentary opposite outline the key changes in our financial performance year-on-year, with record levels of net revenue, profit before tax and assets under management in 2013.
Schroders has made a number of improvements to its financial reporting in recent years in support of the FRCs work to fide-clutter annual reports.
This includes aligning the commentary with the primary financial statements and segmental results and the introduction of a plain English description of the purpose of each note.
This work has continued in 2013 where we have consolidated and simplified further the plain English explanation of both the accounting policies and purpose of each note to the accounts.
As usual, our commentary looks to explain how the financial results relate to our overall strategy, business model, key performance indicators and main business developments during the year.
