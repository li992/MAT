Chief Executives review During the year ended 30 September 2013 the Group has successfully pursued its strategy to deliver shareholder value through purchasing portfolios, developing new lending, entering into new servicing agreements and continuing the careful management of the extant portfolios.
Nigel Terrington Chief Executive A3.1 Financial review CONSOLIDATED RESULTS For the year ended 30 September 2013 2013 2012 m m Interest receivable 272.6 293.8 Interest payable and similar charges 111.3 136.0 Net interest income 161.3 157.8 Other operating income 16.6 12.4 Total operating income 177.9 170.2 Operating expenses 58.6 51.9 Provisions for losses 15.2 24.1 Underlying pro t 104.1 94.2 Fair value net gains 1.3 1.3 Operating pro t being pro t on ordinary activities before taxation 105.4 95.5 Tax charge on pro t on ordinary activities 20.2 23.3 Pro t on ordinary activities after taxation 85.2 72.2 Dividend rate per share for the year 7.2p 6.0p Basic earnings per share 28.4p 24.2p Diluted earnings per share 27.5p 23.5p The Group is organised into two major operating divisions: First Mortgages, which includes the buy-to-let and owner-occupied first mortgage assets and other sources of income derived from first charge mortgages: and Consumer Finance, which includes secured loans, car finance, retail finance, unsecured loans and other sources of income derived from consumer loans.
Both divisions include internally originated and acquired assets.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports primary segmental information.
Strategic report A3.1 Financial review continued The underlying operating pro ts of these business segments are detailed fully in Appendix B to the annual report and are summarised below.
2013 2012 m m Underlying operating pro t First Mortgages 64.4 61.6 Consumer Finance 39.7 32.6 104.1 94.2 Net interest income increased by 2.2% to 161.3 million 2012: 157.8 million, re ecting asset growth in the First Mortgages and Consumer Finance divisions but also the cost in the year of increasing funding capacity to support future growth in the Paragon Mortgages and Idem Capital businesses.
The combined cost of increasing the warehouse facilities and issuing the retail bond was 3.6 million, charged within interest payable.
Other operating income was 16.6 million for the year, compared with 12.4 million in 2012, the increase of 33.9% re ecting, principally, an increased level of third party fee income both from new administration arrangements and from older contracts as incentive fees began to be earned.
Operating expenses during the year were 12.9% higher at 58.6 million 2012: 51.9 million.
There were three principal reasons for this: the charge for share based payments increased by 1.2 million, principally caused by the impact of the increase in the Companys share price during the year: direct costs of 1.3 million were incurred in preparation for the establishment of a bank subsidiary within the Group to fund consumer finance originations: and employment costs increased as additional staff were employed to manage the growth in business activity, particularly the administration of loans acquired or serviced for third parties in the period.
The cost:income ratio was impacted by these additional charges and by the deduction from net interest income in respect of the cost of carrying the new funding lines as outlined above, increasing to 32.9% for the year from 30.5% in the year ended 30 September 2012 Appendix A.
The increase was in line with expectations and the absorption now of these additional costs should support future income growth.
On an underlying basis, excluding these additional factors, the ratio reduces to an underlying measure of 30.9% Appendix A.
This is similar to the level for the last year, and remains signi cantly below the industry average.
The Board remains focused on controlling operating costs through the application of rigorous budgeting, management reporting and monitoring procedures.
The charge for impairment provisions of 15.2 million was 36.9% lower than the charge of 24.1 million for 2012, with reductions in both the First Mortgages and Consumer Finance divisions arising from improved arrears performance and the impact of rising house prices on security valuations.
As a percentage of loans to customers note 31 the charge has reduced to 0.17% 2012: 0.28%.
Low interest rates have increased affordability for customers, reducing the incidence of new arrears and assisting the correction of past arrears.
The loan books continue to be carefully managed and the credit performance of the buy-to-let book continues to be exemplary.
Yield curve movements during the year resulted in hedging instrument fair value net gains of 1.3m 2012: gains of 1.3 million, which do not affect cash ow.
As the fair value movements of hedged assets or liabilities are expected to trend to zero over time, this item is merely a timing difference.
The Group remains economically and appropriately hedged.
Cash generation has remained strong over the period and in addition the Group raised 60.0 million from the retail bond issue in March.
After investing signi cantly in both asset purchases and in the development of our buy-to-let lending business detailed below, free cash balances stood at 170.8 million at 30 September 2013 2012: 127.7 million.
Corporation tax has been charged at an effective tax rate of 19.2%, compared to 24.4% in 2012, the decrease being attributable primarily to the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK and a consequent revaluation of deferred tax liabilities.
Pro ts after taxation of 85.2 million 2012: 72.2 million have been transferred to shareholders funds, which totalled 873.3 million at the year-end 2012: 803.5 million.
