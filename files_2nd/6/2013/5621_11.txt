Essar Energy plc 40 Business review Annual Report and accounts 2013 Financial review The following section provides an overview of our Groups financial performance for the 12 month period ended 31 March 2013, highlighting the key financial drivers and performance indicators for Essar Energy plc and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Income statement 12 months 15 months ended ended 31March 31March US$ million 2013 2012 Change % 1 Revenue 27,257.7 21,956.7 24% 2 Operational EBITDA 1,068.1 686.8 56% 2 CP EBITDA 1,335.5 484.5 176% Loss before tax before exceptional items and sales tax benefit in 2012 163.2 166.1 2% Loss after tax before exceptional items and sales tax benefit in 2012 175.0 101.2 73% Exceptional items, sales tax benefit and associated tax 653.1 Loss after tax after exceptional items and sales tax benefit in 2012 175.0 764.3 77% 1 Including sales tax benefit but before its subsequent reversal in 2012.

Revenue stated after deducting inter-segmental consolidation adjustments of US$95.8 million 2012: US$60.4 million.
2 Including sales tax benefit but before its subsequent reversal in 2012.
Revenues Group Essar Energy increased revenue by US$5.3 billion in the 12 month period ended March 2013, compared to the 15 month period ended March 2012.
Of this amount, US$3.9 billion reflected the revenue increase due to the inclusion of revenue from the Stanlow refinery for a full 12 months and US$1.3 billion was the increase in revenue from Vadinar refinery due to higher volumes despite 15months in FY2012 versus 12 months in FY2013.
Revenues Refining and Marketing India R&M India revenues increased by US$1,323.0 million from US$15,245.0 million in the 15 month period to March 2012 to US$16,568.0 million in the 12 months to March 2013 after eliminating inter-segmental revenues for the current period of US$51.4 million FY2012: nil.
This was primarily as a result of an increase in the quantity of the refinery products sold partially offset by lower product prices.
In more detail: `` US$2,464 million increase due to an increase in the quantity of refinery products sold by 2,765 KT.
During FY2013, 18,878 KT ofrefinery products were sold against 16,113 KT in FY2012 due to completion of Vadinar refinery expansion and optimisation projects in early FY2013.
`` US$737 million decrease due to a decrease in the average selling price by US$39 MT.
The average selling price of refinery products during FY2013 was US$852 MT against US$891 MT during FY2012.
`` No Sales Tax Incentive Income in FY2013 compared to US$339 million in FY2012 towards sales tax deferral income.
Revenues Refining and Marketing UK Stanlow refinery has contributed revenues of US$10.2 billion in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013 as compared to revenues ofUS$6.3 billion in the first eight months of ownership to 31 March 2012.
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements Essar Energy plc 41 Annual Report and accounts 2013 Refining and Marketing operational information Throughput and production from the Groups refining assets compared to the prior period were as follows: Throughput MMT Production MMT 12 months 15 months 12 months 15 months ended ended ended ended 31March 31March 31March 31March Operational assets 2013 2012 2013 2012 Vadinar 19.8 17.1 18.9 16.3 Stanlow 9.9 6.8 9.0 6.3 Mombasa 1.1 2.0 1.0 1.9 The significant changes period on period were due to the Stanlow refinery, with results for the prior year reflecting only eight months of operations post-acquisition, and the completion of the Vadinar Phase I and optimisation expansion projects.
Revenues Power Power revenues increased in the 12 month period ended 31 March 2013 by US$92.1 million to US$448.6 million from US$356.5 million in the 15 month period ended 31 March 2012 after eliminating inter-segmental revenues for the current period of US$44.4 million 2012: US$60.4 million.
The increase in revenue is mainly due to the commissioning of Salaya I in FY2013, which contributed US$184 million, offset by Rupee depreciation of US$53 million and lower revenue from Hazira I due to lower PLF, compared to the 15 month period ended 31 March 2012.

3 Algoma, PLF computation method has been revised and previous period figure has been restated.
4 Salaya I 12 months ended March 2013 include Unit II trial run generation of 31.1 MU.
5 Vadinar P2 and Salaya I commissioned in 2012-13, hence previous year availability and PLF not applicable.
6 Availability and PLF for Salaya I and Vadinar P2 considered from commissioning date.
7 Mahan 600 MW Unit 1 trial run generation in FY2013.
Operationally, with the exception of Salaya I which was commissioned during the period, all plants performed well in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013, with the key measure of plant availability between 97% and 100%, with the exception of Algoma which had an availability of 91% due to a shutdown in November 2012.
Despite high gas prices and low gas availability impacting generation from our captive plant, generation from Salaya I and Vadinar P2 meant that overall generation from Essar Powers portfolio in the 12month period was higher at 10,017 MU.
This compares with 7,907 MU generated in the 15 months to 31 March 2012.
Operational EBITDA Operational EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, sales tax benefit, exceptional items andany non-operational items.
Non-operational items represent other losses, as shown in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
This represents a change in definition of Operational EBITDA: in prior periods only some elements of other gains and losses were excluded from Operational EBITDA.
For the sake of simplicity and clarity all such items are now excluded.
The comparative figures have been restated accordingly.

The Groups Operational EBITDA increased by US$381.3 million, or 56%, in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013 compared to 15 months ended 31 March 2012.
Operational EBITDA Power Powers Operational EBITDA in the 12 months ended 31 March 2013 was lower by US$41.6 million at US$224.7 million compared tothe US$266.3 million in the 15 months ended 31 March 2012.
On a 12-month comparative basis, this represented an increase of 5%.
Operational EBITDA was higher mainly due to commissioning of Vadinar P2 and a marginal contribution from Salaya I.
This was partially offset by lower Operational EBITDA from Hazira I due to lower generation for GUVNL compared to the period ended 31March 2012 and depreciation of the Rupee.
Operational EBITDA Refining and Marketing India R&M India Operational EBITDA increased by US$222.3 million to US$688.6 million during the 12 month period ended 31 March 2013 in comparison to US$466.3 million in the 15 months ended 31 March 2012.
Operational EBITDA is higher primarily due to increased GRM, including hedging gain loss, of US$192.3 million due to increase in margins and volumes.
Operational EBITDA Refining and Marketing UK R&M UK Operational EBITDA was US$185.0 million in FY2013.
This result was a significant improvement over the first eight months of ownership primarily driven by improved margins in the European region and increased volumes.
The results also benefited by US$93 million as a result of the margin enhancement programme.
Refining and Marketing CP EBITDA and CP GRM For further understanding of our Refining and Marketing operations we also present Operational EBITDA on an adjusted internal measure using CP GRM, as defined below.
CP GRM is not calculated under IFRS, but management believes that this information should be provided as it enables investors to better understand the underlying performance of our refineries.
The differences between CP EBITDA and Operational EBITDA for the Refining and Marketing operations are set out in the tablebelow: 12 months 15 months ended ended 31March 31March US$ million unless specified R&M India 2013 2012 CP GRM India US$ per barrel 7.96 4.45 CP EBITDA 823.8 234.2 Impact of: Timing differences in pricing domestic products 61.5 99.2 Time lag in crude prices 114.1 156.9 Impact of inventory movement 11.6 217.9 Hedging impact 71.0 43.5 Operational EBITDA Refining and Marketing India 688.6 466.3 Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements Essar Energy plc 43 Annual Report and accounts 2013 12 months 15 months ended ended 31March 31March US$ million unless specified R&M UK 2013 2012 CP GRM UK US$ per barrel 7.38 3.06 CP EBITDA 317.2 12.8 Impact of: Timing differences in pricing domestic products 20.5 Time lag in crude prices 0.2 8.1 Impact of inventory movement 5.2 17.7 Real time crude supplies 37.6 Hedging impact 69.1 39.4 Operational EBITDA Refining and Marketing UK 185.0 17.0 Group CP EBITDA Group Power Exploration and Production R&M India R&M UK Corporate 12 months 15 months 12 months 15 months 12 months 15 months 12 months 15 months 12 months 15 months 12 months 15 months ended ended ended ended ended ended ended ended ended ended ended ended 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March 31March US$ millions 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 2013 2012 CP EBITDA 1,335.5 484.5 224.7 266.3 0.2 2.1 823.8 234.2 317.2 12.8 30.4 26.7 See Appendix 1 of this Annual Report for details of how CP GRM is calculated.

Net finance costs increased due to the increased interest cost of loans mentioned above, a reduction in borrowing costs capitalised due to the commissioning of projects, offset by an increase in interest income from the short-term deployment of surplus funds.
Taxation The Groups FY2013 effective tax rate was 7.2 % compared with an FY2012 rate of 33.4%.
The tax charge of US$11.8 million in FY2013 FY2012: tax credit of US$383.4 million comprises current tax income of US$15.8 million FY2012: current tax charges of US$38.1 million and deferred tax expenses of US$27.6 million FY2012: deferred tax income of US$421.5 million.
The current tax generally represents Minimum Alternative Tax MAT payable in India.
There is a current tax credit as a result of the reversal of MAT liability in respect of previous periods for Essar Oil Limited, India.
The majority of profits derived from operations in India are subject to MAT.
MAT is charged on book profits in India at a rate of 20.01%, but is available as a credit against corporate income tax in the following ten years.
A deferred tax credit generally represents an asset created on tax losses or timing differences which are carried forward and are available to be offset against future taxable profits.
The effective tax rate of the Group is negative since there is a tax charge even in the case of losses.
This is primarily on account ofcertain losses, deferred tax assets that have not been recognised in the absence of reasonable certainty.
Other losses, net Other losses principally relate to foreign exchange losses due to the depreciation of the Rupee against the US dollar ofUS$255.9million 15 months to 31 March 2012: US$315.2 million.

Assets under construction include mining properties and exploration and evaluation assets.
Property, plant and equipment have increased by 3.4% against March 2012.
The increases by segment, including assets under construction after impact of exchange difference, are as follows: `` Refining and Marketing India US$220.5 million `` Refining and Marketing UK US$68.5 million `` Exploration and Production US$204.6 million `` Power US$292.9 million The operational assets in R&M India decreased mainly due to deprecation charged during the period.
Assets under construction have increased mainly due to expansion related activities and advances for a new township under construction.
In the Power segment, operational assets increased mainly due to the commissioning of Vadinar P2 unit 1 and Salaya I with the transfer of the related assets from assets under construction to operational, offset by exchange rate variations.
The 6% depreciation of the Rupee from March 2012 caused a reduction in property, plant and equipment of US$265.9 million, US$13.2 million and US$286.5 million in the Power, Exploration and Production and Refinery and Marketing India segments respectively.
Other non-current assets Other non-current assets have increased by US$96.3 million over March 2012, primarily as a result of US$159 million of receivables towards sales tax assignment being shown as non-current following final determination of the sales tax matter, whereas in the prior period such amounts were shown as current, which is partly offset by decrease in deferred tax assets created on business losses.
Current assets Current assets have decreased by US$44.7 million to US$6,487.8 million from 31 March 2012, driven by the following key activities during the year: `` Reduction in inventory held at R&M UK of US$448 million due to an agreement to buy crude oil on a real time basis from Barclays Bank, as a result of an inventory monetisation agreement signed in July 2012.
`` US$445 million net increase in inventory at R&M India due to increased capacity.
`` A decrease in cash and cash equivalents mainly due to a US$150 million repayment to lenders as a result of refinancing the US$450 million loan at Essar Energy plc.
`` Reduction in other receivables of US$159 million in relation to assigned liabilities in respect of sales tax now presented as non-current following the final determination of the sales tax matter.
A decrease in trade receivables by US$98 million in R&M UK and an increase in trade receivables by US$44 million in R&M India due to usual collection cycle of various customers.
Essar Energy plc 46 Business review Annual Report and accounts 2013 Financial review Current liabilities Current liabilities have increased by US$2,681.8 million, to US$10,285.3 million from 31 March 2012, primarily due to the following: `` Reclassification of US$2,362.6 million of long-term debt to short-term.
The Group has a number of power projects, some of which have recently been commissioned and others are under development.
Consistent with a number of companies operating in the power sector in India, the Group has been impacted by project delays particularly in relation to regulatory approvals including mine approvals and other factors outside the Groups controls.
As a result, there were some instances of late payments of interest and principle, some breaches of financial and non-financial covenants for which waiver letters subsequent to31 March 2013 but prior to the approval of the annual report have been received and all breaches as at the balance sheet date have subsequently been cured.
IFRS makes it necessary to reclassify this debt as short-term as at 31 March 2013, but the Group expects this will be reclassified back to long-term going forward.
`` US$356 million decrease due to sales tax liability presented as non-current following the order of the Supreme Court confirming the payment of the liability in eight equal instalments from 2 January 2013.
`` Increase in crude creditors by US$95 million and advances from customers of US$258 million in R&M India.
`` A decrease of US$484 million in payables in R&M UK due to the impact of the inventory monetisation arrangement whereby R&M UK trade payables for crude represent only 3-5 days compared to 30 days previously and payment of the deferred consideration of US$175 million plus interest to Shell.
`` Net increase in short-term borrowings by US$764 million mainly due to increase in working capital loans and bills of exchange in R&M India.
`` US$387 million reclassification other than mentioned above of non-current borrowings to current due to repayment within one year in R&M India.
`` Essar Energy plc repaid US$217 million of the bridge loan.
`` Increase in acceptances and creditors in the Power business by US$170 million due to Salaya 1 and VPCL phase 2 operational and construction at Mahan power plant.
Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities have decreased by US$1,928.0 million, representing a 31.3% decrease, from US$6,157.6 million at 31 March 2012 primarily due to the following: `` Reclassification of non-current liabilities to current liabilities by US$2,362.6 million due to certain non-compliance of covenants.
`` Increase of US$356 million due to the sales tax liability now being payable in eight quarterly instalment from 2 January 2013.
`` Increase in long-term borrowing net of amounts transferred to current including project buyers credit of US$112 million.

This was mainly due to reduction in trade payables, an increase in trade and other receivables and an increase in inventories.
Net cash used in investing activities has decreased by US$2,310.3 million from US$3,321.4 million at 31 March 2012.
The decrease is mainly due to a lower level of capital expenditure as projects are completed and acquisition of Stanlow refinery last year.
At 31 March 2013 there was net cash, cash equivalents and bank deposits of US$176.5 million 31 March 2012: US$436.6 million.
Capital and liquidity Essar Energy had underlying gross debt of US$6,917 million, net debt underlying of US$6,741 million and gearing of 67% as of 31March 2013.
At 31 March 2012, Essar Energy had gross debt of US$6,710 million, net debt underlying of US$6,273 million and gearing of 63%.
The gross and net debt increased largely as a result of the Companys continued capital expenditure programme in the Power and R&M India businesses.
It is anticipated that the Groups debt will continue to increase as projects are funded with peak debt forecast to occur in FY2014.
On 1 July 2011, Essar Energy entered into a US$450 million secured and guaranteed term loan.
Essar Energy utilised this loan to enable Essar Oil UK Limited to finance the Stanlow acquisition and may also utilise the loan, amongst other things, for general corporate purposes.
This loan was refinanced on 14 May 2012 with a new US$300 million three year secured loan facility and US$150 million of internal cash resources.
Separately, Essar Energy also signed on the same date a US$250 million 3.5 year subordinated unsecured loan facility with Essar Global Limited for general corporate purposes.
In July 2012, Essar Energy announced that R&M India has secured a new seven year credit facility with its Indian banks of up to c. US$949 million Rs.
50 billion to meet the deferred sales tax liability owed to the Gujarat government and for general corporate purposes.
In July 2012, Essar Energy paid the second and final instalment of the consideration due to Shell for the purchase of the Stanlow refinery, which was completed on 31 July 2011.
This second instalment was for US$175 million plus interest, giving a total of US$183.3 million, and the first instalment, which was paid on completion, was for US$175 million.
Essar Energy plc 48 Business review Annual Report and accounts 2013 Financial review In July 2012, R&M UK concluded crude oil and product inventory arrangements under which legal title for the inventories of crude oil and petroleum products at Stanlow is transferred to a counterparty who will supply crude to the refinery in line with its requirements.
The new arrangements have allowed R&M UK to repay its previous working capital revolving credit facility.
In addition, they allow R&M UK to reduce its costs while retaining operational flexibility.
In September 2012, Essar Energy secured a US$150 million 4.5 year credit facility with Axis Bank with the ability, subject to successful syndication, to increase the facility size to US$450 million.

Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements Essar Energy plc 49 Annual Report and accounts 2013 Going Concern The Group monitors and manages closely its liquidity risk.
In assessing the Groups going concern status, the Directors have taken account of the financial position of the Group, anticipated future trading performance, its bank and other facilities, its capital investment plans, forecast of gross refining margins and the likelihood of any material adverse legal judgments.
The Group has prepared detailed annual business plans and forecasts covering the period to 30 June 2014.
These business plans and forecasts were used as the basis for assessing the Groups cash headroom and compliance with banking covenants.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group is dependent on the availability of existing loan facilities together with new facilities and arrangements which are being negotiated but have not yet been committed.
As further set out in the capital and liquidity section of the Financial review, the Group is progressing well in establishing loan facilities, including refinancing facilities and other arrangements with a variety of lenders and financial institutions to ensure that the Group has adequate liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due and to improve the Groups liquidity position significantly.
In addition, whilst breaches of certain covenants in some debt facilities have occurred both during the financial year to 31 March 2013 and subsequently, no loans have been recalled and the Group has continued to cure such breaches and obtain waivers from the financial institutions.
The facilities under discussion far exceed the Groups current financing needs.
Further, in respect of several of these facilities, which would meet the Groups forecast needs, the Group has secured written confirmation from the proposed lenders that such lender is confident that the relevant facility will be made available.
However until these facilities are committed, there is a risk that they may not ultimately be available.
The Directors have examined all available evidence and have concluded that in light of the supportive nature of the relationships heldwith the lenders and financial institutions, the assurances received from the lenders and the current stage of negotiations, the Directors are satisfied that adequate financial resources will continue to be made available to the Group and Company so as to enable it to continue to trade on a going concern basis.
As a result, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group and Companys financial statements.
