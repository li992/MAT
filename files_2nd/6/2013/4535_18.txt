of priorities for capital Our performance is summarised in figure 1.
Our close and careful management of all aspects of the business meant that in a challenging market we delivered allocation: to invest in the gross transaction value of 2.8 billion, revenue of 2.3 billion, operating profit of 168.0 million, profit before tax of 154.0 million and earnings per share of four pillars of the strategy: 10.2pence.
We consider this to be a solid performance in light of the highly to pay a dividend to our competitive market environment which was also impacted by poor weather affecting the profitability of the UK and a write-off arising out of the closure shareholders: to reduce of the Romanian franchise stores in the International business.

the store modernisation programme and the 16 new UK stores scheduled to open during the next four years.
We are also investing in systems across the business in particular to support our fast-growing multi-channel activities.
Much of the revenue investment primarily to support product development and our marketing activities has been made now and our focus will be on achieving a return on this investment.
Why have you changed the way you guide on the cost base?
In the past we gave guidance for key cost categories as a percentage of Group sales.
This was useful when the business was principally a UK store model.
However, with the growth of sales from multi-channel and international operations, this guidance became less useful.
Starting at the interim results in April 2013, we now provide guidance by geographic segment and, within each segment, break the analysis down into store costs, online costs and other costs as appropriate.
There has been a lot of commentary about the change to IAS 19.
Can you explain what this accounting standard does and how the change will impact Debenhams?
In 2013, Debenhams benefited from a pension credit of 11.3 million under IAS 19 Employee Benefits 2012: 11.7 million.
The purpose of this accounting standard is to put a notional impact of a defined benefit pension scheme onto the profit and loss account.
From our financial year 2014, the method of calculating this impact is changing.
Currently, IAS 19 calculates an income on a schemes assets and an expense on its liabilities to give a net income or cost where asset returns and interest rates can be different which can be taken in either operating profit or the interest line.
The revised IAS 19 requires an income or expense to be calculated by applying a single interest rate to a schemes net surplus or net deficit.
Under the revised standard, in 2014 there will be a charge to profit before tax of 2 million.
Thus, there will be a negative impact on profit before tax of 13million between 2013 and 2014 as a result of the change to IAS 19.
It is important to note that the revision has no impact on the scheme, its members or the cash contribution that Debenhams has agreed with the trustees.
Why did you have to take a write-off in Romania?
We took a write-off of 3.8 million in the first half of 2013 following the closure of the six franchise stores in Romania in February which related to some outstanding receivables dating back to 2011.
We have since strengthened our controls and the financial support behind receivables.
What are your priorities for capital allocation?
We have a very clear order of priorities for cash.
The first is to invest in the four pillars of the strategy to build a leading international, multi-channel brand.
In 2013 we spent 133.3 million on capital expenditure: you can see a breakdown of this spend on page 40.
Secondly, we pay our shareholders a dividend and during 2013 spent 41.4 million of cash on the 2012 final dividend and 2013 interim dividend.
Our third priority is to reduce net debt to a level around one times EBITDA over the medium-term.
Finally, any spare cash generated over and above these requirements will be returned to shareholders through the share buyback scheme.
