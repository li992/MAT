Working capital Working capital comprises receivables and payables from construction contract customers and other third parties.
Where receivables exceed payables, this is termed positive working capital and where payables exceed receivables, this is referred to as negative working capital.
Including the impact of exchange, negative working capital decreased from665 million at the end of 2012 to 550 million at the end of 2013.
Of this decrease of 115 million, the biggest component was 75 million in Construction Services.
This was largely due to changes in the mix of business, away from larger more complex projects, which have the potential for more favourable terms, to smaller projects.
Total working capital as a percentage of annualised revenue WCPR at the end of the year was 6.3 % 2012: 7.7 %.
The most significant component of negative working capital relates to Construction Services, which ended the year with WCPR of 10.5 % 2012: 11.6 %.
