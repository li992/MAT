FINANCE REVIEW Derwent London benefitted from a particularly strong performance across all aspects of its financial focus during 2013.
With the support of a buoyant occupational market and fierce competition from investors for Londons highly-prized stock of real estate, the Group experienced rapid growth in net asset value and one of our highest property valuation increases in recent years.
We were also able to grow earnings significantly, further improve our interest cover and maintain modest gearing while investing substantially more in the portfolio than in the prior year.
In addition, we entered into three refinancing transactions totalling 800m which combined to move us decisively to a predominantly unsecured debt structure.
This enabled the release of fixed charges over much of our property portfolio which will improve operational and financial flexibility.
The refinancing also extended the average duration of our debt to 7.7 years and significantly reduced the average cost.
Much has been written about the UKs renewed confidence and the economic growth that emerged in 2013 but Londons recovery started far earlier.
That has certainly been reflected in our own results over the last year but the recent strength of Londons commercial property market is also very evident from the transformation of our financial position over the last five years.

Together with development profits from our projects and strong underlying rental value growth across the portfolio, this helped to provide a 452.5m increase in NAV 2,800 32 for the Group over the 12 months to 31 December 2013.
This is more than double the NAV increase in 2012 which was, itself, a strong year.
2,100 24 EPRA net asset value per share increased by 20.0% during 2013 to 2,264p per share from 1,886p a year earlier.
The revaluation surplus and profits from the sale of investment 1,400 16 properties together account for 378p with other items approximately netting out to nil.
The overall improvement in EPRA NAV per share can be 700 8 summarised as follows: 2013 2012 0 0 p p Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Revaluation surplus 326 170 Profit on disposals 52 7 Property portfolio at fair value LTV ratio EPRA profit after tax 54 50 Net assets attributable to equity shareholders Dividends paid net of scrip 30 30 Equity portion relating to issue of convertible bonds 2019 12 Interest rate swap termination costs 13 7 Dilutive effect of convertible bonds 2016 10 EPRA net asset value per share p Minority interest 7 5 2,400 Other 6 52 378 185 10 13 12 54 2,264 30 13 The EPRA NAV and NAV per share are diluted measures 326 and therefore take account of the exercise of share options 2,200 and long-term share incentives as well as the conversion of convertible bonds where these reduce the NAV per share.
As the NAV per share is now higher than the conversion price of the convertible bonds maturing in 2016 of 2,222p, the dilutive impact of this, equating to 10p per share in 2013, 2,000 has been included in the calculation of EPRA NAV per share for the first time.
Of this, 4p is due to the conversion into 1,886 shares at a price below the NAV per share and 6p is due to the early write-off of the unamortised part of the bonds equity component: the latter amount will normally amortise up to 1,800 the maturity date of the bonds in July 2016 unless the bonds are converted into equity at an earlier date.
A detailed reconciliation of the Group net asset value to the EPRA NAV is shown in note 17 to the financial statements.
The improved prospects for the UK economy have brought forward the prospect of UK interest rate rises.
Although there has been some retrenchment so far this year, this had a beneficial impact on the mark-to-market cost of our interest rate derivatives which fell to 16p per share from 53p in 2012.

The equity component of these 2019 convertible bonds recognised at issue was 12p per share, roughly equivalent to the cost of the swaps terminated.
The fair value of fixed rate bond liabilities also fell to 15.2m from 58.0m in 2012 and these combined to bring the Groups EPRA triple NAV per share to 2,222p at 31 December 2013, an increase of 26.0% over the year.
Note that the EPRA triple NAV now also deducts unamortised loan arrangement costs and fees.

EPRA earnings per share 124.8 3.2 were also up to 53.9p from 50.4p a year earlier.
In addition, including the fair value uplift in property and derivative values 120 and the profits on disposal of our properties, the overall Group IFRS profit before tax was 467.9m, more than double that 110 of 2012.
Gross property income increased by 5.4% to 131.6m for the 100 year ended 31 December 2013 from 124.8m in 2012.
Income from new lettings and rent reviews totalled 11.8m through 2012 and 2013 with a further 4.1m from properties acquired.
90 These more than compensated for the 3.2m of income lost on disposals and 6.5m on voids, expiries and lease breaks.
Net property and other income rose 6.2% to 124.3m from 80 117.0m last year.
Of this, 121.7m was net rental income, 6.7% higher than in 2012.
70 Lettings and reviews The real progress in underlying rental income levels across the portfolio can be demonstrated by the increase in like-for-like property income where the effects of acquisitions, disposals and developments are taken out.
EPRA gross rental income increased by 3.6% during the year on a like-for-like basis.
The Group administration charge for the year rose by We have included the new EPRA cost ratio figures this year for 6.4% to 26.7m: this increase is largely due to higher salary, the first time.
The total ratio of overheads and irrecoverable bonus and incentive payments to our staff and management property costs to rental income was 25.1% in 2013 and 25.2% team, the levels of which rose by 1.5m over the year.
Our high degree of development and refurbishment activity adds considerably to the Groups overhead: from our own estimates, this activity represents approximately one third of our total staff costs, so it is arguably unrepresentative to measure running costs against rental income alone.
We are therefore also showing the ratio of overheads and irrecoverable property costs to the property portfolio fair value which results in a ratio of 1.0% in 2013 and 1.1% in 2012.
Note also that it is our policy not to capitalise development overheads, all of which are expensed in the year.

As part of the refinancing in 2013, 3.2m of unamortised issue costs were written off when the old loans were repaid but this is not taken into account in deriving the EPRA profit before tax.
Excluding this amount, net finance costs were almost unchanged compared to the previous year.
Borrowings were higher and average borrowing costs were lower in 2013 and the impact of our refinancing on the cost of debt is explained EPRA profit m in more detail below.
2.0 140 0.7 130.9 The total cost of breaking or re-couponing swaps in the year was 13.7m, most of which was judged to coincide with the 9.3 equity uplift arising on our second convertible bond issue.
The 120 increase in interest rate expectations referred to above led to a significant unwinding of the cost associated with fair valuing our 100 other interest rate swaps.
This gave a fair value uplift of 38.5m 26.4 in 2013 compared to a 2.4m deficit in 2012.
80 Taxation Our REIT status significantly reduces the taxation costs of the 1.1 57.8 Group but brings with it a responsibility to our stakeholders and 60 41.2 to HMRC to operate within certain rules.
We do not generally pay tax on our property business income and gains provided we distribute nearly all of the taxable profits every year and withhold 40 tax on those distributions.
In 2013, 4.2m of tax was withheld from shareholders on such distributions and paid to HMRC.

The 2013 tax charge relating to this part of the business was 1.0m, comprising a current year tax charge of 0.8m and a prior year tax charge of 0.2m.
The tax charge was primarily due to the unelected share in our joint venture with the Portman Estate which is outside the REIT regime.
