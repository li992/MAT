2.3 2.6 Net pension finance costs 4.5 4.1 Discount on provisions 1.8 1.3 8.6 8.0 Net finance costs increased by $0.6 million in 2013 to $8.6 million, mainly due to modest increases in the financial cost of pension deficits and an increase in the discount charge on provisions.
Net finance costs on borrowings and cash balances were lower by $0.3 million, at $2.3 million, as lower borrowing costs were offset by lower income from cash balances.
Borrowing costs, which largely relate to arrangement and commitment fees on unutilised borrowing facilities, came down as a result of the refinancing of the Groups main borrowing facility in 2013.
Income from cash balances was lower than the previous year because, although the year end cash balance was higher than the previous year, the average cash balances held during the year were lower.
Net pension finance expense was higher than the previous year because, under IAS 19, the charge is based on the deficit value at the beginning of the year and the opening deficit in 2013 was higher than in 2012.
The increase in the discount charge on provisions is related to the changes in the basis of the discount rate as discussed in the section Exceptional items.
