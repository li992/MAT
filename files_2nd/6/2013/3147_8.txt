Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 15 Operational performance review Centamin intends to continue to grow and diversify its project pipeline through targeted acquisitions of exploration and development prospects in the region and beyond.
Overview Centamins principal asset is the Sukari Gold Mine, which is located in the eastern desert of Egypt, approximately 700km from Cairo and 25km from the Red Sea.
For the twelve months ended 31 December 2013, production from Sukari was 356,943 ounces 2012: 262,828 ounces of gold at an operating cash cost of US$663 per ounce US$669 per ounce in 2012.
The first pillar of Centamins growth strategy is the expansion of Sukari, which includes the growth of Sukari Hills resources and reserves, the development of the underground mine and the Stage 4 expansion, which will double the plants processing nameplate capacity from 5Mtpa to 10Mtpa.
Construction of the Stage 4 expansion was steady during the year and whilst some commissioning activity commenced in 2013 the bulk of commissioning will commence in the first quarter 2014, versus the previouslyexpected Andrew Pardey second half of 2013.
The temporary suspension of operations in 2012 caused Chief Operating Officer by strikes at the ports and the lack of fuel and supplies all contributed to the delay in commissioning Stage 4.
These unforeseen delays in the critical path items, materials and services have meant that the Stage 4 expansion project has not met its original targeted date for completion.
The expected capital cost of the Stage 4 expansion which is funded by PGM out of cost recoveries, is US$331.2 million including contingency, with total expenditure at the end of 2013 of US$327.8 million.
Capital expenditure during the year saw an increase in noncurrent assets of US$252.0 million in property, plant and equipment, mainly relating to net capitalised workinprogress which comprises: US$99.3 million for the Stage 4 processing plant: US$77.4 million for the open pit mining fleet expansion: US$16.2 million for open pit development: US$29.5 million for underground development: US$1.7 million for mine development properties: and US$27.9 million for other sustaining capital expenditure.
Centamin continued exploration on its tenements in northern Ethiopia where exploration drilling confirmed the presence of low grade mineralisation.
In September 2013 Centamin entered into a joint venture with Alecto Minerals plc to pursue existing and new opportunities identified by Alecto in Ethiopia.
The initial joint venture projects focus on two exploration licences, one in Wayu Boda and the other in Aysid Meketel.
A recommended allshare takeover offer of ASXlisted Ampella Mining Ltd saw Centamin expand its interests into West Africa.
Ampella holds exploration licences in a highly prospective region of Burkina Faso and Cte dIvoire.
In February 2014, Centamin gained a controlling interest in Ampella enabling Centamin to expand the operational activity in this region.
Centamin intends to continue to grow and diversify its project pipeline through targeted acquisitions of exploration and development prospects in the region and beyond.

It is expected that the ore treated through the new flotation circuit will be predominantly sulphide based ore, amenable to recovery by flotation.
Any ore that may be oxide or transitional in nature will be treated through the existing processing circuit by adjustment of the crushed ore product splits to each of the crushed ore stockpiles.
Exploration activities Growth of Sukari Hill The main focus of exploration to date has been on the Sukari porphyry.
Surface drilling in 2013 continued north Movement of ore through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into the northern from the open pit to the processing plant Pharaoh Zone.
During the second half of the year Underground drilling was progressively steppedup as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high grade extensions of the deposit.
The ore body has not yet been closed off by drilling to the north, or at depth.
Further exploration of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2014, predominantly from both the Amun and Ptah declines.
Open pit resources Mineral resources at Sukari, as at 30 June 2013, are shown in the following table.
The work satisfies the reporting requirements of the JORC 2012 and CIM 2004 guidelines for reporting mineral resources.
The mineral resource estimate is based on the mined surface as at 30 June 2013 and adjusted for historical, current and planned underground mining.
All available assays as at June 2013.
Resource data set comprises 234,788 two metre down hole composites and surface rock chip samples.
Proven and Probable mineral reserves are included in mineral resources.
The resources are estimates of recoverable tonnes and grades using multiple indicator kriging with block support correction.
Measured resources lie in areas where drilling is available at a nominal 25 x 25 metre spacing, Indicated resources occur in areas drilled at approximately 25 x 50 metre spacing and Inferred resources exist in areas of broader spaced drilling.
The resource model extends from 9,700mN to 12,200mN and to a maximum depth of 0mRL a maximum depth of approximately 1000 metres below wadi level.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 18 19 Regional exploration The second pillar of Centamins growth strategy is regional exploration.
Seven other prospects besides Sukari Hill have 2 been identified on the 160km Sukari tenement area and exploration is being conducted under the principle that ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing processing plant.
Drilling programmes have been under way on the Quartz Ridge and VShear prospects to the east and northeast of the hill respectively during 2013.
Ongoing drilling to the south at the Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fasttrack near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing production.
Further regional drilling of the Sukari licence is planned for 2013.
Exploration beyond Sukari The third pillar of Centamins strategy is growth beyond Sukari.
Centamin continued exploration on its four tenements Una Deriam, Finarwa, Winibo and Shehagne in northern Ethiopia, and in total, 11,134 meters were drilled over the four tenements.
Of these licences only Una Deriam remains active, the others having being impaired at the year end due to the presence of only low grade mineralisation.
In September 2013 Centamin entered into joint venture with Alecto Minerals plc to pursue existing and new opportunities identified by Alecto in Ethiopia.
The initial joint venture projects relate to two exploration licences Wayu Boda and Aysid Meketel.
A recommended allshare takeover offer for ASXlisted Ampella Mining Ltd, was announced on 10 December 2013.
Centamin took control of Ampella on 24 February 2014.
This takeover provides Centamin with an extensive licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored 100km trend of gold mineralisation in Burkina Faso, as well as further exploration properties in Cte dIvoire.
Centamin will implement a systematic exploration program, aimed at Top: base of the primary crusher during construction as part of the developing the potential for further significant growth of the Stage 4 expansion existing resource base comprising 1.92Moz Indicated and 1.33Moz Inferred.
