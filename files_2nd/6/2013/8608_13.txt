This growth was ahead of operating profit growth due to strong performance in underlying joint venture JV profits, with our share of JV post-tax profit at Sainsburys Bank up 38 per cent from 16 million to 22 million.
We are pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Lloyds Banking Group to acquire their 50 per cent shareholding of Sainsburys Bank and take sole ownership.
Sainsburys intends to fund the future consideration from internal resources.
As well as the stand-alone growth potential of the Bank, full ownership will also allow future products to be even more tailored to Sainsburys customers, leveraging Nectar data to drive sales uplift in both financial services and our supermarkets business.
After taking out a Bank product, Sainsburys shoppers become more loyal and spend more in-store, providing significant opportunity to unlock further value.
The Banks results will be fully consolidated within our financial services segment from when the transaction completes, currently expected in January 2014.
