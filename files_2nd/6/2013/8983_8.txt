Compared to the prior year, zinc in concentrate output fell by 17.5 kt to 134.1 kt due to lower ore extraction and grades at the Artemyevsky mine.
In respect of precious metals, silver product output of 14,348 koz was 14% above the prior year benefiting from a release of work in progress.
Gold production decreased by 17% to 107.5 koz with the lower volume of gold extracted at the Artemyevsky and Abyz mines.
