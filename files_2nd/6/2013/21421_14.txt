Rates on renewal business on average increased by 1% across the portfolio, with more significant increases in property of 3% and specialty lines of 3%.
We have continued to adjust our underwriting appetite in areas where competition is most intense.
Our portfolio by business division has remained broadly unchanged from 2012.
We continue to operate a diversified portfolio by type of business and geographical location, and have grown our business across five of the six divisions during 2013.

Premium retention rates Retention of business from existing brokers and clients is a key feature of Beazleys strategy.
It enables us to maintain a deep understanding of our clients businesses and requirements, affording greater insight into the risks involved in each policy we write and enabling us to price risk most accurately to achieve profit.

The most notable rate increases were seen in our specialty lines division where they have been at 3% for the last two years: prior to this rate increases had not been seen for six years.
Increases were the most significant in professional indemnity for architects and engineers 6%, management liability 6% and treaty 3%.
Other significant rate increases were seen within our property division 3%, with the most significant being in homeowners 6% and US commercial property 6%.
Rate change on renewals in all other divisions were down by 1% in political risks & contingency and life, accident & health, 3% in reinsurance and 5% in marine.
Reinsurance purchased Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: to enable the group to write large or lead lines on risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
The amount the group spent on reinsurance in 2013 was $293.7m 2012: $353.2m.
The group as a whole is a net buyer of reinsurance and has benefited from falling premium rates on renewals.
In addition, specific reductions in reinsurance spend were seen in the property division where we were able to achieve more efficiency in our reinsurance buying through the consolidation of parts of the property and catastrophe programme.
Combined ratio The combined ratio of an insurance company is a measure of its operating performance and represents the ratio of its total costs including claims and expenses to total net earned premium.
A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio has decreased in 2013 to 84% 2012: 91%.
Our combined ratio in 2013 is lower than the historic average due to relatively low levels of claims activity with no significant catastrophes or adverse development on prior years claims.
It is worth pointing out that the calculation of the combined ratio for Beazley includes all claims and other costs to the group but excludes foreign exchange gains or losses.
We believe this represents the most transparent and useful measure of operating performance as it ensures that all of the costs of being in business are captured, whether directly linked to underwriting activity or not.
Claims Overall, claims have developed favourably during 2013, with claims notifications at normalised levels.
We have only moderate exposure to the floods in Europe during May and the hailstorms in Germany, as well as the floods in Calgary in July.

Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range 5-10% above the actuarial estimates which themselves include some margin for uncertainty.
The margin held above the actuarial estimate was 8.2% at the end of 2013 2012: 6.9%.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
During 2013 we were able to make the following prior year reserve adjustments across divisions, with the overall net impact being a release to the group.
2013 2012 $m $m Life, accident & health 4.6 0.5 Marine 47.3 27.7 Political risks & contingency 39.4 33.1 Property 33.7 6.2 Reinsurance 55.6 7.0 Specialty lines 46.6 51.5 Total 218.0 126.0 Releases as a percentage of net earned premium 13.7% 8.5% The increase in reserve releases was driven by our property and reinsurance divisions which benefitted from the benign natural catastrophe environment in 2012, and favourable development on our reserves set up following the 2010 and 2011 natural catastrophes.
Reserve releases decreased in specialty lines in 2013, which was in line with our expectations.
The 2013 releases came mainly from the 2003 through 2006 underwriting years as these years continued their exceptional development.
The political risks and contingency reserve releases were driven by continued favourable development on our financial crisisexposed 2006 2008 underwriting years, while our Marine division benefitted from continued strong performance on all years.

com Beazley 37 Annual report 2013 Financial review Group performance continued Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased during 2013 to $619.3m from $563.5m in 2012.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2013 2012 $m $m Brokerage costs 337.2 313.0 Other acquisition costs 94.3 95.5 Total acquisition costs 431.5 408.5 Administrative expenses 187.8 155.0 Total acquisition costs and administrative expenses 619.3 563.5 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premium they remain between 21% and 22%.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with accounting standards.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity e. g. underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
Administrative expenses comprise primarily personnel costs, IT costs, facilities costs, Lloyds central costs and other support costs.
These increased in 2013 due to performance linked remuneration and the write off of renewal rights assets relating to the life, accident & health and specialty lines divisions.
Investment performance Investment income for the year ended 31 December 2013 was $43.3m, or an annualised return of 1.0%, compared with $82.6m or 2.0% over the same period in 2012.
Lower returns, compared with the previous year, were driven by a rise in bond yields in the US, as the federal reserve indicated early in the year that it would taper its quantitative easing programme, finally confirming in December that the tapering would start in 2014.
In the UK yields rose, as the economy recovered, and in Europe yields followed the lead set by the US.
Our core portfolio returned 0.5% in 2013.
Government bonds, especially in the US, performed poorly the comparable BoAML 1-5 year government index produced a negative return in 2013, but the credit component of our portfolio performed well, as credit spreads narrowed significantly in 2013.
At year end AAA AA government and agency bonds remained approximately 47% of the overall portfolio, while cash and cash equivalents and credit assets comprised 41%.
The main challenge to our investment performance in 2013 was US federal reserve policy, and we expect that, if the US economy maintains its upward trend, federal policy and a rising yield environment will continue to make investment conditions challenging for managers of fixed income portfolios in 2014.
The remaining 12% of our portfolio continues to be held in a diversified portfolio of capital growth assets, which returned 4.7% in 2013.
This portfolio continues to be managed by our associated company, Falcon Money Management Limited.
Duration of the fixed income portfolio at year end was 1.8 years 2012: 1.9 years with a yield to maturity of 1.4% 2012: 1.0%.
We are changing our relationship with Falcon Money Management.
In 2014, they will cease managing our core portfolio but will be actively involved in the management of our capital growth assets.
This should enable us to lower investment management fees in future periods.

Tax Beazley is liable to corporation tax in a number of jurisdictions, notably the UK and Ireland.
Our effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate between the Irish and UK tax rates.
In 2013, it was announced that the UK corporation tax rate will be reduced to 20% by 2015.
This rate reduction in the UK tax rate has been applied to our UK deferred tax liability brought forward.
This reduction in our deferred tax liability has offset our current year tax charge to create an effective tax rate of 15.7% for the year.
