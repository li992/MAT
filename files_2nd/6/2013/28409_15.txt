Strategic report Provident Financial plc continued Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 Financial review The groups financial strategy is to invest in businesses that generate a high return on capital in order to provide high returns to shareholders.
To support the delivery of this strategy, the group operates a strict financial model that aligns the groups dividend policy, gearing and growth plans.
The financial model has been developed to ensure that the group maintains a robust capital structure providing a comfortable level of headroom against the groups banking covenants, including Andrew Fisher the gearing covenant of 5.0 times, and the regulatory capital Finance Director requirements set by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA.
Thestrong capital generation of the businesses in which the group invests supports the distribution of up to 80% of its post-tax earnings by way of dividend.
This allows the business to retain sufficient capital to support receivables growth consistent with managements medium-term growth plans for the group and a maximum gearing ratio of around 3.5 times.
The financial model is underpinned by the groups consistent application of prudent and appropriate accounting policies.
