The expected increase reflects increasing Sky Broadband and Sky Talk subscribers, scaling our LLU presence and the growth of broadband traffic to support incremental customers and fibre capability, increasing Irish broadband subscribers and increased usage per customer.
Marketing costs increased in the year and are expected to increase in future years in order to maintain our share of voice in an increasingly competitive environment.
Subscriber management and supply chain costs were flat year on year.
The level of growth in both the total number of customers and the number of additional services taken by our customers for example HD will remain key drivers of these costs in future as will our ability to deliver rate efficiency improvements across our contact centre and supply chain operations.
Administration costs, excluding the impact of phasing of our share incentive plans, were flat year on year.
