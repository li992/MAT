The Cear Basin is a Cretaceous rift basin with proven source and reservoir rocks extending out into the deepwater setting.
Premier has committed to drilling two wells in CE-M-717 before August 2018.
Both Cear licences also carry commitments to acquire 3D seismic over the entire licence areas.
Premiers work programme in Brazil consists of 3D seismic acquisition planned for late 2014, with a view to drilling the first well in 2016.
Premier was also awarded a 35 per cent non-operated equity in licence FZA-M-90 in the deepwater Foz do Amazonas Basin.
This licence contains a potential high impact Cretaceous exploration play, proven across the border in French Guiana.
Premier opened a Brazil office in early 2014, which will be staffed for executing the forward drilling programmes.
The rift system in Kenya is one of the few remaining under-explored onshore, conventional oil plays.
In 2013 Premier secured a 55 per cent non-operated equity in onshore Kenya licence 2B, in the Southern Anza Basin.
The Anza Basin is a Cretaceous to recent Rift Basin, analogous to the prolific East Africa Rift Systems such as the Lokichar Tertiary Rift Basin which contains several recent oil discoveries.
Approximately 100 km of 2D seismic will be acquired in early 2014 and Premier is committed to drilling a well in late 2014 or early 2015.
Elsewhere in Kenya, Premier relinquished its non-operated 20 per cent interest in offshore licence L10A, as the identified prospectivity did not satisfy internal threshold criteria on a risked basis.
Premier continues to retain a 25 per cent equity in adjacent offshore Block L10B, for which a drill decision will be made in May 2014.
In October 2013, Premier and Rockhopper announced they had signed a Heads of Agreement with Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd FOGL to farm-in to licences PL004a and PL004c, which are adjacent to the Sea Lion development and include the Isobel Elaine and Jayne East prospects.
The transaction, which is due to complete in the first quarter of 2014, will result in the increase of Premiers equity in both licences to 36 per cent and assumption of operatorship.
In November 2012, Premier was awarded a 30 per cent non-operated interest in Block 12 in Iraq.
Block 12 lies in an under-explored part of one of the worlds most prolific oil and gas 2 basins.
This is an 8,000 km licence in the foreland basin of the Zagros fold belt, updip from producing fields.
Premier has significant exploration experience of foreland basins via its established history in Pakistan.
Over the course of the year, the 2014 work programme and budget was approved by the Iraqi ministry of oil and gas and a tender process for 2D and 3D seismic was initiated.
Premiers exploration rights in the Daora, Haouza, Mahbes, Mijek and Laguara blocks offshore the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic still remain under force majeure, awaiting resolution of sovereignty under a United Nations mandate process.
In Egypt, Premier continues the relinquishment process for the North Red Sea-1 licence.
Outlook Premiers first exploration well onshore Kenya to be drilled in late 2014 or early 2015 Acquisition of 3D seismic across our three new Brazilian licences planned for 2014 2015 Four well exploration and appraisal programme in the North Falkland Basin in 2015 Continue to look for opportunities in new countries which can deliver either high impact prospects or play-opening opportunities with significant follow on potential 42 Premier Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements OUR PEOPLE Premier seeks to be the employer of choice IT IS DUE TO THE CONTINUED HARD WORK, DEDICATION AND TALENT OF PREMIERS MANAGEMENT AND STAFF THAT THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO GENERATE STRONG PROFIT, RISING CASH FLOWS AND HEALTHY RETURN ON CAPITAL.

Xuan, Luu Thi Anh Finance Manager Vietnam 44 Premier Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Financial Statements FINANCIAL REVIEW Record sales revenue and cash flow Tony Durrant Finance Director Total sales revenue from Economic background all operations reached a The stability in oil prices continued for a third year running, averaging US$108.7 barrel bbl against US$111 bbl for the previous two years, and new record level trading in a range of US$119.0 bbl to US$96.8 bbl.
Premier's portfolio of of US$1.5 billion.
crudes traded at a weighted average of US$2.6 bbl premium to Brent, as we continue to realise favourable prices for our Chim So crude in the Asian markets.
Premier's average realisations for the year were US$109.0 bbl 2012: US$111.4 bbl after taking into account timings of actual liftings and export duties paid in Vietnam.
Post hedging, realised prices marginally increased to US$109.1 bbl 2012: US$107.5 bbl.
Average gas prices for the group were US$8.32 mscf 2012: US$8.34 mscf.
Gas prices in Singapore, linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil HSFO pricing and in turn, therefore, linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$17.1 mscf 2012: US$18.7 mscf.
The average price for Pakistan gas where only a portion of the contract formulae is linked to energy prices was US$4.4 mscf 2012: US$4.3 mscf.
Income statement Production in 2013 averaged 58.2 kboepd 2012: 57.7 kboepd on a working interest basis.
On an entitlement basis, which under the terms of our PSCs allows for additional government take at higher oil prices, production was 52.4 kboepd 2012: 51.6 kboepd.
Working interest gas production averaged 174 mmscfd 2012: 180 mmscfd or approximately 52 per cent of total production.
Total sales revenue from all operations reached a new record level of US$1.5 billion 2012: US$1.4 billion, driven by higher production and the stable oil prices.
Cost of sales rose to US$1,034.8 million 2012: US$742.4 million.
Operating costs amounted to US$418.9 million 2012: US$342.4 million.
Significant items included new field costs in respect of the Huntington field in the UK and costs relating to the gas pipeline repair in Vietnam.
Unit operating costs were US$19.7 boe 2012: US$16.2 boe.
Underlying unit amortisation excluding impairment rose to US$17.7 boe 2012: US$16.4 boe mainly reflecting commencement of production from the Huntington field in the UK, which has a higher amortisation charge per boe compared to the group average.
Impairment charges for the year which related to the Balmoral area amounted to US$178.7 million 2012: US$20.7 million on a pre-tax basis US$67.9 million, post-tax.
This followed a review of the longer-term plans for the life of the fields in this area, where it was determined that additional maintenance and operating cost expenditure is likely to be required in order to ensure that additional reserves will be extracted.
At year-end, decommissioning costs were also updated based on latest estimates of drilling costs and time estimates to abandon the fields.
A re-forecast of decommissioning costs has also resulted in a credit to the income statement of US$15.3 million related to Fife area abandonment activities.
