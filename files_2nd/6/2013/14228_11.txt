SALES The Groups bad debt charge on an underlying basis being both bad debts written off and the movement in the allowance for bad and doubtful debts decreased by 10bps to 0.5% of sales 2012: 0.6% of sales.
Reducing the Groups bad debt charge as a percentage of sales in difficult trading conditions is testament to the Groups strong credit control procedures.
Despite this encouraging performance, the Group is very mindful of the risk of bad debts increasing as the economies in which it operates remain weak, construction activity is subdued, and the Groups customer base remains at risk of having credit withdrawn by its banks.
The Groups credit control policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and a number of the Groups businesses have credit insurance to protect them from bad debts rising above prescribed aggregate loss levels.
As detailed in the Key Performance Indicators section, while the Groups underlying operating profit margin at 3.9% remains consistent with that achieved in 2012, it remains well below that historically achieved.
Given the operational gearing impact of the business where the majority of operating costs are fixed, it is envisaged that the Groups operating margins will continue to improve when the Group experiences sustained sales growth.

The Accounting Policies section on page 89 and Note 14 to the Accounts on page 105 provide details of what is included within intangible assets and over what periods the assets are amortised.
In response to the economic downturn, SIG halted its acquisition activities between 2008 and 2012.

On 1 February 2014 the Group agreed to sell its German Roofing operation for a net consideration of 7.2m.
As a consequence the assets and liabilities associated with this operation have been written down to the recoverable amount through the recognition of a one-off charge of 21.3m.
In addition, a goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of 21.5m associated with the write down of the German Roofing Cash Generating Unit was recognised.
