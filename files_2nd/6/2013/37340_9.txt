DIRECTORS REPORT overview anD HeaDline results Financial review Over the full year, valuation increases of 217.5m including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures helped us deliver a profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 533.0m, compared to 515.7m for the previous year.
Basic earnings per share were 68.4p compared to 67.5p for the year ended 31 March 2012.
However, underlying earnings were down slightly: revenue profit was 290.7m compared to 299.4m last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share declined from 38.5p to 36.8p this year.
Our combined portfolio increased in value from 10.33bn to 11.45bn as a result of acquisitions, further investment in our development programme and our valuation surplus of 217.5m.
Net assets per share increased by 38p from 921p at 31 March 2012 to 959p at 31 March 2013.
Adjusted diluted net assets per share were up by 4.6% over the year, increasing from 863p at 31 March 2012 to 903p.
The 40p increase in adjusted diluted net assets per share, together with the 29.4p dividend paid in the year, represents an 8.0% total return from the business.
A number of the measures we use internally to assess the performance of the business include the results of our joint ventures on a proportionate basis.

It includes the pre-tax results of our subsidiaries and joint ventures on a proportionate basis, but excludes capital and other one-off items.
A reconciliation of revenue profit to our IFRS profit before tax is given in note 4 to the financial statements.
Table 4 shows the composition of our revenue profit including the contributions from London and Retail.
Revenue profit decreased by 8.7m from 299.4m last year to 290.7m.
As anticipated in the Financial Review last year, the fall in revenue profit was due to a reduction in non-recurring income, the impact of selling investment properties ahead of finding attractive buying opportunities and the loss of income at Kingsgate House, SW1, a property we demolished this year for redevelopment.
