Audit Committee Report We report to the Board as part of a separate agenda item, on our activities and on matters of particular relevance to the Board in the conduct of their work.
During the Financial Year we formally reported to the Board on two occasions.
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE DURING THE YEAR We assisted the Board in carrying out its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting requirements, compliance and the assessment of internal controls.
We also managed the Companys relationship with the external auditor.
Following the publication of the revised version of the UK Corporate Governance Code, which applies to Financial Years commencing on or after 1 October 2012, the Board requested that we advise them on whether we believe the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Companys performance, business model and strategy.
Our terms of reference have been amended to reflect this.
FINANCIAL REPORTING Our primary role in relation to financial reporting is to review with both management and the external auditor of the appropriateness of the half-year and annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters: The ownership and existence of the assets, and The valuation of the underlying assets To aid our review we considered reports prepared by external service providers, including KPMG, EY and the administrator of the underlying funds, SS&C GlobeOp, and also reports from the external auditor on the outcome of their annual audit.
As set out in Note 1 j to the Financial Statements, in accordance with IAS 32 because of the provisions contained in the Companys Articles of Association the Sterling, Euro and US Dollar Ordinary shares have been classified as liabilities.
We reviewed this treatment again in considering the 2013 Annual Financial Statements and the Companys external auditors have confirmed to us that this remains the required accounting presentation.
