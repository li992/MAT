FINANCIAL REVIEW 2013 Another year of good, consistent, profitable and competitive top and bottom line underlying growth FINANCIAL OVERVIEW 2013 CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT UNDERLYING Turnover at 49.8 billion decreased 3.0%, including a negative impact from both foreign exchange, of SALES GROWTH 5.9%, and acquisitions net of disposals of 1.1%.
Underlying sales growth was 4.3% 2012: 6.9%, balanced between volume growth of 2.5% 2012: 3.4% and pricing of 1.8% 2012: 3.3%.
Emerging markets, now 6.9% 6.5% 57% of total turnover, were flat at reported exchange rates, with underlying sales growth of 8.7% versus 11.4% in the prior year.
The Group saw a weakening in the market growth of many emerging countries, in 4.3% particular during the third quarter, exacerbated by significant currency devaluation.
Core operating margin was up 0.4 percentage points to 14.1%.
Gross margin improved by 1.1 percentage points to 41.2% at constant exchange rates.
All categories and all regions improved gross margin.
This was a result of a higher margin business mix, driven in part by margin accretive 2011 2012 2013 innovations, and active cost management.
Commodity costs have been more stable than recent years, increasing by around 4% in 2013.
Investment in advertising and promotions increased by 0.5 percentage points or 460 million, at UNDERLYING constant exchange rates.
Overheads increased by 0.2 percentage points as a result of favourable VOLUME GROWTH one-off items in 2012.
Operating profit was 7.5 billion, compared with 7.0 billion in 2012, up 8%.
The increase was mainly 3.4% driven by non-core items which were a net credit of 0.5 billion 2012: net debit 0.1 billion : core 2.5% operating profit was flat at 7.0 billion.
The total gain on business disposals, recognised in non-core 1.6% items, was 0.7 billion.

Our longer term expectation for the tax rate remains around 26%.
Net profit from joint ventures and associates, together with other income from non-current investments, contributed 127 million in 2013, compared to 91 million in the prior year.
The movement is mainly due to the low prior year comparator which included an impairment of warrants associated with the disposals of the US laundry business.

Core earnings per share were 1.58, up 3% from 1.53 in 2012 after a 7% headwind from currency movements.
