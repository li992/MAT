The reduction in the value of interest rate swaps is attributable to interest rate swaps in asset positions maturing in the year.
The decrease in the value of other derivatives was due mainly to the decrease Graham Chipchase in aluminium prices combined with the weakening of the US dollar against Chief executive the euro.
