2009 79.1m We continue to make extra contributions to the plans at a rate agreed Return on sales with the trustees and expect this to be at the rate of 7m per year for the immediate future with the objective of eliminating the deficit over the next six years.
We continue to develop and implement plans to reduce the risk in the future cost of our DB pension plans.
21.1% R&D investment 2013 21.1% Expenditure on R&D increased to 31.1m 2012: 27.4m an increase of 13% and representing 5.0% 2012: 4.7% of revenue.
All four 2012 20.8% sectors increased both the absolute spend and their percentage of 2011 20.2% revenue spent on R&D in the year.
Environmental & Analysis has the 2010 18.8% highest spend per of revenue at 6.8%.
2009 17.3% We are required under IFRS to capitalise certain development expenditure and amortise it over an appropriate period, for us three years.
R&D by its nature carries risk and all R&D projects, particularly Dividend paid and proposed those requiring capitalisation, are subject to close scrutiny and a rigorous approval and review process.
This results in an asset carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, after 0.4m of 7% increase foreign exchange movements and disposals, of 12.0m 2012: 10.5m.

The key operating risks are covered 2010 32.0m in the Chief Executives Strategic Review and Sector Reviews.
2009 29.7m A key risk mitigation is that we spread risk across the Group via well-resourced independent operating units.
There are extensive and regular reviews of operations at local and Divisional levels.
These reviews are supplemented by Internal Audit.
As we expand our business internationally, we continue to focus on maintaining the quality of people and the controls operating across each country.
Our policies and processes to mitigate Bribery & Corruption together with our Code of Conduct have been rolled out across the Group including newly acquired businesses.
This supports our longstanding ethical approach to business.
In 2013 14 we will be supporting increased growth in subsidiary companies by further developing the strategic use of Information Technology having this year rolled out a centralised IT disaster recovery solution.
The Board considers all of the above factors in its review of Going Concern as described on page 69 and has been able to conclude its review satisfactorily.
Halma takes a disciplined approach to managing risk, to sustain high returns and deliver growth over the long term.
In the year ahead we will continue to focus on strong cash generation to enable investment in existing and new businesses, finance dividends and deliver significant value to shareholders.
