Overview of the year Financial review Introduction Investec operates under a DLC structure with primary listings of Investec plc on the London Stock Exchange and Investec Limited on the JSE Limited.
In terms of the contracts constituting the DLC structure, Investec plc and Investec Limited effectively form a single economic enterprise in which the economic and voting rights of ordinary shareholders of the companies are maintained in equilibrium relative to each other.
The directors of the two companies consider that for financial reporting purposes, the fairest presentation is achieved by combining the results and financial position of both companies.
Accordingly, the year-end results for Investec plc and Investec Limited present the results and financial position of the combined DLC group under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, denominated in Pounds Sterling.
All references in this document to Investec or the group relate to the combined DLC group comprising Investec plc and Investec Limited.
Exchange rates Our reporting currency is Pounds Sterling.
Certain of our operations are conducted by entities outside the UK.
The results of operations and the financial position of our individual companies are reported in the local currencies of the countries in which they are domiciled, including Rands, Australian Dollars, Euros and US Dollars.
These results are then translated into Pounds Sterling at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our combined consolidated financial results.
In the case of the income statement, the weighted average rate for the relevant period is applied and in the case of the balance sheet, the relevant closing rate is used.
The following table sets out the movements in certain relevant exchange rates against Pounds Sterling over the period.
