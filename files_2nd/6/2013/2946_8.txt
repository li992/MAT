However, we have had some success with EcoPod sales.
Over the period from 2011 to 2013, Carillion acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to sell and licence EcoPod, a heating system, which combines a range of technologies, including highly efficient cascade boilers with biomass, ground source and gas absorption heat pumps and thermal solar panels to deliver major energy savings.
EcoPod generated revenue, including licence fees, of some 36 million in 2013 and has delivered an overall return on our investment of over two times, which compares 3 favourably with the returns we expect from other investment decisions.
The operating margin was maintained at 5.1 per cent, with operating profit reduced, broadly in line with the reduction in revenue.
In 2013, we won new support services contracts and contract extensions worth some 1.9 billion, with notable successes in markets where we are seeking to develop and increase our presence, in line with our strategy of diversifying our support services business in each of our three geographies into sectors such as oil, power distribution and highways maintenance.
In the UK, notable contract wins included an extension to our contract with BT Openreach for Broadband Delivery UK worth some 500 million over three and a half-years, a five-year contract to provide facilities management services for Shell worth up to 150 million, contracts for Network Rail worth over 120 million, a A Carillion telent Joint Venture delivers a wide range of infrastructure services 10-year contract for the Sussex Energy Saving Programme worth up for BT Openreach and in 2013 BT awarded the Joint Venture a 500 million to 100 million, a strategic property services partnership for Stockport contract extension for Broadband Delivery UK.

However, the Revenue outlook for replenishing our portfolio of investments is positive.
In Group 2.3 1.3 December 2013, we achieved financial close on the Royal Liverpool Share of Joint Ventures 234.6 286.4 Hospital project, in which we will invest 15 million of equity.

seven projects for cash proceeds of 151.2 million, which represented an average discount rate of some seven per cent and generated a pre-tax profit of 44.6 million.
In 2013, our investments in PPP projects continued to perform well and in line with our objective of achieving a 15 per cent internal rate of return.
Revenue in 2013 reduced, due to the effects of selling seven equity investments in 2012, as previously reported, together with the effects of selling further investments in 2013.
Operating profit increased, because profit from the sale of equity investments more than offset the equity returns no longer received from the investments sold.
At 31 December 2013, we had 19 PPP projects in which we had invested 53 million of equity and into which we are committed to make further planned investments of 95 million.
The Directors valuation of these investments at 31 December 2013, using a nine per cent discount rate, was 68 million 2012: 173 million, which reduced due to the effect of 2 selling investments during the year.

Full-year revenue increased as the pace of contract awards improved during the year, although there continued to be some slippage in respect of a number of contracts that we have been targeting that we now expect to be awarded in 2014.

profit reduced in 2013, due to our operating margin reducing to 4.0 per cent 2012: 6.1 per cent, which continues to reflect the fact 2 that our markets across the region remain competitive.
During 2013, we won a number of substantial new contracts.
For example in Oman, Carillion Alawi won a 130 million contract to build the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre and a 92 million contract to build the Kempinski Wave Hotel.
In Abu Dhabi, our Joint Venture business Al Futtaim Carillion AFC won a 130 million contract to build the Four Seasons Hotel and became preferred bidder for a 110 million contract for the Hard Rock Hotel, for which we have signed a contract since the year end.
In Dubai, AFC became the preferred bidder for a 155 million contract to build the City Walk retail development.
As a result, the value of our order book and probable orders for Middle East construction services increased to 0.9 billion at the year end 2012: 3 0.8 billion.
Revenue visibility for 2014 is 85 per cent 2012: 94 per cent for 2013.
Our pipeline of contract opportunities also increased at the year end to 13.1 billion 2012: 11.4 billion with notable opportunities in Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and we expect to deliver further revenue growth in this segment in 2014.
Over the medium term, we expect new opportunities in the United Arab Emirates, where, for example, Dubais success in being chosen to host Expo 2020 will lead to additional investment in buildings and Part of the multi-billion pound mixed-use Cairo Festival City infrastructure.

Contrary to our expectations at the beginning of 2013, the need to rescale our UK construction activities continued throughout the year, with total UK construction revenue reducing to around 0.8 billion in 2013 2012: 0.9 billion.
However, we now believe rescaling is complete and that our revenue run-rate in UK construction had stabilised by the year end and now has the potential for modest growth in the second half of 2014.
Our construction activities in Canada contributed some 0.3 billion of revenue in 2013, which was slightly lower than in 2012, as we continue to maintain a very selective approach to the contracts for which we bid, with a particular focus on bidding for Public Private Partnership projects for which we expect contract awards to be made in 2014.
The reduction in operating profit reflected lower revenue and a reduction in operating margin to 4.2 per cent 2012: 5.6 per cent, which was in line with our expectations.
The margin was lower because some of the factors that have contributed to higher margins, namely lower bid costs, the action we took to reduce overheads and favourable outturns on contracts being completed, are temporary and their effects are declining.
Nevertheless, we believe that our strategy of being very selective in terms of the contracts for which we bid will have a permanent benefit to margins and we continue to expect our normalised, long-term margin to remain 2 Carillion has been selected by Manchester Airports Group as a partner to above the industry average.
