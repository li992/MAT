SWITCH RMSpumptools develops mechanical and electrical products for artificial lift completions.
The Switch is an industry first, patented, in-well device that can direct power between two electric submersible pumps from a single power cable.
Through use of its innovative technology, RMSpumptools has developed a means to reliably switch between two power cables using hydraulic control from surface, all while compensating for the high pressures and temperatures associated with an in-well environment.
The Switch targets high cost applications typically associated with offshore and subsea well completions where significant savings can be achieved.
