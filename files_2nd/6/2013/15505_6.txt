BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW OVERVIEW Revenues of 601.5m 2012: 471.5m were 27.6% higher than in the previous financial year: the pre-tax profit was 34.6m 2012: 30.7m.
The increase in revenue reflects the combination of continuing strong organic growth in the number of services we provide, modest energy price inflation, and the swing from a warm winter last year to an exceptionally cold winter this year.
The improvement in pre-tax profitability of 12.7% reflects the investment we are making in signing up increasing numbers of Gold Status members, the benefits of which will become increasingly apparent over the coming years.
Our balance sheet at the year end shows a net cash position of 0.8m which was broadly in line with last year, notwithstanding a 7.5m increase in working capital during the year associated with our rapid growth.
The increase in both the quantity and quality of new customers caused a rise of around 13.5% in the net investment of our Customer Acquisition operating segment compared with the previous year.
We anticipate a further modest increase this year, as we maintain our current strong focus on growth.
Distribution costs increased by 1.8m reflecting higher bonuses and incentive payments to Distributors resulting from our continuing strong organic growth, and the progressive implementation of the new compensation plan we announced almost 18 months ago.
Earnings per share increased by 14.5% to a record level of 38.7p 2012: 33.8p.
In accordance with previous guidance and our strong cash generation, the Company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 18p 2012: 17p per share, making a total dividend of 31p 2012: 27p per share for the year.
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS The rate at which our customer management business is growing remained consistently strong over the year, and we successfully achieved our seventh consecutive quarter in which we delivered net growth of over 50,000 services: 70,000 NET GROWTH IN NUMBER OF SERVICES PROVIDED 60,000 50,000 40,000 30,000 20,000 10,000 0 Q1 FY11 Q2 FY11 Q3 FY11 Q4 FY11 Q1 FY12 Q2 FY12 Q3 FY12 Q4 FY12 Q1 FY13 Q2 FY13 Q3 FY13 Q4 FY13 21 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED This trend reflects the significant further progress we have made in focussing Distributor activity on gathering multi-utility home-owners.
As a result, all our core services are now seeing consistent strong monthly growth.
This progressive improvement in the quality of our customer base, with lower levels of delinquency and a steady increase in the average number of services being taken by each customer, has resulted in a reduction in both churn and bad debts.
Revenues increased across all our services during the year, with the exceptionally cold winter increasing gas sales by approximately 27m compared with the level we would have expected to supply at seasonally normal temperatures.
280m REVENUE BY SERVICE M 240m 200m 2013 160m 2012 120m 80m 40m 0 Electricity Gas Fixed Mobile Other Communications Telephony Broadband CUSTOMER ACQUISITION Our net investment in acquiring new customers increased during the year to 10.1m 2012: 8.9m, reflecting the improvement we have achieved in both the quantity and quality of our new customers.
Although the initial cost of acquiring a customer who takes at least four core services is considerably higher than for a household taking fewer services, our experience shows that the lifetime value of such customers more than compensates for the higher upfront cost we incur.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution costs, which primarily represent the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Distributors, increased by 1.8m to 17.8m 2012: 16.0m : this reflects an increase in the amount of residual income we paid, combined with higher bonus and incentive payments resulting from the significant increase in our organic growth compared with the previous year.
22 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS BUSINESS The bad debt charge for the year fell to 9.0m representing 1.5% of revenues 2012: 2.0%, reflecting the improvement in the quality of our customer base referred to above.
To have achieved this fall against the headwinds of continuing strong growth, energy price inflation and a challenging broader economic climate is particularly encouraging.
Whilst remaining sympathetic to the financial difficulties some households are experiencing in paying for their energy, we continue to manage our bad debt risk by installing prepayment meters at properties where the occupiers are unwilling to pay for the energy they are using by any other means.
We installed 6,584 of them during the year 2012: 6,842, many of them at the customers own request, which helped take our base of prepayment meters to 33,563 2012: 22,477 representing approximately 4.5% of the energy services we supply: this remains significantly below the average level of prepayment meters within the industry of around 15%.
In addition, the further small reduction we have seen in the average number of delinquent customers across the year is, we believe, a useful forward indicator to the level of bad debts we can expect for the current year.
2.5% DELINQUENT CUSTOMERS 2.0% 1.5% 1.0% 0.5% 0.0% Q2 FY11 Q3 FY11 Q4 FY11 Q1 FY12 Q2 FY12 Q3 FY12 Q4 FY12 Q1 FY13 Q2 FY13 Q3 FY13 Q4 FY13 The average number of employees increased from 541 to 604, most of which took place in the second half of the year: this increase in headcount of 11.6% is substantially below the increase we saw during the year in the number of services we are providing, as we continue to enhance our systems to manage our growing customer base more effectively.
Personnel expenses increased by 17.8% during the year to 20.5m 2012: 17.4m, as we continue to strengthen our management team, and other administration costs remained broadly stable.
SHARE OPTION COSTS The operating profit is stated after share option expenses of 931,000 2012: 641,000.
These expenses relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share based payments.
TAXATION A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
The tax charge for the year is 7.6m 2012: 7.3m.
The effective tax rate for the year was 21.8% 2012: 23.7%.
23 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET The largest balance sheet movements in the year reflect the increased size of our customer base, recent energy price increases and the impact of the unseasonably cold winter.
Under our wholesale supply arrangements with npower, we are no longer responsible for funding the working capital requirements associated with our energy budget plan customers: as at the year end, this net funding requirement would have been in excess of 55.0m 2012: 26.9m.
Due to the impact of these arrangements, the level of working capital employed by the Group only increased from 31.4m as at 31 March 2012 to 38.9m at the year end, which was broadly in line with the growth in revenue.
There was a small net cash outflow of 0.2m during the year, in line with management expectations.
Capital expenditure is expected to increase significantly over the course of the current year, as we start to pay for the 18.0m refurbishment of Merit House our new headquarters office building, whilst funding growing demand from customers for a free Smartphone.
Facilities will be arranged with Barclays Bank PLC to enable us to fund this expected increase, without affecting our progressive dividend policy.
The Group does not have a policy with respect to interest rate management, as it has no long-term debt funding requirements.
Cash surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns, after allowing for the Companys working capital requirements.
