Financial review Chief Financial Officers report Jonathan Silver Chief Financial Officer Segments Laird has two segments: Performance Materials and Wireless Systems.
Revenue Revenue increased by 3% to 537.0m for the full year in 2013 from 520.2m in 2012.
In US$, Performance Materials revenues were 4% higher and Wireless Systems revenues were 2% lower.
The table below shows revenue for each segment in US$ together with the incremental revenue contribution from acquisitions made part way through 2012 and in 2013.
Performance Wireless Materials Systems Total Revenue $m $m $m 2012 514.4 309.7 824.1 2013 net of acquisitions 528.8 301.5 830.3 Acquisitions 7.4 2.1 9.5 Total for 2013 536.2 303.6 839.8 Revenue on an organic basis was 1% higher in 2013 over 2012.
Revenue on an organic basis is defined as the increase or decrease in revenue, year on year, with the base revenue for the prior year including revenue from the newly acquired companies as if Laird had owned those acquired companies for the same period in the prior year.
Segmental revenue is also disclosed in note 3.
Revenue from the largest customer, including revenue invoiced indirectly through its suppliers, amounted to 18% of revenue 2012, 19%.
The top five customers accounted for 34% of revenue including revenue invoiced indirectly through their suppliers in 2013 2012, 36%.

Performance Wireless Materials Systems Unallocated Total 2012 Operating profit $m 77.5 40.9 10.5 107.9 ROS 15.1% 13.2% 1.3% 13.1% 2013 Operating profit $m 80.5 35.5 11.0 105.0 ROS 15.0% 11.7% 1.3% 12.5% Operating margin for Performance Materials was 15.0% in 2013 2012, 15.1% and for Wireless Systems operating margin was lower 11.7% 2012, 13.2%.
The table below provides further analysis in US$ of the underlying operating profit.
The gross profit percentage of 40.8% is 0.8% higher than in 2012.
2013 2012 Performance Materials & Wireless Systems $m $m Revenue 839.8 824.1 Cost of sales 496.9 494.1 Gross margin 342.9 330.0 Gross margin % 40.8% 40.0% SG&A 176.0 169.2 Gross R&D 74.4 58.0 Net capitalised development 12.5 5.1 Operating profit 105.0 107.9 R&D expenditure has risen to 8.9% of revenue against 7.0% in 2012.
Much of the increase in R&D is in Wireless Systems which typically has design cycles beyond one year and longer product lives than Performance Materials.
A proportion of this investment has been capitalised and typically will be amortised over a three to four year period and matched against the revenue benefit.
Two companies were acquired part way through 2012 and Nextreme was acquired in 2013.
$5.0m of the R&D increase $3.1m net of capitalised development and $3.0m of the indirect overhead increase is due to the full year impact of the 2012 acquisitions and a part year of the 2013 acquisition.
The bar chart below is a high level profit bridge of the change in underlying operating profit from 2012 and 2013.
The impact of acquisitions has been broken out in order to provide a better understanding of the changes in the base business.
2012 2013 $8.4m margin $ 5.9 m drop-through Investment in net R&D $ 3.8 m Investment $ 1.6 m $107.9m in indirect overheads Acquisition $105.0m margin drop through on reduction in organic revenue, year on year Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 47 016933 LAIRD AR 13 p46-66 v15.
indd 47 07 03 2014 19:16 Financial review continued Underlying operating profit operating margin continued The increase in gross margin of $8.4m arises from the increase in revenue on an organic basis together with an increase in average gross margins.
The margin increase has been more than offset by the $5.9m increased investment in net R&D gross R&D less net capitalised development, the $3.8m increase in indirect overheads and the net loss from the incremental contribution of $1.6m from acquisitions.
Profit Profit before tax from continuing operations was 43.2m 2012, 45.1m.
Profit for the year after taxation and after discontinued operations was 30.8m 2012, 46.5m.
Underlying profit Underlying profit before tax in the year was 60.1m 2012, 60.7m.
Underlying profit is defined as profit before tax, exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, goodwill and US capitalised development costs, the gain or loss on sale of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments, and acquisition transaction costs, as set out in note 14.
Exceptional costs Exceptional costs in the period amounted to 4.6m for continuing operations 2012, 2.1m.
Exceptional costs were reduced by a 4.7m reduction to the assessment of the earnout that could be payable for the Nextreme acquisition.
5.0m of the exceptional cost was due to the buyout by the Telematics business of its existing manufacturing representative agreement to allow a more direct approach to market.
The cash outlay for the buyout does not occur until 2014 and later.
Much of the balance of the expenditure relates to changes in senior personnel, to align senior management with the new culture and further allow implementation of the strategy.
Finance costs Finance costs, excluding a profit on the fair valuing of financial instruments of 1.3m 2012, 0.4m were 7.1m, compared to 7.4m in 2012.
Taxation The underlying tax charge on total underlying profit before tax is equivalent to an average tax rate of 17.5% 2012, 16.5%.
Due to the proportion of profit generated in China, the average tax rate is expected to increase in 2014 and be in the range 18% to 19%.
Profits in the USA continue to be sheltered by amortised goodwill deductions resulting from acquisitions and profits in the Czech Republic are sheltered by incentives.
Lairds tax payable largely arises in China and Germany.
An analysis of the total tax charge is given in note 11.
Underlying earnings Continuing underlying earnings per share were 18.6p 2012, 19.1p.
Underlying earnings are based on underlying profit less underlying tax and exclude deferred tax on acquired intangible assets, goodwill and US capitalised development costs.
The average number of shares in issue throughout 2013 was 266.0m 2012, 265.6m.

indd 48 07 03 2014 19:16 Cash flow The table below provides a further analysis of cash flow to complement the notes to the financial statements.
2013 2012 2012 Analysis of cash flow m m m Continuing Continuing Discontinued operations operations operations Operating profit 67.2 68.1 1.5 Depreciation asset disposal gain 14.9 13.5 Amortisation of capitalised development costs 3.6 5.3 Share based payments 1.4 1.8 87.1 88.7 1.5 Increase decrease in working capital 19.0 7.5 11.1 Capitalised development costs 11.6 8.5 Capital expenditure less disposals 12.8 13.3 0.3 Operating cash flow 43.7 74.4 12.3 Total operating cash flow 43.7 86.7 Finance costs net 7.1 7.0 Taxation 13.0 17.9 Trading cash flow surplus 23.6 61.8 Dividends 28.6 23.2 Trading cash flow after dividends 5.0 38.6 Acquisitions disposals 2.6 16.4 Exceptional costs 3.2 13.3 Share issues 0.3 1.6 Increase in treasury shares 4.4 Exchange translation movement 2.6 4.8 Decrease increase in net borrowings 2.7 10.9 after adjusting for creditor increases on exceptional items of 5.8m 2012, decreases of 12.4m Cash conversion operating cash flow as a proportion of operating profit for continuing operations in 2013 was 65% against 109% in 2012.
The rate in 2012 was unusually high due to a 7.5m working capital inflow, whereas a small outflow would have been expected.
As expected this reversed early in 2013 and therefore had an adverse impact on 2013 cash conversion.
For the two years consecutively together, cash conversion was just under 90% consistent with the healthy level of cash generation which Laird targets.
Treasury policies Laird has a centralised Treasury function, the objectives of which are to monitor and manage the financial risks of the Group and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet the requirements of the business.
Group Treasury is not intended to be a profit centre and operates within a framework of policies and procedures.
Lairds Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to assist in the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
All hedging is carried out centrally and speculative trading is specifically prohibited by Group Treasury policy.

indd 49 07 03 2014 19:16 Financial review continued Interest rate risk Laird is exposed to interest rate risk as it holds borrowings on both a fixed and floating basis.
Lairds policy for this risk is to optimise the mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage Lairds finance costs.
Credit and counterparty risk Lairds policy on counterparty risk management is to place cash deposits and other financial instruments with its relationship banks, all of which also provide credit facilities to Laird.
The level of exposure to each bank is continually monitored.
As at 31 December 2013 all cash and short-term deposits had a maturity of less than three months.
Foreign exchange management Laird aims to minimise its exposures to US$ transactional currency exposures by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
Laird aims to forward cover at least 75% of the unmatched cash flows on a quarterly basis.
Foreign currency borrowings are used partially to hedge the currencies of the Groups principal assets and cash flows.
Where foreign currency borrowings are in the same currency as investment in overseas assets they are treated as a hedge of the net investment.
Net borrowings and debt facilities Net borrowings were 109.5m 2012, 106.8m.
A cornerstone of our financial planning is to ensure that the Group maintains committed loan finance which provides sufficient headroom above expected borrowing requirements and has a significant proportion with terms that exceed one year.
Laird has 235m 2012, 235m of bilateral revolving credit facilities which do not expire until April 2016.
In addition, Laird has in issue $140.0m 84.5m of US$ Private Placement notes which have remaining terms of just under one year 2014, $97.0m, and three years 2016, $43.0m.
Covenants A key consideration for financial planning is to maintain sufficient headroom between borrowings and the ceiling set by the covenants.
Lairds bank facilities and US Private Placement loan notes contain two principal financial covenants: net debt EBITDA earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and interest cover.
For the year ended 31 December 2013, net borrowings were 1.3 times EBITDA, 37% of the maximum permitted of 3.5 times.
Interest cover was 10.2 times against the minimum requirement of 3.0 times.
Thus, there was considerable financial headroom.
The expected headroom is routinely estimated against the covenants and the sensitivity to a number of alternative scenarios is tested to ensure ongoing compliance.
The Group does not anticipate approaching its covenant limits in the foreseeable future.

indd 50 07 03 2014 19:16 Currencies in 2013 Local currency exposures are balanced where possible but the Group operates a global business and this creates currency imbalances where operating and procurement costs may not be able to be matched with revenues in local currencies.
In 2013, circa 75% of revenues were negotiated in US$.
With circa 45% of the cost base in US$, there is a large US$ surplus.
Approximately 10% of revenues are negotiated in both Renminbi and Euros.
In most currencies other than US$ and Euro, costs exceed revenues, the most significant being the Renminbi RMB which accounts for approximately 34% of Lairds cost base.
This imbalance can lead to an adverse impact, in so far as the strengthening of the RMB may not be fully recovered in US$ selling prices.
In addition, there is a translation impact in converting profits into the Groups reporting currency Sterling : each US$0.01 appreciation against Sterling approximates to an annual increase in operating profit of 0.4m.
In 2013, on average through the year the US$ was stronger against Sterling than in 2012 and this increased profits on translation by 0.5m.
The majority of the Groups assets are held overseas and these are hedged in part by foreign currency loans.
Pensions There are 29 employees who are active members of defined benefit plans and approximately 1,600 deferred and current pensioners.
There is an overall defined benefit pension scheme deficit under IAS 19 Revised 2011 of 3.7m at 31 December 2013 which is more than accounted for by the unfunded schemes of 6.4m as the funded schemes are in surplus.
At 31 December 2012, there was an overall deficit of 1.5m.
The principal driver of the year-on-year change in the deficit was an increase in the inflation assumption from 3.15% in 2012 to 3.6% in 2013, which contributed to the increase in the estimate of liabilities.
Shareholders funds Shareholders funds at the 2013 year end were 436.1m 2012, 440.9m.
The reconciliation is set out in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Return on capital employed Return on capital employed underlying profit before interest and tax as a proportion of average shareholders funds plus net borrowings during the year was 12.0% in 2013 compared to 12.4% in 2012.
