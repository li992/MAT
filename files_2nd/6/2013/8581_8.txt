Settling the convertible has resulted in 16 million of interest cost savings over the remaining period of the bond.
Partly buying back the debt has avoided the full dilution which would have occurred if the entire convertible had been redeemed.
Settling the convertible has also resulted in an exceptional charge of 23 million shown in financing costs and in a net 74 million loss attributable to equity, which has been reflected directly in retained earnings.
