Strategic report Financial review and risk OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS easyJet grew revenue by 10.5% from 3,854 million to 4,258 million.
Whilst the economic environment remained tough, the combination of a benign competitor capacity environment and easyJets efficient management of its network in targeting markets with the highest returns has driven improved yields and load factor.
Capacity increased by 3.3% as easyJet ew over 60 million passengers for the first time this year.
easyJets profit before tax grew by 50.9% to 478 million, resulting in profit before tax per seat of 7.03 2012: 4.81. profit after tax was 398 million, an increase of 56.1% from 255 million last year.
As competitors have reduced their capacity on easyJet routes, easyJet has increased capacity by 3.3%.
The Companys strategy of targeting capacity with the highest returns generated strong yields in the year.
Further improvements in yields were driven by the maturity of routes introduced in prior years, and revenue initiatives, including the introduction of allocated seating.
easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2013 30 Strategic report Excluding fuel, cost per seat grew by 5.3% to 38.17, and by 3.9% at constant currency: of this increase, 2.6% was due to increases in charges at regulated airports.
A further 0.4% of the increase was due to the increased need for fide-icing following one of the longest periods of adverse weather experienced across the network in the last few years.
The increased proportion of A320 aircraft in the eet delivered a cost per seat reduction of 0.9%.
Fuel costs decreased slightly on a per seat basis, due to the increased proportion of A320 aircraft and a slightly shorter average sector length.
Our effective fuel price of $980 per tonne was in line with last year.
profit before tax increased by 161 million 2.22 per seat to 478 million 7.03 per seat.
Tax charge for the year was 80 million.
The significant majority of profits are subject to UK corporation tax at 23.5%: the remainder being subject to Swiss corporate tax at 24.1%.
The lower effective tax rate of 17% is a consequence of legislation being enacted in the year reducing the UK corporation tax rate to 20% from 1 April 2015, which resulted in a reduction of the deferred tax element of the tax liability.
Earnings per share and dividends per share 2013 2012 pence per pence per share share Change Basic earnings per share 101.3 62.5 62.1% Proposed ordinary dividend 33.5 21.5 55.8% Proposed special dividend 44.1 Basic earnings per share increased by 62.1% to 101.3 pence driven by the 56.1% increase in profit after tax from 255 million to 398 million, and a 3.7% reduction in the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
The ordinary dividend grew by 55.8% to 33.5 pence per share.
After taking into consideration the level of liquidity in the business at the end of the financial year, the Board is additionally proposing to pay a special dividend of 175 million 44.1 pence per share.
The ordinary and special dividends are subject to shareholder approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 13 February 2014.
Return on capital employed and capital structure 2013 2012 Change ROCE 17.4% 11.3% 6.1ppt Gearing 7% 29% 22ppt ROCE for the year was 17.4%, an improvement of 6.1 percentage points from the prior year driven by the increase in profit as average adjusted capital employed remained broadly in line with the prior year.
Total shareholder return for the year was 143.8% driven mainly by the increase in share price from 5.81 to 12.78.
This was a result of the signicantly improved cash ow performance, proceeds from sale and leasebacks and the release of restricted cash in the period.
com 31 Strategic report Financial review and risk continued EXCHANGE RATES The proportion of revenue and costs denominated in currencies other than sterling was little changed year on year.
The slight reduction in revenues denominated in euros was the result of improved yields earned across the UK.
Revenue Costs 2013 2012 2013 2012 Sterling 48% 47% 25% 24% Euro 41% 43% 35% 35% US dollar 1% 1% 34% 35% Other principally Swiss franc 10% 9% 6% 6% Average exchange rates 2013 2012 Change Euro revenue 1.19 1.19 0.2% Euro costs 1.19 1.22 2.0% US dollar $1.59 $1.60 0.5% Swiss franc CHF 1.45 CHF 1.46 0.7% Exchange rates were again volatile, with the euro uctuating between 1.14 and 1.25 to the pound and the US dollar between $1.49 and $1.63.
However over the year as a whole, movements in average effective exchange rates were relatively small.
In the 2012 financial year easyJet saw a difference of 0.03 between average exchange rates for euro revenue and costs due to sterling strengthening during the second half of the year.
In the 2013 financial year the average rates were the same, driven by sterling weakness in the early part of 2013 followed by a gradual recovery during the second half of the year.
The total negative impact on profit for the year of changes in exchange rates was as follows: Favourable adverse Euro Swiss franc US dollar Other Total million million million million million Revenue 5 3 1 1 6 Fuel 1 5 4 Costs excluding fuel 33 2 1 34 Total 37 5 4 2 44 Costs Revenue % % EUR EUR 6% 10% USD USD GBP GBP Other Other 35% 25% 41% 48% 34% 1% easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2013 32 Strategic report FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Revenue 2013 2012 Pence per Pence per million per seat ASK million per seat ASK Seat revenue 4,194 61.64 5.65 3,794 57.61 5.26 Non-seat revenue 64 0.94 0.09 60 0.90 0.08 Total revenue 4,258 62.58 5.74 3,854 58.51 5.34 Revenue per seat improved by 7.0% to 62.58 in comparison to the prior year, with seat revenue contributing to almost all of this increase.
The primary driver for revenue per seat increase was the improved yield, as easyJet took advantage of competitor capacity reduction on its routes and made changes to its network, including the closure of the Madrid base, in order to drive capacity to markets which deliver the highest returns.
Load factor increased by 0.6 percentage points to 89.3%.
Revenue initiatives further drove the increase in revenue per seat, in particular the introduction of allocated seating in November 2012 contributed 0.51 of this increase.
Non-seat revenue per seat performance stabilised after falling last year.
Commissions earned from travel insurance continued to decline however this was offset by improved in-ight sales.
Airports and ground handling cost per seat increased by 9.4% 7.9% at constant currency, primarily driven by increases in charges at regulated airports, with significant increases in Spain and Italy.
The increases in Spain by AENA were a factor in the decision to close easyJets Madrid base earlier in the year.
Italian increases were driven by the implementation of the contratto di programma programme, with further costs as a result of the quadrupling of the terminal Navaid charges.
Airports and ground handling costs were also impacted by the higher load factor as well as the prolonged winter weather resulting in a significant increase in fide-icing costs.
Crew cost per seat increased by 1.9% 1.1% at constant currency, with an average pay increase of 1.7% partially mitigated by the increased proportion of A320 aircraft in the eet.
Navigation costs were broadly in line with the prior year at constant currency, as higher rates were offset by the benefit of the increased mix of A320 aircraft in the eet and the reduced average sector length.
Maintenance costs were at at constant currency.
As expected, the one-off items incurred last year did not recur, however there were cost increases as a consequence of an increase in the average eet age to 5.1 years and a net 17 additional leased aircraft.
The average age of the eet is expected to gradually rise in the next few years as a result of easyJets decision to minimise expenditure on the current generation aircraft ahead of the eet order to acquire new generation A320neo aircraft, due for delivery from 2017.
Other costs have increased by 8.5% to 3.31 per seat, mainly as a result of an increase in those performance-related employee costs which are based on either return on capital employed or total shareholder return.
Disruption costs also increased with higher levels of compensation claims made in the year as more ights were cancelled due to the adverse weather.
Other costs also include brand licence royalties, which doubled to 10.6 million following the transition from xed fees in 2011 and 2012 to 0.25% of total revenue as set out in the Brand Licence Agreement.

After taking account of hedging, easyJets average effective fuel price was $980, in line with last year.
This, together with the increased proportion of A320 aircraft in the eet and a small reduction in average sector length, resulted in a small decline in fuel cost per seat.
For much of the year future fuel prices were below spot price and we have purchased forward 1.4 million tonnes of fuel for 2014 and 2015 at an average price of $948 per tonne.
As a result the hedged percentages are 72% for 2014 at $982 per tonne and 56% for 2015 at $950 per tonne.

Aircraft leasing costs per seat increased by 3.7% driven by the sale and leaseback of 12 new A320 aircraft and 12 mid-life A319 aircraft.
Seven A319 aircraft were returned to lessors, so overall the number of leased aircraft increased by 17 to 72.
Leased aircraft represent 33% of the eet at year end, which allows easyJet to eliminate their future residual value risk and provide eet exibility over and above that provided by the new framework arrangements.
easyJet expects the owned leased mix to uctuate in advance of the delivery of new generation A320neo aircraft from 2017.
Interest payable and finance charges decreased by 0.15 per seat to 0.23 as easyJet repaid early 186 million of relatively high-coupon debt in the year, partly offset by reduced interest rates earned on cash and money market deposits.
Net exchange losses arise from changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling.
Fluctuations of the size seen in the last few years are within the range of expectations given the size of the related foreign currency cash ows.

com 35 Strategic report Financial review and risk continued Net assets increased by 223 million driven by the profit for the year offset by dividends paid and the adverse movement in the hedging reserve.
The movement in the hedging reserve was due to the mark-to-market movement on the US dollar and jet fuel forward contracts, partly offset by the favourable movements on the Swiss franc and euro forward contracts.
The net book value of property plant and equipment decreased by 115 million.
Movement in property plant and equipment is driven by the acquisition of 10 aircraft, pre-delivery payments on aircraft orders, offset by the sale and operating leaseback of 24 aircraft.
Net working capital improved from the prior year, partly driven by the greater number of seats on sale, and partly by the decrease in credit card receivables at the year end as easyJet made changes to its contract with providers, improving settlement terms.

Net cash at 30 September 2013 was 558 million compared with net debt of 74 million at 30 September 2012 driven by the increased cash generated from operations, proceeds received on the sale and leaseback transactions in the year and the release of restricted cash in the year.
