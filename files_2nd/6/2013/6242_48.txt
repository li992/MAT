The US$525.3 million decline reected the adverse effect of lower affecting performance and to provide a gold and silver prices and reduced sales volumes of gold from Minera detailed analysis of the financial results Penmont.
These factors were partially mitigated by increased volumes ofsilver sold, mainly from Saucito.
inorder to enhance understanding The main factors that impacted adjusted production costs were: the oftheGroups financial statements.

The financial information is optimisation and cost-reduction initiatives, as well as lower variable production costs at Minera Penmont due to stoppages.
presented in US dollars, except where Despite the slight decrease in adjusted production costs, cost of sales indicated.
The full Financial Statements increased by 6.9% due to the unproductive costs recorded at Minera andtheir accompanying notes can Penmont US$26.1 million : and the fact that in 2013 there was no significant variation in change in work in process US$1.3 million, whilst be found on page 149-206. there was an increase in 2012 US$74.3 million.
These adverse factors were mitigated by the lower depreciation and profit sharing, as well as favourable results from MXP USD hedging.
As a result, gross profit decreased from US$1,364.6 million to US$767.4 million.
Exploration expenses recorded in the income statement of US$207.8 million decreased by 11.0% compared to 2012.
Total risk capital invested in exploration was US$233.3 million, a decrease of 26.8% compared to 2012 and below the revised budgeted gure of US$242.8 million.
This decrease reected our continued commitment toinvesting through cycles albeit with a more conservative approach.
The Silverstream contract was another factor that negatively affected the Groups profit levels, with a US$54.0 million non-cash loss registered during the period comprised of a non-cash loss of US$65.7 million related to the revaluation of the Silverstream and an US$11.7 million gain resulting from amortisation effects during the period : this compares to aUS$117.7 million gain recorded in 2012.
We engage in some hedging activities to mitigate the impact of risks related to variables that are beyond our control such as prices, exchange rates and interest rates.
These include hedging of a portion of lead and zinc production as these are the Groups by-products: Mexican peso-US dollar exchange rates, which affect our cost of sales: and other currencies, such as euros and Swedish krona related to the purchase of equipment.
In addition, we entered into a rate lock agreement in November 2013 in connection with the debt issuance due to the extreme volatility and the upward trend of interest rates at that time.
Detailed information about hedging activities and derivative positions isexplained going forward in each component of the income statement it affects.
All the above factors resulted in a 69.5% decrease in profit for the year and a 67.6% decline in profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group, to US$240.4 million.
The Group ended the year with a cash position of US$1,251.7 million.
This resulted mainly from: net cash from operating activities of US$446.0 million, the issuance of US$789.0 million Senior Notes, net of transaction costs, the US$346.1 million placement of new shares and US$63.8 million proceeds from the Silverstream.
