FINANCIAL REVIEW FINANCIAL REVIEW INTRODUCTION In compliance with IFRS, the income and expenditure directly attributable to discontinued operations, principally the Groups former office portfolio, the remainder of which was sold during 2013, has been disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement.
The assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations, are described as held for sale in the comparative figures for the consolidated balance sheet.
Note 9B on page 130 analyses the components of the net profit related to discontinued operations.
With the exception of Hammersons former share of the secured loan on 125 Old Broad Street, assets held for sale at 31 December 2012 were funded from the Groups unsecured debt, so no finance costs have been attributed to these assets within the profit related to discontinued operations.
PROFIT BEFORE TAX The Groups profit before tax for 2013, including discontinued operations, was 341.2 million compared with 142.2 million in 2012.
As analysed in the table below, the year-on-year increase reflected a full years contribution from revaluations within Value Retail, for which we have equity accounted since August 2012, and portfolio revaluation gains of 90.3 million.
Property revaluation losses in 2012 amounted to 49.9 million.
The majority of the office portfolio was sold in 2012, and this explains the lower gain on sale of investment properties in 2013.
A good operational performance also contributed to the increase in profit.
Losses on derivative revaluations were partly offset by lower costs relating to bond redemptions.

The table below bridges adjusted profit before tax between the current and prior years.
The principal contributors to the increase were the positive impact from acquisitions, income growth at the like-for-like portfolio and a combination of a strong operating performance at Value Retail and equity accounting for that investment for a full year.
Higher financing costs partly offset these increases.

Calculations for earnings per share are set out in note 11A to the accounts on page 132.
NET RENTAL INCOME An analysis of net rental income is set out on page 40.
In 2013, the portfolio as a whole generated net rental income of 290.2 million, to which continuing operations contributed 282.8 million compared with 258.8 million in the prior year.
Growth of 2.1% in income from the like-for-like portfolio and the impact from acquisitions more than offset the income lost from disposals.
46 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2013 ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES Administration expenses are analysed in the following table.

Administration expenses for discontinued operations represent the costs of staff made redundant as a result of the sale of the office portfolio, and fees receivable relate to the joint ventures for 125 Old Broad Street and 10 Gresham Street.
COST RATIO The table below follows the guidance published by EPRA in respect of a standard cost ratio, calculated as total operating costs as a percentage of gross rental income.
The ratio is not necessarily comparable between different companies as business models and expense accounting and classification practices vary.
Hammersons ratio for continuing operations, including the cost of vacancy, has dropped by 240 bp from 27.0% in 2012 to 24.6% in 2013, principally reflecting increased management fees and additional rental income.
As refurbishments, extensions and completed developments come on stream, we expect the ratio to decline further over time.

Our business model for developments is to use a combination of in-house staff and external advisers.
The cost of external advisers is capitalised to the cost of developments.
The cost of staff working on developments is generally expensed, but may be capitalised subject to meeting certain criteria related to the degree of time spent on and the stage of progress of specific projects.
com 47 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED We are taking measures to improve efficiency and to increase resources deployed to our development pipeline and digital marketing.
Gross savings of 6 million per annum are targeted, derived from: consolidating senior positions in London and Paris: relocating our London head office to more cost effective premises and transferring some roles to a larger operations centre in Reading: lowering share benefits: reviewing pension benefits: and integrating activities between London and Paris.
The savings will be invested to boost our development capabilities and enhance our digital services to retailers and shoppers, both of which are sources of growth for our business.
This rebalancing of our cost base will result in a 5 million implementation charge in 2014.
SHARE OF RESULTS AND NET ASSETS OF ASSOCIATE VALUE RETAIL VR Since August 2012 we have equity accounted for the Groups investment in VR.
Prior to that date, our interests were treated as investments and distributions received were recognised as income.
VRs contribution to the Groups income statement and balance sheet is set out in the table below.
EPRA net income from our investment in 2013 was 19.0 million, or 2.7 pence per share, compared with 12.6 million, or 1.8 pence per share, in 2012.
Including the Groups loan to VR, our net interest at the end of 2013 was valued at 633.8 million on an EPRA basis, equivalent to 89.0 pence per share.
The changes reflect the revised accounting basis as well as the acquisition of additional interests in VR over the last 18 months.
Excluding our share of VRs income for the period, this investment contributed 82 million, or 11 pence per share, to the increase in the Groups EPRA net asset value in 2013, principally through property valuation increases.
The operating performance of VR is described on page 37 of the Business review.

We remain alert to the capital markets for further opportunities for savings.
Underlying finance costs, comprising gross interest costs less finance income as shown in note 7 to the accounts, were 103.6 million compared with 96.3 million in 2012.
Interest capitalised during the year was 13.1 million and related principally to the development of Les Terrasses du Port.
The finance costs for discontinued activities shown in note 9B are in respect of the Groups share of the secured debt and related derivatives of the 125 Old Broad Street joint venture, for which the sale was completed in June 2013.
No finance charges have been allocated to discontinued operations as the other office properties which had been held for sale were financed from the Groups pooled unsecured borrowings.
TAX The Group is a UK REIT and French SIIC for tax purposes.
48 Hammerson plc Annual Report 2013 DIVIDEND The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 10.8 pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 8.3 pence, the total for 2013 is 19.1 pence, representing an increase of 7.9% on the prior year.
The final dividend is payable on 25 April 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 14 March and 3.6 pence will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the balance of 7.2 pence paid as a normal dividend.
As has been the case in recent years, there will be no scrip alternative although the dividend reinvestment plan continues to be available to shareholders.
BALANCE SHEET Equity shareholders funds were 4.1 billion at 31 December 2013, having increased by 209 million during the year.
Net assets, calculated on an EPRA basis, increased by 223 million during 2013 and the movement over the year is shown in the table below.
There was a corresponding 5.7% rise in EPRA net asset value per share to 5.73 at 31 December 2013.
The valuation surplus on the investment property portfolio was augmented by the gains from our Value Retail investment, developments and retained earnings.

FINANCING AND CASHFLOW At 31 December 2013, net debt was 2.3 billion and comprised borrowings of 2.3 billion and cash and deposits of 57 million.
Over the year net debt increased by 216 million, principally a reflection that development expenditure, dividends and the impact of exchange exceeded the net proceeds from investment activity, retained earnings and distributions from Value Retail.
Cash and deposits closed approximately 10 million lower on the year following a 129 million cash inflow from operating activities, capital expenditure of 202 million, net outflows from investment activity of 11 million, 45 million of distributions received from Value Retail and a 28 million net inflow from financing activities.
Liquidity, comprising cash and undrawn committed facilities, was 716 million at the end of 2013.
Our policy for interest rate hedging is to fix the rate of at least 50% of debt, although we may increase this at higher gearing levels.
At 31 December 2013 70% of debt was fixed, compared with 80% at the beginning of the year.
Increased exposure to floating rate debt enables us to benefit from the continuing low interest rate environment whilst maintaining the security offered by fixed rates of interest on the majority of debt.
Recent market pricing indicates that interest rates may increase in the medium to long term and our fixed floating profile will partly mitigate that risk.
Furthermore, debt that will be drawn in respect of the private placement noted below will be at rates that have already been fixed, reducing the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Exposure to exchange translation differences on euro denominated assets is managed through a combination of euro borrowings and derivatives, and at the end of 2013, 79% of the value of euro denominated assets was hedged, consistent with our policy.
Interest on euro debt also acts as a hedge against exchange differences arising on rental income from our French business and during the year, all of the relevant income was hedged in this way.
The maturity profile of the Groups borrowings is shown in the chart overleaf.
At 31 December 2013, the average maturity of the Groups debt was more than five years.
We monitor the capital markets with a view to managing short-term maturities.
In May we completed a tender offer for 28 million of the Groups 300 million 5.25% unsecured bonds due in 2016.
The premium and costs paid on the repurchased bonds resulted in an exceptional charge of 3.9 million.
The interest cost of the bond was 5.25% and the debt was refinanced at an incremental finance cost of 1.4%, so we secured a lower running cost of debt.
We expect this to result in a saving of approximately 1.0 million per annum.

In addition, an existing 125 million facility maturing in 2017 was increased to 150 million in April.
In November we signed an agreement with nine US institutions for the placement of $443 million fixed rate notes, which will fund in two tranches in 2014.
These notes mature in seven, 10 and 12 years and are denominated in US Dollar, British Pound Sterling and Euro, with the US Dollar portion swapped to fixed Euro.
The resultant weighted average coupon is fixed at 3.6%, with a weighted average maturity of nine years.
The attractiveness of this transaction was enhanced by the ability of the US investors to defer closing, enabling Hammerson to maximise the benefit from low floating rates on its banking facilities.
By final drawdown in June 2014, the placement will repay existing floating rate debt and increase the proportion of the Groups fixed rate debt by approximately 12% and extend the weighted average debt maturity by approximately 0.4 years.
We believe that the sterling and euro bond markets will be available in the medium term to replace existing bank borrowings and bonds as they mature.
We will access these markets as appropriate.
The Board approves financing guidelines against which it monitors the Groups financial structure.
These guidelines, together with the relevant metrics, are summarised in the table below which illustrates the Groups robust financial condition as at the end of 2013.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities, and the recently issued Private Placement loan notes, contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing, defined as the ratio of net debt to shareholders equity, should not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income divided by net interest payable, should not be less than 1.25 times.
The same gearing covenant applies to three of the Companys unsecured bonds, whilst the remaining bonds contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175%.
The bonds have no covenant for interest cover.
Hammersons financial ratios are comfortably within these covenants.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 55 to 59 provide further context for financing risk.
Fitch and Moodys rate Hammersons unsecured credit as Aand Baa2 respectively.
