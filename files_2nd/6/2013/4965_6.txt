Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 30 Annual report and accounts 2013 Operational and financial performance Simplifying the numbers There are two core elements to our gross profit: the dark green spread and the bark spread.
Fuel Our cost of sales comprises fuel costs in respect of generation, grid charges, other retail costsandcost of power purchases, the largest element being fuel costs.
Fuel costs in respect of generation rose from 929 million in 2012 to 946 million in 2013.
This figureincludes the cost of coal and sustainable biomass burnt net of the value of renewable support and carbon allowances purchased.
The power stations output for the year drives the requirement for the volume of fuel, although thefuelmixalso influences total fuel costs.
source In 2013 we entered Phase III of the EU ETS with no free carbon emissions allowances fromthe startofthe year, compared to the 9.5 million tonnes of free allowances received in 2012.
This increased the cost of carbon by 58 million in 2013.
In addition, from April 2013 the CPSmechanism came into effect, creating a levy on our coal purchases, and adding 62 milliontofuel costs in 2013.
In total carbon costs increased by 120 million asaresult of thesetwofactors in 2013.
This was offset to a limited extent by increased biomass burn which reducedourcarbon emissions allowances requirement.
Volume In 2013 our net sales were 26.2TWh compared to a record 27.1TWh in 2012.
Generation volumes aredriven by plant availability and commodity market conditions.
Generation increases when availability is high and commodity prices make it profitable for us to generate.
Operational performance remained strong in 2013.
However with the planned double outage andtheconversion of our first unit to run on biomass, the load factor for the plant as a whole generate waslower at 80% compared to 82% last year.
Dark green and bark spreads remained strong in2013asdescribed on page 33.
Income Our revenue is comprised of power sales, ROC and LEC sales, ancillary services income and otherincome, the largest element being power sales, followed by ROC and LEC sales.
We sell power into the wholesale market and through our retail arm, Haven Power, to business customers in the Industrial and Commercial and Small and Medium Enterprise markets.
The revenueachieved is influenced by market prices, the timing of securing the sales and powerstation output.
supply ROC and LEC sales represent an increasing element of our total revenue as we expand our outputfrom biomass generation.
This revenue stream is influenced by the number of ROCs wegenerate, the price we can achieve for ROCs in the market and the timing of the sales.
Haven Power, whilst a low margin business, offers a route to market for the ROC and LEC outputofour generation business.

Upon salethe value of the ROCs and LECs is recognised in revenue and reversed from costofsales.
Operational performance Whilst the market spreads available, in comparison to our short run marginal cost of producing, determine whether it is optimaltogenerate, the operational performance of the power station determines whether we are able to generate and benefitfrom good market spreads.
Our availability metrics show the amount of time we are able to generate if required.
This is influenced by both planned and forced outage rates.
We assess the optimal time to undertake planned outages, based on expected market spreads available.
In comparison, forced outage rates are driven by the maintenance needs of the plant, for example, leaks in boiler tubes requiring repair.
We have a long-term target of 5% for our forced outage rate, set based on extensive benchmarking of industry-leading standards.
Our operational statistics continue to demonstrate our leadership position in the coal-fired generation sector.

ROC and LEC income Upon sale to a counterparty, ROC and LEC revenue is recognised, moving the value from cost of sales to revenue.
Sales have historically been made following the end of a compliance period, causing a peak in revenue, ROC and LEC cost of sales, and cash in the third quarter of a year.
Tomorrow as we move towards becoming a predominantly biomass-fired generationbusiness, the cost of sustainable biomass, the value of renewable supportand therefore the bark spread will increasingly drive our profitability.

For our coal generation 65 capacity the margins available are reflected in the dark green spread, the difference between the price of power we sell and the cost of the coal and carbon we purchase.
60 For our newly converted biomass unit, the margins available are reflected in the bark 55 spread, the difference between the price of power we sell plus renewable support and the cost of the biomass we purchase.
50 The trends in commodity prices witnessed in the last few years are described in the 45 following paragraphs and illustrated in the accompanying charts.
40 Power and gas Following a period of volatility in 2011 and early 2012, power prices have remained relatively stable over the 18 months to 31 December 2013.
The gas market continues to drive power prices.
Forward coal prices $ tonne C alendar year 2012 Calendar year 2014 The impact of the Fukushima disaster and limited Japanese nuclear generation Calendar year 2013 Calendar year 2015 continued to provide support to the global liquefied natural gas LNG market throughout 2013.
UK gas prices remained strong and stable through 2013 with prices 160 being pulled upwards towards oil indexed European prices and international LNG prices in order to attract imports.
140 European and UK gas prices remain at a premium to US prices, where advances in 120 technology are leading to a large supply of low priced shale gas, adding to already significant reserves.
However, shale gas developments outside the US are in their infancy and will in all probability, therefore, have little impact in the short to medium 100 term.
Furthermore, demand for gas is rising rapidly so that even with the possibility ofincreased shale gas production, global markets may well remain strong.
80 Coal Market prices for international coal have fallen steadily from a peak in mid-2011.
Whilst global demand has grown through 2013, the low US gas prices described above forced increases in US coal exports.
Combined with rising supplies from Forward carbon prices tonne Indonesia and Australia, this has resulted in a weak global short-term market December 2011 December 2013 characterised by low international prices and high stocks in Europe.
With high stock December 2012 December 2014 levels also being held in China, any increase in Asian demand has been insufficient 25 toabsorb the excess supply.
These market dynamics, as well as increasing operating costs, have continued to 20 putpressure on UK domestic coal producers.
15 Carbon Following the dramatic fall in market prices for EU ETS carbon allowances in the 10 second half of 2011, amid fears for the Eurozone economies, the downward trend continued through 2012 and 2013.
5 The combination of slow economic growth and any Phase II surplus bankable into Phase III, drove carbon prices to new lows during 2013 before they recovered slightly towards the end of the year.
With an over-supplied market, the main price driver is political intervention and the back-loading debate postponing the sales of emissions allowances to restrict current supplies.
Although the back-loading proposals are not finalised the likelihood of implementation has increased with the EU providing the required authorisation for the European Commission.
However, the timing and the profile of the volumes to be removed still remains uncertain.

Movements in these exchange rates have driven the changes in biomass costs during the period.
At the start of 2013 we saw a weak US dollar, relative to sterling, driving market biomass prices down.
The dollar recovered mid-way through the year, but weakened again towards the end of the year, as can be seen in the chart on page39.
As explained in Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts below, the extensive foreign currency hedging programme we are putting in place provides us with some protection from these fluctuations in exchange rates.
However, as a result this will inevitably drive some volatility through the unrealised gains and losses line inour income statement a non-cash item, excluded from underlying earnings.
Dark green spread and bark spread As a result of the relatively stable power prices and low coal and carbon prices, we have seen attractive dark green spreads during 2013.
However, the introduction of both full auctioning of EU emissions allowances from the start of the year and the CPSmechanism from April has increased costs for coal-fired generators.
Having fallen during the year, market bark spreads rose at the year end to levels similar to those at the start of the year.
The movements have principally been driven by currency effects described above.
Looking forward, the UK governments CPS mechanism, whilst strengthening the case for biomass generation, is likely to erode the competitive position of coal-fired plant.
Our biomass transformation project means the bark spread will become an increasingly important element of our gross margin.

The generation gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 430 million, compared to 496 million in 2012.
Whilst the dark green spreads, which currently account for the majority of our gross profit, remained strong the impact of additional carbon costs meant that profits for 2013 were lower.
The introduction of the UK CPS mechanism from April 2013 adds a levy to our coal purchases and increases the cost of the coal we burn.
In addition, from 2013 we entered Phase III of the EU ETS with the removal of free CO emissions allowances, compared 2 to the 9.5 million tonnes of free CO allowances received in 2012 under Phase II.
2 The combined cost of these measures added 120 million to our fuel costs in 2013.
The rising cost of carbon will continue to erode the profit margins of coal generating plant.
This very much supports the economic case for the strategy we have developed to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled power generator.
Revenue Total generation revenue for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 1,780 million, compared to 1,630 million in 2012.
Excluding 334 million of power purchased in the market 2012: 138 million, our generation revenue of 1,335 million was lower than the equivalent comparative for 2012 1,389 million.
This decrease reflects the reduction in net power sold electrical output, at an average achieved electricity price 51.0 per MWh broadly in line with last year 51.3per MWh.
The output in 2012 represented a record level for the plant as a result of the combination of high availability and good margins available in the market.
Generation revenue also includes sales of Renewables Obligation Certificates ROCs and Levy Exempt Certificates LECs, totalling 63 million in both 2013 ROC and LEC assets and 2012. on the balance sheet 2013 2012 We recognise the value of the ROCs and LECs earned as generated, reducing m m fuel costs in respect of generation.
The recognition of a sale is matched by a As at 1 January 18.7 32.1 corresponding cost of sale.
The ROCs and LECs, earned through generating ROCs and LECs generated 143.9 32.0 electricity from burning biomass, are held on our balance sheet until sold.
ROCs and LECs purchased 37.6 11.4 The timing of ROC sales is largely driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation ROCs and LECs sold utilised 60.7 56.8 RO deadlines and commercial considerations.
Consequently, the majority of the As at 31 December 139.5 18.7 ROCs generated in 2013 will be sold in 2014.
Drax Group plc 35 Annual report and accounts 2013 In April 2013, we converted our first unit to run fully on biomass under the ROC regime.
As a result of the increased biomass burn and as demonstrated by the table at the foot of the opposite page, we have generated considerably more ROCs and LECs during the year ended 31 December 2013, than during 2012.
Total generation revenue includes sales fulfilled by purchasing power in the market.
We purchase power when the cost of power in the market is below our marginal cost of production in respect of power previously contracted for generation and delivery by us, and to cover any shortfall in generation during outages.
The cost of these purchases is included in cost of sales.
Whilst net power sold at 26.2TWh in 2013 reflects a reduction from 27.1TWh in 2012, this gross up for power purchased in the market resulted in the overall increase in total generation revenue.
Cost of sales As explained on pages 30 to 31, our fuel costs are driven by a combination of market Fuel burn composition heat % prices at the time of securing the fuel and the mix of different fuels burnt during the period.
In addition, as noted above UK and EU legislation CPS mechanism and Advantaged fuels: Phase III of the EU ETS to incentivise renewable energy has increased the cost of 3% burning coal.
Biomass: 12% Our average cost of fuel excluding CO emissions allowances for the year ended 2 31 December 2013 was 27.9 per MWh, compared to 30.6 per MWh in 2012.
As the largest component of our fuel burnt, coal prices still drive the average fuel cost, with a falling international market price contributing to the decrease in the year.
Biomass accounted for 12% of our total fuel burnt by heat content in 2013 2012: 5%, the increase reflecting the conversion of our first unit fuelled by biomass from April 2013.
As we progress our transformation, biomass costs will account for a greater Coal: 85% proportion of the fuel costs in respect of generation.
Within costs of sales, net biomass costs are made up of the cost of the fuel delivered to site less the value of renewable support received.
The cost of the fuel includes 2013 2012 Change raw material and delivery costs.
The renewable support reflects the value assigned Coal 85% 90% 5% to ROCs and LECs earned through generating electricity from burning biomass.
Biomass 12% 2% 10% The value of the renewable support therefore reduces the net biomass cost.
Biomass R&D 0% 3% 3% As described in Revenue above, upon sale of the ROCs and LECs the income is Advantaged fuels 3% 5% 2% recognised in revenue and the value of the ROC or LEC previously held in the balance sheet is recorded separately in cost of sales.

For Phase III of the EU ETS 2013 2020 we have no free 31 31 carbon allowances 2012: 9.5 million tonnes and are therefore required to meet December December 2013 2012 the full cost of CO tonnes emitted from coal generation through purchases of 2 Coal 8.5 9.6 allowances in the market.

Our safety performance in the UK continues to be industry-leading.
However, performance at our US construction sites is not yet meeting Drax standards.
As described in the Chief Executives statement we have taken action to bring US performance up to ourUK standards.
Outage and plant utilisation levels Biomass Our first unit was converted to biomass in April using, on a temporary basis, the storage and distribution systems originally built for biomass co-firing.
Through the final quarter we began commissioning our new on-site biomass receipt, storage and distribution systems, with those systems required to support our first converted unit being completed towards the end of the year.
Planned outages, mainly in the first half of the year, for scheduled inspections and to allow for planned upgrades to the rail loop, resulted in a planned outage rate of 5.4% for our biomass unit.
The forced outage rate for the period of 6.8% largely reflects expected issues for a newly converted unit, and we have seen a steady improvement through the period as we gained more experience.
Availability for the biomass plant for the period was therefore 88%.
2.9TWh The load factor for our biomass unit was initially constrained by the use of temporary generated from our first convertedbiomass unit systems, which resulted in expected reliability issues with fuel delivery.
Many of these issues were overcome through the introduction of the new facilities towards the end of the year.
As a result the load factor for the period was 75%.
Coal We have continued to deliver good operating performance from our coal units.
The planned outage rate for our coal plant for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 10%, compared to 9.6% in 2012, reflecting the two unit outages undertaken in both years.
Our maintenance regime includes a major planned outage for each of our six units once every four years.
Consequently, there is an irregular pattern to planned outages and associated expenditure, since in two of the four years two units will eachundergo a major planned outage.
One unit will undergo a major outage in 2014.
80% The forced outage rate for our coal plant of 6.8% for the year ended 31 December Load factor for the coal plant 2013 2012: 4.8% was higher than our long-term target of 5%.
We have continued to 2012: 82% test a wide variety of advantaged fuels, for example coals with lower cost than the standard bituminous coal that we burn.
In the first half of the year, some of these fuels have resulted in a higher number of plant integrity issues than we typically experience.
However, the testing work is an important component of our drive to optimise value from our fuel mix, as well as the work to define our solution for compliance with the Industrial Emissions Directive see Chief Executives statement.
Coal plant availability for the year ended 31 December 2013 was therefore84%.
Although slightly lower than availability of 86% for 2012, this continues to demonstrate a leadership position amongst coal-fired plant.
With strong plant despatch economics, the resulting load factor of 80% compares favourably with the average for other UK coal and gas plants.
The load factor of 80% for the plant as a whole for the year ended 31 December 2013 was down by 2% on 2012, reflecting a decrease in electrical output net sales to26.2TWh in 2013, compared with the record output of 27.1TWh in 2012.

Haven Power should utilise all the ROCs generated from our current converted unit Peter Bennell and a substantial proportion of the LECs from the planned unit conversions.
Chief Executive, Haven Power Gross margin As Haven Power continues to deliver good volume growth, movements in the financial metrics are largely driven by volumes.
In the year ended 31 December 2013, sales volumes rose 59% from 5.1TWh in 2012, to 8.1TWh.
This drove an increase inrevenue from 451 million in 2012, to 751 million in 2013.
The majority of the growth at Haven Power has come from the more competitive I&C market which has a lower gross margin than the SME market.
In addition, rising grid charges and other retail costs of sales including Feed-in Tariff costs, driven up by increasing amounts of intermittent renewable generation, combined to drive a gross profit of 16 million, upmarginally on 15 million in 2012.

190 Group EBITDA The Group EBITDA is primarily driven by the factors influencing the gross margin.
The fall in EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2013 to 230 million, from 298 million in 2012, is therefore a result of the increasing costs of carbon following the removal of free carbon allowances under Phase III of the EU ETS and the introduction of the CPS mechanism during 2013.
Whilst these additional costs and the governments trajectory for increasing CPS over time, erode the profitability of our coal-fired generation plant, theystrengthen the case for biomass generation.
We are making a significant investment in our biomass transformation: however our financial performance mustbe viewed in this context until our biomass operations reach an appropriate scale.
Depreciation 230m Group EBITDA 2012: 298 million Depreciation was 65 million for the year ended 31 December 2013, compared to59 million in 2013.
As we continue to invest in our biomass transformation, ourdepreciation charge will increase as new investment comes on stream over thecoming years.
2012 costs CESP Investment in growth Underlying costs 2013 costs Drax Group plc 39 Annual report and accounts 2013 Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts The Group enters into forward contracts for the sale of power and the purchase of coal, biomass and carbon emissions allowances which are the elements which make up the gross profit of the business as described on pages 30 to 31.
In addition, where contracts for the purchase of fuel or carbon allowances are denominated in a foreign currency, the Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts.
These contracts aim to fide-risk the business, providing secure cash flows into the future.
The accounting for these contracts at rising volumes increases volatility in theunrealised gains and losses line in the income statement.
Where possible, we take the own use exemption for contracts entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward domestic coal and biomass contracts and therefore we do not reflect their value in our accounts until the contracts close out unlike derivatives which we mark-to-market.
Forward contracts which meet the definition of derivatives under IFRS and do not qualify for the own use exemption, are included in our accounts at their fair value at the balance sheet date, derived largely by reference to market prices at that date.
Unrealised gains and losses arise on the movements in the fair value of these contracts between balance sheet dates.
Where the derivative contracts meet the definition of an effective hedge under IFRS, the movement in their fair value is recognised through the hedge reserve, acomponent of shareholders equity in the balance sheet.
This is largely the case for our forward power and carbon contracts, as well as some of our forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where they do not meet the definition of an effective hedge from an accounting perspective, even though they represent an economic hedge, the movement in Currency spot rates their fair value is reflected in the income statement as an unrealised gain or loss on USD:GBP EUR:GBP derivative contracts.
This encompasses some of our forward foreign exchange and CAD:GBP financial coal contracts.
1.8 Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised through the income statement were 110 million in the year ended 31 December 2013 compared to 36 million in 2012.
In both years the figure was largely driven by movements in the fair value of 1.6 ourforward foreign exchange contracts.
These contracts reflect an extensive hedging programme to support our biomass 1.4 procurement activities.
The programme covers all contracted and a substantial proportion of as yet un-contracted but forecast purchases and provides a significant degree of protection from adverse currency movements.
1.2 A weakening US dollar at both year ends resulted in unrealised losses on these contracts, as market rates were preferential in comparison to contracted rates.
The volumes of these contracts have increased significantly during the year as we look to fide-risk the business by securing our cash flows in sterling.
In considering mark-to-market movements, it is important to recognise that profitability is driven by our strategy to deliver market level dark green or bark spreads, not by the absolute price of any single commodity at any given date.
We therefore look to underlying profit excluding unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts as our performance indicator.
For more information on our derivative contracts see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
Interest Net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2013 were 23 million compared to 14 million in 2012, the increase predominantly arising from the interest paid on borrowings, as we drew down 100 million in December 2012 and a further 125 million in April 2013.

The reduction is driven by the 22 million impact of a 3% reduction in corporation tax rates 2012: 15 million from a 2% reduction.
In addition, the 2013 tax charge includes the impact of research and development claims, now agreed with HMRC, resulting in a credit of 7 million in respect of prior years.
2012 includes the impact of a revision to previous years capital allowances claims agreed with HMRC, resulting in a tax credit of 8 million recognised in the comparative period.
142m Underlying profit after tax The underlying effective rate of tax excluding the after tax impact of unrealised 2012: 193 million gains and losses on derivative contracts is 0% in 2013, compared to 15% in 2012, the difference arising predominantly from the impact of the corporation tax rate changes as described above.
In 2014 we expect underlying rates to more closely align with UK corporation tax rates.
The tax paid during the year was 18 million 2012: 54 million, principally reflecting lower profitability and tax rates in 2013 as described in Liquidity and capital resources.
These payments were offset by tax refunds in respect of prior year credits noted above, bringing net taxes paid for 2013 to 11 million 2012: 51 million.
Profit after tax and earnings per share Profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 51 million, compared to 164 million in 2012, driving basic earnings per share of 13 pence in 2013, compared to44 pence in 2012.
We measure underlying earnings per share excluding the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses as this strips out the volatility on our derivative contracts non-cash items which do not meet hedge effectiveness criteria under IFRS as described above.
With underlying profit after tax of 142 million in 2013 2012: 193 million, underlying earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2013 was 35 pence per share, compared to 52 pence in 2012.
The reduction in underlying earnings per share in 2013 principally reflects the impact of additional costs of carbon on our profitability as outlined above.

Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 42 Annual report and accounts 2013 Operational and financial performance Financing and cash flow management In April 2013, we agreed a new 75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme.
This replaced 50 million of the 100 million amortising term loan facility agreed with the Green Investment Bank, signed in December 2012.
The new loan facility enhances the existing financing structure executed last year by providing additional liquidity to the Group and ensuring a smoother profile of debt maturities.
Furthermore, the all-in cost of the new facility is very competitive.
The financing structure also incorporates the remaining 50 million amortising term loan from the Green Investment Bank, a 100 million amortising term loan facility with the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and a 400 million working capital and letter of credit facility.
The term loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from four to eight years, whilst the working capital and letter of credit facility is due to mature in April 2016.
In addition, a commodity trading facility also executed in December 2012, allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades dark green spreads at attractive prices without the requirement to post collateral.
This facility has been operating well, offering trading counterparties access to the security package available to our senior lenders.
Combined with other steps taken over the past three years to limit ourrequirements to post collateral, this is allowing the Group to operate comfortably with a sub-investment grade business model.
Finally, towards the end of 2013 we completed our first ROC monetisation facility.
As described above, cash for ROC sales can often flow back to renewable generators some time after the associated power was produced.
This can result in significant working capital absorption, with ROC income often received more than 12 months after we have paid for the related biomass.
We have agreed an 80 million facility with Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Limited, which allows Drax to sell ROC receivables.
Capital expenditure Fixed asset additions were 286 million in the year ended 31 December 2013, compared to 224 million in 2012.
This includes 228 million on our biomass transformation project 2012: 180 million.
At the Drax Power Station site we completed the commissioning of the new receipt, storage and distribution systems for our first converted unit by the end of 2013, andwe expect to have largely completed the on-site investment required to support 286m three converted units by the end of 2014.
These systems will provide us with the Capital expenditure ability to unload rail wagons efficiently, store up to around 300 thousand tonnes 2012: 224 million ofbiomass on-site and deliver it direct to the combustion system.
Our investment in upstream supply chain infrastructure continues, with the construction of our two pellet plants in Mississippi and Louisiana and our port development at Baton Rouge also Louisiana having started in the Summer.
All threeprojects remain on schedule and on budget.
We are targeting the first half of2015 for commercial operations to begin reaching full capacity within six months.
We expect to spend 650700 million in total on progressively converting three generating units to biomass together with the supporting infrastructure and systems required, completing the two US pellet plants and port facility and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive IED.
Extensive research has been undertaken over the past few years to determine the optimal solution for IED compliance.
As described in the Chief Executives statement, alead solution has been identified and initial trials towards this will commence in 2014.
The estimated capital cost is 75 million to 100 million over four years.
In addition, as described in the Chief Executives statement, we have now developed technical solutions to deliver output of 630MW in a biomass unit, with efficiency only 0.5% lower than that of a coal unit.
We estimate that capital investment of approximately 90 million over three years is required to secure these performance improvements.
Beyond this, we are evaluating further investments in the supply chain, including options for additional pelleting facilities in the US and the conversion of a fourth unit to biomass.
Drax Group plc 43 Annual report and accounts 2013 Other information Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future developments, performance and position including principal risks and uncertainties are set out in the Chief Executives statement, this Operational and financial performance review and the Principal risks and uncertainties section which follows.
Our cash flows and borrowing facilities are described above.
In addition, notes 19 to 21 to the consolidated financial statements explain our approach to capital risk management and give details of financial instruments and hedging activities, and exposure to credit, counterparty and liquidity risk.
We have significant headroom in our new banking facilities, a recent history of cash generation, strong covenant compliance, and good visibility in near-term forecasts, due to our progressive hedging strategy.
Our Business Plan, taking account of our capital investment plans and reasonably possible changes in trading performance, demonstrates that we expect to be able to operate within the level of our current banking facilities.
Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing these financial statements.

See page 42 Contingent liability We were obliged under CESP to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain during the period 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.
We entered into an agreement with a third party, pursuant to which the third party was obliged to deliver our CESP obligation for a total cost of 17 million.
The third party failed to comply fully with its obligation under the agreement, leaving a significant shortfall against our CESP obligation.
Having notified the counterparty of our contractual claim for breach of contract we continue to consider legal options available to us.
We entered into further agreements with additional third parties in order to rectify this shortfall so far as practicable.
At this stage it is not possible to predict whether any enforcement action may be imposed.
No additional provisions have been recognised in respect of this matter as we are not able to reliably measure what the financial impact, if any, might be.

Financials Governance Sustainable business review Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc 44 Annual report and accounts 2013 Operational and financial performance Future developments Regulatory developments As set out in the Chief Executives statement, in December we received confirmation from the government that two Drax units are provisionally ranked equal first among the applications for Investment Contracts under the Final Investment Decision Enabling Contracts for Difference CfD.
Looking forward, if awarded, this would result in our units operating under three different regimes: coal, biomass under the RO and biomass under the CfD.
We are participating in the CfD process as it develops through to finalised Investment Contracts, which are expected to take effect from April 2015.
As outlined in the Chief Executives statement, we will modify one of our coal units during 2014 to operate as an enhanced co-firing unit, enabling us to support a full conversion in April 2015.
However, in the interim, the operation of one of our units as enhanced co-firing, receiving 0.9ROC MWh, rather than 1ROC MWh applicable to a converted unit, will have a corresponding impact on the profits achievable in the near-term.
Also in December 2013 Capture Power Limited, the consortium of Drax, Alstom UK Limited and BOC a member of The Linde Group was awarded the Front End Engineering and Design contract, for its planned 426MW oxy-combustion demonstration project located on the Drax Power Station site.
A two-year process now commences with the negotiation of an engineering, procurement and construction contract and a CfD contract, all dependent on successful funding applications and adequate incentives for low carbon technologies from the electricity market reform.
Drax has committed to invest 4 million in the project during this initial phase.
