Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 INFORMA PLC 23 STRATEGIC REPORT Financial Review continued ADJUSTED NET FINANCE COSTS Adjusted net finance costs, which consist principally of interest costs net of interest receivable, decreased by 4.4m from 32.3m to 27.9m.
The Group maintains a balance of fixed and floating rate debt partly through utilising derivative financial instruments.
The year-on-year decrease in finance cost occurs as the last of the higher rate fixed interest swaps that were entered into at the time of the Datamonitor acquisition in 2007 expired during 2012, resulting in a lower average interest rate in 2012 and 2013.
TAXATION Across the Group, tax has been provided on adjusted profits at an adjusted tax rate of 21.5% 2012: 22.8%.
This adjusted tax rate benefits from profits generated in low tax jurisdictions, and is lower than for the previous year due to movements in the mix of profits between jurisdictions and lower tax rates in certain countries including the UK.
During 2013, the Group paid 71.6m 2012: 45.5m of Corporation and similar taxes on profits, including approximately 44.0m 2012: 33.0m of UK Corporation Tax.
Payments in 2013 included 15.0m in regard to matters agreed with HMRC in 2012.
Due to higher than expected availability of losses, and other offsets, the payments in respect of the agreed matters were some 6.0m lower than expected last year.
The impact of the closure and payment of UK tax issues and also the conclusion of various overseas tax audits was assessed during the year and a further 13.7m release of tax provisions was made.
This followed the release of 60.0m in 2012.
Both of these amounts have been reflected as adjusting items in the accounts.
The Group tax charge on statutory Profit Before Tax PBT was 10.9% 2012: 33.1% negative.
The statutory tax rate reported for both 2013 and 2012 was affected by the release from tax provisions noted above and impairment charges which were not deductible for tax purposes.
Our effective tax charge reconciles to cash taxes paid as follows: 2013 2012 m m Tax charge on adjusted PBT per Consolidated Income Statement 66.1 68.1 Deferred taxes 2.0 0.6 Current tax on adjusting items 17.1 16.8 Taxes paid in relation to earlier years less 2013 taxes payable in later periods 16.6 3.2 Withholding and other tax payments 1.5 2.3 Total corporate taxes paid 69.1 49.8 Taxes refunded from German authorities 0.2 5.8 Taxes paid in relation to discontinued operations 2.7 1.5 Net income taxes paid per Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 71.6 45.5 EARNINGS AND DIVIDEND Adjusted diluted EPS of 40.1p 2012: 38.2p is 5% ahead of 2012 and statutory diluted EPS of 17.1p 2012: 15.5p is 10% ahead of 2012.
The Board has proposed a second interim dividend of 12.50p per share 2012: 12.50p per share.
This dividend will be paid on 27 May 2014 to ordinary shareholders registered as of the close of business on 2 May 2014.
This will result in a total dividend for the year of 18.90p per share 2012: 18.50p per share.
Dividend cover has remained consistent at 2.2 times total earnings 2012: 2.2 times on an adjusted earnings basis.
