Group Finance Directors review Reflecting on the 2013 financial results for Barclays, I believe progress has been made and momentum is building around the Transform Programme.
This was the first year of the Programme, which necessitated a substantial investment in future cost reduction and repositioning of our balance sheet and capital base.
Financial review Overview Within the results, there are two areas that I felt were particularly noteworthy.
First, the breadth and diversity of income in the Group, underpinned by our traditional consumer and commercial banking franchises.
Similarly, within the Investment Bank, growth in Equities and Investment Banking income provided an offset to the market-led weakness in certain FICC businesses.
Second, demonstration of strong financial fundamentals across funding and liquidity, capital, credit risk management and margins should stand the bank in good stead for generating sustainable returns going forward.
Income statement review 2013 profits were impacted by 1.2bn of costs to achieve Transform which drove a 32% reduction in adjusted profit before tax to 5.2bn, while statutory profit before tax improved from 0.8bn to 2.9bn due to a significant reduction in the own credit charge.
Adjusted income was down 4% to 28.2bn reflecting reductions in Investment Bank FICC, partially offset by impressive performances in Investment Bank Equities and Investment Banking and growth in UK We have made quick RBB, Barclaycard and Corporate.
progress on leverage, but Impairment charges improved 8% to 3.1bn reflecting lower impairments in the wholesale businesses, with increases in UK RBB and Barclaycard focusing on balance sheet due to business growth and non-recurrence of prior year releases.
optimisation for sustainable Adjusted operating expenses increased 1.3bn to 19.9bn reflecting 1.2bn of costs to achieve Transform, 220m provisions for litigation returns is now the priority and regulatory penalties in Q413 in the Investment Bank, mainly relating to the US residential mortgage-related business and UK bank going forward.
The Groups cost target for 2015 remains at 16.8bn excluding costs to achieve Transform.
I am pleased by the strong results in UK RBB, Barclaycard and Corporate Banking, whilst noting 2013 was a tough year for Investment Bank income.
Moreover, following restructuring and fide-risking activity we completed during the year, Europe RBB, Africa RBB and Wealth and Investment Management now have clear paths to shareholder value creation in the medium term.
Importantly, the resilience of the underlying customer and client franchises across the Group allowed us to maintain dividends of 6.5p per share for full year 2013 despite a 25% increase in the total number of shares following the rights issue.
Balance sheet review In October, I began conducting a detailed balance sheet review, specifically focused on meeting leverage ratio requirements as a priority.
We have made strong and quick progress on this.
Our Prudential Regulation Authority PRA leverage exposure reduced by nearly 200bn from June 2013 which, combined with the 5.8bn rights issue and issuance of 2.1bn of AT1 securities, strengthened our PRA leverage ratio to just under 3%.
Our focus on Risk Weighted Asset RWA management continued throughout the year, resulting in a 7%, or over 30bn, reduction in CRD IV RWAs.
Looking ahead, the balance sheet review will continue but with increased focus on optimising the balance sheet, considering both risk weights and leverage, in order to generate improved returns.

What happened: Outlook: On 20 June 2013 the PRA announced the results of its review of capital As a result of these actions, Barclays is now in a much stronger capital adequacy of major UK banks and building societies.
As part of its position and this has allowed us to increase the dividend payout ratio review, the PRA introduced a 3% Leverage Ratio target to be achieved target from 30% to 40-50%, with a 40% payout ratio expected in 2014 by 30 June 2014.
As at 30 June 2013, Barclays PRA Leverage Ratio was to allow focus on capital accretion.
We remain committed to structurally reducing the cost base of the Actions taken: Group and we have reaffirmed our 16.8bn cost target with a mid-50s In order to achieve the PRAs 3% Leverage Ratio target by June 2014, cost: income ratio for full year 2015.

In the second half of 2013, we increased our PRA Leverage Ratio from 2.2% to just shy of the 3.0% Regulation remains a key variable and, while we have gained clarity in requirement through these actions.
certain areas, there remain a number of outstanding items which we will continue to anticipate as best we can.
In particular, the Transform A significant proportion of the capital gap was reduced through targets will allow us to achieve a fully loaded CRD IV Common Equity completion of a one for four rights issue which raised 5.8bn of capital Tier CET 1 ratio of greater than 10.5% in 2015 with a fully loaded CRD for the Group.

strong support shown by shareholders during what was a challenging period.
2014 will likely be another year of transition, with greater focus on balance sheet optimisation, particularly in the Investment Bank, Through management actions we were also able to reduce the Groups combined with strict cost control in order to generate higher and more CRD IV leverage exposure by nearly 200bn to 1,363bn.
This was sustainable returns in the future.
Ultimately, increasing the Groups RoE achieved through fide-risking the business via actions such as improving will help to reduce the market valuation discount and increase total legal netting agreements on derivatives and reducing low returning Exit shareholder returns.
A highlight of 2013 was Barclays issuance of 2.1bn equivalent of benchmark Euro and US Dollar AT1 securities.
This represented the targeted issuance for the PRA leverage plan, and constitutes a key step in transitioning our capital base towards future regulatory capital requirements.
