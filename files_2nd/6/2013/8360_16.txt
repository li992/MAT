OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTERSERVE ANNUAL REPORT 2013 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW 45 CASE STUDY WEST KOWLOON TERMINUS BUILDING EXPRESS RAIL LINK Currently under construction, the West Kowloon Rail Terminus will be Hong Kongs only hub for the national high speed rail network.
When complete this network will link Hong Kong with Beijing.
The terminus building will reflect the strategic importance of this project, to Hong Kong and to China, in both its scale and scope.
With construction costs estimated at HK$8 billion, the terminus will be capable of handling 99,000 passengers per day and is expected to be the largest terminus of its kind in the world.
While much of the terminus is being built underground, an iconic roof has been designed to give the structure the grandeur it deserves amidst an already dramatic Kowloon skyline.
The unique design of the roof, which incorporates an exposed huge sloping concrete beam and concrete arch, required RMD Kwikforms innovative engineering team to work closely with the contractor teams, providing them with solutions that complement the schedule, as well as the construction problems.
These solutions have included over 45,000 square metres of soffit support and travelling forms to construct over 3 km of overhead concrete ducting.
RMD Kwikform has used much of its product range on the project, providing the contractor with schemes and guidance that maximize productivity, whilst providing superior health and safety performance.
