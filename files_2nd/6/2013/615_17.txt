FINANCIAL REVIEW The Group has delivered excellent cash conversion DAVID EGAN and improved net GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR debt position.
OVERVIEW I am pleased to be reporting on a solid set of results for 2013 despite subdued economic environments and end-markets that proved to be more challenging than expected.
Global economies have shown lower than expected growth and consumer confidence remained subdued during the year.
Despite these challenges, we have either held or grown market share in the majority of our end-markets, maintained price discipline and continued to exert tight cost control.
Whilst adjusted operating profit was behind last year, cash generation was very strong resulting in a significant strengthening of the balance sheet leading to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0x versus 1.3x at the end of 2012.
