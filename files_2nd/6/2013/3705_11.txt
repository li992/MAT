During the year, the liabilities relating to the past service of CPP pensioners were subject to a buy-in arrangement whereby the CPP transferred assets in exchange for an insurance policy.
This has eliminated the Groups exposure to interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with liabilities amounting to 242m.
