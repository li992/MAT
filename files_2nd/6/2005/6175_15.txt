As stated earlier, additional lump sum payments made to the two pension schemes in 2005 accounted for a further 2m.
The cash inflow during the year together with the increased net borrowings of 17.8m was utilised principally for capital expenditure 27.9m, the investment in MLT 4.9m and corporation tax and dividend payments 28.1m.
