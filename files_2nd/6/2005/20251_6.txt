Financial Review The highlights on page 1 refer to the results for the year both on the statutory, UK GAAP, basis and also on an alternative basis which excludes goodwill amortisation and exceptional income and costs.
In our experience, the alternative presentation tends to be favoured by major investors and analysts as this form of presentation more clearly focuses on the Groups profitability.
The following analysis provides a reconciliation of the results on these two bases.
The purpose of providing this analysis is to demonstrate the underlying results of the Groups business, without the effects of nonrecurring exceptional items and non-cash goodwill amortisation and impairment provisions so that readers of the accounts may more clearly consider the trends.

The value of assets under management AUM is a key driver of turnover in the investment management division, as a large element of income is derived from fees calculated as a percentage of client assets.
The property divisions income also depends to an extent on the value of client assets but this is by no means the only factor, as significant elements of income can also arise from development and transaction fees, management services, etc.
Both segments of the business have continued to develop their business during the year: the AUM of the investment management division has grown steadily over the year through new business gains as well as increases in markets and performance.
Furthermore, on 30 September 2005 a further 30.1bn of AUM was added following the acquisition of certain asset management businesses from Deutsche Bank AG, although the acquisition had no impact on the results for the year.
The property division has developed its existing business in the Nordic region as well as opening new offices and developing opportunities in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
AUM of this division increased by 1.6bn over the year.
The movements in assets under management over the year are summarised below: Investment Property asset management management Total bn bn bn At 30 September 2004 18.2 3.9 22.1 Net additions from acquisitions and disposals 30.1 1.1 31.2 Net new business won 2.6 0.5 3.1 Effects of market movements & performance 3.3 3.3 At 30 September 2005 54.2 5.5 59.7 Turnover Total turnover for 2005 increased by 11.4% over 2004 with the split between the Groups two reporting segments as follows: 2005 2004 000 000 Change Investment management 109,782 91,659 19.8% Property management - continuing 46,145 35,678 29.3% Property management - discontinued 12,674 n a Total property management 46,145 48,352 - 4.6% Group total 155,927 140,011 11.4% Turnover in the investment management division, which is earned principally as a percentage of the periodic value of AUM, has benefited from the continued addition of new AUM, summarised above, as well as investment performance of existing assets.
The fall of 4.6% in turnover in the property management division is due to the inclusion in the 2004 figure of 12.7 million of income from the UK and Amsterdam offices which were sold in May 2004.
Excluding this amount, turnover in the property division increased by 29.3% on a like-for-like basis.
Turnover for the Group increased significantly in the second half of the year from 72.9 million in the first six months to 83.0 million in the second half of the year.
This increase results from the continued growth of new business and the improvement in world stock markets.
Administrative expenses In 2005, total administrative expenses were 139.1 million which compares with 218.8 million in 2004.
However, the 2004 figure included exceptional costs of 85.3 million incurred in that year whereas the 2005 figure is stated after releasing 2.6 million of an Aberdeen Asset Management PLC 15 Financial Review continued exceptional provision.
More meaningful comparison can be achieved by looking at operating expenses, which exclude these exceptional items and the non-cash charge for amortisation and impairment of goodwill.
At this level, costs have increased by 7.4% to 122.2 million.
However, adjusting for operating costs of the property business sold in 2004, the increase on a like-for-like basis is 17.5%.
A more detailed analysis is shown in the following table: 2005 2004 000 000 Change Investment management 82,030 73,565 11.5% Property management - continuing 40,169 30,471 31.8 Property management - discontinued 9,747 n a Total property management 40,169 40,218 -0.1% Total administrative expenses 122,199 113,783 7.4% Operating profit loss The total operating profit for the group in 2005 was 17.8 million compared with an operating loss of 77.7 million for 2004.
However, the underlying operating results before exceptional items and goodwill charges shows an operating profit of 34.7 million for 2005 compared with 27.3 million for 2004.
This represents an increase of 27.1% over 2004.
Further analysis of the underlying profit by division shows: 2005 2004 000 000 Change Investment management 28,768 19,210 49.8% Property management continuing 5,976 5,207 14.8% Property management discontinued 2,927 n a Total property management 5,976 8,134 -26.5% Total underlying profit 34,744 27,344 27.1% The change in the operating margin of each division is shown in the table below.

The investment management division incurred costs of 3.6 million on office closure, fund range amalgamation and other projects, while the property division incurred start-up and rationalisation costs of 1.4 million in relation to a corporate acquisition and an intended new fund launch.
Excluding the effects of there non-recurring costs, the core operating margin was 30.0% for the investment management division and 15.9% for the property division Gain on disposal of significant investments In the year to 30 September 2005 a gain of 12.5 million has been recorded on the sale, to Friends Provident plc, of the Groups 15% shareholding in Lombard International Assurance SA, a Luxembourg registered life company.
The original cost of this investment was 1.2 million, although the investment had been revalued since acquisition to 21.1 million.
The gain of 12.5 million, recognised through the profit and loss account, excludes the revaluation amount of 19.9 million which is shown as a transfer between reserves.
The proceeds 16 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC received to date, net of expenses, are 33.6 million.
The Group may receive further consideration for this sale in April 2006 and 2007, dependent on Lombard achieving or exceeding certain performance targets for both new business profits and growth in embedded value for its two financial years to 31 December 2006.
The further consideration will be paid in cash or Friends Provident ordinary shares, at Friends Providents option.
In aggregate the gross consideration receivable by the Group is capped at approximately 50.7 million.
The table below sets out the gain based on the range of potential proceeds.
Consideration Maximum received to date consideration 000 000 Proceeds 34,115 50,700 Original cost 1,163 1,163 Expenses of sale 567 567 32,385 48,970 The total gain can be analysed as follows: Amount taken to revaluation reserve in previous years 19,901 19,901 Gain reported in 2005 12,484 12,484 Gain to be reported in future years as proceeds are received 16,585 Gain on disposal 32,385 48,970 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries The loss on disposal of subsidiaries of 3.6 million in the year to 30 September 2005 represents the loss incurred on disposal of the Groups life assurance subsidiaries, Aberdeen International IoM Life Assurance Limited and Aberdeen International Limited, less deferred consideration of 2.8 million received in respect of the sale in 2004 of the UK and Amsterdam property subsidiaries.
There is the potential for further proceeds of up to 4 million to be received in respect of the disposal of the property subsidiaries, but no account has been taken of any such proceeds as they are dependent on the future performance of those companies.
Goodwill amortisation and impairment provisions In the year to 30 September 2005 goodwill amortisation costs were 19.5 million which is a slight increase from a cost of 19.1 million in 2004.
This increase is due mainly to a full years charge for goodwill arising on the purchase of Edinburgh Fund Managers 2004 - 11 months charge and additions to goodwill in Thailand and in the property division.
Net interest payable and similar charges For the year to 30 September 2005 ongoing interest and similar charges totalled 10.2 million.
This represents a17.1% reduction compared to the cost of 12.3 million for 2004.
The composition of the interest cost in 2005 is quite different from 2004 and the ongoing interest cost for the group is reduced significantly following the changes to the Groups debt structure over the year as described in the net borrowings section below.
Non-recurring costs of 1.67 million arose on the redemption of 75 million of the Groups 2007 convertible bonds and a non-cash charge of 3 million is recorded in the UK GAAP figures to reflect the unwinding of an element of discount on a provision made in 2004.
Taxation The tax charge for the Group for the year to 30 September 2005 was 6.3 million and was made up as follows: m Tax charge on underlying profit for the year 8.0 Tax credit on exceptional items 0.5 Adjustment in respect of previous years 1.2 6.3 The effective rate of tax for the Group in 2005 is 26.4% calculated by dividing the tax charge by the profit before tax, as shown in the underlying profit column in the table on page 14.
Over the year tax losses arose within the UK business and profits were generated mainly by the Groups overseas operations on which tax is charged at rates shown below the standard UK rate of 30% Aberdeen Asset Management PLC 17 Financial Review continued Earnings per share In 2005 basic and diluted earnings per share, excluding the effects of goodwill amortisation, impairment provisions and exceptional items were 4.79p and 4.77p respectively compared with 3.01p for both measures in 2004, these figures having been restated to take account of the effects of the rights issue.
On the mandatory FRS 14 basis, basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were 1.44p and 1.43p respectively compared with a loss of 22.46p on both measures in 2004 after restatement for the rights issue.
The restatement of these figures as a result of the rights issue completed on 23 September 2005 is based on the theoretical ex-rights price of an ordinary share, calculated at close of business on 31 August 2005, being the last trading day before the shares were quoted ex-rights.
Net funds At 30 September 2005, following the rights issue on 23 September 2005 and the acquisition of Deutsche Asset Management on 30 September 2005, the Group had net funds of 45.1 million.
This compares with a net debt figure of 169.3 million at 30 September 2004.
Prior to the above transactions, there were a number of changes to the Groups funding arrangements which reduced debt levels and reduced the effective interest rate.
In November 2004 the Company entered into new term loan and working capital facility agreements with Bank of Scotland.
Bank term loans, amounts outstanding under the existing working capital facility and the US $27.5 million Convertible Subordinated Loan Notes were replaced by a new 85.1 million term loan.
The repayment profile of this term loan was closely matched to the expected pattern of receipts from disposals of non-core assets.
In March 2005 the Company issued 26.6 million 4.5% Convertible bonds 2010.
The proceeds of this issue were used to repay bank borrowings.
In June 2005 the Company issued 80 million 6.75% Convertible Preference Share Units by way of a Placing and Open Offer.
The net proceeds from this issue were used to repurchase 75 million Convertible bonds 2007 and in doing so replaced debt with permanent capital.
At the same time, the bank loans were redesignated as a 65.1 million revolving credit facility, available until December 2006.
In October 2005, this revolving credit facility was extended to July 2007 and a further 44 million revolving credit facility, maturing July 2008, was agreed.
At the year end no amounts were drawn down under this facility.
2005 2004 m m Convertible bonds 2010 25.7 Convertible bonds 2007 24.7 98.3 Bank term loans 30.1 Drawn on bank overdrafts 41.4 Convertible subordinated loan notes 15.2 Guaranteed loan notes 1.5 2.0 51.9 187.0 Cash balances 97.0 17.7 Net cash borrowings 45.1 169.3 As a result of these changes the Groups average cost of debt has reduced from approximately 6.0% to approximately 5.2% per annum.
Pension funding The main pension scheme operated by the Group is a money purchase scheme which provides certainty of the funding cost.
The Group also has three legacy defined benefit pension schemes, all of which are closed to new membership and to future service accrual.
The Group has adopted the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17 and the disclosures are shown in note 29 to the accounts.
The aggregate actuarial deficit of the three defined benefit schemes has increased by 11% as shown in the table below: CGA MJ EFM Scheme Scheme Scheme Total 000 000 000 000 Deficit after taxation at 30 September 2004 441 13,750 4,830 19,021 Add back: deferred tax asset 189 5,893 2,070 8,152 Deficit before taxation at 30 September 2004 630 19,643 6,900 27,173 Contributions during the year 150 2,100 2,258 4,508 Other movements in assets 252 3,694 6,128 10,074 Movements in liabilities 413 8,097 8,933 17,443 Deficit before taxation at 30 September 2005 641 21,946 7,447 30,034 Less: deferred tax asset 192 6,584 2,234 9,010 Deficit after taxation at 30 September 2005 449 15,362 5,213 21,024 18 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC While FRS 17 requires that pension scheme assets be stated at market value, the liabilities are estimated on the basis of certain actuarial assumptions regarding future economic conditions and mortality experience over a period of several decades.
These disclosures have to be considered in light of the fact that even a small change in assumptions may have a considerable effect on the actuarial valuation of liabilities.
One of the assumptions to which these numbers is most sensitive is the discount rate used to estimate the present value of the future cashflows which comprise the liabilities of the schemes.
FRS 17 requires that a discount rate equivalent to the yield on a AA-rated corporate bond be used.
The appropriate discount rate at 30 September 2005 was 5.1%, compared to 5.7% a year earlier, and this has had a significant effect on the estimated value of the liabilities.
Had the discount rate remained at the 2004 rate of 5.7%, the liabilities of the three schemes would have been approximately 14 million lower, i. e. each 0.1% reduction in the discount rate has increased the aggregate deficit by around 2.4 million before tax 1.7 million after tax.
Whilst logic might suggest that the pattern of reducing bond yields would reverse at some future date, there is a risk that trustees feel pressured into favouring bonds rather than equities in setting asset allocation.
The natural consequence of this, in the absence of any significant increase in the supply of appropriate long dated bonds, is that bond yields will remain at low levels for some considerable time to come thus, perversely, exacerbating the problem of actuarial deficits under FRS 17.
Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise fixed asset and current asset investments, cash, loan notes, bank term loans, convertible bonds, deferred consideration and various items, such as trade debtors, trade creditors, etc that arise out of its operations.
Details of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities are given in note 25 to the accounts.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 13 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments and excluded short term debtors and creditors from the disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures of financial instruments.
The Group has adopted a policy of minimising exposure to exchange risk arising from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The Company repaid its major non-sterling liability which was US $27.5 million Convertible subordinated loan notes on 18 November 2004.
Surplus cash balances are invested in money market deposits and other interest bearing accounts, taking advantage of group offset arrangements, in order to optimise interest income while also retaining flexibility in respect of the Groups expected cash requirements.
Acquisition of Deutsche Asset Management businesses and contracts The first stage of the acquisition of certain UK-based fund management businesses and contracts from Deutsche Bank AG was completed on 30 September 2005.
The second stage of the acquisition, involving the acquisition of the Philadelphia fixed income contracts, was completed on 1 December 2005.
The expected total cost of the acquisition is 263 million and is being paid in cash from the proceeds of the rights issue which was completed on 23 September 2005.
The purchase price of the first stage of the acquisition, which is recognised in the balance sheet at 30 September 2005, amounts to 177 million.
An element of the purchase price in respect of the equities and multi-asset business is deferred and is payable on 31 March 2006.
The amount payable is based on the actual run-rate management fees for this element of the business and the current estimate of the deferred amount payable is 35 million.
However, the actual amount payable remains subject to adjustment until 30 June 2006.
Based on this estimate the goodwill arising on the transaction amounted to 204.4 million.
Other post balance sheet events On 7 October 2005, the Groups 11.3 million investment in preference shares of Century Group was redeemed following the sale of Century Group.
The Groups investment in New Star Asset Management PLC was sold for a consideration, net of expenses, of 14.6 million on 11 November 2005 following the listing of New Stars shares on the Alternative Investment Market.
A gain of 8.6 million arose on this sale.
