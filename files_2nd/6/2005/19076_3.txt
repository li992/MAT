Minerva plc 14 Annual report and accounts 2005 Finance Directors review Review of results The period under review has been one during which the Group has taken action to reposition IVAN itself for the future and, in doing so, has incurred two exceptional charges.
EZEKIEL Firstly, following the administration of Allders in January 2005, we recognised, in full, a writedown of the book value of our investment in Scarlett Retail of approximately 13.9 million.
In addition, we recognised a loss of 8.0 million, being the non-recoverable amount of a 10.0 million loan advanced to Allders.
These were fully reported to shareholders in the Interim Results in March of this year.
404.5 MILLION WAS GENERATED FROM DISPOSALS.
Secondly, against a backdrop of strong demand for well-leased investment properties, we took the opportunity to dispose of selective investments from our property portfolio and, in doing so, reshape the balance sheet for future growth.
By 30 June 2005, properties totalling 404.5 million were sold or subject to binding sale commitments.
In doing so, the Group has incurred an aggregated loss of 28.3 million after deducting disposal expenses and recognising the charges relating to the repayment of loans secured on the properties sold.
The latter is a by-product of the disposals and incorporates fixed rate loan and interest rate swap breakage costs, together with unamortised loan issue costs, relating to the loans repaid, and reflects the low interest rate environment prevailing at the time of the disposals.

Net rental income has reduced during the year by 3.2 per cent to 50.8 million 2004: Administrative expenses for the year increased 52.5 million.
The decrease principally arises from 9.7 million to 16.7 million, almost entirely from the property disposals during the second accounted for by the irrecoverable 8.0 million half of the financial year, offset in part by the element of a 10.0 million loan advanced full-year affect of acquisitions made in the to Allders.
