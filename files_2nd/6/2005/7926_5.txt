IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2005 18 Effective Cash Management Our five year track record of cash conversion is strong with our operating cash flow after net capital expenditure averaging 92 per cent of adjusted operating profit.
Strong cash generation is a key hallmark of our business and the effective application of our cash is essential in continuing to deliver growth in shareholder value.
Our primary aim is to continue to develop the business through investment in organic growth and by pursuing value creating acquisitions.
In order to keep our balance sheet efficient while we are looking for value creating opportunities we commenced a share buyback programme in February.

The average share price paid was 1475 pence, excluding transaction costs.
Shares were purchased on market on the London Stock Exchange and are held as treasury shares on the balance sheet.
We have, and intend to renew at the 2006 AGM, shareholder approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of our issued share capital.
The Directors choose to exercise this power only when, in light of market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be to increase earnings per share and is in the best interest of shareholders generally.
The share buyback programme is ongoing, and in the absence of value creating acquisitions, we intend to spend up to our annual free cash flow.
The impact of the share buyback programme for the financial year ended September 2005 was to increase adjusted earnings per share by 0.4 pence and basic earnings per share by 0.2 pence, after taking into account an increase in the net interest charge of 3 million and a decrease in the tax charge of 1 million.

Lambert & Butler Golden Virginia Richmond The UKs best selling cigarette An excellent performance The UKs second biggest brand family, with a 16% market from the UKs market leader cigarette brand family had an share.
MARKET DYNAMICS We estimate that the UK cigarette market was down by around 4 per cent to 51 billion cigarettes.
Consumer downtrading continued with growth in both the ultra low price cigarette and fine cut tobacco sectors.
We estimate the fine cut tobacco market grew to 3,000 tonnes 2004: 2,900 tonnes.
We operate in a highly regulated environment in which new point of sale advertising restrictions were introduced in December 2004.
The UK Governments Health Bill was published on 27 October 2005, and states that from the summer of 2007, smoking will be banned in all enclosed public places in England and Wales, apart from private members clubs and licensed premises that do not serve or prepare food.
We anticipate that in Scotland and Northern Ireland a ban on smoking in public places will be implemented on 26 March 2006 and by April 2007 respectively.
OUR PERFORMANCE We delivered a strong improvement in operating profits, up 5 per cent to 477 million as a result of price increases, growth in fine cut tobacco volumes and cost reductions.
Our results reflect the strength of our brand portfolio, which includes the UKs two best selling cigarette brand families, Lambert & Butler and Richmond.
Lambert & Butler performed well, maintaining 16.0 per cent of the market, whilst Richmond had an excellent year, growing its share by 1.5 percentage points to 14.7 per cent.
The combined brand families accounted for over 30 per cent of the UK market in 2005.
Reflecting market dynamics, our market shares of Regal, Embassy and Superkings declined slightly such that our total UK cigarette market share remained broadly stable at 44.5 per cent.
We increased our fine cut tobacco share to 66.3 per cent, with strong growth from Golden Virginia, the UK market leader.
Our excellent performance in this highly regulated environment reflects our continued investment in our skilled salesforce and supporting technology.
Our UK co-marketing and logistics agreement with Philip Morris was renegotiated for an additional five years.
OUTLOOK The UK market continues to make a major contribution to the Groups overall performance.
In the context of moderate market declines and current market sector trends, our strong brand portfolio means we are well placed to build on our market leadership positions in cigarette and fine cut tobacco and to further develop our profits.
