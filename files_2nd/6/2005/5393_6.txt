32 Financial review Turnover Reported Group turnover fell by 8.4% or 177.9m to 1,942.8m.
The decline, excluding exchange movement, was 5.1% or 107.1m.
The adverse exchange movement was largely driven by a decline in the weighted average rate of the US Dollar against Sterling from $1.70 last year to $1.85 in 2004 05.
At constant currency, turnover in EMI Music fell by 7.4%, declining in all regions apart from Latin America.
The disappointing level of reorders for second-half releases and the slippage of two major albums out of the financial year was partially offset by stronger catalogue sales.
At constant currency, turnover in EMI Music Publishing was up on the prior year in all major geographic regions and by 4.9% at a divisional level.
The increase in turnover was driven by strong growth in performance, synchronisation and other revenues.
Mechanical revenues were below the prior year, driven by the decline in the global recorded music market.
Martin Stewart Group digital sales increased to 49.7m from 15.1m in the prior year, an increase Chief Financial Officer of 329% at constant currency.
Digital sales represented 2.5% of total Group turnover EMI Group for the year, with the percentage increasing sequentially during the year from 2.2% in the first quarter to 3.5% in the fourth quarter.
Costs During the course of the year, all costs were tightly controlled.
Administration expenses were reduced by 31.6m and gross margin, after distribution costs, improved from 35.3% to 35.7%.
Royalty and copyright costs, manufacturing and distribution costs together with marketing and promotion costs are all largely variable with turnover.
They have, therefore, declined in absolute terms but, as a result of greater efficiencies, there has been a relative improvement particularly in marketing and promotion costs.
Group corporate costs were higher in the year due to increased legal and regulatory costs.
The cost structure was improved over the year by the outsourcing of manufacturing in the United States and Europe and the restructuring of some of our record labels, particularly in Continental Europe.
These initiatives delivered savings of 35m in the year and are expected to deliver further savings of 15m in the current financial year, bringing the total annualised cost savings to 50m.
Costs were Operating profit tightly controlled Group operating profit EBITA declined by 16.4m or 6.6% from 249.3m to 232.9m.

and gross margin EMI Music reported EBITA of 132.7m, a decline of 11.8m or 8.0% at constant improved to currency on the prior year.
The EBITA contribution from the Continental Europe region increased significantly in the year but this improvement was more than offset 35.7%.
by declines in North America and Asia.
Operating margin remained constant at 8.6%, further evidence of the Groups determination not to chase unprofitable sales and its ability to control costs.
EMI Music Publishing reported EBITA of 100.2m, a growth of 3.0% at constant currency on the prior year.
Operating margin declined from 25.6% to 25.0%.
This decline in margin was primarily attributable to an increase in allocated corporate costs.
Group operating margin increased again from 11.8% to 12.0%.
