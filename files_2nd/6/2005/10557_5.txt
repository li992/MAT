The annual bonus is not pensionable.
For 2005, a scheme was designed to reward the achievement of significantly stretched targets and foster the continued development of inter-divisional co-operation and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: collaboration.

Accounting policies continued The Morgan Crucible Company plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
e Derivative financial instruments The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The parent The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 88 to 95. profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see accounting policy f. The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 5 January 2004 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs.
The principal The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet exception is that, as more fully explained below, financial instruments accounting is determined on different bases in the year ended 4 January date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange 2006 and for the year ended 4 January 2005 due to the transitional provisions of IAS 32 and IAS 39. contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Judgements made by the Directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements f Hedging and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 28. i Cash flow hedges a Transition to Adopted IFRSs Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging The Group is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRS for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1. reserve.

If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently In addition to exempting companies from the requirement to restate comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39, IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in the hedging the full requirements of IFRSs in the transition period.
The following exemptions have been taken in these financial statements: reserve are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, Business combinations Business combinations that took place prior to 5 January 2004 have not been restated.
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period or Fair value or revaluation as deemed cost At the date of transition, fair value at the date of previous revaluation has been used as deemed periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in cost for properties previously measured at fair value.
Employee benefits All cumulative actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans have been recognised in equity at 5 January 2004.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in the hedging reserve and is recognised Cumulative translation differences Cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations have been set to zero at 5 January 2004. in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the b Measurement convention cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in the hedging reserve is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: ii Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale.
Non-current assets Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge economically the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
c Basis of consolidation iii Hedge of net investment in foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective i Subsidiaries hedge is recognised directly in the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently iv Effect of first time adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 5 January 2005 are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial The Group has taken advantage of the transitional arrangements of IFRS 1 not to restate corresponding amounts in accordance with IAS 32 statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Instead the following policies were applied in respect of financial instruments issued by the Group, investments in debt and equity securities, derivative financial instruments and hedging.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in In the comparative period other than the following exceptions all financial assets and financial liabilities were carried at cost amortised as preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent appropriate less, in the case of financial assets, provision for any permanent diminution in value.

0.5 The Group has taken advantage of relief available in IFRS 1 to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS at 5 January 2004.
The nature and main effects upon the consolidated balance sheet at 5 January 2005 and upon the 2005 consolidated income statement, statement of changes in equity, statement of recognised income and expense and cash flow statement are as follows: iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of related hedges are taken to translation In 2005 hedging instruments and hedged items are accounted for separately in the balance sheet.

On 5 January 2005 the hedged items and hedging instruments are brought separately on to the balance sheet in accordance with the 2005 policy.
The cash flow statement is unaffected by this change in accounting policy.

Where parts of an item Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to ii Leased assets cash-generating units group of units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis.
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets Goodwill was tested for impairment at 5 January 2004, the date of transition to Adopted IFRS, and for the years ended 4 January 2005 and acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 4 January 2006. payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.

Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the Motor vehicles and IT equipment 3 years greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an h Intangible assets asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of ii Reversals of impairment subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 5 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of An impairment loss in respect of a held-to-maturity security or receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy l. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in ii Research and development the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient m Share capital resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of i Preference share capital overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or is redeemable but only at the accounting policy l. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Dividends on preference share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
iii Other intangible assets n Employee benefits Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy l. i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are ii Defined benefit plans indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that Capitalised development costs 3 years have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
