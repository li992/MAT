FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW Operating results Total sales for the group were 3.3 billion compared to 3.2 billion in 2004.
Like for like sales for the group were down 2.3 per cent due principally to the fall in new car sales in our UK market.
This year we have produced a good set of trading results as explained in the Chief Executives review.
Gross margins have been maintained at 14.2 per cent and our operating margin excluding exceptional items was 3.0 per cent 2004: 2.8 per cent.
Exceptional operating costs of 2.9 million incurred in the year relate to the impairment of goodwill, manufacturer debt and redundancy costs in respect of our MG Rover dealerships.
The trading loss of 2.3 million of the MG Rover franchise is included within operating profit 2004: profit of 2.0 million.
Of the original 16 MG Rover sites which we operated at the beginning of the year, four have been closed with a view to disposing of the property and the remainder have all been refranchised.
The franchises added have been greenfield start ups and will therefore take a period of time to build up new car sales and aftersales to replace the lost MG Rover business.
Cash flow Net debt as at 31 December 2005 was 177.0 million compared to 246.8 million at the end of 2004.
Net debt is defined as including 77.4 million of cash and cash equivalents note 24, 260.9 million of interest bearing loans and borrowings note 16 and 6.5 million of derivative financial instruments note 17.
At the time of the CD Bramall acquisition, in early 2004, we said our target would be to reduce our debt to more normal levels by the end of 2005.
This target has been achieved and gearing was 70 per cent at the end of the year.
The reduction in debt has been by a combination of good cash flow from operations and property and business disposals.
The cash flows of the business may be summarised as follows: m 2005 2004 Cash generated from operations 130.4 187.4 Net interest paid 43.2 26.4 Tax 16.6 19.3 Replacement capital expenditure 45.2 26.7 Free cash flow 25.4 115.0 Acquisitions 60.8 315.4 Disposals 119.7 65.0 Dividend 15.6 9.8 Other 1.1 2.8 Reduction increase in net debt 69.8 148.0 Cash flow generated from operations was 130.4 million, which compares with 187.4 million generated in 2004.
This is made up of two key components, operating profit and working capital movements.
The operating profit element after adding back depreciation, intangible charges and property profits was 144.9 million, up 2.9 million on the 142.0 million in 2004.
In respect of working capital we made a net investment of 14.5 million whereas in 2004 we had a net inflow of 45.4 million, mainly due to the lower working capital investment achieved following the CD Bramall acquisition.
The main contribution to the increase in investment in working capital in 2005 arose in December when new car registrations were 8.7 per cent up on 2004.
The increase in registrations was principally due to higher diesel vehicle sales to company car drivers in advance of changes in tax rules.
As a consequence we closed 2005 with higher than normal vehicle debtors.
Net interest paid has increased year on year.
This reflects the higher interest rates during the year and also the impact of when payments are made.
Replacement capital expenditure was 45.2 million which includes plant and machinery, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles.
Expenditure on plant and machinery and fixtures and fittings was 9.1 million, up slightly on the 7.6 million in 2004.
The balance of the expenditure of 36.1 million 2004: 19.1 million is in respect of motor vehicles used either for our contract hire fleet or for service loan cars for our customers.
The level of investment is up this year as we have financed more of these vehicles ourselves rather than on an operating lease basis.
10 FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW CONTINUED Acquisitions consist of businesses purchased during the year and property developments.
In 2005 we have spent 41.6 million which includes the cost of acquiring 25 dealerships and a further 19.2 million on property developments 2004: 19.8 million.
The expenditure in 2004 is principally the cost of acquiring CD Bramall 293.5 million.
Business disposals raised 16.2 million in 2005 2004: 17.9 million, which included the sale of seven dealerships.
Property disposals raised 103.5 million 2004: 47.1 million.
This includes the disposal of properties in October to a property joint venture company that we have formed with the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.
Financing costs The total net interest charge for the year of 39.6 million includes bank interest, vehicle stocking charges and finance charges 2004: 34.6 million.
The total charge has gone up by 5.0 million due to higher interest rates.
In addition we have funded the CD Bramall acquisition cost for an extra two months.
Total net interest cover was 2.6 times compared to 2.9 times in 2004.
Tax The overall effective tax rate for the year was 32.4 per cent 2004: 30.2 per cent.
The rate is higher than the standard 30.0 per cent UK tax rate, primarily due to depreciation on assets not eligible for capital allowances, together with goodwill impairment and trading losses in Germany for which no tax relief in the current year is available.
Earnings per share Reported earnings per share were 34.8 pence in 2005 compared to 37.1 pence in 2004.
The previous year is higher as asset disposal profits were 11.5 million higher.
Earnings per share excluding goodwill impairment and non-trading items increased by 3.4 pence 11.3 per cent from 30.0 pence to 33.4 pence for 2005.
Dividends The proposed final dividend of 6.6 pence per share will bring the total dividend for the year to 13.2 pence, an increase of 29.4 per cent.
This increase in dividend demonstrates our confidence in the future prospects of the group.
The interim dividend for 2005 and proposed final dividend amount to 8.2 million each.
Since the companys shares commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange in 1989 the compound annual growth rate in dividend has been 12.8 per cent.
International Financial Reporting Standards Up to December 2004 Pendragon reported its results under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
Following adoption of Regulation 1606 2002 by the European Parliament in July 2002 all EU listed companies are required to report their consolidated financial statements under EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
These accounts are the groups first annual financial statements prepared under IFRS and the comparatives have been restated in line with the new policies.
The changes to the income statement arising with the adoption of IFRS are relatively insignificant, whilst the net assets of the group increased by 34.7 million as at 1 January 2004 with a restatement in the value of property, which is in part offset by the pension fund deficit that has been recognised, and an increase in the deferred tax liability of the group.
A full report detailing the changes to Pendragons accounting policies and their financial effect was published on 22 July 2005 and is available on the companys website http: www.
11 The principal changes the group has made to its accounting policies on adoption of IFRS to those presented in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 are as follows: a Tangible fixed assets land and buildings have been restated to fair value as at 1 January 2004. b Employee share options the fair value of the options granted to employees are expensed to the income statement.
c Goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested instead for impairment at least once a year.
d Intangible assets are recognised on acquisition if they can be separately identified and reliably measured.
e Dividends final dividends recognised once approved at AGM or interim dividends when they are paid.
f Deferred tax provided in full including capital gains that have been rolled over.
g Leases buildings are treated as fixed assets if they are long term and all the risks and rewards have substantially transferred to the group.
h Revenue recognition contract hire vehicles remain on balance sheet as fixed assets if the group has a future repurchase commitment.
Profit is spread over the period of the lease.
i Employee pensions the full deficit on the pension schemes is recognised on balance sheet, and future costs will be calculated in accordance with the corridor approach.
j Financial instruments assets and liabilities of financial derivatives are recognised on balance sheet.
k Inventories stock held on the balance sheet has been restated to include all vehicles invoiced to the group including those that are on interest free stocking plans.
Under the previous treatment interest free vehicles were not included in the balance sheet total.
Treasury Information regarding treasury policy and procedures together with details of financial risk management are set out in the notes to the financial statements.
These are the first full set of financial statements of the group to reflect the adoption of International Accounting Standard IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The main impact of these is to recognise for the first time the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.
Pension funds The group participates in six defined benefit pension schemes which have been closed to new members for a number of years.
New employees are offered membership of defined contribution schemes.
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 19 and show a pension cost for the year of 5.4 million 2004: 6.4 million.
The IAS 19 deficit on the groups pension schemes has increased to 90.4 million from 80.2 million, before tax.
Whilst the value of the scheme assets increased by 41.1 million the estimated liabilities rose by 51.3 million due to the effect of falling bond yields and the expected interest on the liabilities.
Under the groups adopted accounting policy, 71.4 million of the deficit is held on the group balance sheet.
The group increased its level of contributions to the defined benefit schemes with additional payments of 4.7 million and four of the schemes will have formal actuarial valuations as at April 2006 under the UK Governments new Scheme Specific Funding arrangements.
Summary We have again demonstrated our ability, through strong operating cash flow and selective disposals, to manage our borrowings efficiently.
Both interest and dividend cover remained at good levels in the year.
