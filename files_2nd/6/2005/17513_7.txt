20| Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 Operating and Financial Review | Financial Review Basis of presentation of financial information Financial information is presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The reporting currency of Xstrata plc is US dollars.
Financial statements of subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currencies and converted to US dollars on consolidation of Group results.
For details of the significant impacts of the introduction of IFRS refer to the note IFRS reconciliation to UK GAAP.
Unless indicated to the contrary, revenue, earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA and earnings before interest and taxation EBIT are reported in the Chief Executives Report and the Operating and Financial Review before nontrading items BNI.
Non-trading items are material items of income and expense which, due to their nature or expected infrequency, are presented separately in the income statement.
Unless indicated to the contrary, all data and commentary in the Chief Executives Report and the Operating and Financial Review exclude the discontinued Forestry operation and all dollar and cent figures provided refer to US dollars and cents.
Consolidated operational results Group revenue increased by 25% in 2005, exceeding $8 billion as robust demand supported price increases across all of Xstratas commodities.
The strong price increases in the thermal and coking coal and ferroalloys markets seen in the first half of the year eased in the second half, but improved demand in LME-traded commodities boosted prices of copper, zinc and lead, significantly increasing earnings.
Higher revenues drove profits and cash flow to record levels.
Despite a weaker US dollar against all of Xstratas local currencies, EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2005 increased by 50% to $3,103 million and EBIT improved by 68% to $2,520 million.

Ferrochrome and vanadium price increases contributed $221 million and higher zinc and lead prices $134 million to EBIT.
Lower volumes in a number of commodities compared to the previous year reduced EBIT by $9 million.
The greatest impact was from lower gold production at the Alumbrera copper-gold mine, down by 9% due to lower gold grades, and from lower vanadium sales due to the closure of two operations in 2004.
Chrome volumes also reduced due to a number of furnaces being temporarily suspended for routine maintenance during the winter period when energy prices are high.
The north Queensland copper operations produced record  volumes but smelter production fell by 7% following maintenance work and limitations to furnace production due to gas off-take restrictions.
Hard coking coal production also fell by 7%, impacted by a roof fall at Oaky Creek, which resulted in 130,000 tonnes of lost production, and planned lower production from the higher cost Oaky Creek open cut mine.
Despite this, coking coal sales remained at a similar level to the previous year.
Production of semi-soft coking coal declined from increased levels of production in 2004 in response to steel producers preference for hard coking coal in order to maximise output.
Lower volumes were partially offset by higher thermal coal volumes and improved zinc and lead production at Mount Isa following the commissioning of the new Black Star zinc-lead mine and higher production from George Fisher.
Despite the substantial, ongoing increases in costs being experienced across the mining industry, Xstrata achieved a reduction in unit costs in real terms of $19 million during the period.
The combined impact of efficiency programmes, which delivered $106 million of savings, was offset by specific cost increases that are being experienced across the mining industry, including freight, consumables, fuel and energy price increases.
In particular, Xstrata Zinc achieved significant cost savings through improved capacity utilisation from the combined impact of the start-up of the Black Star mine and higher volumes from the George Fisher mine at Mount Isa.
Efficiency improvements in the ferrochrome business produced benefits in 2005, by focussing on initiatives to improve the quality of feed to the smelters and minimise metallurgical coke requirements.
Significant progress was also made in reducing operating costs at the Xstrata-Merafe Chrome Ventures Boshoek operation during the year.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 23 Productivity improvements at Xstrata Coals New South Wales operations, particularly at the Beltana mine, largely mitigated increased cost inflation.
Productivity improvements at the Oaky North underground operation in Queensland were more than offset by an unexpected roof fall at the same underground operation, port congestion at the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and higher prices for key inputs.
The benefit of ongoing efficiency programmes and improved ore grades in Xstrata Copper in North Queensland more than offset higher fuel, power and reagent costs.
The Alumbrera copper operation in Argentina benefited from record processing volumes as the benefits of the flotation expansion were realised, but overall costs were impacted by higher smelting, refining and freight rates, and the impact of lower gold head grades.
Other income and expenses include Windimurra closure costs, the impact of one-off gains in 2004 which were not repeated in the period under review and a higher Group share-based payments charge under IFRS.
These are more than offset by equity-accounted income of $21 million from Xstratas 19.9% stake in Falconbridge Limited.
The weaker US dollar during 2005 gave rise to an unfavourable foreign exchange variance of $264 million.
This was mainly due to a 3% strengthening of the Australian dollar and lower currency hedging gains compared to the previous year.

Increased taxable earnings in 2005 led to a higher weighted average statutory tax rate of 24.2% from 22.4% in 2004.
The effective tax rate benefited from a decrease in corporate tax rates in South Africa and the recognition of research and development allowances in Australia.
In total $27.6 million was written off in relation to the unsuccessful offer for WMC.
The net foreign currency translation gain of $62 million represents the effect, mainly in the first half, of the release of cumulative foreign currency translation gains and losses on repayment of inter-company loans that are considered equity in nature.
In accordance with IFRS, these gains and losses are recorded in the foreign currency translation reserve until the loans are repaid, at which point they are recycled through the income statement.
Xstratas forestry division was sold in January 2005, giving rise to a $4 million profit on disposal.

Xstrata Zinc has secured a substantial amount of its concentrate requirements for the remainder of 2006 into the San Juan fide Nieva and Nordenham zinc smelters in Spain and Germany respectively.
Forward sales have been entered into for a minor proportion of 2006 copper zinc, lead and gold production, as shown in the hedging summary below.
Cash Flow, Net Debt and Financing Summary Xstratas operations generated $1,924 million of free cash flow during 2005 after funding sustaining capital expenditure of $412 million.
Despite tax paid increasing by $323 million versus the prior period, cash flow before capital expenditure increased by 42% to $2,325 million compared to 2004.
Net debt increased by $1,139 million as strong cash generation was offset by the cash portion of the acquisition of 19.9% of Falconbridge Limited and returned $522 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 4.1% of Xstratas issued share capital under the Equity Capital Management Programme.
In addition, in 2005 Xstrata invested $517 million of capital at operations to enhance production capacities including expenditure funded via finance leases, acquired African Carbon Group for $60 million and distributed dividend payments to shareholders of $154 million.

The value of concentrate stocks increased at the European zinc smelters due to higher metals prices.
This increase in inventories was partially offset by a drawdown of thermal coal stockpiles in South Africa.
Underlying trade creditors increased as a result of higher payables as a consequence of the higher prices inherent in concentrate stocks for the European zinc smelters, in addition to timing of payments around the year end.
As a consequence of the ongoing development of Australian operations, stripping ratios increased, with overburden removal at both the Black Star zinc lead open pit at Mount Isa and at the Ernest Henry copper operation, resulting in increased deferred stripping costs.

Its responsibilities include: management of the Groups cash resources and debt funding programmes, funding acquisitions and investments, management of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and co-ordinating relationships with banks, rating agencies and other financial institutions.
The Group is generally exposed to US dollars through its revenue stream.
The Group will seek to source debt capital in US dollars directly or by borrowing in other currencies and swapping them into US dollars, thus matching the negative exposure of our debt service obligations against the positive exposure of our revenue.
Currency Hedging Currency hedging may be used to reduce the Groups short-term exposure to fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates to the US dollar, Sterling and Euro.
The currency hedging gains reflected in the income statement for the period ended 31 December 2005 amounted to $45 million compared to $218 million for the corresponding period in 2004.
The unrealised mark-to-market loss on currency hedging in place at 31 December 2005 was $14 million.
The majority of Australian dollar hedging relates to contracted US dollar priced sales.

Commodity hedging is in the form of forward and option contracts covering a portion of planned attributable gold, copper, zinc, silver, lead and coal production.
Hedges relating to sales in 2006 are classified as cash flow hedges and shown in the table below.
The fair value of these hedges is deferred within equity on the balance sheet until the sale is recorded.
The unrealised mark-to-market loss on commodity hedging maturing in 2006 and in place at 31 December 2005 was $85 million.

Gold and silver are principally produced as by-products from our major operating assets, hedging these commodities effectively locks in a portion of the operating costs associated with these assets.
Xstrata Coal has an ongoing hedging programme for thermal coal, principally from South Africa, and hedges a portion of forecast production when pricing opportunities exist in the forward market.
As indicated in the 2005 Interim Report, the Ernest Henry copper gold operation is scheduled in 2006 to enter a period of abnormally low ore grades for several months.
As a consequence, unit costs are expected to increase temporarily.
A decision was made during the first half of 2005 to lock in the profitability of the operation through the forward sale of copper for this period.
As a result of the more favourable outlook for copper prices into 2006, relating to 27,800 tonnes of copper have been redesignated as hedges against 2005 copper sales with the full earnings impact of $35 million recognised in the profit and loss statement at the balance sheet date.
Zinc hedges maturing in 2006 relate to a specific shipment of zinc which was delayed from the final quarter of 2005 into 2006.
Copper and zinc are often sold under terms whereby sales are priced according to future quotational periods.
These terms are negotiated by concentrate purchasers to match the pricing period with the expected timing of cathode sales.
In certain circumstances, forward contracts have been undertaken to lock in the final price at the time at which the sale is recognised.
Hedges that relate to 2005 sales for which the quotational period is still open are shown in the table below and have been recognised in the income statement at the balance date.
As a result, these hedges will have no further earnings impact.

Total capital expenditure across the Group increased by $398 million or 72% to $947 million.
Sustaining capital expenditure of $430 million in 2005 included: n $188 million at Xstrata Coal, including the $52 million AUD68 million longwall system at the Ulan underground mine and $12 million AUD16 million underground drift conveyor system at the same operation, both completed within budget: and n $115 million at Xstrata Copper including $21 million for continued mobile equipment replacements to assist in mining at greater depth at Ernest Henry and a total of $50 million for mine development, infrastructure maintenance and ore handling projects at Mount Isa which resulted in increased concentrate output during 2005.
While this capital expenditure is sustaining in nature, these projects will have a material positive impact on costs and efficiencies at Xstratas operations.
Sustaining capital expenditure in 2006 is anticipated to decrease slightly from 2005 levels, to around $400 million, as Xstratas businesses continue to upgrade and invest in operations to increase efficiencies and production capacity.
In particular, increased capital will be directed to the Mount Isa Mines copper and zinc operations to upgrade smelters and the zinc concentrator, undertake work on the shafts and improve paste filling capabilities in 2006.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 | 31 Total expansionary capital expenditure increased to $517 million in 2005.
Despite significant cost pressures due to rising input prices, particularly raw materials and labour, Xstratas businesses delivered a number of capital growth projects during the year on time and within budget.
Significant progress was achieved in 2005 in delivering two of the Groups major growth projects: the Rolleston coal development in Queensland, Australia, and the Project Lion ferrochrome smelter and related mine development in South Africa.
At Rolleston, first production began as scheduled in September 2005, with total expenditure in 2005 of $135 million.
Phase one of Project Lion has also progressed well, incurring $132 million in 2005 the largest part of the projects total cost.
Again, despite escalating input prices, in particular steel, the project remains both on budget and schedule for commissioning in the second half of 2006.

32| Xstrata plc Annual Report 2005 Operating and Financial Review | Financial Review Expansionary capital expenditure is also anticipated to remain at a similar level to 2005 expenditure of around $500 million, as large-scale expansion projects are completed, new projects initiated and additional investment is made in a number of low capital cost, high return incremental expansion projects from the portfolio.
Feasibility studies have confirmed the potential attraction of the development of the Goedgevonden coal mine and number 5 coal seam at South Witbank and Tavistock mines in South Africa.
These projects are contingent on infrastructure and market considerations and, if approved, would result in additional capital expenditure in 2006.
Expenditure will continue on the Rolleston thermal coal mine as it moves towards full production in 2008, although at a lower rate than in 2005.
Phase one of Project Lion will be completed during 2006, with commissioning expected in the second half.
