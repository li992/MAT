Finance Directors review Changing and reshaping The group has undergone signi cant change since Alan Parker took over as Chief Executive in June 2004: in July 2004 we acquired Premier Lodge for 505 million and a further 19 pub restaurant sites for 31.2 million.
The lodges are now integrated in Premier Travel Inn and the pub restaurants in Brewers Fayre: in March 2005 after the year-end, we announced the disposal of our franchised Marriott hotels business.
Following the EGM on 22 April 2005 we expect this transaction to complete on 5 May 2005: with the appointment of Christopher Rogers as Finance Director on 1 May 2005 seven of Alan Parkers direct reports will have changed.
The most immediate impact on the David Richardson financial statements comes from the Finance Director Premier Lodge acquisition and under each heading we have tried to identify the underlying e ect as well as the group total.
The longer reaching impact will, of course, result from the changing management and the reshaping of the group following the Marriott disposal.
Year-end date These accounts are drawn up to 3 March 2005 and represent 52 weeks trading.
This is five fewer days than last year but, consistent with our practice, comparisons are shown year-on-year.
