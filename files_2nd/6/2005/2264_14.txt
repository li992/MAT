55 Financial review Net debt equity Corporate transactions and restructuring In South Africa the disposal of Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium lead by two major black empowerment Percentage investors was completed on 22 March 2005.
African Oxygen Limited, BOCs subsidiary in South Africa, retains a 80 significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.
The gain on disposal of 84.9 million has been recognised as an exceptional item.
African Oxygen Limited has distributed the proceeds 60 of the disposal to its shareholders through a buy back of shares and a special dividend.
The amount of the special dividend payable to minority shareholders was some 54 million, which is included in the total dividends paid to 40 minorities in subsidiaries within the Group cash flow statement.
The sale of BOCs packaged gas business in the US to Airgas Inc was completed in July 2004.
Part of the 20 consideration was payable subject to certain conditions and accordingly was not recognised in 2004.
This remaining 0 03 04 05 consideration amounting to US$20 million was received in November 2005 and has been recognised in 2005 as an exceptional item.
The disposal of the business in 2004 resulted in a loss of 79.5 million plus associated restructuring costs of 14.8 million.
Net debt capital employed In 2005 20.7 million has been charged for restructuring in BOC Edwards.
This comprises 13.9 million of goodwill impairment and severance costs.
Savings of approximately 5 million are targeted from this restructuring Percentage during 2006.
Further costs are anticipated from this programme in 2006 leading to additional benefits.
40 Group expenditure on acquisitions of businesses was 57.1 million 2004: 50.9 million.
The main acquisitions during 2005 were G Van Dongen Holding BV, to expand Gists primary business into Europe, and an additional 30 equity investment in Compania fide Nitrogeno fide Cantarell CNC in proportion to BOCs existing 65 per cent equity holding.
The main acquisition in 2004 was to increase BOCs holding in CNC.

Liquidity and capital resources Cash flows The Groups cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Group cash flow statement on page 88, are summarised in the following table: 2005 2004 2003 million million million Net cash inflow from operating activities 665.5 758.5 700.1 Dividends from joint ventures and associates 51.1 79.1 35.0 Returns on investment and servicing of finance 131.6 91.2 94.4 Tax paid 118.4 98.2 90.7 Total provided by operating activities 466.6 648.2 550.0 Capital expenditure and financial investment 299.7 204.2 227.0 Acquisitions and disposals 128.8 92.5 118.3 Total used by investing activities 170.9 111.7 345.3 Decreases in debt 165.7 180.7 128.7 Shares issued 9.6 12.4 2.6 Equity dividends paid 204.1 197.3 192.1 Net sales purchases of short-term investments 14.3 20.8 16.2 Total used for financing activities 345.9 386.4 307.2 Decrease increase in cash 50.2 150.1 102.5 56 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Financial review Cash flow from operationsTotal cash generated by operating activities in 2005 was 466.6 million compared to 648.2 million in 2004.
The decrease was associated with a lower net cash inflow from operating activities of 665.5 million 2004: 758.5 million primarily as a result of an approximate 70 million impact of the disposal of the Afrox hospitals business part way through the year.
Returns on investment and servicing of finance increased significantly in 2005 compared with 2004.
The 2005 total included approximately 54 million for the minority interest element of the special dividend paid by African Oxygen Limited following the disposal of its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited in March 2005.
The 2005 tax paid includes approximately 15 million in connection with this transaction.
In 2004, the increase in cash provided by operating activities to 648.2 million 2003: 550.0 million was driven by higher operating profit before exceptional items of 576.9 million in 2004 2003: 505.6 million and improved working capital management offsetting the impact of higher contributions to the UK pension scheme.
Higher dividends from joint ventures and associates in 2004 of 79.1 million 2003: 35.0 million, which included a second dividend from Japan Air Gases, also helped to improve cash flows.
Investing Cash used by investing activities was 170.9 million in 2005 2004: 111.7 million.
The increase in capital expenditure and financial investment over the prior year reflects a higher level of expenditure in new supply scheme projects, principally in Asia Pacific and the Americas.
The higher net cash inflow from acquisitions and disposals in 2005 reflects the proceeds from the sale by African Oxygen Limited of its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited in March 2005.
In 2004, the reduction in cash used by investing activities to 111.7 million 2003: 345.3 million reflected a lower level of expenditure on acquisitions in 2004 compared to 2003, proceeds from the divestment of the US packaged gas business in July 2004 and receipts of 53.0 million from capital restructuring of Japan Air Gases Ltd. Financing Overall, net debt decreased by 122.7 million as a result of a net cash inflow of 91.6 million, a 9.6 million inflow from the issue of shares, an inflow of 34.7 million for the net debt acquired disposed on business acquisitions and disposals and 13.2 million for the effect of exchange rate and inception of finance leases.
Decreases in debt in 2005 principally relate to the repayment of 168.6 million of medium term notes.
In 2004, net debt decreased by 405.7 million as a result of a net cash inflow of 339.2 million, a 12.4 million inflow from the issue of shares, an outflow of 4.7 million for the net debt acquired disposed on business acquisitions and disposals and 58.8 million for the effect of exchange rate and other movements.
Decreases in debt in 2004 principally related to the repayment of 125.0 million of 6.75% bonds due in 2004 and 42.6 million net repayment of commercial paper.
The Group has access to a range of funding.
Debt finance is raised by issuing bonds, commercial paper, other obligations to investors and through borrowings from banks.
As well as medium and long-term borrowings, the Group maintains short-term borrowings, principally in the form of commercial paper and bank borrowings.
At 30 September 2005, the Group had US$450 million 254 million of committed multi-currency facilities with a group of relationship banks maturing in 2008.
In October 2005 these facilities were replaced with US$600 million 339 million of committed multi-currency facilities maturing in 2010.
These facilities provide back-up for the issue of commercial paper as well as general liquidity for the Group.
Additional committed facilities are maintained by the principal operating units in the Group.
At 30 September 2005, the gearing ratio net debt including finance leases as a percentage of capital employed was 25.6 per cent compared with 29.9 per cent in 2004 and 37.4 per cent in 2003.
The net debt equity ratio was 40.9 per cent, compared with 51.2 per cent in 2004 and 73.4 per cent in 2003.
The Group has access to a diverse range of debt finance including commercial paper, public bonds and bank borrowings which, it believes, will be available to meet long-term financing needs.
The Group has sufficient facilities to cover likely borrowing needs.
Management anticipates that capital expenditure in 2006 will be at a higher level than in 2005 and will be covered by cash inflow from operating activities and existing sources of financing.
Management of financial risks The board of directors sets the treasury policies and objectives of the Group which include controls over the procedures used to manage currency, interest rate and credit risk.
The approach to managing risk is set out below.
This approach is expected to continue during the next financial year.
On a day-to-day basis, Group treasury carries out these policies, with regular review meetings with the Group finance director.
Specific and significant activities need approval from the finance committee, which includes any two directors of the company.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments nor does it enter into any leveraged derivative transactions.
Currency riskThe Group faces currency risk principally on its net assets, most of which are in currencies other than sterling.
Currency movements can therefore have a significant effect on the Groups balance sheet when translating these foreign currency assets into sterling.
In order to reduce this effect the Group manages its borrowings, where practicable and cost effective, to hedge its foreign currency assets.
Where possible, hedging is done using direct borrowings in the same currency as the assets being hedged or through the use of other hedging methods such as currency swaps.
Group borrowings are currently held in a wide range of currencies and, after swaps, 79 per cent of net debt 2004: 82 per cent is denominated in the principal currencies affecting the Group: US dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, South African rand and sterling.
The aggregate of the notional principal values of currency swaps was 341.7 million 2004: 593.1 million spread over a range of currencies.
The fair value of such swaps is included in note 21 b i to the financial statements.
Financial review 57 The balance sheets of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange for the year and any exchange difference is dealt with as a movement in reserves.
This is explained more fully in the accounting policy note on page 91.
The profit and loss accounts of overseas businesses are translated at average rates of exchange and this translation impact directly affects the profit and loss account of the Group.
The Group manages its currency flows to minimise currency transaction exchange risk and forward contracts are used as appropriate to hedge net currency flows and selected individual transactions.
The Groups foreign exchange cover is mainly managed in the UK, Australia, Japan and South Africa.
The UK manages the cover for exposures on net trade flows of the Groups companies in the US and certain other countries.
The aggregate principal amount of forward cover outstanding at 30 September 2005 amounted to 222.6 million 2004: 224.4 million.
Interest rate risk At 30 September 2005, the Groups net debt position after interest rate hedging activity included a net exposure of 36.6 million 2004: 74.6 million to floating interest rates.
Based on the Groups 2005 year end level and composition of net debt, an increase in average interest rates of one per cent per annum would result in a decrease in future earnings, before tax, of 0.4 million per annum 2004: 0.7 million.
In order to manage interest rate risk the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
At 30 September 2005, there was a 4:96 ratio 2004: 8:92 between floating and fixed rate net debt.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary this mix and to manage the Groups interest rate exposure.
At 30 September 2005, the aggregate of the notional principal values of swap agreements which affect the floating rate fixed rate mix was 286.4 million 2004: 285.3 million.
Foreign exchange risk At 30 September 2005, the Group had outstanding forward exchange contracts totalling 222.6 million 2004: 224.4 million in respect of its actual and forecast transaction exposures.
The fair value of these contracts at 30 September 2005 amounted to a gain of 0.2 million 2004: a gain of 7.5 million.
A ten per cent appreciation of sterling would increase the fair value of these contracts by 15.2 million 2004: 11.0 million.
In addition to these forward contracts, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange movements on its net debt position.
At 30 September 2005 net debt, after currency swaps, comprised net sterling liabilities of 153.2 million 2004: 104.6 million and net currency liabilities of 686.5 million 2004: 857.8 million.
Based on the Groups 2005 year end level and composition of net debt, a ten per cent appreciation of sterling would result in a reduction in the value of net currency liabilities of 62.4 million 2004: 78.0 million.
Counterparty risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from counterparties.
Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty depending upon its credit rating and by regular reviews of these ratings.
The possibility of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is considered unlikely by management.
The currency and interest rate hedging profile of the Groups borrowings at 30 September 2005 is shown in note 21 to the financial statements.
Further information on financial risk management is also given in note 21 to the financial statements.
Interest on net debt The net charge before the Groups share of interest of joint ventures and associates was 47.6 million in 2005 2004: 70.5 million, 2003: 75.8 million, which, after excluding interest income from loans to joint ventures and associates, represented 7.2 per cent of average net borrowings during the year.
After taking into account interest capitalised of 1.1 million 2004: 0.1 million, 2003: 0.8 million and the Groups share of the net interest of joint ventures and associates of 29.1 million 2004: 17.9 million, 2003: 20.3 million, the net charge was 76.7 million.
Adjusted interest cover the number of times that the interest charge on net debt is covered by adjusted operating profit increased to 7.4 times 2004: 6.5 times, 2003: 5.3 times.
Net interest on pension financing items The interest on pension scheme liabilities was 128.9 million in 2005 2004: 117.4 million, 2003: 110.2 million.
The expected return on pension scheme assets was 147.1 million in 2005 2004: 133.2 million, 2003: 119.6 million.
The increase in the expected return on scheme assets was a result of the increased value of the Groups pension assets.
This reflects the increase in the value of world equity markets and the impact of the additional cash contributions made by the Group to the UK pension scheme.
Debt maturity profile The maturity profile of the commitments relating to the Groups gross borrowings and the estimated associated interest cost, if the debt runs to the full term, is as follows: 2005 2004 Principal Interest Principal Interest million million million million More than five years 303.9 82.7 320.5 111.2 Three to five years 202.2 58.0 260.9 76.6 One to three years 265.4 82.4 347.1 93.9 Within one year 259.2 52.7 262.1 64.6 Total 1,030.7 275.8 1,190.6 346.3 58 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Financial review At 30 September 2005, the Group had US$450 million 254 million of committed multi-currency facilities with a group of relationship banks maturing in 2008.
Additional information on the Groups gross borrowings can be found in note 20.
Details of the Groups share of net debt of joint ventures and associates, the majority of which is non-recourse, are given in note 13 a.
Other contractual obligations The maturity of other contractual obligations of the Group is as follows: Other creditors Total other excluding Unconditional contractual deferred Operating purchase cash income leases obligations obligations million million million million More than five years 3.0 59.9 371.2 434.1 Three to five years 10.7 25.9 116.9 153.5 One to three years 5.2 49.1 137.0 191.3 Within one year 872.3 40.6 71.4 984.3 Total 891.2 175.5 696.5 1,763.2 See also note 25 to the financial statements for further information on operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations.
Off-balance sheet arrangements The Group has provided guarantees of 49.3 million to third parties at 30 September 2005 as shown in note 26 a to the financial statements.
The guarantees include performance bonds in the Cantarell joint venture, a guarantee of the borrowings of a joint venture in China and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business.
Other than disclosed, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Total group tax rate Taxation The tax charge on profit before exceptional items for 2005 of 131.5 million is calculated in accordance with UK Percentage accounting standards, including FRS19 deferred tax, under which full provision is made for deferred taxes.
40 The effective tax rate on adjusted profit in 2005 was 26 per cent 2004: 29 per cent, 2003: 29 per cent.
The main reason for the reduction in the tax rate was the resolution of various matters with the US tax authorities, 30 including the utilisation of tax losses.
The Group pays corporation tax in the UK at a rate of 30 per cent.
Additional information on tax 20 rates is shown in note 4 to the financial statements.
The Group is currently liable to pay federal tax at the rate of 35 per cent in the US.
This is reduced by the 10 existence of tax credits.
In the other principal subsidiaries, the tax rate is typically between 29 per cent and 42 per cent.
0 03 04 05 Contingencies The Group monitors all contingent liabilities including matters relating to litigation and the environment via a process of consultation and evaluation which includes senior management, internal and external legal advisers and internal and external technical advisers.
This process results in conclusions with respect to potential exposure and provisions are made or adjusted accordingly.
Management believes that the Group has adequately provided for contingencies which are likely to become payable in the future.
Legal proceedings BOC Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which BOC Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of BOC, The BOC Group, Inc. currently is party to a number of lawsuits in the US for alleged injuries resulting from exposure to manganese, asbestos and or toxic fumes in connection with the welding process.
The BOC Group, Inc. has not manufactured welding rods in the US since 1986 when the welding electrodes business was sold.
The BOC Group, Inc. ceased selling welding rods in the US manufactured by others when the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations that distributed packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.
Financial review 59 Manganese litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 8,574 claimants Total Claimants in pending manganese related cases in both US federal and state courts that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 1,100 claimants from 30 September 2004.
The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of several defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts, for alleged neurological injury, including Parkinsons disease, through exposure to manganese in welding fumes.
Of the Total Claimants, approximately 4,607 claimants have filed in, or been transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation MDL proceeding has been commenced, and approximately 50 claimants are in process to be transferred to or from the MDL.
The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US.
It is currently contemplated that the MDL court will try three cases during the MDL proceeding.
The first such case is currently scheduled for February 2006.
In addition to the cases in federal court, The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts, which are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.
The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other manganese related claims that have been resolved as follows.
From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 3,965 claims were dismissed.
Through 30 September 2005, seven cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc. and one case was tried to a final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
Asbestos litigation At 30 September 2005, there were a total of approximately 15,966 claimants in pending asbestos related cases that name The BOC Group, Inc. as a defendant, a net decrease of approximately 600 from 30 September 2004.
The BOC Group, Inc. is typically one of a large number of defendants in these cases that claim compensatory and punitive damages, in most cases for unspecified amounts, for alleged injuries, including cancer, through exposure to asbestos in welding fumes or from welding consumables.
A very small number of these claimants allege injuries from exposure to asbestos in non-welding rod products and premises.
The BOC Group, Inc. has been a co-defendant in other asbestos related claims that have been resolved as follows.
From 1 January 1997 to 30 September 2005, 11,776 claims were dismissed and 75 claims were dismissed on summary judgments.
Through 30 September 2005, nine cases were tried to final jury verdicts in favour of the defendants, including The BOC Group, Inc. and one case was tried to a final jury verdict in favour of the plaintiffs, which is being appealed.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in all of the various manganese and asbestos related cases and intends to defend vigorously such claims.
In the manganese related claims, The BOC Group, Inc. believes that recent relevant scientific literature, based on epidemiological studies, strongly supports its defence of such claims.
Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of the welding fumes litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
Nonetheless, it is not possible to predict either the number of future claims or the number of claimants that any future claims may present.
In addition, the outcome of welding fume cases, either involving BOC or other defendants, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict, and BOC cannot provide any assurances that any future resolutions of these types of claims will necessarily be consistent with its experience to date.
In the event of an adverse outcome to any of the proceedings, a liability would be recognised if it was considered likely that it would give rise to an outflow of future economic benefits.
Where there is applicable insurance, this would be recognised when its recoverability was virtually certain.
Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas the District Court was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited, The BOC Group, Inc. and The BOC Group plc.
The verdict arose primarily out of an alleged breach of a memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September 2001.
In March 2003, the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and severally liable for a total of US$174 million.
A bond for the full amount was posted with the District Court as part of the normal appeals process.
In August 2004, the appellate court reversed the entire judgement against the BOC entities and all but US$170,000 in reliance damages against Fluorogas Limited.
In addition, the appellate court remanded for reconsideration by the District Court an award of attorneys fees on the US$170,000 recovery.
Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of an English Court.
In January 2005 the parties resolved the outstanding matters to their satisfaction.
The appeal bond was released and Fluorogas Limited applied for, and received, a discharge from the administration order.
Insurance Operational management is responsible for managing business risks.
Several Group departments advise management on different aspects of risk and monitor results.
Insurance cover is held against major catastrophes.
For any such event, the Group will bear an initial cost before external cover begins.
60 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Financial review Inflation Over the last three years, inflation has not had a material impact on the revenue or profit of the Group.
Critical accounting policies The principal accounting policies affecting the results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 91 and 92 of the financial statements.
The application of certain of these policies requires assumptions or subjective judgements by management.
Management bases these on a combination of past experience and any other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstances.
The application of these assumptions and judgements affects the reported amounts of profit during the year and the assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these assumptions and judgements.
Management believes that the following are the critical policies where the assumptions and judgements made could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Tangible fixed assets A significant part of the capital employed of the Group, particularly in the Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products lines of business, is invested in tangible fixed assets.
The nature of the business demands significant capital investment to renew or increase production capacity or to enable the business to achieve greater productivity and efficiency.
It is the Groups policy to depreciate tangible fixed assets, except land, on a straight line basis over the effective lives of the assets.
This ensures that there is an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of production and delivery of goods and services.
A key element of this policy is the estimate of the effective life applied to each category of fixed assets which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge.
In deciding the appropriate lives to be applied, management takes into account various factors including, among other things, the accumulated experience of the effective asset lives from historic business operations and an assessment of the likely impact of any changes in technology.
While Group earnings in any period would fluctuate if different asset lives were applied, in some cases the original estimated life of an asset is closely related to contractual arrangements with large customers.
Some of the earnings impact of choosing a different asset life would be mitigated, as the different life may reflect different contractual arrangements with such customers.
Nevertheless, variations in the effective lives could impact the earnings of the business through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge.
It is estimated that a change of one year in the effective life of all plant, machinery, vehicles and cylinders would have an impact of between 15 million and 20 million on annual Group operating profit.
A change in the effective life of buildings would have only a negligible impact.
Intangible fixed assets In a similar manner to tangible fixed assets, management uses its judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
It is the Groups policy to amortise goodwill on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
This takes into account, among other things, the maturity of the business acquired and its product and customer base.
Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one year in the useful economic life of all goodwill would have an impact of approximately 1 million on annual Group operating profit.
Retirement benefits Results of the Group include costs relating to the provision of retirement benefits for employees.
It is the directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
The assumptions are based on actual historical experience and are set after consultation with the Groups actuaries.
They include the assumptions used for regular service costs and for the financing elements related to the pension schemes assets and liabilities.
Whilst management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect both the operating profit and net interest cost of the Group.
There are a number of elements used in the assumptions and these vary for the different countries in which the Group operates.
There may also be an inter-dependency between some of the assumptions, making it potentially misleading to consider any approximate impact on Group results of a change in any one assumption in isolation.
Nevertheless, for the UK and US schemes together, it is estimated that an absolute 0.25 per cent change in the assumptions on rates of inflation, discount rates and return on equities in pension scheme assets would individually result in changes of approximately 6 million, 3 million and 3 million respectively in the total pension cost in annual Group profit before tax.
A similar change in the assumptions on all other schemes would have only a negligible impact.
Environmental provisions In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out environmental clean-ups at former and current production sites.
Many of these obligations will not arise for a number of years, and the costs are difficult to predict accurately.
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide an appropriate amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups, and the amounts, if material, are discounted to present values.
Both the amount of anticipated costs, and the interest rates used to discount such costs, are subjective.
The use of different assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one per cent in the interest rate used to discount such costs would have an impact of approximately 1 million on annual Group profit before tax.
Financial review 61 Current asset provisions In the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing the net realisable value of various elements of working capital principally stocks, work-in-progress and accounts receivable.
Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving stocks, bad or doubtful debts and product warranties.
Actual costs in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences would affect future earnings of the Group.
The provisions are established at levels appropriate to the circumstances within individual Group business units, and not on a Group-wide systematic basis.
It is therefore considered that any estimate of the impact on annual Group operating profit of any change in such provisions may not be meaningful.
Nevertheless, a change of ten per cent in the level of provision for bad and doubtful debts at 30 September 2005 would have an impact of approximately 3 million on annual Group operating profit.
The areas covered by critical accounting policies under UK GAAP do not materially differ from those under US GAAP.
Further details of the differences between UK and US GAAP are given in note 30 to the financial statements.
Accounting The Groups accounting policies are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP.
During the year, the following new UK standards were issued: FRS22 Earnings per share FRS23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS24 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies FRS25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation FRS26 Financial instruments: Measurement FRS27 Life assurance FRS28 Corresponding amounts RS1 Operating and financial review None of these standards are effective for the Group for the financial year ended 30 September 2005.
The accounts for the financial year ended 30 September 2005 have therefore been prepared on an accounting basis consistent with that applied in the financial year ended 30 September 2004.
With effect from 1 October 2005 the Groups accounting policies will be based on International Financial Reporting Standards, as outlined in the following section.
International Financial Reporting Standards In accordance with EU legislation, the Group is required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
Accordingly, IFRS will first apply to the Groups financial statements for the financial year commencing 1 October 2005.
Results for the quarter ending 31 December 2005, which will be announced in February 2006, will be presented on an IFRS basis.
In January 2006 the Group intends to present results for each quarter of the financial year to 30 September 2005 restated on an IFRS basis.
The Group established an IFRS project team in 2003.
This is overseen by a formal steering committee, which includes the Group finance director.
There have been regular reports on progress to the audit committee and executive management board.
A comprehensive training programme has been undertaken covering Group finance personnel worldwide.
The Groups auditors have been kept informed of, and consulted on, the development of the IFRS project and the preparation and implementation of the new Group accounting policies.
The Group is still in the process of finalising the full effects of adopting IFRS but management is confident that all areas have been identified where significant differences will arise between UK GAAP and IFRS.
These areas are set out below.
This is based on the IFRS that are expected to be in effect for the year to 30 September 2006.
However, it is possible that there could be further changes to IFRS and interpretations prior to this date.
The Group has elected to adopt early the amendment to IAS19 as set out below, but does not currently intend to adopt early any other IFRS or interpretations.
The principal differences which management expects to affect the Group are as follows: a Goodwill.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised over a period up to a maximum of 20 years.
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but instead is reviewed for impairment annually.
Under UK GAAP the cost of share options is calculated by reference to their intrinsic value, which means that there is no charge for options granted at the market price.
Under IFRS, the Group will record a charge for the fair value of all share options including Save As You Earn schemes.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the tax rate will be slightly higher under IFRS and the impact will be fully quantified as part of the restated results to be announced in January 2006. d Pensions.
The Group has already adopted FRS 17 under UK GAAP.
The equivalent IFRS is IAS 19 and the Group intends to adopt early the amendment to IAS 19 allowing for immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses in a Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Accordingly, the impact of accounting for pensions under IFRS will be similar, although not identical, to UK GAAP and as a result management does not expect a significant impact on earnings.
There will be a difference in presentation in the balance sheet, and differences relating to the calculation of certain assets and liabilities.
Under UK GAAP, net pension assets or liabilities are shown after deduction of the appropriate deferred tax.
Under IFRS, net pension assets or liabilities are shown before the deduction of any deferred tax, which is then included with other deferred tax items.
62 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Financial review e Foreign exchange.
There are certain differences in the requirements of IAS 21 compared to UK GAAP in respect of functional currencies and in relation to the accounting for foreign exchange on loans between Group companies.
This is an area where there may be increased volatility in the Groups ongoing results on an IFRS basis compared to UK GAAP arising from exchange gains and losses.
The Group will adopt IAS 39 on 1 October 2005 in line with the exemption under IFRS 1.
This standard impacts the accounting for a range of financial instruments and embedded derivatives.
The Group has few financial instruments and they are predominantly related to managing currency and interest rate risk.
The Group has reviewed its financial instruments and has concluded that at present they meet the requirements to enable it to apply hedge accounting.
Embedded derivatives typically arise from escalation clauses in contracts with customers to recover cost increases.
Whilst the impact is not material at 1 October 2005, embedded derivatives may give rise to greater volatility in the Groups earnings arising from marking to market the underlying derivative.
The adoption of IFRS will also result in a number of changes to the presentation of the financial statements including disclosures.
For example, the Groups share of the post-tax profit arising in joint ventures and associates will be shown as one line in the income statement rather than as part of Group turnover, operating profit and interest.
There will be a number of other presentational changes including reclassifications within the balance sheet and a change to the layout of the cash flow statement.
Overall, management believes that the impact of IFRS on earnings and net assets will be broadly neutral subject to the effects of IAS 21 and IAS 39 as noted above.
Cashflows and the underlying economics of the business will not change.
US GAAP The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differs in certain respects from US GAAP.
The US accounting information in note 30 to the financial statements gives a summary of the principal differences between the amounts determined in accordance with the Groups accounting policies based on UK GAAP and amounts determined in accordance with US GAAP, together with the reconciliation of net profit and shareholders funds from a UK GAAP basis to a US GAAP basis and a movement in shareholders funds on a US GAAP basis.
The net income for the year ended 30 September 2005 under US GAAP was 326.7 million 2004: 297.7 million, 2003: 264.3 million, compared with the net profit of 367.0 million in 2005 2004: 264.0 million, 2003: 219.1 million under UK GAAP.
Shareholders funds at 30 September 2005 under US GAAP were 2,122.2 million 2004: 1,920.1 million, compared with 1,942.0 million 2004: 1,675.3 million under UK GAAP.
The difference primarily results from the differing accounting treatment of pensions, goodwill, financial instruments, investments, fixed asset revaluations, deferred tax and variable interest entities.
Related party transactions During the year, interest income of 13.8 million 2004: 7.3 million, 2003: 7.6 million was received from the Cantarell joint venture in Mexico.
During the year, the Group was invoiced 45.9 million in respect of purchases of production plants from Linde BOC Process Plants in the US.
At 30 September 2005, 1.9 million was payable in respect of these invoices.
No material purchases were made in 2004 or 2003.
The Group had no other material related party transactions that might reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the users of these accounts.
Exchange rates The majority of the Groups operations are located outside the UK and operate in currencies other than sterling.
The effects of fluctuations in the relationship between the various currencies are extremely complex and variations in any particular direction may not have a consistent impact on the reported results.
In terms of average rates for the year, in 2005 sterling strengthened against two of the four principal currencies affecting the Group: by three per cent against the US dollar and by two per cent against the Japanese yen.
Sterling weakened by two per cent against the Australian dollar and by three per cent against the South African rand.
In 2004, sterling strengthened against the US dollar and the Japanese yen.
Sterling weakened against the Australian dollar and the South African rand.
In 2003, sterling strengthened against the US dollar and the Japanese yen.
On 12 November 2005, the latest practicable date for 250 inclusion in this report and accounts, the rates of exchange to sterling for the principal currencies were as follows: US dollar 1.74:Australian dollar 2.38: Japanese yen 206.55: South African rand 11.75.
200 The highest and lowest rates of exchange for sterling against the US dollar for the last six months were: 150 May June July August September October 100 High  50 Low  0 01 02 03 04 05 Principal operating companies South African rand The following operating companies principally affect the amount of profit or assets of the Group: The BOC Group Inc. a wholly-owned Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of The BOC Group Inc. 16 a wholly-owned Nevada corporation: 12 BOC Limited, a wholly-owned English company: BOC Limited, a wholly-owned Australian company: 8 Gist Limited, a wholly-owned English company: Japan Air Gases Ltd, a Japanese company, in which the Groups Japanese 99 per cent owned subsidiary holds 4 45 per cent: African Oxygen Limited, a South African company, in which the Groups shareholding is 56 per cent.
0 01 02 03 04 05 Supplier payment policy The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly communicating the terms of payment as part of the commercial arrangements negotiated with suppliers and then paying according to those terms.
In addition the UK-based businesses have committed to the Better Payment Practice Code.
A copy of the code can be obtained from the Department of Trade and Industry, DTI Publications Orderline, Admail 528, London SW1W 8YT.
For UK businesses, of amounts owing to suppliers, trade creditors represents 58 days at 30 September 2005.
Going concern The directors are confident, after having made appropriate enquiries, that both the company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Management believes that its current credit facilities provide sufficient working capital to meet the present requirements of its existing businesses and that the gearing ratio is appropriate given the nature of the Groups activities.
