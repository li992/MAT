The reduction in cash generation is primarily due to the operating losses of the acquired TKT business and the timing of working capital payments and receipts.
Net cash used in investing activities was $853.7 million in the year to December 31, 2005 2004: $54.8 million.
Decreases in current financial assets of $366.7 million along with proceeds of $60.0 million from the redemption by IDB of its subscription receipts and the receipt from IDB of additional proceeds from the sale of the vaccines business of $32.2 million, offset cash paid on the purchase of TKT net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of $1,151.5 million, loans made to IDB of $43.2 million, capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment of $71.9 million and intangible assets of $92.1 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.9 million for the year to December 31, 2005.
This was primarily due to inflows of $37.1 million from the exercise of employee stock options being offset by the dividend payments of $28.5 million in respect of the six months to December 31, 2004 and the six months to June 30, 2005.
The total cash consideration for the acquisition of TKT is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, subject to change as may be required by the appraisal rights process.
As at December 31, 2005, shareholders owning approximately 24.8 million TKT shares had accepted the offer and $916.9 million had been paid to them, $83.9 million was paid in connection with TKT stock options and $170.1 million in connection with convertible notes, outstanding at the date of acquisition.
Following the exercise of appraisal rights by former holders of approximately 11.3 million shares of TKT common stock, the remaining $419.9 million, together with any interest that the Court may award, will be paid to them subject to the appraisal process outlined in Note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
For every $1 increase decrease in the merger consideration applicable to those TKT shareholders who have asserted appraisal rights, the total estimated purchase price would increase decrease by approximately $11.3 million.
As a result of the acquisition of TKT, cash balances have been significantly reduced.
Interest receivable has increased as increases in US interest rates have more than offset the impact of the reduced cash balances.
The average cash balances pre-acquisition and post-acquisition of TKT for 2005 were $1.5 billion and $0.6 billion respectively.

18 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2005 Shire plc 6420 Annual Report 2005. qxd 28 4 06 17:44 Page 19 Financial review Dividend policy An interim dividend for the first half of 2005 of 1.8246 1.0475 pence per ordinary share equivalent to 5.4738 per ADS and 6.7629 Canadian per exchangeable share was paid in October 2005.
The Board has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 4.419 2.5356 pence per ordinary share equivalent to 13.257 per ADS and 15.2217 Canadian per exchangeable share for the six months to December 31, 2005.
This is consistent with Shires stated policy of paying a dividend semi-annually, set in US per share ADS, with the first interim payment in each year being maintained at a consistent level.
Any growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year.
Shire intends to pursue a progressive dividend policy.
As a matter of English law, Shire may pay dividends only out of its distributable profits, which are the accumulated realized profits under generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom including reserves arising from a reduction of share capital, of Shire plc and not the consolidated Group, so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalization, less accumulated realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made.
On November 28, 2005, the High Court of Justice in England and Wales approved a reduction of Shires share capital to take effect on November 29, 2005, when the nominal value of each Shire ordinary share was reduced from 3.50 to 0.05.
This reduction increased the distributable reserves available to Shire to approximately $2.95 billion, which the directors of Shire can utilise for future dividend payments at their discretion.
As a result of this capital reduction, as at December 31, 2005, Shire had distributable profits of $2,946 million.
Future dividend policy will be dependent upon distributable profits, financial condition, the terms of any then existing debt facilities and other relevant factors existing at that time.
