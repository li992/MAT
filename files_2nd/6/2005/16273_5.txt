19 The balance sheet remains strong and the Groups after-tax return on average net assets increased further, to 26.9% PETER FITZWILLIAM, FINANCE DIRECTOR Financial Review REVENUES 2005 2004 Increase Turnover 233.3m 192.7m 21% The 21% turnover increase includes a full year contribution from UK Pallets, which was acquired in July 2003, and an initial contribution from UK Mail, which commenced trading on 10 May 2004.
On a like-for-like basis, growth was 12%.
The overall increase reflects the strategy being pursued by the Group, with relatively modest growth in Express, which operates in a mature market, being complemented by rapid growth in the newer businesses and also from acquisitions.
In the year, turnover growth was 5.4% for Express and at least an underlying 15% for each of International, HomeServe, UK Pallets and Courier.
10.2m 4.4% of turnover was contributed by UK Mail in its first year.
The overall increase in turnover reduced from 23% in the first half to 20% in the second half: the reduction in like-for-like growth excluding UK Mail and UK Pallets was from 13% to 12% respectively.
PROFIT 2005 2004 Increase Operating profit 20.3m 18.7m 9% Adjusted operating profit 20.8m 19.1m 9% Pre-tax profit 20.0m 18.7m 7% Adjusted pre-tax profit 20.5m 19.1m 7% Adjusted operating margins were 8.9% 2004: 9.9%, affected by the small profit in UK Mail on turnover of 10.2m and lower margins in UK Pallets.
On a like-for-like basis excluding UK Mail and UK Pallets, margins were 10.0% 2004: 10.3%.
In both cases, the three fewer working days are estimated to have depressed margins by 0.4%.
Net interest payable amounted to 0.3m 2004: nil, reflecting the impact of the aggregate 11m cost of the acquisitions of BXTech in February 2003 and UK Pallets in July 2003.
Excluding goodwill amortisation of 0.5m 2004: 0.4m 20 EARNINGS 2005 2004 Increase Earnings per share 25.7p 23.8p 8% Adjusted earnings per share 26.6p 24.5p 9% The slightly higher percentage increase in earnings per share than in pre-tax profit reflects an effective tax rate of 31.0% 2004: 32.6%, of which 1.6% was a prior year adjustment.
DIVIDENDS 2005 2004 Increase Dividends per share 19.2p 18.0p 7% Together with the interim dividend per share of 6.4p 2004: 5.95p, proposed dividends per share are 7% higher at 19.2p 2004: 18.0p, covered 1.34x 2004: 1.32x by EPS.
CASH FLOW 2005 2004 Cash inflow from operating activities 21.5m 22.6m Net debt 5.6m 5.6m Net cash inflow from operating activities totalled 21.5m 2004: 22.6m, the small reduction relative to 2004 reflecting primarily increased working capital requirements and an increase in amounts due from franchisees.
Net capital expenditure rose to 6.6m 2004: 5.8m, reflecting principally the roll-out of hand-held scanners and the replacement and expansion of the vehicle fleet.
Capital expenditure in 2006 is expected to increase as a result of the Groups planned investment of 2m in mail sorting equipment.
BALANCE SHEET 2005 2004 Goodwill 9.0m 10.8m Equity shareholders funds 53.5m 49.1m 11% Gearing 10% The balance sheet remains strong and the Groups after-tax return on average net assets increased further, to 26.9% from 26.5%.
Year end net debt was unchanged at 5.6m, representing gearing of 10% 2004: 11%.
At this level, the Group can comfortably accommodate further capital expenditure or small acquisitions without recourse to equity financing.
RISKS The Board regularly considers the principal risks facing the Group and establishes processes to limit their impact without stifling entrepreneurial enterprise.
Overall, since the vast majority of the Groups activities are provided to UK businesses, the fortunes of the Group are linked to the general health of the UK economy.
The Groups exposure is limited by being spread across a wide range of industry sectors, with the most significant being the high tech sector, which generates roughly 20% of Group turnover.
FedEx, the worlds leading express delivery company, accounts for less than 10% of turnover, and no other customer accounts for over 5%.
Operating in the transport and services sector, the Groups principal costs are people and vehicle-related.
Levels of unemployment affect the availability of staff and drivers but the Groups expansion is not expected to be constrained by these factors.
Working hours will increasingly be subject to the European Working Time Directive, which restricts employees weekly hours.
The Group has evaluated the likely impact of this Directive and considers that it will not have a significant impact on its operations.
Fuel costs represent an important cost but significant increases can be passed on to customers via a fuel surcharge mechanism common throughout the industry.
Handling millions of transactions each year, the Group is highly reliant on the availability and smooth running of its operational computer systems.
Any widescale systems failure would cause significant disruption to the business but disaster recovery procedures are well established and regularly tested.
21 EXPOSURE TO FINANCIAL RISK The Group is not significantly exposed to the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates since all income is in sterling and costs denominated in foreign currency represent less than 5% of all expenditure.
The Groups profitability, traditionally strong levels of cash flow and low indebtedness mean that it is not significantly exposed to liquidity risk.
The Groups exposure to interest risk has been reduced by means of an interest rate cap hedging contract.
TREASURY POLICY The treasury function is run prudently, with cash invested in low risk cash deposits.
The Group uses a deposit in euros to hedge the Groups limited exposure to purchases denominated in European currency, and gains and losses on the retranslation of the account offset increases or decreases in the sterling equivalent value of foreign purchases.
At the year end, the balance on this account was 0.6m.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS The Group will be required to prepare its accounts for the year ending 31 March 2006 under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The interim results to 30 September 2005 will be the first reported in line with IFRS.
There are two principal changes which will be required to the Groups accounting policies under IFRS.
These are in relation to the accounting for share-based awards and goodwill amortisation.
The net impact on reported profits is not expected to be significant, nor to have any effect on cashflow.
SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE Business Posts share price performed strongly in the financial year ended 31 March 2005, closing up over 34 per cent at 660p on the previous years close of 490.5p and outperforming the FTSE Support Services sector by 32 per cent.
The shares moved in line with the sector throughout the first quarter of the financial year before registering strong outperformances ahead of the final figures announced on 18 May 2004 and the AGM trading update on 13 July 2004.
The shares continued to outperform the market in subsequent months, leading to Business Posts entry into the FTSE 250 in January 2005.
