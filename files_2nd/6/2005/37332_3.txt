1.1 Operating and Financial Review Operating and Financial Review Introduction Land Securities has had an excellent 12 months, performing well in all areas of the business.
Across the Group there is a sense of real achievement as we deliver a very strong performance from our investment portfolio, build and let our development programme and grow our property outsourcing business.
We have restructured the business to focus on our market-leading positions in retail, London and property outsourcing and improved the debt structure for the Group.
At the same time the commercial property industry as a whole is undergoing a renaissance as Government, investors and the wider public increasingly recognise the role our industry plays in the economic success of the country.
A structural shift in the investment property market, upon which we commented last year, has come a step closer.
We were very pleased with the positive response from Government in respect to the introduction of REITs as outlined in the last Budget statement.
The Group has benefited from a strong investment market, improving central London occupier demand, increasing demand for property outsourcing and from our focus on driving returns from our investment portfolio.
This has resulted in a return on capital of 17.3% 2004: 11.5%, Andrew Macfarlane Francis Salway Group Finance Director Group Chief Executive more than 9% higher than our cost of capital.
Return on equity was 11.3% 2004: 13.4% which improves to 21.3%, if the exceptional charge relating to the debt restructuring is excluded.
Competitive environment and business planning Land Securities operates in the UK primarily within the commercial property markets.

16 Land Securities Annual Report 2005 Land Securities has 5.3bn invested in retail property Bullring, Birmingham Annual Report 2005 17 1.1 Operating and Financial Review continued Investment property has performed very well over the past few years, driven by investor Property equivalent yield vs gilts recognition of its good returns compared to other asset classes.
The macro-economic 14 background which drives the performance of the commercial property investment market 12 remains unchanged.
Interest, inflation and employment rates have remained stable during 10 the year.
This has resulted in a competitive investment market and the yield shift which was 8 evident in 2003 04 continued throughout 2004 05.

However, competition exists in a number of disaggregated forms, examples of which are sale and leaseback transactions with separate facilities management contracts.
The estimated total value of the property outsourcing market is approximately 511bn, of which we believe the addressable market is some 110bn.
We estimate that our current share of this addressable market, including Telereal, is around 3%.
In the London office market, the downturn in the occupational market between 2001 to 2003 can be predominantly attributed to employment factors.
Similarly, its gradual recovery is being driven primarily by a resumption of employment growth allied to a moderating of the amount of new developments starting on-site.
The London office markets have also benefited from some older, surplus office buildings being converted to alternative uses.
We expect these trends to continue, resulting in progressive rental growth for the London office market over the medium-term, but with the recovery lagging in the City owing to higher current vacancy rates.
18 Land Securities Annual Report 2005 1.1 Operating and Financial Review continued Retail property markets in the UK benefit from a highly restrictive planning regime which constricts supply, while demand for accommodation from retailers has been driven in recent years by their desire to operate out of more efficient units, generally larger in size and of regular shape.
These drivers of demand will continue, although the slowing of consumer expenditure will moderate levels of demand from retailers to a degree.
However, so long as disposable incomes remain stable and unemployment is low, we expect the retail property market to be resilient.
The occupational demand for property is driven by the health of the economy and an organisations desire either to grow or contract its operations and we collaborate with our occupiers to ensure that we can assist with their requirements.
We have more than 2,000 occupiers and this diverse base protects us since no single occupier provides more than 2.9% of the Groups gross rental income, with the exception of the Government which now accounts for some 9.2%.
We have, therefore, examined the Governments efficiency review proposals carefully and since then have worked closely with certain Government departments on their plans.
We believe that the review may create further opportunities for our property outsourcing business.
In order to execute our strategy and ensure we achieve our aim of delivering attractive, sustainable returns for shareholders in what can be cyclical markets, we conduct a rigorous business planning process.
We have in place a five-year business plan and balanced scorecards both for the Group and individual business units which are reviewed and updated every six months.
These reviews measure operating as well as financial performance and allow us to refine our plans against the prevailing operating environment, ensuring an allocation of capital which responds to our view of market conditions and opportunities.
Table C Financing strategy and debt restructuring Exceptional Exceptional Before commenting in greater detail on the financial results, we report on our financial strategy Bond debt costs interest m m m and debt restructuring since this is relevant to an understanding of the results.
Table C summarises At 31 03 04 1,800.0 the accounting implications of the transaction.

As a result of the transaction we issued 2.3bn of new bond debt at an average rate of Exceptional costs 5.35% and made a 77.2m balancing cash payment to bondholders who were unable to hold of refinancing 14.8 667.3 the new bonds.
Land Securities Annual Report 2005 19 1.1 Operating and Financial Review continued We implemented this alternative approach to financing the business to improve our operational and financial flexibility and to enhance the position of our noteholders by utilising the credit strength inherent in our investment portfolio.

Dedicated third party funding or loan from Secured Group Other lenders Secured lenders The structure created a security pool the Secured Group which grants our debt investors security over 7.4bn of investment properties at 31 March 2005, representing about 85% of the investment portfolio excluding joint ventures.
About 2.5bn excluding Telereal of the Groups property assets, mainly comprising Land Securities Trillium properties, our joint venture holdings and certain other assets, are outside the Secured Group.
As a result of this structure we have the flexibility to finance these assets separately without impacting upon the credit rating of the debt issued by the Secured Group.
The new debt structure provides significant future flexibility which ensures our ability to buy and sell assets easily and to maintain our development programme.
The secured debt structure has a tiered covenant regime that gives the Group flexibility to run its business, while increasing the protection available to debt holders if gearing rises materially.
While loan to value and interest cover in the Secured Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45 times respectively, we retain substantial operational flexibility.
If these limits are exceeded, operational restrictions increase and would act as an incentive to reduce gearing.
Our loan to value ratio at the year end in the Secured Group was 35.4%, well below the 65% threshold.
In addition to issuing 2.3bn of new notes, a further 77.2m was paid in cash to debt investors who could not accept the new bonds.
The total nominal value of the Groups bond debt has increased by 0.5bn as a result of this transaction.
This compensated debt investors for the reduction in the rate of interest payable on the bonds, which fell from an average of 8.5% to 5.35% on exchange.
The increase in the face value of the Groups debt, together with the additional cash payments to non-eligible holders and the costs of the transaction, has resulted in a significant 682.1m exceptional accounting charge incurred during the second half of the year, including 42.0m of costs incurred to close out our interest rate hedge portfolio see Hedging below.
A further 12.7m of transaction costs will be deferred and amortised over the life of the underlying debt.
20 Land Securities Annual Report 2005 Land Securities has 3.6bn invested in London offices 30 Gresham Street, EC2 Annual Report 2005 21 1.1 Operating and Financial Review continued With the exception of transaction costs, incentive payments to noteholders and swap cancellation costs the exceptional charge is not a 2004 05 cash outflow and has had no impact on the dividend policy.
Most of this exceptional loss is fully allowable for tax.
A 25m annual initial reduction in interest payments on bond debt and immediate savings in tax more than offset the cost of the transaction and the net present value of the higher amounts payable on the ultimate maturity of the bonds.
Although reported as an exceptional loss, the transaction is value creative and earnings enhancing.
In addition, the Group now has lower future cost of financing on new debt raised.
As part of the debt restructuring, we also renewed our bank facilities.
At 31 March 2004, the Group had 1.55bn of committed bank facilities which would have expired in the normal course in 2005 and 2006.
We have replaced these facilities with a new 2.0bn committed five-year facility which is available to the secured group.
Profits As a result of the factors explained in Financing Strategy and Debt Restructuring, the Group incurred a loss of 155.8m before tax for the year to 31 March 2005 2004: profit 373.1m.
Excluding the refinancing charge, profits before tax were 526.3m, a 41.1% increase on 2004.
Revenue profit, which we use as the measure of the underlying profitability of the Group, was 401.1m, 29.7% higher than last year.

As part of our review of the Groups financing arrangements we also revisited the appropriateness of this hedging strategy.
We concluded that with property and interest rate cycles typically of four to seven years duration it would usually be unnecessary to hedge beyond this timeframe.
We have set a target for the Group to have approximately 80% of planned debt for this period at fixed Table G Gearing rates of interest and 20% floating, although we may choose to fix a higher percentage of this 31 03 05 31 03 04 % % debt, depending upon our view of short-term ie one to two year interest rates.

International Financial Reporting Standards International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS will first apply to the Land Securities Group for the year to 31 March 2006 and will be adopted when we report our interim results for the period to 30 September 2005.
We are well advanced with our preparations for IFRS and in late June we will re-present an extract of the results for the year to 31 March 2005 under IFRS, with reconciliations to current GAAP.
The main effects of IFRS for Land Securities will be: Recognition of investment property revaluation surpluses and deficits in the income statement and the associated deferred tax liability in the tax charge and balance sheet A change in the accounting treatment for the debt restructuring, which will result in the reinstatement of the nominal value of our old debt on the balance sheet and the amortisation up to the new, higher redemption amounts of the new debt over the life of the bonds.
The amortisation charge will be treated as additional non-cash interest in the profit and loss account.
The effect will be to under-report the Groups actual liabilities on the face of the balance sheet.
The interest charge in the income statement will exceed the actual cash interest that we will pay Our interest rate hedge portfolio may not meet the strict requirements for hedge accounting under IAS39.
Therefore, we may be required to revalue certain hedges each time we report and account for the cost or profit that would arise were the hedges to be terminated The potential that a small number of leases will need to be classified as finance leases and accounted for as such Dividends will be recognised effectively when paid, rather than when proposed.
We held a presentation on IFRS in February 2005, which is available on our website www.
The IFRS presentation to be held in June will also be available on our website as soon as it has taken place.
We will be modifying our usual definitions of adjusted earnings per share and net asset value per share to deal with some of the distortions introduced by IFRS.
Pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
These schemes are closed to new members.
At 31 March 2005 the schemes had a combined deficit, net of deferred tax, on an FRS17 basis of 7.6m 2004: 12.0m.
During the year the Group made a further special contribution of 10.0m to its principal defined benefit pension scheme and is maintaining an enhanced contribution rate to address the small deficit.

2 Development programme including Kent Thameside.
The development programme comprises projects which are completed but less than 95% let, developments on site, committed developments approved projects with the building contract let : and authorised developments projects approved by the Board, but for which the building contract has not yet been let.
The like-for-like investment portfolio showed a 9.5% increase in value over the period with the strongest growth from retail warehousing at 16.6%, shopping centres and shops at 9.9% and offices at 5.8%.
This uplift takes account of the negative effect of the abolition of disadvantaged area Stamp Duty relief of 60.3m in the like-for-like portfolio following the recent Budget changes.
This increase in value was achieved as a result of both rental growth in many sectors combined with yield compression.
After adjusting for units materially altered during the year, rental values for retail warehousing have grown at 6.7%, shopping centres and shops at 2.2% and London offices at 2.6% producing a total rental growth for the like-for-like portfolio of 3.3%.
The average equivalent yield for the whole like-for-like portfolio is now 6.0%.
In terms of the net reversionary potential of our like-for-like portfolio, the over-rented element of our London offices has reduced as rental growth begins to feed through, helping to increase the overall net reversionary potential for the like-for-like portfolio to 2.9%.
Void levels across the like-for-like portfolio were 3.0% at the year end, compared with 1.9% at the start of the year.
The mean weighted unexpired lease term for the like-for-like portfolio is 9.0 years 2004: 11.0 years assuming all lease breaks occur.
