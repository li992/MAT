The total consideration was 4 million.
The total consideration can increase by up to a further 0.5 million to the extent that the net assets at completion of Intruder exceed 0.95 million.
The final consideration will be confirmed in our Interim Report for the period ending 30 September 2005.
In the year to 31 October 2004, Intruders turnover was 4.31 million, pre-tax profits were 0.45 million and net assets were 0.94 million as at 31 October 2004.

Over the last five years this has fallen from 4.6% of turnover to 1.3% in the current year.
This clearly reflects the Groups stated objective to move away from capital-intensive businesses.
Generation, which was disposed of earlier in the year, was the final step in achieving this objective.
This policy allows us to reduce the amount of capital tied up in long-term projects and to direct funds to other areas which generate greater shareholder value.
Going concern The Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
