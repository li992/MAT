2005 was a strong year for Venture demonstrating the benefits of the capital investment over the previous two years, which resulted in record production, cashflow and profits.
Unit lifting costs see Glossary have fallen by 27% with increased production and reserves.
This increase in reserves has been from further acquisitions and field development programmes, which has led to a replacement ratio of over 400%.
In parallel with this, 2005 has seen the biggest change in accounting regulations since the introduction of UK GAAP with the first time implementation of IFRS.
Revenue of 164.1 million for the twelve months ended 31 December 2005 2004: 81.5 million was 101% higher than that achieved in the same period in 2004.
This reflects a 77% increase in production to 29,864 boepd 2004: 16,832 boepd and the benefit of higher commodity prices.
The operating profit of 73.5 million was depressed by 9.5 million due to the adoption of IFRS, offset by lower unit lifting costs.
On a like-for-like basis an underlying operating profit of 83.0 million was generated in 2005 2004: 23.1 million with an underlying fully-diluted earnings per share EPS of 36.1 pence 2004: loss 5.0 pence.
Profit before tax of 55.9 million 2004: loss 0.3 million was further depressed by a 6.5 million mark to market hedging cost as a result of IAS 39, giving an underlying profit before tax of 71.9 million.
No adjustment in respect of IFRS has any cash impact.
Operating cashflow for 2005 was 77.7 million 2004: 44.1 million, an increase of 76%.
The adoption of IFRS has a material impact on both the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.
For this reason, there are two sections of commentary.
Firstly, a commentary on the underlying profit performance and secondly, a section explaining the impact of IFRS on those results.
Underlying Profit Performance Key Statistics per boe 2005 2004 Increase decrease Effective realised price 17.35 14.36 2.99 Unit Lifting costs 4.80 6.59 1.79 Depreciation, depletion and amortisation 3.71 2.33 1.38 Administration expenses excluding currency exchange variances 0.45 0.45 VENTURE PRODUCTION PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 19 FINANCIAL REVIEW 2005 was a successful year for Venture with underlying operating profit increasing to 83.0 million 2004: 5.0 million.
Venture achieved an average realised price of 17.35 boe, an increase of 22% over 2004, reflecting the higher commodity prices offset by the production volumes hedged at prices below market levels.
Full benefit from the higher commodity prices was restricted by two incidents.
Firstly, the loss of Trees production due to the Brae riser leak until 4 February and secondly, 14 days lost gas production from A Fields due to a shutdown of LOGGS.
An insurance claim of 10 million was received relating to the Brae Riser incident, of which 6.5 million was for lost revenue and 3.5 million was for costs.
Gas accounted for 64% of production and 68% of revenues, whilst oil represented 36% of production and 32% of revenues.
The increased proportion of gas reflects the contribution of the Annabel project, Saturn coming on stream and the loss of production from Trees.
As a result of increased production volumes across Ventures three production hubs, unit lifting costs have decreased by 27% from 6.59 boe to 4.80 boe.
This is in line with expectations and demonstrates the benefit of increased production volumes through the fixed cost infrastructure.
The unit rate for depreciation, depletion and amortisation DD&A has increased from 2.33 boe in 2004 to 3.71 boe in 2005.
This reflects the cost of acquiring and developing Ventures asset portfolio.
Underlying gross profit increased by 80.3 million to 82.2 million 2004: 1.9 million.
Gross profit for 2004 included a non-cash impairment of the Companys Trinidadian assets of 18.1 million following the strategic decision to withdraw from operations in that country.
Administration expenses excluding IFRS adjustments for the year were 4.9 million 2004: 2.8 million.
On a unit basis, administration expenses of 0.45 boe remained at the same level as 2004.
Other operating income includes a receipt of 6.5 million in settlement of the business interruption element of the insurance claim for the Brae incident.
Finance expense for the period totalled 12.6 million 2004: 5.8 million, an increase of 6.8 million.
The increase in bank interest reflects the higher utilisation of the bank facility, from borrowings of 64.5 million at 31 December 2004 to 172.7 million at 31 December 2005.
Asset acquisitions and the capital development program have driven this increase in borrowings.
The 2005 charge also includes 1.5 million for the write off of bank facility fees relating to the previous financing that had been capitalized.
Non-cash finance expense on future decommissioning liabilities has increased by 0.9 million to a total of 3.8 million, following Gadwall and Annabel fields coming on stream.
These increases have been partially offset by a 3.1 million credit derived from the capitalisation of interest on development projects.
The effective tax rate for 2005 was 44% compared with 96% in 2004, and is deferred as a result of Ventures tax position.
The deferred tax liability in the Balance Sheet is 46.9 million 2004: 39.5 million.
Due to brought forward losses, Venture is currently not in a tax paying position, although tax payments are expected to commence during 2007.
On 19 December 2005 the sale of the Trinidadian operation was completed.
The total consideration of 18.0 million comprised 7.6 million in cash, convertible loan notes totalling 5.8 million and share capital of 4.6 million.
The gain on disposal of 0.4 million was in line with expectation following the impairment in 2004.
Underlying Profit after tax was 40.0 million compared with 12.6 million for 2004 excluding the Trinidad impairment, an increase of 217%.
Impact of IFRS There are a number of new Accounting Standards applicable to these statements, which Venture has reviewed fully.
Of these, there are three standards that have a major bearing on these annual accounts.
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 39 Financial instruments 20 VENTURE PRODUCTION PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 FINANCIAL REVIEW Summarised Analysis of IFRS Adjustments to the Income Statement: Year Ended Year Ended 31 Dec 2005 31 Dec 2004 million million Pre tax Post tax Pre tax Post tax Cost of Sales IAS12 3.8 1.6 Administration Expenses IFRS 2 5.7 4.9 1.6 1.4 Change in Fair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments IAS 39 6.5 4.0 Total IFRS Adjustment to Profit 16.0 8.9 3.2 1.4 Summarised Analysis of IFRS Adjustments on the Balance Sheet: As at As at 31 Dec 2005 31 Dec 2004 million million Property, plant and equipment IAS 12 18.0 20.5 Provisions IFRS 2 3.7 1.1 Deferred tax asset liabilities All 2.8 19.1 Derivative financial instruments IAS 39 43.0 Adjustment to Net Assets 25.9 0.3 Note: Detailed reconciliations relating to 2004 are included in Note 35 of Notes to the Annual Accounts.
IAS 12 establishes principles for accounting for current and deferred income taxes.
IAS 12 requires deferred taxation to be calculated by reference to temporary differences, which are determined by reference to the tax base of an asset relative to its carrying amount in the financial statements.
Under the requirements of IAS 12, Venture has recorded deferred tax liabilities to reflect temporary differences related to certain of its previous acquisitions.
As a result, the fair values of these assets have been restated in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations to record the tax gross-up.
On the Balance Sheet, the increase to property, plant and equipment of 18.0 million is offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities.
In the Income Statement the increase in the charge for depreciation of 3.8 million is offset by an equal and opposite tax credit producing no net effect on profit after tax.
There is no cash impact in the period.
IFRS 2 requires all share-based transactions to be fair valued and a charge made to the Income Statement to reflect the future cost of their provision.
Venture has a number of share-based compensation schemes and in this period their collective impact is to reduce profit after tax by 4.9 million.
In the Balance Sheet, under shareholders equity, a reserve is established to recognise the equity component of the transaction.
Any component of the transaction that may be cash settled is included in accruals, offset by a deferred tax asset.
IFRS 2 does not reflect any cash impact in the period.
IAS 39 is a broad standard that has been the subject of much comment and interpretation, both before and after the Interim Results.
It applies to most commodity price, foreign currency and interest hedging contracts.
The detailed accounting rules and subsequent treatment is complex and is not covered here.
In summary, the rules revolve around the effectiveness of a hedge, determined by various indices.
If a hedge can be shown to be effective, hedge accounting can be applied and only the Balance Sheet is impacted until the hedge unwinds and is matched against the hedged item on the Income Statement.
However if a hedge cannot be shown to be effective, hedge accounting cannot be used and the contracts have to be marked to market at the end of each reporting period, with any resultant profit or loss over the remaining period of the contract being charged immediately to the Income Statement.
This treatment can create extreme volatility in charges against profits.
VENTURE PRODUCTION PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 21 FINANCIAL REVIEW All of Ventures oil and gas hedges meet the rules that allow their values to be reflected in the Balance Sheet i. e. to use hedge accounting.
However, when reporting our Interim Results our gas hedges were treated as ineffective, reporting a mark to market charge of 12.6 million in the Income Statement.
Although information is now available for these hedges to be classified as effective for accounting purposes, to ensure consistency of treatment, we have continued to show it as mark to market in the Income Statement with a reduced charge of 6.5 million as the hedged volumes have substantially unwound for the year to 31 December.
In reality, the product is sold at market price and the mark to market charge will be recovered through the revenue line in future periods.
The gas hedges that have been marked to market all expired by 31 March 2006.
We anticipate that all current and future hedges will meet to the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
Ventures Balance Sheet demonstrates the potentially adverse effect of the implementation of IAS 39 on the net assets of a business.
The Standard requires net assets to include the cumulative notional cost calculated at 31 December 2005, of terminating all hedges at that date.
In Ventures case an amount of 43.0 million is shown as a liability, which is partly offset by a deferred tax asset.
The other side of this entry is the creation of a negative cashflow reserve.
As the gas is produced and sold, the value achieved will be reported in the normal way through the revenue line.
The Balance Sheet entries under IAS 39 may continue to vary with commodity price movements, introducing a degree of volatility to the accounts.
The material effects of the first adoption of IFRS are covered above.
As they will now form an integral element of financial reporting, there will be no separate identification of these items in the financial commentary unless they are material.
Balance Sheet Venture had fixed tangible assets of 441.4 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 283.4 million, reflecting asset acquisitions and continuing field development expenditures during the last twelve months.
Investment in associates of 5.5 million and loan notes of 5.8 million reflects our investment in Ten Degrees North Energy Limited, the local Trinidadian company to which we sold our Trinidad assets.
The Balance Sheet shows a movement in net current liabilities from 6.8 million at 31 December 2004 to 5.7 million at 31 December 2005, reflecting the derivative financial instruments liability of 43.0 million required by IAS 39.
This liability relates to hedges of future cashflows that will be generated during 2006 and from which the liability will be met.
Crude oil stock held at year-end totalled 94,967 bbls.
The increase in debtors and creditors reflects the growth in the business and the change from a crude oil overlift to an underlift position.
The debtors outstanding at year-end reflect the high level of production during the last quarter of the year.
Cashflow Net cashflow from operating activities increased by 76% to 77.7 million 2004: 44.1 million.
Internally generated funds financed approximately 37% of the Companys 207.9 million capital investment 2004: 99.4 million.
During the year Venture expended 16.6 million in acquiring additional interests in existing and other license areas, including the Ensign package.
A further 191 million was invested in developing assets, principally A Fields 78.4 million, GKA Area 34.6 million and Saturn 22.5 million.
A new banking facility with Royal Bank of Scotland was concluded in July 2005 and successfully syndicated in November.
Due to the level of interest the syndication was over-subscribed and the facility was increased to a total of 370 million.
In July 2005 29 million was raised through the successful private placing of convertible bonds.
During the year, 1.7 million was received from the issue of 1,849,965 shares in respect of share options exercised by employees.
Hedging Policy Venture has a Hedging Policy that covers interest rates, foreign exchange and commodity price hedging.
Normally and where appropriate, the Company may hedge up to 50% of proven un-contracted production to protect cashflows against commodity price and exchange rate fluctuation to ensure the availability of funds to meet the capital expenditure requirements of the development programme.
In exceptional circumstances, and only with the prior approval of the Board, up to 75% of such production may be hedged.
As far as possible, it is Ventures intention to meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 such that the accounting impact of hedges is restricted to the Balance Sheet, thus minimising the volatility in the Income Statement that can be created by marking to market.
In future, in common with all companies that have hedge contracts in place, the Balance Sheet will continue to carry a large cashflow reserve representing the cost benefit of open hedging transactions in place at the Balance Sheet date.
22 VENTURE PRODUCTION PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 FINANCIAL REVIEW In late 2003 and early 2004, in keeping with its long-term hedging strategy, Venture put in place oil and gas price hedges from 2004 until the end of 2006.
This was done in order to make financial commitments to ensure the delivery of the Companys 2004 5 development programme.
The Board remains convinced that the decision to implement this hedging was correct and as a direct result Venture is seeing the benefits of this in terms of increased production volumes from new development projects coming onstream in 2004 5.
These oil hedges, at significantly below current market prices, expire during 2006.
Hedges are in place with a variety of counterparties, details of which are summarised in the following tables: Swaps Oil Gas Volume Price Volume Price Period bbl $ bbl therms p therm 2005 January March 819,000 29.75 22,833,000 27.14 April June 838,599 29.29 23,086,700 22.47 July September 784,000 29.35 23,809,600 18.67 October December 784,000 29.18 19,320,000 28.85 2006 January March 440,751 25.55 12,390,000 28.85 April June 453,098 25.37 July September 359,101 25.27 October December 359,101 25.16 Put and Call Options Put Options Purchased Call Options Sold Volume Price Volume Price Period bbl $ bbl bbl $ bbl Oil 1 2007 1,095,000 48.33 1,095,000 80.13 Forward Sales Gas Volume Price Period therms p therm 2005 January March 5,112,000 35.55 April June July September October December 9,786,904 59.69 2 2006 31,308,418 53.96 1 Weighted average price $ bbl 2 Weighted average price p therm Summary 2005 has been an excellent year for Venture, with the Company meeting market expectations.
This has been accomplished due to three main factors.
Firstly, increased production volumes have generated stronger cashflows and profitability.
Secondly, with strong commodity prices and with a greater proportion of unhedged production, the Company has been able to deliver more of the revenues achieved to profit and cashflow.
Finally, lower unit lifting costs have generated greater cashflow per unit of production.
All of these factors should continue to drive profitability during 2006.
