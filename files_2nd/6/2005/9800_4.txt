"One direct output of this exercise was the establishment of Strategic Key Performance Indicators ""KPIs"", which are set out in the Operating and Financial Review."
This will enable your Board to monitor progress against key strategic objectives.
In pursuit of our growth objective we made a small acquisition: Paver Systems in Scotland and we also purchased the property assets of Stoke Hall Quarry in Derbyshire.
Our objective is to increase the flow of suitable acquisition candidates.
After accounting for all of these investment activities we ended the year with conservative balance sheet gearing, which is appropriate to our forward investment plans and the somewhat uncertain outlook in 2006, when we expect trading conditions to be at least as difficult as 2005.
Finally, it remains only for me to thank all of our stakeholders: customers, suppliers, but especially our employees for their support and excellent work throughout a challenging year.
