Financial review The following section provides the financial review for 2005.
Operating profit before impairments Operating profit before impairments was 488.8m 423.4m, an increase of 65.4m or 15.4%.
This consists of the operating profit before impairments for each of the six divisions as described in the operating review, which totalled 520.3m 446.1m, less central expenses of 31.5m 22.7m.
The increase in central expenses of 8.8m includes 4.4m relating to a bodily injury claim in the USA, which is self-insured centrally by the company.
Operating impairments Operating impairments in the period were 4.0m compared with 29.3m in the previous year.
The net charge for the year consists of 23.6m of impairment charges, offset by a reversal of 19.6m.
The charges relate primarily to the US and UK aggregates divisions.
The reversal follows an economic improvement in the supply arrangements at certain operations in the US aggregates division and additional disposal proceeds at certain UK aggregates sites.
Exchange impact Foreign exchange translation increased group turnover by 35.2m, operating profit before impairments by 6.4m and profit before tax by 6.0m.
The US dollar year end exchange rate moved from $1.9199 at December 31, 2004 to $1.7168 at December 31, 2005.
The net impact of foreign exchange movements resulted in an increase in sterling translated net debt from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 of 95.7m.

Interest payable on loans totalled 119.0m 92.2m against interest receivable of 60.1m 40.0m, resulting in a net interest cost of 58.9m 52.2m.
The main reason for the increase in the net interest charge was an increased level of net debt following the acquisitions made in 2005.
Interest cost on the pension plan liabilities and other post-retirement benefits was 103.2m 99.2m, offset by an expected return on pension assets of 108.7m 111.2m, to give a net pension finance income of 5.5m 12.0m.
The reduction in income resulted primarily from a reduction in interest rates.
The unwind of the discounting relating to long-term provisions was a charge of 2.5m 6.6m, and included the impact of a change in discount rates.
Taxation on continuing operations Taxation on continuing operations was 34.4m 27.1m.
The 2005 charge consisted of an underlying tax charge, excluding the tax relating to joint-ventures and associates, of 58.4m, a net release from provisions of 29.6m and a charge of 5.6m relating to impairments.
The 2004 tax charge has been restated by 49.6m following a change in the interpretation of the deferred tax accounting requirements under IFRS.
The restatement resulted in a charge of 27.1m for 2004, which consists of an underlying tax charge, excluding the tax relating to joint-ventures and associates, of 55.1m, one-off deferred tax credit after restatement of 21.7m and a tax credit on impairments of 6.3m.
The underlying tax charge of 58.4m 55.1m was equivalent to an underlying effective tax rate of 14.9% 15.6% on the profit before tax and impairments, excluding joint-ventures and associates, of 392.8m 353.4m.
The net provision release in 2005 of 29.6m resulted from the successful resolution of a number of issues with the relevant tax authorities.
Discontinued operations Current year loss after taxation of discontinued operations was 7.3m 56.0m.
The profit after tax earned by operations in 2005 prior to their disposal was 2.8m.
Hanson Aggregates North America sold its 50% interest in the joint-venture Campbell Concrete and Materials, a ready-mixed concrete business operating in Houston, Texas on June 17.
Hanson Continental Europe disposed of 19 ready-mixed concrete sites on May 13, and has subsequently restructured its Spanish operations.
Seagoe, a drainage business based in Northern Ireland, was included in discontinued as a disposal group held for sale.
Seagoe was sold in January 2006.
The profit after tax arising from the sale of the above operations was 2.3m.
A loss after tax of 12.4m 50.0m resulted from operations that were discontinued prior to 2004.
The main item in this category was an asbestos charge of 22.4m 79.7m before tax and 13.7m 40.6m after tax.
Asbestos Various of the Companys US subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits alleging bodily injury due to exposure to asbestos-containing products before 1984.
New claimants were 10,350 for 2005 compared with the 18,700 new claimants received in 2004.
At the end of 2005, outstanding claimants totalled approximately 131,350 135,750.
Of the 14,750 7,150 claimants whose cases were resolved during 2005, over 90% were dismissed without payment.
In the USA, claimants can often file claims without illness or product identification.
In the absence to date of federal reform, a number of states have introduced reform measures.
Although outstanding claimants decreased at the end of 2005 compared to 2004, this does not mean we believe this is the start of a downward trend in the number of claimants.
Financial review Continuing operations 38 The gross cost of resolving asbestos claims in 2005 was $43.2m $59.3m including legal fees of $26.3m $27.4m.
The net cost of asbestos for the year after insurance was $31.7m $12.8m.
The Companys approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against these US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable and reliably estimable.
The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
At present, based on detailed analysis and the assumptions referred to in note 21 of the Notes to the accounts, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to approximately eight years of gross cost assuming annual gross costs of $60.0m.
The full year increase in the provision for future asbestos costs was $60.0m $222.5m, taking the gross provision to $496.8m $480.0m before the impact of discounting, which has reduced the provision to $398.6m $401.2m, or 232.2m 209.0m.
Offsetting this is approximately $14.6m $26.1m of remaining insurance cover at December 31, 2005.
The insurance settlement reached in February 2006 and detailed in note 31 of the Notes to the accounts will result in an additional insurance asset of approximately $60m being recognised on January 1, 2006.
In addition to this settlement, we will continue to use a combination of litigation and negotiation to maximise further insurance cover.
The net cost of resolution is allowable for US tax at a rate of 39%.
Following the recent insurance settlement, the estimated net cost of approximately $48.0m is equivalent to approximately $29.0m post-tax, or 16.0m, 3.4% of net cash inflow from operating activities of 471.2m 507.5m.
Dividends The 2005 interim dividend paid and final dividend recommended total 20.0p 18.15p, an increase of 10.2% on 2004.
The sustained increase in our dividend payout reflects our confidence in the underlying strength of the group and its ability to generate strong cash flows.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share in 2005 were 53.2p 36.0p, up 47.8% on last year.
EPS on continuing operations before impairments were 55.5p 46.7p, up 18.8% on last year.

This includes 10.6m 4.3m paid for asbestos costs, net of insurance.
Taxation paid was 54.1m 18.3m compared to the tax charge of 34.4m 27.1m.
The increase in tax payment results from increased earnings and reduced first year capital allowances in the USA.
Net interest paid was 64.3m 53.2m compared to a net finance cost of 55.5m 46.8m.
Capital expenditure Capital expenditure for the purchase of property, reserves, new and replacement plant and equipment during the year totalled 196.1m 201.1m of which 191.8m 198.6m was paid in 2005.
This represented 122.0% of continuing depreciation.
Over half of this amount has been spent in North America.
A further 123.1m of capital expenditure had been committed as at December 31, 2005 primarily for new building products plants in the USA.
These capital expenditures are expected to be financed out of group cash flows and bank facilities.
The group continues to identify and invest in projects which are intended to reduce operating costs and expand and enhance the performance of our divisions.

On January 4, 2005, Hanson Building Products UK acquired the assets of UK brick manufacturer Marshalls Clay Products for 64.7m and Thermalite, a market leader in aircrete blocks, on March 7 for 124.2m.
On June 17, Hanson Aggregates North America acquired the assets of Mission Valley Rock, Berkeley Ready Mix and Berkeley Asphalt, and Hanson Building Products North America acquired the assets of Sherman Pipe, a concrete pipe and precast concrete products business for a total of 108.0m.
Other acquisitions made in the year consisted of three quarries in Southern Indiana by Hanson Aggregates North America in December, and a further six acquisitions totalling 46.0m.
Capital structure and share buyback programme The capital structure of the group takes account of the needs of our equity shareholders to maximise return on equity whilst recognising that to do so requires access to the debt capital markets.
Our debt ratings are carefully managed and we maintain an inclusive relationship with the major rating agencies to ensure consistent ratings over the medium-term.
Key credit ratios are closely monitored and reviewed as part of our planning process.
The group continually reviews its level of debt and equity.
Following a four year period of debt reduction, Hanson commenced an on-market share buyback programme during October 2004.
During the year ended December 31, 2005 8,335,000 shares were bought back and held as treasury shares for 46.7m, of which 45.1m was paid in 2005.
At December 31, 2005 there were 14,685,000 ordinary shares in issue which are held in treasury.
The share buyback programme is a rolling return of that capital which we believe is in excess of our medium-term requirements and which is reviewed on a continuing basis in the context of our cash flow, capital expenditure and acquisition plans.
Financial review Continuing operations 40 Net debt At the end of 2005, the groups net debt of 989.6m 695.2m was represented by borrowings of 2,072.6m 2,089.5m, offset by cash of 1,083.0m 1,394.3m.
The maturity profile of the groups cash and debt, excluding undrawn balances on committed bank facilities, is set out in the table below.
The table below shows the effect on US dollar denominated profits and net debt of a 10% fall in the US dollar.
In US dollars only Total for 2005 m 10% fall m Operating profit before impairments 232.5 21.1 Net debt and foreign exchange 1,090.1 99.1 For further details, see note 29 of the Notes to the accounts.
Balance sheet and provisions Total equity is 2,672.3m 2,411.0m at December 31, 2005.
The transfer to reserves from the income statement was 387.6m less amounts for dividends paid of 136.2m.
The effect of currency movements increased total equity by 56.8m.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits During 2005 Hanson, together with the relevant trustees, continued to monitor the funding and asset allocation policies of the main UK and US defined benefit plans.
The group has adopted a funding policy that targets the accrued benefit obligation, which is higher than applicable statutory minimum funding levels in each country.
Total contributions by the group for its pension and other post retirement obligations were 68.1m, principally in the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia.
As at December 31, 2005, the net liability in relation to defined benefit pension plans was 20.8m 48.5m and the net liability relating to post-employment medical benefits was 103.3m 80.4m.
Over recent years, movements in market value apart, the groups defined benefit plans have generally moved toward asset allocations with lower levels of risk.
At the end of 2005, 58.3% 53.7% of defined benefit plan assets were in bonds, property and cash.
Details of contributions to the pension plans, market value of assets and amounts recognised in the balance sheet can be found in note 28 of the Notes to the accounts.
Off balance sheet arrangements The groups off balance sheet arrangements consist of the following, as referred to in the Notes to the accounts: operating leases notes 3 and 27 commitments to capital expenditure note 13 guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds note 26 Other than as disclosed, there are no off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.

Due to the nature of the groups trading activities there are no significant purchase obligations.

In carrying out this role, the Risk Committee reviews audit reports, risk assessment returns, including those for Turnbull, as well as regular management reports.
Funding, liquidity and treasury management The groups financial risk policy identifies risks and sets out a control framework for managing exposures.
This policy is approved by the Board and covers interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risks.
It also sets out policies for funding and liquidity management.
The Risk Committee has delegated authority from the Board to monitor and review these policies, approve the adoption of new instruments in accordance with group policies and approve any changes to policy implementation.
Operating within the strict controls of these policies, the Treasury department manages these financial risks, ensuring in particular that sufficient funding and liquidity is available to meet the expected needs of the group.
In addition to the high level of free cash flow of the group, Hanson operates a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt together with short-term cash and investments.
Our core funding is provided by two US bond issues, each of $750m, maturing in September 2010 and March 2013, respectively.
A third US bond of $750m matured in September 2005.
The group also has substantial committed bank facilities which total 947.7m, the principal components of which are a new 500m facility expiring in 2010 and a $475m facility expiring in 2009.
The new 500m facility replaced a five year 519.2m facility due to expire in March 2006.
At the balance sheet date, 244.2m of committed bank facilities were utilised by way of letters of credit and cash drawings.
The level of unused facilities, together with other resources available to the group, is such that we believe that we have sufficient funding to satisfy our working capital requirements in the near to medium-term.
Committed bank facilities m Expiring Remaining 2005 947.7 2006 85.5 862.2 2007 85.5 776.7 2008 776.7 2009 276.7 500.0 2010 500.0 Group credit facilities contain a financial covenant broadly consistent with, but less restrictive than, the groups interest cover target.
The group does not, therefore, anticipate that this covenant will restrict funding or investment strategies in the foreseeable future.
Financial review 42 Credit risk The Boards policy is that credit risk for financial transactions should be restricted to counterparties with a minimum AA3 credit rating for long-term transactions and F2 P-2 A2 for short-term transactions.
In addition, there are individual counterparty and country limits for cash and short-term investments.
Hansons credit ratings, which are a key determinant of the terms on which the group can issue debt, were unchanged during the year as shown below: Short-term Remaining Fitch F2 BBB Moodys P-2 Baa1 Standard & Poors A2 BBB Interest rate risk The groups policy for interest rate risk is designed to limit the groups exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
This is achieved by limiting the level of floating interest rate exposure to a maximum determined by both the level of debt and the level of operating profit of the group at any point in time.
This approach, which is consistent with our target for ongoing leverage, will mean, other things being equal, that for any given level of debt, a higher level of operating profit will result in a higher limit on the level of floating rate debt in the group and vice versa.
Consistent with this policy, at December 31, 2005, the group held 56% 77% of net debt at fixed rates.
For further details, see note 29 of the Notes to the accounts.
Foreign exchange risk Due to the nature of our products, which are generally uneconomic to transport long distances, there are few foreign exchange transaction exposures in the course of our day-to-day business.
However, the majority 67% of our capital employed is in overseas locations and is denominated in foreign currencies, principally US dollars 42%.
As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both reported profit and asset values.
The exposure of asset values to foreign exchange rates is controlled to an extent by matching a proportion of currency assets with currency liabilities, using both debt and foreign exchange contracts.
This means that falling overseas exchange rates will give rise to both falling asset values and lower levels of net debt in sterling terms.
The interest cost of currency liabilities also provides a partial hedge for foreign currency income.
Critical accounting policies The following section explains where, in these financial statements, we have exercised judgement in applying the groups key accounting policies and critical estimates in areas which are by their nature inherently uncertain.
Although we have used all of the information currently available to us in making such critical estimates, changes to our assumptions in these areas could materially affect the financial results and position shown in this document.
Hansons significant accounting policies in accordance with IFRS are set out on pages 74 to 77 of the Annual Report and Form 20-F. Where estimates have been used, it is possible that over time the actual results upon which the judgement was based could differ from those estimates.
The group considers the following are the critical policies where assumptions and judgements could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Legal and other disputes Various of the groups subsidiaries are subject to a number of legal disputes, the most significant being asbestos claims against a number of its US subsidiaries.
Provisions for anticipated settlement costs and associated expenses arising from legal and other disputes are made where a reliable estimate can be made of the probable outcome of the dispute.
Where it is not possible to make such an estimate, no provision is made.
Our approach to providing for asbestos is explained in note 26 of the Notes to the accounts.
Financial review 43 Financial review continued Environmental obligations Various of the groups subsidiaries are also subject to environmental obligations for clean-up and remediation costs, pursuant to environmental laws and regulations.
Provisions are made for environmental obligations and related costs which are probable and reliably estimable and where a legal or constructive obligation to remedy-known exposures exists.
The ultimate requirement for such actions, and their costs is inherently difficult to estimate and is based on current information on costs and expected plans for remediation.
Actual costs can differ from estimates over time because of changes in existing laws and regulations, public expectations, new sites arising and unknown conditions being encountered.
Impairment The group applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets under IFRS and SFAS 144 Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of together with SFAS 142 Goodwill and other intangible assets under US GAAP.
Under IFRS, the group compares the carrying value of goodwill and tangible assets, with the higher of their net realisable value and value in use explained below, to determine whether an impairment exists.
Under US GAAP, the group assesses the fair value and recoverability of goodwill by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the actual goodwill attributable to a reporting unit.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group of assets, being tested for evidence of impairment.
The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgements, in particular those involved in a determining a value based on our current expectations of future industry conditions and the associated cash flows from the groups operations, but also those involving our future intentions for assets which are currently non-operational, b our determination of the level at which groups of assets can be reasonably tested for impairment separately from other parts of the business and c our treatment of centrally held assets, could each result in materially different carrying values of assets and assessments of impairment.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Under IFRS, the group applies IAS 19 Employee benefits.
Under US GAAP, the Company applies SFAS 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS 106 Employers Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.
These accounting standards require the group to make assumptions including, but not limited to, future asset returns, rates of inflation, discount rates, life expectancies and health care costs.
The use of different assumptions, in any of the above calculations, could have a material effect on the accounting values of the relevant assets and liabilities which could result in a material change to the cost of such liabilities as recognised in the income statement over time.
These assumptions are subject to periodic review.
See note 28 of the Notes to the accounts for additional information regarding the groups pension and other post-retirement benefits.
