Our objective is to continue to focus on increasing ROE, as opposed to nominal capital, through the efficient deployment of our capital base.
We intend to generate ROE in excess of our cost of capital.
We have set the following targets over the medium to long-term: Group ROE: 20% in Pounds Sterling.
Investec plc ROE: 15% - 20% in Pounds Sterling.
Investec Limited ROE: 25% - 30% in Rand.
The dividend for 2000 and 2001 was set in Rand and the dividend thereafter was determined in Pounds Sterling.
In the medium to long-term, we aim to achieve EPS growth of 10% in excess of UK inflation in Pounds Sterling.
We continually strive to build and maintain a sustainable business model.
We intend to maintain a dividend cover of between 1.7 and 2.3 times based on earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill, denominated in Pounds Sterling.
Our dividend cover will be increased to the upper end of the target range in years of strong performance.
Interim and final dividends will be declared and proposed in accordance with the above policy.

13 An overview of Investecs key income drivers Investec provides a wide range of financial products and services to a niche client base in three principal markets, South Africa, the UK and Australia as well as certain other markets.
Investec is organised into five principal business divisions: Private Client Activities, Treasury and Specialised Finance, Investment Banking, Asset Management and Property Activities.
In addition, our head office provides certain group-wide integrating functions such as Risk Management, Information Technology, Finance, Investor Relations, Marketing, Human Resources and Organisational Development.
It is also responsible for our central funding and other activities, such as our Trade Finance operations.
There are therefore a number of key income drivers for our business which are discussed below.

These risks are summarised briefly in the table below.
For information pertaining to the management and monitoring of these risks, see the references provided.

Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk factors.
Risks relating to the markets in which Investec operates Due to the nature of our businesses, we have been and will continue to be affected by changes in a number of macro-economic fundamentals.
These include the condition of worldwide financial markets, general economic cycles, levels of exchange and interest rates, and inflation, in particular in South Africa, the UK and Australia, where the group derives most of its profit as well as, to a lesser extent, the US and Europe.
17 Fluctuations in exchange rates Since the end of July 2002, following the implementation of our Dual Listed Companies structure, our reporting currency has been Pounds Sterling.
A substantial proportion of our operations are conducted by entities outside the UK.
The results of operations and the financial condition of our individual companies are reported in the local currencies in which they are domiciled, including Rands, Australian Dollars and US Dollars.
These results will then be translated into Pounds Sterling at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements.
In the case of the profit and loss accounts, the weighted average rate for the relevant period is applied and, in the case of the balance sheets, the relevant closing rate is used.
Exchange rates between local currencies and Pounds Sterling have fluctuated.
The translation effect of such fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies of those countries in which we operate against Pounds Sterling may adversely positively affect our results of operations and financial condition.
This report notes where the impact of depreciation appreciation of these currencies against Pounds Sterling is key to understanding the performance of our businesses.
During the period under review, the Rand appreciated by approximately 5% against Pounds Sterling.
This had a marginally positive impact on the group's consolidated results, as the South African operations generated 66.3% of the group's operating profit after taxation but before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill.
The table below sets out the movements in relevant exchange rates against Pounds Sterling over the reporting period.
These rates are indicative only and are not necessarily the rates at which the relevant currencies were converted into Pounds Sterling, for the purposes of preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

The sale of Investec Bank Israel Limited was concluded on 22 December 2004.
Fluctuations in interest rates The shape of the yield curve, the time lag between changes in interest rates applicable to assets and liabilities, and the volatility of interest rates in each of our principal geographic markets can affect our net interest income, dealing profits generated by the Interest Rate and Forex desks and fees in Corporate Treasury.
As a matter of policy, we do not take on material unhedged, longdated interest rate positions.

The most significant areas of impact for us due to IFRS are as follows: Financial review Salient features of the group's results in the year under review Profit and loss account analysis Total operating income Total operating income increased by 23.5% to 692.6 million 2004: 560.8 million.
The various components of total operating income are analysed briefly below.
Further details on the key income drivers and significant variances in the various components of the group's operating income can be found in the description of our principal businesses on pages 40 to 78.
Net interest income increased by 26.1% to 132.7 million 2004: 105.2 million.
We recorded strong growth in Private Banking and UK Treasury and Specialised Finance lending portfolios, with total core loans and advances increasing by 20.7% to 5.8 billion.
A more stable interest rate environment in South Africa has led to an improvement in the performance of the Treasury and Specialised Finance and Central Funding divisions.
The following table sets out net interest income by division for the period under review: 31 March 31 March UK GAAP 000 2005 2004 Variance % change Private Banking 98 345 78 914 19 431 24.6% Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking 5 374 4 677 697 14.9% Treasury and Specialised Finance 46 970 40 832 6 138 15.0% Investment Banking 3 340 6 484 3 144 48.5% Asset Management 2 842 2 900 58 2.0% Property Activities 169 378 209 55.3% Group Services and Other Activities 24 016 28 218 4 202 14.9% Net interest income 132 686 105 211 27 475 26.1% Net fees and commissions receivable Net fees and commissions receivable consist of fees receivable for the provision of fund management, investment advice, banking services, retainers, institutional stockbroking commissions and brokerage, and similar items that are likely to recur due to the repetitive nature of these activities i. e. ''fees and commissions receivable - annuity income''.
Also included are facility arrangement fees, corporate finance fees and similar items that are transactional in nature and therefore generate more erratic income streams i. e. ''fees and commissions receivable - deal income'', offset by fees and commissions payable which predominantly comprise brokerage payable, banking fees and other similar charges i. e. ''fees and commissions payable''.
Net fees and commissions receivable increased by 28.3% to 411.4 million 2004: 320.7 million.
This was largely attributable to increased lending turnover and transactional activity in the Private Banking division and a sound performance by the UK Project Finance, UK Investment Banking, Financial Products and Property divisions.
The Asset Management and Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking divisions benefited from improved equity market conditions and net inflows across a number of the product ranges.
Financial review The following table sets out net fees and commissions receivable by division for the period under review: 31 March 31 March UK GAAP 000 2005 2004 Variance % change Private Banking 91 196 62 181 29 015 46.7% Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking 60 164 53 390 6 774 12.7% Treasury and Specialised Finance 46 727 36 256 10 471 28.9% Investment Banking 56 781 51 992 4 789 9.2% Asset Management 124 085 100 129 23 956 23.9% Property Activities 24 594 12 647 11 947 94.5% Group Services and Other Activities 7 820 4 071 3 749 92.1% Net fees and commissions receivable 411 367 320 666 90 701 28.3% Dealing profits Dealing profits comprise: trading income: the marking-to-market of interest rate instruments, equities and other securities such as foreign exchange instruments: profit on the disposal of dealing properties: and the profit loss on realisation of the group's trading investments.
Dealing profits decreased by 23.7% to 68.7 million 2004: 90.1 million mainly as a result of the moderate performance of the trading investments held within the Property and Private Banking divisions in South Africa and certain other investments held directly by the group in its corporate portfolio.

The business has benefited from an increase in embedded value as a consequence of improved efficiencies.
The group risk business has been sold to Capital Alliance Holdings Limited CAL through a reinsurance contract executed on 31 December 2004, and the earnings reflect income to the date of sale.
23 Return on shareholders funds in the long-term assurance business The 77.6% growth in the return on shareholder's funds in the long-term assurance business conducted through IEB to 42.8 million 2004: 24.1 million results from the substantial increase in the average long-term assurance assets attributable to the shareholder from 186.9 million to 248.1 million, supported by favourable capital market conditions.
Other operating income Other operating income increased by 58.1% to 19.3 million 2004: 12.2 million as a result of gains achieved on the sale of investments in the underlying funds of the UK private equity portfolio.
The following table sets out other operating income by division for the period under review: 31 March 31 March UK GAAP 000 2005 2004 Variance % change Private Banking 116 381 265 69.6% Private Client Portfolio Management and Stockbroking - 130 130 100% Treasury and Specialised Finance 959 1 458 2 417 100% Investment Banking 14 539 5 904 8 635 100% Asset Management 45 138 93 67.4% Property Activities 2 619 2 549 70 2.7% Group Services and Other Activities 1 000 4 552 3 552 78.0% Other operating income 19 278 12 196 7 082 58.1% Total recurring annuity type income Investec defines recurring annuity income as net interest income, annuity fees and commissions receivable net of fees payable and a portion of the return on shareholders funds in the long-term assurance business.
Recurring annuity income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 64.8% to 65.2% our target range is 70%-75%.
Administrative expenses Administrative expenses increased by 14.6% to 452.8 million 2004: 395.2 million.
Variable remuneration increased by 41.0% to 106.9 million due to increased profitability.
Other operating expenses increased by 8.3% to 345.9 million largely as a result of an increase in marketing, compliance, risk management and regulatory costs, an increase in rental costs given that the group no longer owns certain of the buildings from which it operates, an increase in consulting fees relating to certain projects undertaken to improve efficiency which should result in long-term cost savings, and an increase in headcount in certain divisions.
We have made material progress towards reaching our operating expenses to total operating income target of 65% as the ratio improved from 72.7% to 66.8%, principally as a result of the strong growth in operating income of 23.5%.

25 Provision for bad and doubtful debts The bad and doubtful debts charge in the profit and loss account increased marginally by 1.8% to 21.3 million 2004: 20.9 million.
We have experienced an increase in provisions as a result of book growth mitigated by bad debt recoveries and provisions made in prior years against certain loans, which are no longer required.
The percentage of gross non-performing loans NPLs to core loans and advances decreased from 1.8% to 1.0%.
Total provision coverage remains highly satisfactory both as a percentage of gross NPLs and net NPLs gross NPLs net of security, at 157.9% and 409.1%, respectively.
The group's general provision as a percentage of net loans and advances has remained at approximately 1.2%.

Financial review ROE - an assessment of economic capital utilised In order to assess the return on economic capital utilised, we believe that certain adjustments should be made to the profit and loss analysis and balance sheet analysis as reflected under UK GAAP.
We believe that these adjustments are necessary as they reflect the actual utilisation of capital and return thereon, notwithstanding accounting conventions.
"The methodology applied in assessing the utilisation of our economic capital is as follows: A notional return on capital net of the cost of subordinated debt which is managed and borne in the centre is allocated from ""Group Services and Other Activities"" to the business segments based on their total capital utilisation."
Shareholders' funds as shown under UK GAAP is increased to reflect permanent capital which is reflected under subordinated debt.
The final dividend is added back to shareholders' funds which, under UK GAAP, reduces reserves.
The following tables set out the calculation of average shareholders' funds in terms of economic capital utilised.
This allocation represents a portion of the costs remaining in the centre which are indirectly allocated to operating divisions as they facilitate their operations but are excluded in calculating performance incentive remuneration.
These allocations are based on managements estimates of relative benefit derived.
31 Tangible net asset value per share In calculating the tangible net asset value per share, we assume that all previously issued Compulsory Convertible Debentures CCDs are treated as equity.
Under UK GAAP, however, a portion of these CCDs is treated as debt and not included in shareholders' funds.
Furthermore, the consideration paid for the group's own shares are deducted from shareholders' funds referred to as treasury shares.
As a result, we believe that certain adjustments should be made to more appropriately reflect the tangible net asset value per share.
