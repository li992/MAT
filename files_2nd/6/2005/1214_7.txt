Arla Foods UK plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Operating and We are pleased to have fulfilled our aim of delivering profitable growth during financial review a period of considerable change in the dairy industry.
This progress has been achieved by adhering to our strategy of exploiting the full potential of our brands and securing all the expected benefits of rationalisation and investment.
In a climate of continuing cost pressures, we will maintain our drive to increase efficiency across the business while seeking to recover inflation in energy and utility costs from the marketplace.
Sales growth driven by brands Group turnover from continuing operations for the 12 months to 30 September 2005 was 1.32 billion, an increase of 4.6 per cent compared with the 12 month period to 30 September 2004.
Our previous report covered the 18 months to 30 September 2004, and included virtually a full year of trading by the merged business created by the merger of Express Dairies plc and Arla Foods Plc.
To enable meaningful comparisons, throughout this review we shall cite prior year figures which relate to the 12 months to 30 September 2004.
The sales increase was driven primarily by the continued growth of our leading brands.
The imported Lurpak range again performed particularly well, in a category where a number of our competitors brands showed declines.
Lurpak Spreadable consolidated its position as the number one selling product in the whole butter, spreads and margarine BSM category, while Lurpak Lighter Spreadable achieved growth of over 17 per cent.
The total value of the Lurpak brand grew by almost four per cent to 157 million.
Anchor also made good progress, achieving nearly four per cent growth in BSM, aided by the successful launch of Anchor Lighter Spreadable in January 2005.
We also made good progress in cheese and added value dairy products, where we have recently gained McDonalds shake, sundae and organic milk supply in the UK, supplied by our Ashby-fide-la-Zouch facility.

Maintaining leadership in liquid milk Overall volumes of UK milk processed grew by four per cent.
The turnover of our plastic bottling dairies benefited from increased throughput and the selling price increases agreed with major retailers in early 2005.
This was only partially offset by a further decline in doorstep milk volumes.
The major reconfiguration of milk supply, begun by the major retailers in April 2004, was completed by the end of the year, and we began supplying more than half of Morrisons total milk requirements from October 2005.
Towards the end of the year, we also won new organic milk business with Asda Wal-Mart, and secured sole supplier status in fresh cream with Asda Wal-Mart, Morrisons and Somerfield Kwik Save.
We remain the clear UK market leader in liquid milk, with an overall share identical to that held by the two separate Arla Foods and Express Dairies businesses prior to their merger in October 2003.

nationwide coverage Dairy processors are amongst those hardest hit by oil-led inflation, which affects the cost of our plastic packaging, fuel for both collection of raw milk and distribution and energy for our processing plants.
Our key packaging cost is HDPE resin, the price of which has increased by some 30 per cent since July 2005, to over 850 per tonne.
This reflects both an imbalance in global supply and demand, which will only be rectified when new capacity comes on stream in 2008, and the impact of rising crude oil prices.
Our diesel fuel costs in the current financial year are likely to be some 2 million higher than in 2004 05, and we expect to settle our annual contracts for gas and electricity at prices some 40 to 50 per cent above those paid last year for the same unit volumes.
Discontinued operations Three businesses were discontinued during or shortly after the end of this financial year.
In November 2004 we announced the planned closure of H T Webb, our wholesale cheese packing business, and this was effected in the second quarter of the year.
The mail and parcel delivery operations of Express Dairies were discontinued in early October 2005, as volumes generated by our agreement with TNT Mail had fallen significantly short of expectations, and our future competitiveness was expected to be adversely affected by Royal Mails introduction of a new catalogue delivery service and a revised pricing structure for heavier and larger format items.
Finally, on 17 October 2005 we announced the sale of our London Foodservice business to Dairy Crest, beginning the long-needed rationalisation of the middleground sector in this region: this disposal was completed by the end of October.
Together these businesses contributed operating losses of 4.4 million in the 12 months to 30 September 2005, compared No1 with losses of 3.6 million in the prior year.
Underlying pre-tax profit, inclusive of these losses, increased by 3.6 per cent to 40.1 million 2004: 38.7 million.

This was completed on budget and on schedule, with production commencing before the end of the financial year and more than doubling our processing capacity for this successful, growing brand.
We also spent 12 million of our total 18 million investment to create a new dairy at Lockerbie, to serve the central belt of Scotland, where we are now meeting all the fresh milk requirements of both Asda Wal-Mart and Morrisons.

We will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards in our financial year to September 2006, the expected effects of which are discussed further below.
The triennial actuarial review of the Express Dairies Pension Scheme is currently underway.
As at 30 September 2005, the FRS17 pension deficit, post deferred tax, of the Express Pension Scheme stood at 72.2 million 2004: 84.5 million and that of the Arla Scheme at 31.8 million 2004: 25.9 million.
The overall reduction in the combined deficit reflects the appreciation in asset values over the year, which more than offset a further increase in liability calculations.
International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS References herein to IFRS relate to the application of International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards, and Interpretations issued by the Standing Interpretations Committee and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee.
This years results have been reported in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The group will report its results in accordance with IFRS for the first time in the current financial year ending 30 September 2006.
The results for the half-year ending 31 March 2006, and for the full year to 30 September 2006, will include restated comparatives and appropriate reconciliations.
We have completed our initial assessment of the adjustments required to restate the accounts from UK GAAP to IFRS for the transitional balance sheet of 30 September 2004 and for the year ended 30 September 2005.
IFRS is subject to ongoing review and possible amendment by interpretative guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board.
Our assessment is therefore subject to potential change.
Under IFRS, the group estimates that net assets at 30 September 2005 will be reduced by approximately 93.8 million.
The largest adjustment relates to the change in accounting for pensions since the gross deficit of 156.0 million, calculated in accordance with IAS19 Employee Benefits, is shown as a liability on the balance sheet.
A related deferred tax asset of 46.8 million is shown separately on the balance sheet.
The reduction in net assets also represents 1m recognition of the fair value of the groups derivative financial instruments of 5.5 million, partly offset by a revision of the carrying value of the Loan Notes of 2.2 million.
Net assets are increased by reversal of the accrual for the final dividend of 4.6 million which is reflected as a liability only when declared, and the reversal of goodwill amortisation of 8.0 million.
Other adjustments to net assets amount Rosenborg benefits from to a reduction of 4.7 million, including deferred tax assets and part of a 1 million liabilities of 1.7 million and 2.8 million respectively.
marketing programme with a new modern design and We also estimate that, under IFRS, the profit before tax excluding up-to-date packaging exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and discontinued operations for the year ended 30 September 2005 will reduce by 0.4 million.
The adjustments arising from an increased pension charge, partly offset by a reduced charge for share based payments.
The adoption of IFRS will have no impact on the reported cash flows of the group.
A detailed presentation of the impact of restating the accounts from UK GAAP to IFRS is available on the Arla Foods website www.
18 Arla Foods UK plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Treasury management The treasury operations of the group are managed within parameters formally defined and regularly reviewed by the board.
The activities of group treasury are routinely reported to the board and the Audit Committee and are subject to review by internal audit.
The board has approved the policy that group treasury follows in managing the main financial risks to the group: funding, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The groups policy is to ensure that there is appropriate continuing funding in place by arranging for all short-term borrowing to be fully backed by committed medium-term facilities and by limiting the amounts due for repayment within 12 months.
At 30 September 2005, the weighted average term of the groups outstanding facilities was four years 2004: three years.
In addition, unused committed bank facilities were 120.0 million 2004: 120.0 million.
New Our policy is to use financial instruments to manage and limit the exposure to adverse movements in interest rates by fixing or capping interest rates on between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of debt.
At the year end 56 per cent 2004: 56 per cent of the net debt was fixed through the use of interest rate swaps.
building on our new product development Although only a small proportion of the groups sales and purchases agenda, Lurpak Spreadable Unsalted will be launched are denominated in currencies other than sterling, the group has an ongoing exposure to the euro, through European intervention in January 2006 prices and export subsidies.
It is the groups policy wherever possible to protect itself against adverse movements in the sterling euro exchange rate through the matching of cash flows and the use of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Due to the seasonal nature of the groups trade, there were no such instruments in place at either the start or the end of the year.
