793529 1090 3 6 05 10:39 Page 27 Regime which is contrary to EU law and thus invalid.
In summary, it is argued that imposition of corporation tax under the CFC Regime amounts to unlawful discrimination or an unlawful restriction on the exercise of fundamental freedoms under the EU Treaty particularly Articles 43 and 56.
On 3 May 2005 the Special Commissioners referred the matter to the European Court of Justice the ECJ requesting that a number of questions in relation to the invalidity argument be determined as a preliminary matter.
Pending resolution of such questions, Vodafone 2s application for closure of the enquiry and, effectively, the enquiry itself has been stayed.
It is not expected that the ECJ will deliver a judgment in this matter until, at the earliest, mid 2006.
The ECJ does not have jurisdiction to determine the outcome of Vodafone 2s application rather the Special Commissioners will apply the ECJs judgment to the particular facts of Vodafone 2s application.
If the ECJ decides that the CFC Regime in its entirety is invalid under EU law, then no charge to UK corporation tax can arise to Vodafone 2 with respect to VIL under the CFC Regime and the Special Commissioners will order that the Inland Revenues enquiry be closed.
If the CFC Regime is held by the ECJ to be valid, either in part or as a whole, then it will be a matter for the Special Commissioners to apply the ECJs reasoning to the particular circumstances of Vodafone 2s case.
Although it is not possible to address all possible outcomes under such a scenario, it should be noted that even if the CFC Regime is held by the ECJ to be entirely lawful, Vodafone 2 would continue to resist the imposition of corporation tax liability on other grounds.
The Company has taken provisions, which at 31 March 2005 amounted to 1,757 million, for the potential UK corporation tax liability and related interest expense that may arise if the Company is not successful in its challenge of the CFC Regime.
The provisions relate to the accounting period which is the subject of the proceedings and accounting periods after 31 March 2001 to date.
Please see note 8 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company considers these provisions are sufficient to settle any assessments that may arise from the enquiry.
However, the amount ultimately paid by the Company if any upon resolution of the enquiry may differ materially from the amount accrued and, therefore, could have a significant effect on the profitability or cash ows of the Group in future periods.
In the absence of any material unexpected developments, the Company expects to reassess the amount of this provision when the views of the ECJ become known, which is expected to be during 2006.
A number of Vodafone subsidiaries acquired 3G licences through auctions in 2000 and 2001.
An appeal was led by Vodafone UK, along with other UK mobile network operators which were granted a 3G licence, with the VAT and Duties Tribunal on 18 October 2003 for recovery of VAT on the basis that the amount of the licence fee was inclusive of VAT.
The amount of this claim is approximately 888 million.
In August 2004, these claims were referred, jointly, to the ECJ although no hearing date has yet been listed.
A decision from the ECJ is not expected before 2006.
The Group has not recognised any amounts in respect of this matter to date.
In addition, the Group has made a claim for recovery of VAT in relation to 3G licence fees in Portugal and may pursue similar claims in certain other European jurisdictions.
