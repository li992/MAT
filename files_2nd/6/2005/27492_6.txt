OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW INTRODUCTION Northern Rock is a specialised lender providing loans for residential mortgages, secured commercial lending and unsecured personal finance.
Funding is obtained from both on-shore and off-shore personal savings, wholesale money markets, from the securitisation of loans and from covered bonds.
Income is also generated from the sale of third party insurance products.
All lending activities are carried out in the UK, whereas funding, particularly non-retail funding, is attracted globally.
Efficiency is paramount to the Northern Rock business strategy.
Cost efficiency enables competitive pricing for both savings and lending products leading to volume and income growth supporting further improvements in cost ratios.
Capital efficiency is achieved by optimising the use of debt and equity capital and securitisation.
Northern Rock has well established strategic targets against which its financial performance is monitored.
These targets, which were all achieved on an underlying basis in 2005, are set out in the following table: Strategic 2005 Performance Targets Reported Underlying Growth in total assets 20% - 5% 27.5% 24.9% Growth in profits attributable to shareholders 15% - 5% 2.8% 13.6% Return on equity 19% - 22% 19.3% 20.8% INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS The 2005 results have been prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as approved by the International Accounting Standards Board that, under European Regulations, are effective or available for early adoption at the Groups first reporting date under IFRS, 31 December 2005 and which differ significantly to UK GAAP used in the preparation of previously reported financial statements.
Analysis of the results is complicated as a result of certain IFRS only having been applied from 1 January 2005.
This means that the revised 2004 statutory results only include the impact of certain of the IFRS used in the preparation of the 2005 results.
As a consequence we have included in comparisons set out in the Operating and Financial Review, 2004 results prepared on a proforma basis, incorporating the impact of IFRS where it can be determined what the impact would have been if the accounting changes had been effective in 2004.
This impact includes the treatment of interest income and fees and the reclassification of certain funding instruments from debt to non shareholders equity but excludes the effects of accounting for derivatives under IFRS which differs from that applied under UK GAAP.
Full reconciliations of the effect of the introduction of IFRS together with full details of the accounting policies for 2005 are included in the notes to the accounts.
As a consequence of the introduction of IFRS the 2005 balance sheet and income statement are subject to a certain amount of volatility particularly from the accounting for hedges deemed under IFRS rules to be ineffective, plus volatility arising from fair value movements on derivatives taken out in respect of certain financial liabilities and instruments included in non shareholders equity which themselves are not subject to fair value treatment.
Where appropriate, such volatility is separately identified in the review of financial and operating results to enable managements view of underlying performance to be separately disclosed and discussed.
Further detail is given on page 38.
35 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Summary income statements shown on a reported statutory basis and on an underlying basis for 2005 and on a reported statutory and proforma basis for 2004 are set out as follows: 2005 Statutory Adjustments Underlying m m m Net interest income 752.3 45.5 706.8 Other income 129.0 129.0 Net hedge ineffectiveness and other unrealised fair value gains and losses 56.4 56.4 Total income 824.9 10.9 835.8 Administrative expenses 249.4 249.4 Covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation 24.7 0.5 25.2 Operating expenses 274.1 0.5 274.6 Impairment losses on loans and advances 56.6 56.6 Profit before taxation 494.2 10.4 504.6 Income tax expense 144.9 3.0 147.9 Profit for the year 349.3 7.4 356.7 Attributable to: Appropriations 48.6 48.6 Profit attributable to equity shareholders 300.7 7.4 308.1 Total 349.3 7.4 356.7 Earnings per share 72.5p 74.3p 2004 Statutory Adjustments Proforma m m m Net interest income 466.9 145.8 612.7 Other income 252.3 140.5 111.8 Total income 719.2 5.3 724.5 Administrative expenses 218.3 1.4 216.9 Covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation 21.6 0.5 22.1 Operating expenses 239.9 0.9 239.0 Impairment losses on loans and advances 48.5 48.5 Impairment of fixed asset investments 4.5 4.5 Profit before taxation 435.3 6.2 441.5 Income tax expense 125.8 1.9 127.7 Profit for the year 309.5 4.3 313.8 Attributable to: Appropriations 42.6 42.6 Profit attributable to equity shareholders 309.5 38.3 271.2 Total 309.5 4.3 313.8 Earnings per share 74.9p 65.7p 2005 reported statutory profit before taxation for the year increased by 13.5% to 494.2 million with profit attributable to equity shareholders decreasing by 2.8% to 300.7 million.
On the same basis return on equity was 19.3% 2004 - 21.6% and the return on mean risk weighted assets 1.22% 2004 - 1.45%.
36 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Based upon 2005 underlying results and the 2004 proforma results, profit before taxation increased by 14.3% to 504.6 million with profit attributable to equity shareholders increasing by 13.6% to 308.1 million.
On the same basis return on equity was 20.8% 2004 - 20.9% and the return on mean risk weighted assets 1.26% 2004 - 1.29%.
ASSETS Total assets on a statutory and underlying basis excluding fair value adjustments for 2005 are set out in the following table: 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 m m Statutory 82,709 64,881 Underlying 81,057 64,881 On a reported statutory basis total assets are 27.5% higher than at the previous year end and on an underlying basis have increased by 24.9%.
TOTAL INCOME The introduction of IFRS in 2005 results in significant changes in the presentation and reporting of interest and non-interest income.
Upfront lending fees are now spread over the expected life of a loan and included in interest income resulting in a deferral of reported income.
Introducer fees are also now recognised within interest income and spread over the expected life of a loan, rather than, as previously, the life of the customer relationship, resulting in an acceleration of the recognition of the cost.
Mortgage incentives continue to be offset against interest income but are now spread over the expected life of a loan rather than over the early repayment charge period.
In addition, following the re-classification of certain instruments from debt to equity, the coupon payable on these instruments is now excluded from interest expense and is treated as an appropriation.
As these accounting changes were introduced on a statutory basis with effect from 1 January 2005 we have prepared comparable 2004 figures on a proforma basis as well as on the statutory basis.
The following table reconciles net interest income and total income on a reported statutory excluding hedge ineffectiveness and underlying basis for 2005 and on a reported statutory and proforma basis for 2004.
2005 2004 m m Reported statutory net interest income 752.3 466.9 Interest implicit in forward exchange contracts 45.5 Impact of IFRS 145.8 Underlying proforma net interest income 706.8 612.7 Reported statutory other income 129.0 252.3 Impact of IFRS 140.5 Underlying proforma other income 129.0 111.8 Reported statutory total income excluding hedge ineffectiveness 881.3 719.2 Underlying proforma total income 835.8 724.5 Based upon the table above total income ratios are as follows: Reported statutory Total income: mean total assets 1.19% 1.23% Total income: mean risk weighted assets 3.57% 3.37% Underlying proforma Total income: mean total assets 1.15% 1.24% Total income: mean risk weighted assets 3.41% 3.43% Interest implicit in forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the sterling cost implicit from the exchange contract and the currency coupon on the foreign currency liability translated at spot exchange rates.
This is regarded as the interest element of the forward exchange contract and is included in underlying interest expense.
37 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued On a statutory basis, total income excluding hedge ineffectiveness in 2005 amounted to 881.3 million representing an increase of 22.5% over statutory total income in 2004.
On this basis the ratio of total income to mean total assets at 1.19% compares with the 2004 ratio of 1.23%.
Total income as a proportion of mean risk weighted assets at 3.57% compares with the 2004 ratio of 3.37%.
On an underlying basis total income in 2005 amounted to 835.8 million representing an increase of 15.4% over proforma total income in 2004.
On this basis, the ratio of total income to underlying mean total assets at 1.15% compares with the 2004 ratio of 1.24%.
Total income as a proportion of mean risk weighted assets at 3.41% compares with the 2004 ratio of 3.43%.
INTEREST MARGIN AND SPREAD Interest margin has been calculated by reference to average interest earning assets excluding fair value adjustments.
For assets denominated in foreign currencies, where these have been economically hedged, average balances are based on the contract rate implicit in the associated hedging instrument.
Average balances have been calculated on a monthly basis.
Interest spread represents the difference between interest receivable as a % of average interest earning assets, excluding fair value adjustments, and interest payable as a % of average interest bearing liabilities, excluding fair value adjustments.
For assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, where these have been economically hedged, average balances are based on the contract rate implicit in the associated hedging instrument.
2005 2004 Reported statutory Interest margin 1.03% 0.82% Interest spread 0.87% 0.73% Underlying proforma Interest margin 0.97% 1.07% Interest spread 0.81% 0.91% Underlying interest margin at 0.97% compares with the 2004 ratio of 0.82% on a statutory basis and 1.07% on a proforma basis.
The proforma basis is considered to be a more appropriate comparator as it is calculated on the same basis as the 2005 figures, including the impact of effective interest rate changes under IFRS.
On this basis, interest margin for 2005 is 10bps lower than the full year in 2004 but only 3bps lower than in the first half of 2005.
During 2004, 3 month Libor was on average 26bps higher than Bank Base Rate.
Although this differential reduced to 11bps on average during 2005, there continued to be an adverse effect on the price of our Libor related funding.
HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS Following the introduction of IFRS, all derivatives entered into by Northern Rock, which under UK GAAP were held off balance sheet, are now recorded on the balance sheet at full fair value with any fair value movements being taken to the income statement.
Where effective hedge relationships can be established, the movement in the fair value of the derivative instrument is offset in full or in part by opposite movements in the fair value of the underlying instrument being hedged.
Any ineffectiveness arising from different movements in fair value will trend to zero over time and so any recorded ineffectiveness in any accounting period is excluded from underlying results in that accounting period.
In addition, Northern Rock enters into certain derivative contracts, which although efficient economically, cannot be included in effective hedge accounting relationships.
Consequently, although the implicit interest cost of the underlying instrument and associated derivative are included in net interest income in the income statement, fair value movements of future cashflows excluding interest flows on such derivatives are recorded in Net hedge ineffectiveness and other unrealised fair value gains and losses on the face of the income statement and are excluded from underlying results as these fair value adjustments are not realised in the current accounting period.
The same treatment also applies to the revaluation at each balance sheet date of economically hedged foreign currency liabilities.
The over-riding objective of the presentation of underlying results is to show the underlying interest income expense of hedged instruments and to exclude future fair value adjustments from current performance measurement.
In 2005, the income statement shows Net hedge ineffectiveness and other unrealised fair value gains and losses as a negative figure of 56.4 million.
This reduces to 10.9 million negative after the cost of interest implicit in forward exchange contracts is transferred to underlying net interest income.
At 30 June 2005 the equivalent figures were 33.3 million positive and 57.6 million positive respectively.
38 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued OPERATING EXPENSES excluding the covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation 2005 2004 m m Staff costs 144.5 119.6 Other expenses 81.6 80.5 Depreciation and amortisation 23.3 18.2 Total operating expenses 249.4 218.3 Total operating expenses amounted to 249.4 million representing an increase of 14.2% over statutory operating expenses of 218.3 million and 15.0% over proforma operating expenses of 216.9 million for 2004.
The increase of 15.0% compares with an increase in underlying assets of 24.9% over the year and a rise in underlying total income of 15.4%, resulting in a cost to asset ratio of 0.34% 2004 statutory - 0.37%, proforma - 0.37% and a cost to underlying income ratio of 29.8% 2004 statutory - 30.4%, proforma - 29.9%.
At the half year stage the cost to underlying income ratio had risen to 30.1% as a result of incremental regulatory costs being incurred in the first half of 2005 with no corresponding cost in the equivalent period in 2004.
In the second half of 2005, underlying income growth of 17.5%, compared with the second half of 2004, exceeded cost growth of only 12.4%, resulting in a 2005 second half cost to underlying income ratio of 29.6%.
Included in the 2005 operating expenses are approximately 10 million of recurring incremental costs 2004 - 3.6 million in relation to the full year impact of increased regulatory requirements.
These have been absorbed in our cost base and so going forward we expect the rate of cost growth to slow, cost growth to be at the bottom end of the one half to two thirds of asset growth range and income growth to exceed cost growth.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THE NORTHERN ROCK FOUNDATION Northern Rock donates 5% of pre tax profit to The Northern Rock Foundation under a deed of covenant.
Such donations are used to support community and charitable causes mainly in the North East of England and Cumbria.
The covenant from 2005 profits amounts to 24.7 million 31 December 2004 - 21.6 million, resulting in approximately 145 million having been donated since its inception in 1997 as an integral part of Northern Rocks conversion to a plc.
CREDIT QUALITY AND LOAN LOSS IMPAIRMENT The arrears position of each of our personal lending portfolios based upon numbers of accounts three months or more in arrears is set out in the following table: Residential Standalone Together CML Residential Unsecured Unsecured Average 31 December 2005 0.39% 0.98% 0.84% 0.92% 31 December 2004 0.37% 1.04% 0.78% 0.80% Note: CML: Council of Mortgage Lenders.
Residential accounts three months or more in arrears at 0.39% remained well below half the CML residential average of 0.92% at 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 - 0.80% and only marginally ahead of the equivalent figure of 0.37% at the end of 2004.
The together secured three months plus arrears increased to 0.84% at 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 - 0.77% but remained below the CML average for residential lending.
At 31 December 2005, properties in possession had increased to 576, representing only 0.09% of all accounts compared with 181 0.03% at the end of 2004 in line with our policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower is unwilling to maintain payments and where we have higher risk.
Standalone personal unsecured loan arrears remain significantly better than industry average, reflecting our policy of attracting high quality lending and use of our bespoke scorecard to avoid lower quality lending.
Three months plus arrears finished the year at 0.98%, below that reported at the half year and at the end of December 2004, although greater collections activity was required compared with 2004.
On an industry-wide view indebtedness of customers seems to have stabilised.
In our loan portfolios indebtedness has begun to decline and collection activity in the last quarter became a little easier.
39 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued At 31 December 2005 only 10 of our commercial loans 0.42% of accounts with balances outstanding of 5.8 million were three months or more in arrears compared with 8 accounts 0.31% with outstanding balances of 6.3 million at 31 December 2004.
Although there are similarities between the bases for determining loan loss impairment provisions under UK GAAP and IFRS, the latter is more prescriptive.
In 2005, we enhanced our loan loss impairment methodologies incorporating risk and performance data captured in and generated by our Basle II capital systems.
Following the introduction of the improved methodologies at the beginning of the year, a reassessment of loan loss impairment provisions was made to reflect more accurately the risk profile of our loan portfolios.
Following this one-off reassessment, opening loan loss impairment provisions were reduced by 10.3 million for the residential portfolio and by 9.8 million in our commercial lending portfolio and increased by 20.1 million in respect of our unsecured loans.
The 2005 charge for loan loss impairment amounted to 56.6 million 2004 - 48.5 million representing 0.09% of mean advances to customers 2004 - 0.10%.
The combination of high quality lending, low interest rates, low arrears and continued strong average Loan to Value ratio LTV of the portfolio have continued to contain the levels of loan loss impairment provisions required for residential mortgages.
Provisions for the commercial secured lending portfolio are consistent with portfolio performance and economic conditions for this sector.
The growth in loan loss impairment provision balances against our personal unsecured credit portfolios reflects growth in balances and the maturing nature of the portfolios.
As a result, total loan loss impairment provision balances for these portfolios have increased to 87.1 million 31 December 2004 - 78.4 million with total cover of 1.48% 31 December 2004 - 1.68%.
We continue to anticipate, with a corporation tax rate of 30% and HM Revenue & Customs stance on tax planning, that the ongoing effective tax rate will trend towards 30.0% in the medium term.
% Standard corporation tax rate for 2005 30.0 Effect of non-deductible items 0.2 Adjustment to prior year tax provisions 0.9 Effective tax rate 29.3 LENDING During 2005 Northern Rock again achieved record levels of total lending.
Total gross lending was 26,879 million, an increase of 15.2% 2004 - 23,342 million, with total net lending of 14,555 million, an increase of 12.6% 2004 - 12,932 million.
Prospects for 2006 are good, with a total opening pipeline of 5,300 million 1 January 2005 - 5,105 million including a residential lending pipeline of 5,005 million 1 January 2005 - 4,891 million.
The 2006 opening pipeline also reflects a 6% improvement in the time applications remain in the lending pipeline.
Improved customer retention reduces the need to grow gross lending significantly as we move towards achieving the centre of our asset growth target range.
The composition of our lending portfolios has continued to be low risk.
At 31 December 2005, 90% of our loans to customers were residential secured loans 31 December 2004 - 89%, 2% commercial secured loans 31 December 2004 - 3% and 8% 31 December 2004 - 8% within our personal unsecured portfolios.
This mix is not expected to change significantly going forward.
An analysis of new lending by portfolio is set out in the following table: Residential Commercial Unsecured Total m m m m 2005 Gross 23,618 408 2,853 26,879 Net 13,350 5 1,200 14,555 2004 Gross 20,051 499 2,792 23,342 Net 11,383 182 1,367 12,932 RESIDENTIAL UK MARKET The UK residential lending market improved in the second half of 2005 resulting in estimated gross lending for the year of 288 billion, broadly unchanged from the 291 billion recorded in 2004.
Gross lending associated with housing transactions and equity withdrawal 40 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued represents around 55% of lending with 45% driven by remortgage activity.
Whilst the former will vary with volumes of home moving transactions and house price inflation, the latter does not due to increased market liquidity following the removal of overhanging early repayment charges.
The two components will continue to provide a substantial and robust gross lending market for us to be able to achieve our lending targets.
The slow down in the housing transaction market during 2005 has, however, resulted in estimated net lending being down 9% at 91 billion 2004 - 101 billion.
UK house prices remained stable throughout 2005.
Although the latter part of 2005 saw an increase in housing transactions, we expect 2006 transactions to be similar to those achieved in 2005, with low single digit house price appreciation, in line with the growth in average earnings.
RESIDENTIAL NORTHERN ROCK PERFORMANCE Against this background, we achieved gross residential lending of 23,618 million 2004 - 20,051 million and net residential lending of 13,350 million 2004 - 11,383 million, representing increases of 17.8% and 17.3% respectively.
Our share of UK gross residential lending for 2005 was 8.1% and our market share of net residential lending was 14.5%.
This compares with 8.0% and 13.5% respectively for the first half of 2005, and 6.8% and 11.2% for 2004 in total.
Our share of redemptions for the year was 5.2% 2004 - 4.5%, again lower than our closing share of mortgage stock of 6.4% 31 December 2004 - 5.5%.
This reflects the continued success and strengthening of our pro-active customer retention process and our fair and transparent policy of allowing existing customers, subject to their contractual terms, to transfer their loan to any product available to new borrowers.
In 2005, 90% of our gross residential lending was originated via the indirect market 2004 - 88%.
This reflects the increasing importance of mortgage clubs and networks, with whom we are even more closely aligned following the introduction of statutory mortgage regulation in the last quarter of 2004, and improvements in service levels and access through our on-line trading platform.
The profile of our new lending has remained low risk despite strong growth in volumes.
There was a slight increase in the proportion of lending to first time buyers to 24% 2004 - 21% reflected in increased volumes of together lending.
76% 2004 - 79% of new customers continued to have a proven payment track record.
The impact of this trend has been to increase the average LTV of new lending in 2005 to 78% compared with 76% in 2004.
Similarly new lending at or below 90% LTV was 70% 2004 - 77% of completions.
The average indexed LTV of our mortgage book is now 58% 31 December 2004 - 53% which continues to provide strong cover in the event of default.
We have minimal exposure to large loans with only 3.4% of new loans over 500,000 2004 - 3.5% and have a good spread of geographic risk.
We offer customers a wide range of innovative and attractive products including lifestyle products and traditional price-led products.
Most of our products also have inbuilt flexibility giving customers the opportunity to overpay, make redraws and subject to advance agreement and after a qualifying period, take payment holidays.
Our lifestyle products comprise our together family of products, Lifetime and residential Buy to Let mortgages.
The together products combine a secured and unsecured loan at one interest rate and one monthly payment.
Gross lending of together products amounted to 7.0 billion of which 6.1 billion were advances secured on residential property representing 28.7% of new residential lending, excluding further advances.
Outstanding balances of together mortgages have increased to 20.6% of our mortgage portfolio 31 December 2004 - 18.2%.
Our Lifetime range is aimed at homeowners aged 60 and over who wish to utilise equity in their homes to enhance their lifestyle.
Such lending accounted for 1.4% of gross new residential lending 2004 - 1.8%, with outstanding Lifetime balances representing 3.0% 31 December 2004 - 3.1% of our mortgage balances.
Residential Buy to Let lending is focussed on lending to private investors secured on good quality residential properties with low LTVs.
Such lending accounted for 4.9% of our mortgage portfolio at 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 - 4.0% and for 7.1% 2004 - 6.4% of gross new residential lending.
In total our family of lifestyle products, which are margin enhancing, represented 37.2% 2004 - 28.9% of our gross new residential lending and 28.5% of mortgage balances at 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 - 25.3%.
Of our traditional price-led mortgage products, fixed rate mortgages remained the most popular with 25.3% 2004 - 46.4% of total new lending accounted for by short term fixed rate products up to two years, and 28.8% 2004 - 7.5% by longer term fixes, normally up to five years.
The increased demand for longer term fixed rate products reflected competitive pricing led by attractive longer term swap rates.
UNSECURED Our personal unsecured credit portfolios comprise the unsecured element of together lending and standalone unsecured loans not linked to a residential mortgage.
An analysis of lending volumes on the separate elements of our unsecured portfolios is shown in the following table: 41 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Standalone Together Total Unsecured Unsecured m m m 2005 Gross 1,970 883 2,853 Net 744 456 1,200 2004 Gross 2,068 724 2,792 Net 1,104 263 1,367 Standalone unsecured gross lending has slowed in line with the number of borrowers who satisfy our credit score and our risk appetite.
Net lending has shown a further reduction as the portfolio matures and redemptions and repayments naturally increase.
Volumes of new together unsecured lending increased below the rate of growth of together mortgage lending due to the cap of 30,000 on the value of the unsecured element of together loans.
At 31 December 2005, our unsecured lending balances were 5,789 million 31 December 2004 - 4,581 million of which 40.0% 31 December 2004 - 40.3% represented together unsecured advances.
COMMERCIAL Competition in the commercial secured lending market remained strong throughout 2005 with certain lenders being particularly aggressive on price and LTV levels at which they are prepared to lend.
Both gross and net lending within our commercial lending portfolio slowed as a result of maintaining our emphasis on quality rather than volume of lending.
Gross lending in the year amounted to 408 million 2004 - 499 million with net lending of 5 million 2004 - 182 million.
TREASURY Our Treasury operation continues to raise wholesale funds, manage interest rate and currency risks, and manage a portfolio of investments primarily for liquidity purposes.
It is not a separate profit centre and does not operate trading portfolios.
At 31 December 2005, 97% 31 December 2004 - 96% of our Treasury investment portfolios comprised assets which are rated single A or better.
We continue to have no exposure to emerging markets or non-investment grade debt.
FUNDING Northern Rock has established four distinct funding arms enabling it to attract funds from a wide range of customers and counterparties on a global basis.
Flows of new funding and closing balances are shown in the following table: Retail Non-Retail Securitisation Covered Bonds m m m m 2005 Net flow 2,809 2,317 8,831 2,378 Closing balances 20,104 22,253 31,156 3,830 2004 Net flow 896 2,770 7,234 1,341 Closing balances 17,290 19,740 22,090 1,339 Note: Net flow in 2005 represents net cashflows excluding fair value adjustments.
Closing balances at 31 December 2005 are stated including fair value adjustments.
42 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued RETAIL Retail funding comprised a net inflow of funds of 2,809 million, including interest credited of 565 million and builds on the successful funding in the first half of 2005 of 1,716 million, again demonstrating the strength and diversity of our retail franchise.
2005s net inflow represents over three times the net inflow of 896 million achieved in 2004.
Funding during the year was largely into our Silver Savings account for the over 50s, launched in September 2004 and supplemented in 2005 by the introduction of a 30 day notice account.
Balances in our Ireland based operation rose 63% to 1,026 million 31 December 2004 - 628 million, with 1,940 million 31 December 2004 - 1,871 million in our Guernsey based off-shore vehicle.
Closing balances of 20.1 billion represent 65.8% of our non-securitised lending portfolios 31 December 2004 - 52.6%.
NON-RETAIL Our non-retail funding provides a balanced mixture of short and medium term funding with increasing diversification of our global investor base.
During the first half we repaid net 2.2 billion, mainly short term funds, following securitisation issues.
In the second half we raised a net 4.5 billion mainly medium term funding, leaving a full year net funding of 2.3 billion.
During the year, we raised 2.6 billion medium term wholesale funds from a variety of globally spread sources, with specific emphasis on the US, Europe and Asia.
This included a US$1.75 billion Extendible Quarterly Securities issue sold to domestic US investors and a US$1.5 billion Floating Rate Notes issue sold in Asia and Europe.
In January 2006, we have raised a further US$2.0 billion Extendible Securities, with over 60% of funds raised from investors new to the Northern Rock Extendible programme.
Key developments in short term funding included the establishment of a CAD$2 billion Canadian Commercial Paper programme which provides access to domestic Canadian investors.
This programme had outstanding balances of CAD$850 million at 31 December 2005.
SECURITISATION Funding through securitisation has remained an integral part of Northern Rocks funding strategy.
During 2005 four residential mortgagebacked issues were completed raising 12.9 billion through our Granite vehicles.
The characteristics of the mortgages securitised, in terms of product type, LTV and geographic distribution remain similar to those of our non-securitised mortgages.
We continue to diversify our investor base aided by comprehensive global investor roadshows.
A second commercial mortgage securitisation Dolerite raising 600 million was also completed.
The last Granite issue of 2005 a 3.75 billion deal was priced at the lowest spread we have ever achieved, even tighter than previous deals completed in the year and significantly below the cost of older deals being replaced.
Already in 2006 we have completed a 6.0 billion residential mortgage-backed securitisation issue, which was heavily oversubscribed.
At 31 December 2005 advances to customers subject to securitisation amounted to 39.1 billion 31 December 2004 - 21.9 billion, representing 56% 31 December 2004 - 40% of our total lending portfolios.
COVERED BONDS In 2005 we raised 3.5 billion 2.4 billion from two further issues from our 10 billion covered bond programme established in 2004.
The second transaction raised funds with a maturity of 15 years priced at mid swaps plus 11bps helping to lower the average cost of new funding.
We intend to continue to actively develop our covered bond programme and will seek to further diversify the investor base.
The covered bonds are secured by a pool of ring-fenced residential mortgages.
The credit risks associated with these loans have subsequently been transferred into the capital markets by means of synthetic securitisation transactions Graphite providing further capital benefits.
WHINSTONE TRANSACTION In November 2005, Northern Rock completed its first Whinstone transaction transferring around 80% of the reserve fund risk relating to pre 2005 Granite residential mortgage securitisations to third party investors, therefore reducing the potential exposure to downturn credit risk.
The transaction reduces the level of core capital required under credit rating assessments of required capital as well as the regulatory capital deduction in respect of the reserve funds, thereby enhancing capital efficiency and more closely aligning regulatory and credit rating capital: an important step in advance of Basle II.
By retaining a small portion of the first loss, Northern Rock continues to align the interests of securitisation investors and the Company and demonstrates its confidence in the credit performance of the mortgage portfolios.
Net interest income, total income and pre tax profits were affected by the interest cost of this transaction for two months in 2005 and will be affected on a full year basis thereafter.
This additional cost will be largely offset by savings in appropriations due to not having to raise subordinated debt to support securitisation capital deductions.
Underlying attributable profits will therefore not be significantly affected by this transaction.
43 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Following the announcement of the transaction Standard & Poors changed the Northern Rock senior unsecured credit rating outlook from neutral to positive.
The 423 million transaction, included within securitised notes in issue, is by far the largest transaction of its type ever completed in the international markets and has been awarded European Securitisation deal of the year by IFR magazine.
It is our intention to continue to utilise this type of transaction on an ongoing basis.
DIVIDENDS In line with our dividend policy of a payout ratio of approximately 40% of sustainable underlying attributable profits, cover of 2.5 times, the proposed final dividend is 20.7p per share payable on 26 May 2006 to shareholders on the register on 28 April 2006.
This, combined with the interim dividend of 9.4p, results in a total dividend for 2005 of 30.1p per share, an increase of 13.6% over the 2004 total dividend of 26.5p per share.
CAPITAL At 31 December 2005, total capital amounted to 3,224 million resulting in a total capital ratio of 12.3%, comfortably above regulatory and internal requirements.
Tier 1 capital was 2,033 million and the Tier 1 ratio 7.7%.
The restated equivalent ratios at 31 December 2004 on a statutory basis were 14.0% and 8.7%.
On a proforma basis the ratios were 13.5% and 8.0% respectively, primarily reflecting the impact of the deferral of fee income following the introduction of IFRS.
Recognising the strategic importance of Basle II to our business, in December 2005, we submitted our application seeking waiver from the FSA to permit us to adopt the Retail Internal Ratings Based approach, which is planned to commence on 1 January 2007.
We intend to initially adopt the Standardised Approach to Operational Risk.
Our low risk balance sheet means that we expect to achieve significant reductions in the levels of our total regulatory risk weighted assets for credit exposures compared to current levels.
This should result, subject to consultation with the FSA and credit rating agencies, in future capital efficiencies.
In the first three years of the operation of Basle II, transitional arrangements will apply such that any capital relief will be introduced gradually with a potential maximum 20% reduction in capital by the end of the transition period.

At the end of 2005, this deficit would have grown to around 74.4 million without corrective action, reflecting in particular volatility arising from the use of point in time assumptions about return on assets and discount rates and in particular the reduction in bond yields seen in December 2005.
The defined benefit element of the fund is a closed fund, and as we get closer to the end of the funds life, the IAS19 deficit will become realised.
Consequently, we have decided to eliminate the average 2005 deficit.
This has been achieved by an initial additional contribution of 20.0 million in December 2005, with the balance of 45.0 million paid in January 2006.
As a result of the above, the IAS 19 deficit at 31 December 2005 is 54.4 million, which reduces by 45.0 million to 9.4 million after the payments made in January 2006.
The impact of these contributions will be minimal on the Groups earnings but will reduce the risk of significant increases in pension cost in the future.
OUTLOOK We expect UK gross residential lending in 2006 to be similar to 2005 at around 300 billion, underpinned by a stable housing market and sustained remortgage activity.
Economic conditions will remain fundamentally supportive, with interest rates remaining low during 2006.
Following two years of growth of assets at the top of our strategic range of 20% - 5% we intend that over the next two to three years the rate of growth of assets will move to the centre of the range, assisting both operational and capital efficiency.
Also as income deferred under IFRS is recognised in the income statement and margins stabilise we expect to see underlying earnings growth move back to at least the centre of our strategic range of 15% - 5% and then converge towards asset growth in the medium term.
Our strategic target for return on equity of 19% to 22% is also confirmed.
Cost efficiency ratios should continue to improve as cost growth returns to below income growth and at the lower end of the target of one half to two thirds of asset growth despite continuing our usual policy of investing in new infrastructure for future capacity and efficiency.
Risk management and credit quality remains paramount to Northern Rocks business, which will remain dominated by good quality prime residential mortgages.
Whilst the extremely benign credit conditions of the last few years are unlikely to continue they are not expected to deteriorate significantly.
This, together with increased focus on arrears management and sound provisioning policies, should ensure that loan loss impairment provisions will not increase markedly.
Capital efficiency will continue to benefit from further sales of securitisation reserve fund risk and in the future by the reduction in capital risk weightings under Basle II.
Our business model remains on track to deliver all of our strategic targets in terms of asset and profit growth, returns on equity and cost efficiency.
This will benefit employees, customers and shareholders.
