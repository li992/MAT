The key exchange rates were as follows: Deferred tax The single largest adjustment arising on the transition to 2004 2005 2005 average average year-end rate IFRS relates to deferred tax.

During 2005, the group increased its cash contributions into the defined benefit pension Goodwill schemes to 3.2 million 2004: 1.5 million.
There are a number of differences in the way goodwill is treated between IFRS and UK GAAP: Adoption of IFRS In most respects, there was a minimal impact on Spectris 1.
Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised over its estimated from the adoption of IFRS.
However, IFRS has introduced useful life.
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but is Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005 13 SPECTRIS 01-17 3 4 06 8:56 pm Page 14 Financial review continued instead subject to an annual impairment test.

Where an acquisition occurs and the conditions for As permitted by the IFRS transitional accounting rules, the recognition of a deferred tax asset are not met at that time, group elected to adopt IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005 but are met at a later date, IFRS requires that an equal and and consequently the comparative period for 2004 has not opposite adjustment to goodwill is made.
In 2004 under been restated to comply with IAS 39.
IAS 39 has impacted on UK GAAP, the group recognised a deferred tax asset of the group in 2005 in three main areas: 12.2 million relating to an earlier acquisition and as a consequence, under IFRS, an additional goodwill charge 1.
Average rate options the group has historically used of 12.2 million has been made in 2004. average rate options to provide a hedge against the groups currency exposures.
Under UK GAAP, the value of the Dividends options was recognised in the profit and loss account in a Under UK GAAP, dividends payable to shareholders were way that matched the gains or losses arising with the period recognised in the profit and loss account in the period to the options were intended to hedge.
IFRS requires that the which they related.
On this basis the 2004 UK GAAP accounts fair value of such derivative financial instruments is included an accrual for the final dividend approved at the recognised on the balance sheet at all times.

As a consequence, the net assets reported by the income statement.

This gives rise to a charge in the accrual for the final dividend declared in 2005 in respect of income statement in 2005 of 1.7 million.
This charge is the year ended 31 December 2004. excluded from the groups adjusted measure of profits and earnings since it is an unrealised loss.

denominated in euros: and an interest portion that changes 2.
Revenue recognition IFRS is similar to UK GAAP but a stream of US dollar fixed interest payments into euro contains specific additional guidance on accounting for fixed interest payments.
Under UK GAAP, the currency 14 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005 SPECTRIS 01-17 3 4 06 8:56 pm Page 15 portion of the swaps was included within the carrying value of the groups borrowings in the balance sheet.
However, the interest portion of the swap was not previously recognised in the group balance sheet.
Aside from the change to the way these financial instruments are presented in the balance sheet, the move to IFRS has required the interest portion of the swap to be carried in the group balance sheet for the first time.
Since it is considered to be ineffective in any hedging relationship, all changes in the fair value of the interest portion of the swap are recognised in the income statement.
At 1 January 2005, the fair value of the interest portion of the swap was a liability of 7.6 million, increasing to a liability of 8.7 million at 31 December 2005.
This gives rise to a charge in the income statement of 1.1 million in 2005.
Over time, as the group continues to make the fixed interest payments due under the swap arrangement, the value of the interest portion of the swap will decrease to nil.
On this basis, changes in its value are considered to be unrealised gains or losses and so are excluded from the groups adjusted measures of profits and earnings.
Forward currency contracts the group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge highly probable forecast future cash flows.
Under UK GAAP, the value of these contracts was recognised at the time when the sale transactions to which they related were recognised.
Under IFRS, the fair value of the forward exchange contracts is required to be recognised on the balance sheet at all times.
Provided the hedges are considered to remain fully effective, the change in the fair value of the forward exchange contracts is recognised in a hedging reserve until the point in time when the sale transactions occur.
At this point, the fair value of the contracts is recognised in the income statement.
This change from UK GAAP to IFRS has not had any impact on the income statement in 2005 but there is an impact on the group balance sheet.
The fair value of the forward exchange contracts at 1 January 2005 of an asset of 0.8 million was recognised in the group balance sheet, reducing to a liability of 0.6 million at 31 December 2005.
1.3 million of this movement was recognised in the hedging reserve and 0.1 million of the movement has been recognised in the income statement in 2005.
