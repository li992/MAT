Currency risk The Groups businesses hedge their known foreign currency transactional exposures by taking out forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group Anthony Rabin Finance Director decided in 2005 not to adopt hedge accounting for its foreign currency transactional exposures.
As a result, there was a charge to profit of less than 1m which would otherwise have been charged to equity.
Balfour Beatty also faces currency exposures on the translation into sterling of the profits and net assets of overseas subsidiaries and associates, primarily in the US and Europe, and on its overseas trading transactions.
Balfour Beatty does not hedge these profit translation exposures as these are an accounting rather than cash exposure.
However, the effect of volatile short-term currency movements on profits is reduced because the Group accounts for currency profits using average exchange rates.
