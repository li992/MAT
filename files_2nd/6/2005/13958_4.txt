Critical Accounting Policies 12 US GAAP US GAAP Impairment of Goodwill In addition to preparing the groups Accounts in accordance FAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets deals with with UK GAAP, the directors are also required to prepare a the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets upon reconciliation of the groups profit or loss and shareholders their acquisition and their subsequent measurement.

The adjustments standard requires that goodwill is not amortised but is tested required to reconcile the groups profit or loss and for impairment at least annually.
Under FAS 142, the shareholders funds from UK GAAP to US GAAP are impairment test is in two stages.
The first step is a screen for explained in Note 34 to the Group Accounts.
Certain of the potential impairment.
This compares an estimate of the fair groups US GAAP accounting policies have been identified as value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill with the critical US GAAP accounting policies and these are discussed carrying value of the net assets including goodwill in the below.
The discussion below should be read in conjunction balance sheet of that reporting unit.
If this identifies a with the full discussion of the differences between the groups potential impairment then the second step is required.
This UK and US GAAP accounting policies set out in Note 34. requires assigning fair values to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit similar to what would be required under US GAAP US Regulatory Assets acquisition accounting.
The difference between the fair value The group prepares its US GAAP financial information in of these net assets and the estimate of the fair value of the accordance with FAS 71 in respect of its regulated US reporting unit as a whole provides an implied fair value of the business, PacifiCorp.
If this implied fair value is less than the carrying In order to apply FAS 71, certain conditions must be value of the goodwill, then goodwill is impaired and an satisfied, including the following: an independent regulator impairment charge requires to be recognised.

A two-step impairment test is also required the capitalised costs, will result from the inclusion of that under FAS 144.
Under FAS 144, undiscounted cash flows for cost in allowable costs for ratemaking purposes.
In addition the long-lived assets of PacifiCorp exceeded their carrying the rate actions should permit recovery of the specific value and accordingly no impairment was triggered.

As the group has met the two conditions The group has applied the provisions of revised IAS 19 2004 within IAS 12 Income Taxes for non-recognition of deferred tax and, as such, actuarial gains and losses relating to these on undistributed profits, no adjustment to the IFRS balance arrangements are recorded directly in retained earnings and sheet has been made in this respect.

In future years, the cost of share Under IFRS, the groups share of the post-tax results of schemes will increase under IFRS 2 as more awards come associates and jointly controlled entities is included within within the scope of the standard.
The amount of future cost operating profit as the operations are closely related to those of will vary depending on the nature of the groups share and the parent and other subsidiaries.
