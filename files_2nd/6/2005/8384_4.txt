The incidence of this risk varies across the different businesses of the Group although the majority of sales and purchases will usually be in the local markets and in functional currency.
Where this is not the case, the Groups businesses are required to hedge 100% of their Adrian Hennah known exposures.
Chief Financial Officer Policy also requires businesses to assess their forecast exposure and hedge an agreed percentage of nonfunctional currency cash flow and also to take action to protect any exposure where a bid is made which involves cash flows in non-functional currencies.
The Group uses forward currency contracts and currency options to manage transaction exposure.
