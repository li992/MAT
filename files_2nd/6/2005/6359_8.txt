governance are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 37 to 39.
THIS REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 21% UPON THE FINAL DIVIDEND FOR THE Pensions YEAR TO 31 DECEMBER 2004.
The group's primary funded defined benefit pension schemes are those operated in the UK, but it also operates such schemes in the Netherlands, Ireland and Canada.
The latest full triennial actuarial assessments of the UK schemes were carried out at 31 March 2005 in respect of the Group 4 scheme and at 31 March 2003 in respect of the Securicor scheme.
These assessments and those of the group's other schemes have been updated to 31 December 2005, including the review of longevity assumptions.
The group's funding shortfall on the valuation basis specified in IAS19 Employee Benefits was 217m before tax or 152m after tax 2004: 220m and 154m respectively.
Although the value of the assets in the funds has increased by 166m since 2004, this was counteracted by a reduction in bond rates, which are used to discount liabilities for IAS19 purposes, and by the impact of an increase in projected longevity.
We believe that, over the very long term in which pension liabilities become payable, improved investment returns should eliminate the deficit in the schemes in respect of past service liabilities.
However, in recognition of the currently reported deficits, an additional cash contribution of 23.5m before tax is being made to the UK schemes in the year commencing 1 January 2006.
Going concern The directors are confident that, after making enquiries and on the basis of current financial projections and available facilities, they have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
