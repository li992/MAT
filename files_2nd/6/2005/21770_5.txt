CO. UK GROUP FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW Significant progress Chris Willford Underlying profit improved GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR to 310.1m, up 11% from 280.4m in 2004.
The Groups profit before tax and loss on sale of discontinued operations improved by 14% to 263.5m 2004: 231.9m.
The increase in profits reects the significant progress the Group has made during the year.
The implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, and the restructuring undertaken by the Group in 2004, complicate the comparison of performance between 2004 and 2005.
The Board believes it is appropriate to assess performance based on the underlying profit of the business which excludes the cost of restructuring and compensation payments and takes accounts of certain changes under IFRS.
Therefore, the discussion of results in this statement uses underlying profit and its components as the measure of performance.
Analysis of the difference between the accounting measures of profit and the underlying profit of the Group is provided on page 12.
Full details of the accounting changes under IFRS are set out in the Appendix.
The increase in underlying profit in 2005 has been delivered through the benets of the restructuring in 2004 and the completion of a rigorous programme of cost reduction in our core business that achieved greater than the planned level of savings.
I am pleased to report that whilst undertaking this programme our Lending and Retail businesses were not diverted and continued to make good progress.
