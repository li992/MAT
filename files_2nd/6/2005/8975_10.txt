Oleg Novachuk Finance Director Summary Listing on London Stock Exchange The major highlight during the year was the successful listing of the Companys shares on the London Stock Exchange.
The shares were listed at 5.40 on 12 October 2005, and by 31 December 2005, had risen 43.2% to 7.74, leading to a market capitalisation of 3.62 billion $6.23 billion at this date.
The Group joined the London benchmark FTSE 100 Index on 19 December 2005. net proceeds of $491.2 million were received by the Company as a result of the Listing.
Financial performance of Kazakh Mining The average realised price of copper cathode increased during the year by 50.1% to $3,794 per tonne in line with the growth commanded by commodities throughout 2005.
The favourable impact on revenues of strongly rising copper prices was offset by the reduced level of contained metal in mined ore and the production difficulties experienced in the first half of the year.
Although revenues and profit before taxation, finance items and negative goodwill increased by 106.2% and 45.6%, respectively, profit margins were slightly depressed as a higher proportion of copper cathodes were produced from purchased concentrate rather than from own concentrate.
A more informed measure for comparing underlying trading performance between 2005 and 2004, EBITDA excluding special items, increased by 35.6% to $1,073.5 million.
Financial performance of MKM Sales volumes at MKM in 2005 were over 70% higher than in the prior year, with growth being driven by wire rod.
Earnings are unaffected by rising copper prices as the copper price component of finished products is passed on to the customer in full.
The conversion margin remained flat due to changed product mix towards lower margin products, continued price pressure in key market segments and, to a lesser degree, product substitution in Europe.
Income tax The effective tax rate for the year was 35.1% compared to a rate of 33.6% in the prior year.
