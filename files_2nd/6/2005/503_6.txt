Operating and Financial Review Local business There are two key objectives that underpin our strategy for the Local business.
The first relates to customer service.
Our customer surveys show that Aggreko is regarded by our customers as providing industryleading levels of service.
The first objective of Rupert Soames our strategy is to create and maintain a clear Chief Executive differentiation between our offering and that of our competitors.
The biggest opportunity for differentiation lies in the attitude and expertise of our staff, the geographic reach of our operations, the availability of a broad range of equipment, and the ability to respond 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
The second objective of our strategy is to be the most efficient specialist rental company.

A key feature of our culture is to devolve responsibility and authority to the lowest point at which we can measure return on capital employed which is the key metric of efficiency in any business as capital intensive as ours.

Aggreko has over 2,000 employees around the world, and they are united by a unique culture.
This culture is hard to describe, but phrases such as customer focused, can-do, completely dependable capture part of the ethos of Aggreko employees.
It has developed through the years, and derives from the fact that very often Aggreko is helping people and businesses to recover from, or to avoid, emergencies or disruption.
Examples include the failure of the power supply to a hospital, or the provision of cooling to a pharmaceutical manufacturer, customers are dependent on Aggreko people to keep things running, often under very difficult circumstances.
Our people are highly skilled and many of them have years of experience.
They are used to reacting quickly, getting the job done professionally and safely, and they always respond well in a crisis.
