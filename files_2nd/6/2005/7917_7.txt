For example, the cost of acrylates used by both National Starch and Paints increased rapidly during 2005.
Higher oil costs impact the petrochemical raw materials bought by the Group.
More details on the types of raw materials bought by ICI are included on page 19 of the annual report and accounts.
ICI was able to pass on these raw material cost increases during 2005.
Energy costs: Approximately 65% of ICIs businesses by sales value manufacture their products using mixing or compounding operations, rather than capital intensive, energy intensive processes, for example, paints, adhesives, electronic materials, flavours and fragrances.
35% are capital and energy intensive processes Uniqema, the starch manufacturing facilities of National Starch and the Regional and Industrial activities in Pakistan and Argentina.
These businesses have some exposure to energy price fluctuations: for example, National Starchs starch operation suffered from significant increases in natural gas prices during 2005.
PTA to paraxylene PX differential margin: the profitability of the Regional and Industrial business in Pakistan is significantly affected by the market price differential between PTA selling prices and the cost of the key PTA feedstock, paraxylene.
