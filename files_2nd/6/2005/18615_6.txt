The development of the former South London Hospital in Clapham comprising 77 units has gone well with 67 reserved or exchanged for a value of 20.3m.
In April we acquired 520 acres of land at West Waterlooville, Hampshire, which were previously held under option.
This has been included in the West of Waterlooville Major Development Area and provisionally allocated 1,550 residential units with a further 1,000 in reserve.
A key element of our progress has been our ability and willingness to work with partners.
At Smiths Dock in North Tyneside we have formed a joint venture with two local landowners to regenerate some 30 acres of waterfront land.
We have submitted an application for detailed planning permission for 1,250 units.
We have made progress on our schemes with Islington Borough Council having now obtained planning consent for our 208 unit scheme at Hornsey Road and the 141 unit scheme in Barnsbury.

3.3m People As this group continues to grow and operate in new market areas it is very important to ensure that we have the personnel and management structure in place to maximise the potential of both our existing asset base and new opportunities.
This year has been one of continued growth and change and we have made three senior appointments Peter Couch, as director of our Equity Release business, Quinton Hill-Lines as director of Corporate Development and, most recently, Richard Exley who has joined as director of Development and who is charged with moving forward this division.
24 Grainger Trust plc Annual report and accounts 2005 In addition we have recently introduced a new Senior Management Structure to ensure that each part of our business is run in accordance with our stated strategy and that we take full advantage of the vast range of knowledge and skills we have within the organisation.
Outlook We remain very confident in the outlook for Grainger.
Our core portfolio is geographically widespread, with a typical value near or below the UK average and is generally unmodernised.
These features help sustain demand in times of market fragility.
As importantly, the reversionary surplus in the portfolio of over half a billion pounds acts as a potential reservoir for future gains.
We will focus on reversionary property for our core portfolio and continue to grow our property and asset management skills so that we can make them more widely available to external investors in the market-rented sector.
We have put in place the products, distribution network and funding capability to support high levels of growth in the home reversion market.
Uncertainty concerning the adequacy of pension provision and the widespread view that house price inflation will be lower in the future should provide the impetus for increased demand.
Home reversion products fit well with other related sectors of the market, for example second homes and retirement living and these may present further opportunities for growth.
We look forward to completing our first German acquisition and are reviewing several other opportunities that should help our European operation to become a meaningful part of the groups business.
We have continued to invest in the development division and have several schemes in the pipeline that will produce attractive returns in the short to medium term.
We are growing this division and are confident that we can use our understanding of local housing markets and management to ensure attractive returns to our shareholders from a wide range of developments in the residential sector.
In the coming year we will continue to progress in these main areas, whilst exploring new opportunities to exploit our skills and asset base.
I am confident that the team we have is well placed to continue at the forefront of residential investment and development in this Rupert Dickinson Chief executive country and in Europe.
We are continuously challenged by new legislation and regulations 20 December 2005 but we will look at these as opportunities rather than threats.
