In this segment we report the results of our UK building and construction activities and International Regional businesses.
Revenue in Construction Services increased by 22 per cent, despite the disposals in 2004 of Crown House and our contracting business in France, which together contributed over 200 million of revenue in 2004.
Progress in this segment is due to healthy growth in the Middle East and Canada, continuing success in our chosen sectors of the UK commercial building market and a strong performance by our Developments business.
Carillion plc Section 04 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Operating and Financial Review 24 Financial Review continued Operating profit increased by 35 per cent and the operating margin rose from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent.
This was achieved despite the effect of introducing, in the second half of 2004, a new method by which we recognise profit on major construction contracts.
Previously, profit was recognised broadly in proportion to revenue after taking account of risks and uncertainties.
In addition, we now take no profit on the first 20 per cent of revenue and this profit is deferred until contracts are completed.
The effect of this in 2005 has been to reduce reported operating profit by 5.4 million 2004: 3.3 million.
Total deferred profit relating to this change at 31 December 2005 was 8.7 million, which we expect to begin releasing to profit in 2007 as contracts reach completion.

Excluding a one-off increase of 7.2m relating to the transfer of rail maintenance to Network Rail.
In this segment we report the results of our activities in rail infrastructure, roads maintenance, facilities management and other support services.
Revenue in Support Services increased by nearly 8 per cent, as the acquisition of PME and organic growth more than offset a reduction in revenue from our rail infrastructure activities.
The latter was largely due to transferring to Network Rail maintenance contracts that generated around 150 million in 2004.
Organic growth was driven primarily by road maintenance in Canada and the UK.
Growth in Canada has been particularly strong following our success in winning contracts in Ontario, where we have established a market leading position.
Since the year-end, we have built on that success by winning a further contract that will extend our operations to Alberta.
Operating profit increased by 0.9 million excluding the 7.2 million one-off increase in profit in 2004, relating to the transfer of rail maintenance to Network Rail and the operating margin reduced from 4.3 per cent to 4.1 per cent, reflecting the loss of rail maintenance contracts, which had higher than average margins in this segment.
PME performed in line with our expectations, contributing 149 million of revenue and 3.5 million of operating profit in the year, following its acquisition in March 2005.
New bank facility In connection with the acquisition of Mowlem plc a new committed bank facility totalling 490 million has been arranged.
Of this amount, 190 million is repayable at the end of five years, 250 million is repayable over five years and 50 million is available for 364 days with a six month term-out option.
Section 04 Carillion plc Operating and Financial Review Annual Report and Accounts 2005 25 Treasury policy and risk management The Group has a centralised Treasury function whose primary role is to manage funding, liquidity and financial risks.
In addition, Treasury sources and administers contract bond and guarantee facilities for the Group.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
The Board sets policies within which Treasury operates that ensure the most effective financing of the Groups operations and limit exposure to financial risk.
The areas of significant financial risk facing the Group relate to funding and liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rates.
Funding and liquidity risk The Groups policy is to avoid carrying significant net debt over the long term.
Carillion plcs principal borrowing facility is a syndicated loan facility led by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and short term overdraft and money market facilities are provided by a group of relationship banks.
Finance and operating leases are also employed to fund longer-term assets.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is regularly reviewed and is designed to satisfy the requirements of the Groups business plan.
Currency risk The Group hedges all significant currency transaction exposures using foreign exchange risk management techniques.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of exchange rate volatility, foreign currency net assets are hedged using matching currency loans, where these assets exceed the On the UK rail network we carry out a equivalent of 10 million.
Profits arising within overseas subsidiaries wide range of projects to upgrade and renew the infrastructure, including track, are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Interest rate risk Borrowing facilities are designed primarily to finance the acquisition of Mowlem plc and short-term working capital requirements and are at floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
The Group has not entered into interest rate derivatives to fix or hedge interest rate risk and none are outstanding.
Certain longer-term assets have been financed using fixed rate leases.
Carillion has equity in a number of PPP joint venture Special Purpose Companies SPC.
SPCs obtain funding for these projects in the form of long-term bank loans or corporate bonds without recourse to the joint venture partners and secured on the assets of the SPC.
A number of SPCs have entered into interest rate derivatives as means of hedging interest rate risk.
These derivatives are interest rate swaps that fix the rate of interest payable and an interest rate cap and collar that limits the maximum and minimum interest rates payable.
Going concern The Directors confirm that, after making enquiries, they have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
