Financial review The IPO provided liquidity for our employee shareholders and a full exit for the 3i Group 3i, which, at the time, was our only institutional shareholder.
Our recent contract awards, particularly in the Engineering & Construction and Operations Services divisions, demonstrate our customers confidence in our capability to undertake larger-scale projects and, as our business has grown, we have enhanced our risk management systems and financial controls.
Following the establishment of our current divisional structure in 2004, we established new divisional boards during the year.
These changes have improved our management of resources and have afforded each of our divisions an increased focus on strategy.
The groups risk review process was further enhanced during the year with the establishment of divisional risk review committees.
These committees provide both an additional layer of review of major proposals, contracts and investments and, within a framework of delegated authorities, are the principal review body for opportunities which are considered lower risk.
We have continued to refine our management reporting systems and 2005 was an important year for the group.
These improvements have After months of intense activity and preparation, resulted in improved communication between our international locations and more efficient and robust processes.
During the year, Petrofac was admitted to the Official List of the we also strengthened our information technology resources and we London Stock Exchange on 7 October following a are in the process of reviewing our IT network infrastructure and the successful IPO.
In December, we were delighted that Petrofac achieved the milestone of admission to the FTSE 250 index of the London Stock Exchange, capping a year of significant growth and corporate development for the group.
