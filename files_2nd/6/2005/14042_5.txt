Finance review Andrew Jenner Finance Director 1.
Introduction 2005 is the first year the Group has reported its results under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
Explanation of the impact of adopting IFRS was provided in the Groups announcement Transition to IFRS Report, which was released on 31 August 2005.
All comparatives throughout this report have been restated under IFRS.
Effective from 1 January 2005, the Group adopted IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Financial performance The Group continued to generate strong organic growth during 2005.
We also benefited from the contributions of ITNET plc ITNET and RCI Holding Corp RCI, which we acquired in February 2005 and March 2005 respectively.
The Groups income statement for 2005 is shown in Figure 1.
This includes the results of our joint ventures, which have been proportionately consolidated.
34 Annual review and accounts 2005 Figure 1: Income statement 2005 2004 Increase m m Revenue 2,260.3 1,636.9 38.1% Gross profit 325.0 242.6 34.0% Administrative expenses before amortisation 214.3 166.2 28.9% Investment revenue and finance costs 19.2 5.2 Profit before tax and intangible amortisation 91.5 71.2 28.5% Intangible amortisation 13.6 7.2 Profit before tax 77.9 64.0 21.7% Tax 23.5 19.5 Profit for the year 54.4 44.5 22.2% Minority interest 1.0 1.0 - Retained earnings 53.4 43.5 22.8% Effective tax rate 30.2% 30.5% Basic earnings per share before intangible amortisation 14.09p 11.46p 22.9% Basic earnings per share 11.66p 10.11p 15.3 % Dividend per share 2.97p 2.63p 12.9% 2.1 Revenue Revenue increased by 38.1% to 2,260.3m.
Excluding the effect of Revenue 337.2m of revenue from our acquisitions in 2005 and 26.0m of 312 2,260 disposals in 2004, our organic revenue growth was 19.4%.
Joint venture revenue increased by 109.8% to 536.1m, primarily reflecting a full year of operation of the Northern Rail franchise, which began in December 2004, and continued growth at AWE.
143 3 191 2.2 Gross margin Gross margin the average contract margin across our portfolio 1,637 26 m was 14.4% in 2005.
2.3 Investment revenue and finance costs Investment revenue and finance costs totalled a net cost of 19.2m 2004 2005 2004: 5.2m.
Included within finance costs was 13.4m of interest on the debt used to fund our acquisitions, the net interest on the assets and liabilities of our defined benefit pension schemes and interest on our underlying net debt, which has reduced compared with 2004.
2.4 Profit before tax and intangible amortisation PBTA Profit before tax and intangible amortisation PBTA increased 28.5% to 91.5m 2004: 71.2m, representing a net 9.3 91.5 margin of 4.0% 2004: 4.3%.
Excluding the profits generated by the 9.3 0.8 acquisitions and their associated funding costs, organic PBTA 71.2 13.4 14.3 m increased by 13.1%.
2.5 Intangible amortisation Intangible amortisation was 13.6m 2004: 7.2m.
The increase results principally from the amortisation of intangible assets acquired with ITNET and RCI, together with the additional amortisation of pensionrelated intangible assets arising from the rights to manage and operate certain of our contracts and franchises.

2.8 Earnings per share EPS Basic EPS before intangible amortisation increased by 22.9% to 14.09p.
Basic EPS increased by 15.3% to 11.66p.
EPS before intangible amortisation and the effect of acquisitions increased by 15.6% to 13.25p, and on a post-amortisation basis increased by 10.4% to 11.16p.
EPS is calculated on an average share base of 458.1m during the year 2004: 430.1m.
The majority of the increase resulted from the issue of 30.4m shares in part consideration for the acquisition of ITNET.
Dividends Our policy is to increase the total dividend per share each year broadly in line with the increase in underlying earnings.
The proposed final dividend of 2.06p per share represents a 13.2% increase on 2004.
The total dividend for the year is 2.97p, an increase of 12.9%.
The dividend will be paid on 17 May 2006 to shareholders on the register at 10 March 2006.
Cash flow Group free cash flow Our cash performance in 2005 was strong, with a 73.8 Group free cash inflow of 73.8m, an increase of 18.0m compared with 2004.
55.8 m 47.0 The Groups cash flow is analysed in Figure 2.
The presentation is consistent with our analysis in previous years 23.5 and is designed to show the true cash performance of the 19.4 14.2 Group the cash flows generated by Sercos subsidiaries, 9.7 8.9 plus dividends received from joint ventures.
It therefore 14.1 11.5 differs from the consolidated cash flow presented on page 74, in which the cash flows of joint ventures have been 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 proportionately consolidated.
The adjustment line in Figure 2 reconciles the movement in Group cash to the consolidated half year full year cash flow.
Figure 2: Cash flow 2005 2004 m m Operating profit excluding joint ventures 62.4 43.5 Non cash items 45.2 32.1 Group EBITDA 107.6 75.6 Working capital movement 11.2 5.3 Group operating cash flow 96.4 70.3 Interest 15.7 3.8 Tax 1.0 1.5 Expenditure on tangible and intangible assets 31.6 23.4 Dividends from joint ventures 25.7 14.2 Group free cash flow 73.8 55.8 Acquisitions 281.7 9.1 Other financing 269.4 7.6 Dividends paid 12.5 10.4 Group non recourse debt financed assets 15.6 25.2 Group net increase in cash and cash equivalents 33.4 3.5 Adjustment to include joint venture cash impacts 4.1 12.8 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 37.5 16.3 Note: Group EBITDA is earnings from subsidiaries before interest, tax, depreciation and intangible amortisation.
36 Annual review and accounts 2005 4.1 Group operating cash flow The Group operating cash inflow for the year was 96.4m 2004: 70.3m, an increase of 37.1%.
This represents a conversion of Group EBITDA into cash of 90% 2004: 93%.
The Groups cash conversion is particularly notable given the level of organic growth, which typically results in a working capital outflow equivalent to one months incremental revenue.
4.2 Tax Tax paid in 2005 was 1.0m, compared with 1.5m in the previous year.
The level of tax paid in 2005 reflects a number of factors, including our continued progress in closing previous years tax returns, with a refund of 8m in the year, as well as residual accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences.
Tax paid in 2004 benefited from a repayment of nearly 7m, as we were able to utilise tax losses in subsidiaries which were previously joint ventures.
From 2006, we expect our tax paid to be close to the tax charge in our income statement.
4.3 Expenditure on tangible and intangible assets Expenditure on tangible and intangible assets was 31.6m 2004: 23.4m.
This represents around 1.8% of revenue excluding joint ventures.
Included within this is 7m of cash spent on designing and building our new SAP accounting system and shared service centre.
This programme of expenditure will continue through 2006 and 2007.
4.4 Dividends from joint ventures Dividends received from joint ventures during 2005 were 25.7m 2004: 14.2m.
This is equivalent to 101% 2004: 78% of our share of joint ventures profit after tax.
The high level of conversion reflects dividend payments made by joint ventures from reserves retained in previous years.
We expect a conversion rate in the range of 70% to 80% going forward.
4.5 Acquisitions The cash outflow in 2005 of 281.7m primarily relates to the acquisitions of ITNET and RCI.
The other significant acquisition during the year was our purchase of the outstanding 50% of Defence Management Holdings Limited DMHL for 5.9m.
DMHL, which owns the special purpose company for the Joint Services Command and Staff College PFI, was previously a joint venture.
4.6 Other financing Other financing of 269.4m primarily relates to the net draw down of loans to fund the acquisitions of ITNET and RCI.
4.7 Group non recourse debt financed assets The 15.6m outflow is the net of expenditure on PFI assets under construction, the movement on non recourse loans and changes in other PFI balances.
Over the life of each PFI contract, we expect these movements to offset each other.
Net debt At 31 December 2005, Group recourse net debt was 264.0m 31 December 2004: 15.3m.
Further analysis is provided in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Net debt As at 31 December 2005 2004 m m Group - cash and cash equivalents 210.0 173.9 Group - recourse debt 453.1 168.4 Group - obligations under finance leases 20.9 20.8 Group recourse net debt 264.0 15.3 Joint venture recourse net cash debt 18.0 4.6 Total recourse net debt 246.0 19.9 Group non recourse debt 326.8 256.5 Joint venture non recourse debt 22.4 47.1 Total non recourse debt 349.2 303.6 Total net debt 595.2 323.5 www.
com 37 Business review | finance review 5.1 Group recourse net debt The strength of our cash flow resulted in a reduction in Group recourse net debt in the second half of the year, from 315.2m at 30 June 2005 to 264.0m at the year end.
The net increase in the Groups other loans during the year reflects the debt funding for the acquisitions of ITNET and RCI.
These loans have covenants consistent with our private placements and allow sufficient headroom to fund known commitments and working capital requirements.
5.2 Group non recourse debt Group non recourse debt, which we have utilised to fund PFI assets and the acquisition of the DES franchise, increased during the year to 326.8m 31 December 2004: 256.5m.
This was the result of our acquisition of the remaining 50% share of DMHL.
Since the acquisition, we have consolidated 100% of DMHLs non recourse debt in our balance sheet.
The increase was partly offset by the scheduled repayments of debt across all our non recourse debt funded projects.
The Groups debt is non recourse if no Group company other than the relevant borrower - typically a special purpose company for a PFI - has an obligation to repay the debt under a guarantee or other arrangement.
The debt is excluded from all of our credit agreements and other covenant calculations, and therefore has no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Pensions To assist understanding of the complexities of accounting for pension schemes under IFRS, we have provided an overview.
Further detail was provided in our announcement Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, on 31 August 2005.
Figure 4: Defined benefit pension schemes As at 31 December 2005 2004 m m Group schemes - non contract specific 200.4 164.6 Contract specific schemes - reimbursable 84.9 56.0 - not certain to be reimbursable 21.3 22.3 Net retirement benefit liabilities 306.6 242.9 Intangible asset arising from rights to operate franchises and contracts 19.0 21.2 Reimbursable rights debtor 84.9 56.0 Deferred tax asset 52.8 41.0 Net balance sheet position 149.9 124.7 The total pension cost included within PBTA for 2005 was 55.6m 2004: 39.5m.
At the year end, the net amount included in the balance sheet arising from our obligations in respect of defined benefit pension schemes was 149.9m 31 December 2004: 124.7m.
Further analysis is provided in Figure 4.
Under IFRS, Serco has three main types of scheme which are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.
Each type has its own accounting treatment under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
These are: Schemes which do not relate to specific contracts or franchises - principally the Group scheme.
For these schemes, the actuarial gain or loss for the period is charged to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense the SORIE Schemes relating to specific contracts or franchises, where the deficit will pass back to the customer or to the next contractor at the end of the relevant contract.
For these schemes, the actuarial gain or loss for the period is charged to the SORIE, and a recoverable intangible asset is recognised on the balance sheet and amortised to the income statement over the contract or franchise life, and The AWE contract, where there is a right of cost reimbursement, and where the pension scheme deficit and offsetting debtor are both included in the balance sheet.
38 Annual review and accounts 2005 The increase in net liabilities during the year resulted primarily from the reduction in the AA bond rate, which increased the liabilities on all defined benefit pensions.
These increases, together with the related deferred tax movement, have been reflected in the SORIE.
Figure 5: Pension assumption sensitivities Change in assumption Change in liability Discount rate 0.5% 10 % 0.5 % 11% Price inflation 0.5% 8% 0.5 % 7 % Salary 0.5% 3% 0.5 % 3 % Longevity Increase by one year 2.5% Figure 5 shows the approximate sensitivities of the liabilities on our defined benefit pension schemes to movements in the discount rate, and to changes in our actuarial assumptions regarding the rate of inflation, the rate of increase of scheme members salaries and life expectancies.
The main Group defined benefit pension scheme accounts for around two thirds of our net balance sheet position.
In recent years, we have taken action to manage the liabilities of the Group scheme.
We have closed the scheme to new members, other than those joining the Group as a result of TUPE transfers.
We increased employer contributions to the scheme from 2003, and employee contributions from 2004.
We have also introduced annual actuarial valuations, which ensure that we have up-to-date information on the position of the scheme.
During 2006, in conjunction with the schemes trustees, we will further consider the funding and risk profile of the Group scheme.
Acquisitions We completed the acquisition of ITNET on 3 February 2005.
The consideration of 245.5m comprised 171.3m of cash and 30.4m shares worth 74.2m.
The acquisition gave rise to goodwill of 260.9m, including fair value adjustments and acquisition costs of 28.1m.
Intangible assets arising on the acquisition have been recognised at 20.6m and will be amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected life of eight years.
From the date of ownership ITNET contributed 190.6m to revenue and 14.3m to PBTA.
Our acquisition of RCI was completed on 21 March 2005 for consideration of 116.3m in cash.
The acquisition gave rise to goodwill of 93.7m, including fair value adjustments and acquisition costs of 7.0m.
Intangible assets arising on the acquisition have been recognised at 2.2m and will be amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected life of five years.
From the date of ownership, RCI contributed 143.3m to revenue and 9.3m to PBTA.
Our other acquisitions during the year, principally the 50% of DMHL, contributed 3.3m to revenue and 0.8m to PBTA.
PFIs 8.1 PFI portfolio The Group has a portfolio of 11 PFI projects.
We have operating contracts for all our PFIs, and equity investments in ten.
Following our purchase of 50% of DMHL, we now own 100% of eight of our PFI projects.
8.2 Accounting for PFI contracts In March 2005, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC issued a draft interpretation on accounting for service concession arrangements.
These are arrangements such as PFIs, under which a government or other body grants contracts for the supply of public services such as prisons or hospitals to private operators.
The IFRIC is still working towards a final interpretation, which it expects to publish in the second half of 2006. www.
com 39 Business review | finance review In the absence of specific guidance within IFRS, from 1 January 2005 we have recognised our PFI debtors at amortised cost, as defined by IAS 39.
This maintains an accounting treatment consistent with UK GAAP and existing IFRS.
The draft guidance from IFRIC, if it were issued in final form, could require a number of changes to the accounting treatment of service concession arrangements.
This could result in a significant increase in the carrying value of the Groups PFI debtors.
Treasury 9.1 Credit facilities and liquidity management The 420m bank credit facility we used to provide funding for the acquisitions of ITNET and RCI comprises a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility.
As at 31 December 2005, term loans totalling 279m were outstanding and the revolving credit facility was undrawn.
The bank facility has covenants and obligations typical of these types of arrangement, is unsecured and expires in December 2009.
Loans drawn under the bank facility accrue interest at a rate of 50 basis points over LIBOR.
Serco has also issued loan notes under two private placements.
The first, for 43.2m, matures in December 2007.
The second, for 117m, amortises evenly from 2011 to 2015.
9.2 Impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 effective from 1 January 2005.
Adopting IAS 39 resulted in a reduction in our opening net assets of 27.1m.
This principally represents a fair value loss from marking to market the interest rate swaps we use to hedge the interest obligations of PFI special purpose companies into fixed rate obligations, and the cross-currency swaps used to hedge long term loan notes.
All designated hedges are highly effective and, as a result, the impact on the income statement for the period was immaterial.
Further details of the effect of applying IAS 32 and IAS 39 can be found in our announcement of 31 August 2005, Transition to IFRS Report.

of duties Our staff receive ongoing training and career development to improve their skills, and our 42 Annual review and accounts 2005 Corporate responsibility Corporate responsibility which encompasses safety, people, community and the environment is fundamental to the way Serco operates.
The emphasis we place on these matters reflect their importance to those we come into contact with during the course of our activities.
And corporate responsibility is also good business practice, which we believe will ultimately help us deliver better returns to our shareholders.
The responsibilities of our Corporate Assurance Group CAG, which reports directly to the Board, include developing and overseeing our corporate responsibility activities.
Our corporate responsibility model, which is described in detail in our separate Corporate Responsibility report, encompasses four elements: Safety recognising our legal responsibility for the safety of our staff and the general public for whom we have a duty of care People addressing our legal and moral responsibility for our employees Community addressing our social responsibility for the communities within which we operate Environment recognising our legal and moral responsibility to protect the environment from damage as a direct result of our operations and to promote activities to protect and sustain the wider environment.
For 2005, we set three targets or objectives in each of these four areas, giving a total of 12.
We achieved, or are on track to achieve, 11 of the 12, and made progress towards achieving the 12th.
Further details of our performance, and the new targets and objectives for 2006, are included in the Corporate Responsibility report.
CAG reports formally to the Executive Chairman and to the Board on a quarterly basis providing analyses of performance against our assurance targets and also advises the Board regarding policy and future activities to enhance best practice around the organisation.
CAG undertook reviews of internal controls during 2005 including health, safety and environmental management.
As a result, CAG has included a number of activities in its programme for 2006 to strengthen the Groups performance in these areas.
