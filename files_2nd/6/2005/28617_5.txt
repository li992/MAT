com Report and accounts 2005 Page 13 Pension schemes Both UK and international accounting standards now require that the net assets or net liabilities of defined benefit pension schemes are included in the balance sheet of the sponsoring company and group.
The gross deficits calculated for accounting rather than funding purposes for both the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and Laurence Keen Scheme total 18.71 million at 31 December 2005 2004: 14.98 million.
The increase in accounting deficit reflects an increase in the calculated pension liability due to the decrease in corporate bond yields, the use of mortality tables that reflect improved longevity and an assumption of higher salary increases based on historical experience.
As mentioned in the chief executives report, we are looking for the most tax effective way of funding the deficit in the Rathbone 1987 scheme.
