FINANCIAL REVIEW The Groups strong balance sheet at the year end has been further strengthened by the proceeds of the disposal of the vehicle rental division in February 2006.
The Group is therefore well positioned to take advantage of opportunities to invest through both organic growth and acquisition.
STEVE LONSDALE GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR FINANCE FINANCIAL REVIEW DELIVERING The Group delivered a robust financial performance in 2005.
Against the background FINANCIAL STRENGTH of substantially higher fuel prices and the end of a significant UK rail franchise, Arriva Trains Northern ATN, in December 2004, earnings per share, excluding goodwill impairment, intangible asset amortisation and exceptional items were broadly maintained, at 45.0p 2004: 45.1p.
The improvement in basic earnings per share, at 43.7p 2004: 42.6p demonstrated the financial resilience of the Group, the increasing contribution from our growing mainland Europe operations, and reflected a reduced tax charge.
This report represents the first set of annual results prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The transition to IFRS has not had a material impact on cash flow or reported profits except for changes to amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets.
Adjustments to the balance sheet, particularly in respect of accounting for pension schemes, were more substantial.
We have continued to make substantial investments for future growth, making use of the strong cash generation that our business provides.
The financial position of the Group remained strong at year end, whilst the 129 million disposal of the vehicle rental division in February 2006 has provided additional resources to assist the future development of the Group.
