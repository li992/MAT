Financial review Balance Sheet Capital expenditure within the core JJB business for the 53 weeks ended 30 January 2005 was 43.0 million, compared to 30.5 million in the comparative period.
The total expenditure of 43.0 million includes 16.9 million on newly opened stores and health clubs, a further 11.2 million on stores and health clubs to open after 30 January 2005, 7.7 million on existing stores and 3.2 million on new computer equipment and EPOS tills.
The capital expenditure on existing stores includes 3.5 million incurred on refitted and refreshed stores: the net book value of tangible fixed assets which have been scrapped in these stores amounted to 1.6 million and has been written off in operating expenses.
Stock levels have reduced by 12.0 per cent to 112.7 million at 30 January 2005 compared to 128.1 million at 25 January 2004 as a result of the successful clearance of excess clothing stocks.
Partly as a result of the reduction in the level of stock, the net cash inflow from operating activities improved by 26.3 million to 104.0 million.
Net funds at 30 January 2005 amounted to 4.4 million compared to a net debt of 3.6 million at 25 January 2004.
Following a Tender Offer, in February 2004, we announced that a total of 7.25 million ordinary shares had been acquired and cancelled by the Company at a price of 280 pence per share, a cost of 20.8 million.
Financial risks and treasury policies The key financial risks faced by the company are the security of existing funds, the ongoing availability of new funds and fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
The following treasury policies, approved by the Board of Directors, are adopted in order that these risks are effectively managed.
Liquidity risk management The Group manages its cash and funding requirements centrally with the objective of maximising interest income and minimising interest expense.
Investments of cash surpluses are made with banks which must satisfy credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board of Directors.
Short term funding requirements are supported by a committed 100 million revolving credit bank facility which expires in June 2005.
The amount drawn on the revolving credit facility at 30 January 2005 was 25 million which compares to 85 million at 25 January 2004.
The undrawn facility, being the difference between the amount drawn at any one date and 100 million, has been retained in order to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
10 Management are currently in discussion with the Groups bankers to put in place a new revolving credit bank facility to replace the existing facility on its expiry date.
Interest rate risk management The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and the revolving credit bank facility.
Interest chargeable on the bank facility is based on floating rates linked to LIBOR.
No interest rate hedging agreement is in place over the bank facility because the Board continues to believe that, given the current interest rate environment, fluctuations in interest rates do not pose a significant risk to the Group.
Foreign currency risk management Stock levels A significant proportion of the Groups trading activities are payable and receivable in sterling and only have reduced approximately 25 million per annum is payable in dollars.
Until December 2004, dollars were being by 12 per cent bought and held in a dollar bank account, equivalent at any one time to the value of approximately 3 months to 112.7 million.
Since December 2004, the Group has entered into a series of forward dollar contracts to provide dollars at a fixed rate of exchange to meet the Groups requirements for six months in advance.
Share buy-backs We obtained the authority from shareholders to purchase up to 5 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company at the time of the AGM on 9 July 2004: this authority will expire at the time of the 2005 AGM in July 2005.
After the Tender Offer in February 2004 where 7.25 million ordinary shares were acquired and cancelled at a cost of 20.8 million, no further share buy-backs have been undertaken by the Company.
11 Financial review continued The Board believes that the primary call on the Groups surplus cash flows should continue to be the further expansion of the chain of combined health club superstores and the development and refurbishment of our retail store chain after which we will consider a further buy back of shares, if that is earnings enhancing.
We will seek a renewal of the authority to purchase up to 5 per cent of the issued share capital at the 2005 AGM, which will then be in place for the following 12 months.
Dividend Despite the reduction in underlying headline earnings per ordinary share, the Board has proposed a final dividend of 7.0 pence net per ordinary share, payable on 18 July 2005 to shareholders recorded on the share register on 10 June 2005.
This dividend, together with the interim dividend of 3.0 pence per share already paid, leaves the total dividend for the accounting period just ended at 10.0 pence which is identical to the total dividend per share paid in the comparative period.
Dividend cover based on underlying headline earnings per ordinary share for the accounting period just ended is 2.0 times and the yield, based on the share price of 208 pence at 28 January 2005, is 4.8 per cent.
Share Capital Details of the share capital and movements during the accounting period ended 30 January 2005 are described in note 22 in the Notes to the financial statements on page 48.
The share price of the ordinary shares at the close of business on 28 January 2005 was 208p, representing an equity market capitalisation of approximately 480 million.
This represents a decrease of 19 per cent from the price of 256p at 23 January 2004.
Following the announcement of the Preliminary results on 13 April 2005, the closing share price was 214p.
On 18 May 2005, the date on which declarable interests have been disclosed in the Directors report, the share price was 190p.
Office of Fair Trading In August 2003, the Office of Fair Trading OFT pronounced JJB guilty of price-fixing of certain replica kit products over a two year period during 2000 and 2001 and levied a penalty of 8.4 million.
We lodged an appeal to the independent Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT against the OFT's decision on liability and against the level of the penalty itself.
The appeal against liability was heard in March 2004 and the result announced in October 2004.
In the CAT's judgment on liability, JJB was successful on one of the grounds of appeal, partly successful on another and unsuccessful on the remaining two grounds.
12 The appeal against the level of the penalty was heard by the CAT in January 2005 and its decision was announced on 19 May 2005.
Whilst we were pleased to note that the CAT had reduced the level of the OFT penalty from 8.4 million to 6.7 million we were disappointed in the amount of the reduction.
We do not believe that it fully reflects the findings made in JJBs favour by the CAT in the liability judgment which allowed JJB's appeal in respect of one ground of appeal and partly allowed JJB's appeal in respect of another ground.
Consequently, we intend to make an application to the CAT for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the CATs judgments in relation both to important aspects of its liability judgment of October 2004 and on the level of the penalty itself.
Until the publication of our Interim results for the 26 weeks ended 25 July 2004, we had not previously made any provision in the accounts in respect of the penalty on the grounds that we believed that we had not breached any part of the Competition Act.
However, following the decision of the CAT which was announced in October 2004, we accepted, on the basis of legal advice, that it was then appropriate to make a provision in the accounts of 2 million in respect of a penalty.
The decision of the CAT on JJBs appeal against the Total dividend for level of the penalty, which was announced on 19 May 2005, does not alter our views on the adequacy the accounting of the 2 million provision and based upon legal advice, the Board still regard 2 million as being an period has been adequate provision to make in our accounts.
