TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Finance directors report For the year ended 31 December 2005 Introduction The accounts for 2005 are presented under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
As a result the 2004 comparatives have been restated.
A commentary on profits, cash flows and net assets is provided below.
Whilst note 38 to the accounts includes detailed information about the reconciliation between IFRS and UK GAAP, a short summary is shown below.
Additionally this report sets out further details of the financial aspects of the groups strategy, risks and policies.
Financial objectives The directors of the company are committed to the long-term creation of shareholder value, which they believe is achieved through: Increasing the groups market share through a combination of like-for-like sales growth and targeted expansion through acquisitions, brown field openings and in-store development: Improving profitability with a medium term target for profit growth in percentage terms exceeding that for sales: Investing in projects and acquisitions where the pre-tax return on capital employed exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of the group by a minimum of four per cent: Generating sufficient free cash flow to enable the group to expand its operations whilst funding attractive returns to shareholders, reducing its debt and pension deficit: Operating an efficient balance sheet, by structuring sources of capital to minimise the groups weighted average cost of capital consistent with maintaining an investment grade financial profile with interest cover between four and six times EBITA: and Maintaining long-term dividend cover at between two and a half and three and a half times earnings.
20 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC To ensure the business is focused upon achievement of targets, a series of key financial performance indicators are monitored throughout the business: IFRS IFRS UK GAAP UK GAAP UK GAAP 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Sales growth 44.4% 9.0% 18.4% 10.8% 8.3% Profit before tax growth 0.1% 16.0% 18.9% 23.7% 24.2% Merchanting operating profit to sales 11.3% 11.9% 11.4% 11.2% 10.1% Interest cover note 10 4.9x 25.9x 21.0x 18.0x 12.0x Return on capital note 36 14.4% 25.0% 25.5% 24.0% 21.5% Free cash generation note 35 226.1m 150.7m 128.1m 105.6m 46.7m Dividend cover 3.4x 4.1x 4.5x 4.7x 4.5x Excludes goodwill amortisation in 2001 to 2003.
Financial review Overall group turnover increased by 44.4 per cent to 2,640.8 million from 1,828.6 million in 2004 with Wickes contributing 41.6 per cent of the increase.
Sales growth of 2.8 per cent in the merchanting business was due to a combination of sales from new branch openings of 4.1 per cent offset by one less working day, 0.4 per cent and lower like-for-like sales per working day of 0.9 per cent comprising 4.3 per cent of price inflation and 5.2 per cent decline in volume.
Like-forlike sales in Wickes core products were down 6.8 per cent whilst showroom sales fell by 13.6 per cent.
Overall like-for-like sales in Wickes were down 7.9 per cent.
Group operating profit rose 23.1 per cent to 268.0 million from 217.7 million in 2004.
Group operating margin was 10.1 per cent, compared to 11.9 per cent for 2004.
This reflects the dilutive effect of our continued merchanting expansion programme, the inclusion of Wickes, retail margins being traditionally lower than those enjoyed by the merchanting industry due to higher overheads, and the effect of weaker markets.
Compared to 2004, merchanting operating margins were 0.6 per cent lower, whilst Wickes saw a fall of 1.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent for the 12 month period to 31 December 2005 compared to their underlying pre-acquisition performance in the year to 31 October 2004.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and goodwill amortisation EBITDA as defined in note 37 were 322.5 million 2004: 251.1 million, an increase of 28.4 per cent.
Total net interest expense before other finance costs of 3.7 million 2004: 2.8 million in 2005 was 57.6 million 2004: 8.4 million.
The rise in interest expense is attributable to the additional borrowings arising from the acquisition of Wickes.
Interest cover as defined in note 10 is approximately 4.9 times 2004: 25.9 times.
Group profit before tax was just ahead of last year at 206.7 million 2004: 206.5 million.
The tax charge was 65.9 million 31.9 per cent compared with 64.4 million 31.2 per cent in 2004.
The rate is higher than the UK corporation tax rate of 30 per cent principally because of the effect of non-qualifying property expenditure and other items which are not 21 allowable for tax.
Basic earnings per share were 116.8 pence, compared with 124.4 pence in 2004, reflecting the impact of the issue of shares in connection with Wickes.
TRA VIS PERKINS PLC International Financial Reporting Standards reconciliation to UK GAAP The introduction of IFRS has had a limited impact upon the groups results and net assets and no impact on its cash flows.
The principal differences have arisen from the: Profit reconciliation treatment of property leases, with some leases being capitalised in the m balance sheet under IFRS: Profit before tax under 2005 UK GAAP 210.2 timing of recognition of proposed dividends in the accounts no longer Leases IAS 17 1.8 accrued at year end : Business Combinations IFRS 3 1.0 non-amortisation of goodwill under IFRS: Derivatives IAS 39 0.9 recognition of certain deferred tax liabilities under IFRS: Other 0.2 valuation of the brand name: and Profit before tax per the accounts under IFRS 206.7 Excludes goodwill amortisation treatment of interest rate derivatives.
Cash flow The group has also benefited from specific actions designed to generate cash from its larger scale.
In 2005 the group has generated 310.8 million of cash from operations 2004: 222.9 million, an increase of 39.4 per cent.
Free cash flow, calculated before expansionary capital expenditure, special pension contributions and dividends, as defined in note 35 was 226.1 million, up 50.0 per cent from 2004.
The free cash generated by the group was used in part to fund expansion capital expenditure in the existing business and on new acquisitions, which, excluding Wickes, in total cost 84.7 million 2004: 68.3 million.
Pensions Improved asset returns offset by the effects of falling corporate bond rates and 26.0 million of company contributions in excess of the income statement charge 2004: 25.8 million has reduced the gross pension scheme deficit for the Travis Perkins final salary scheme at 31 December 2005 to 100.8 million 2004: 128.3 million.
The net deficit, after allowing for deferred tax, was 70.5 million compared with 89.8 million at 31 December 2004.
The company has closed the scheme to all new employees from 1 February 2006.
New employees are offered a money purchase scheme.
In acquiring Wickes, the group adopted the Wickes final salary scheme, which was closed to new members.
After a 3.6 million special contribution in September 2005, the gross deficit on the Wickes scheme at 31 December 2005 was 42.0 million, down by 3.4 million from the date of acquisition.
The actuary has recently performed a full valuation of the Travis Perkins final salary scheme as at 30 September 2005 and the directors are now seeking to reach agreement with the Trustees on future contribution rates.
It is the companys intention to apply this approach to the Wickes scheme and consider merging the two schemes in due course.
Equity Total equity, after deducting the pension scheme deficit at 31 December 2005, was 758.0 million, an increase of 107.4 million on 31 December 2004.
In July 2005 the groups employee share ownership plan purchased 500,000 shares, of nominal value 50,000, for a total consideration of 8.1 million.
The groups equity balances are stated net of these.
The shares were acquired through an actively traded market and on an arms length basis to satisfy share options under the groups incentive plans.
By 31 December 2005, 5,573 shares had been re-issued.
22 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC The groups return on capital in 2005 as defined in note 36 was 14.4 per cent 2004: 25.0 per cent, which is substantially higher than the groups weighted average cost of capital.
At the year-end the share price was 1,400 pence 2004: 1,733 pence and the market capitalisation 1,698 million 2004: 2,089 million, representing 2.2 times 2004: 3.2 times shareholders funds.
Goodwill The net book value of goodwill in the balance sheet is 1,273.8 million.
Additions to goodwill and intangible assets in the year totalled 1,131.5 million of which 1,101.7 million, including 162.5 million in respect of the brand, related to Wickes.
Capital structure At 31 December 2005 the group had net debt of 982.4 million 2004: 30.7 million.
On completion of the acquisition of Wickes on 11 February 2005 a new 1.2 billion credit facility was drawn from The Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Capital and, with the exception of 25 million of overdraft facilities, all other facilities previously advanced to the group were either repaid or withdrawn.
The new facility was syndicated on 23 March 2005 to an additional 14 UK and overseas banks.
The facility comprised a 500 million five-year term loan and a five-year 700 million revolving credit facility.
Included within the net debt of the group are 32.7 million of finance leases 2004: 18.6 million capitalised under IFRS.
These primarily relate to finance leases on properties for trading sites.
In addition to the property leases the group had 3.6 million 2004: nil of finance leases associated with plant and equipment.
Borrowings also include 8.2 million 2004: 9.0 million of unsecured loan notes, which are redeemable at six monthly intervals ending in June 2015.
Interest on these loan notes is determined at 6 monthly intervals by reference to LIBOR.
0.8 million of loan notes issued during 2002 were settled during the year.
During 2005, two amortising interest rate swaps of 180 million and 171.5 million respectively and one amortising interest rate floor and one amortising interest rate cap of 171.5 million each have been entered into by the group to manage the interest rates associated with bank borrowings.
The interest rate cap and floor arrangements act in unison to provide an interest rate collar for the borrowing element.
The two interest rate swaps fix the interest rate at 4.935 per cent and 4.9575 per cent respectively and the collar derivative operates between a floor of 4.205 per cent and a cap of 5.7 per cent.
The groups current hedging policy is to maintain the profile of borrowings in the approximate ratio of one third to one half at fixed interest rates, one third to one sixth within a collar of interest rates and the remainder at variable rates.
New borrowing facilities Following the acquisition of Wickes, which was financed from sources in the banking market in the United Kingdom, the group embarked upon a programme to diversify its debt sources and lengthen the maturity of debt repayments.
In December 2005, the group raised $400 million through a private placement of fixed rate guaranteed unsecured notes the Notes with a broad range of US financial institutions.
As a result of strong demand for the Notes 23 the group was pleased to raise $150 million more than its initial target.
The debt comprises of $200 million of the Notes repayable in 7 years and the remainder in 10 years resulting in bullet repayments becoming due in 2013 and 2016.
TRA VIS PERKINS PLC The net proceeds, which were received on 26 January 2006, have been swapped into Sterling at variable rates, and have been used to refinance approximately half of the groups existing 500 million term loan reducing it to 270 million.
The term loan is now due to be repaid in four 43.2 million and two 48.6 million tranches six monthly commencing 30 June 2007, with the final payment due on 10 February 2010.
The revolving credit facility is available to the group until 10 February 2010.
As part of the process of reviewing the terms and structure of its debt, the group has also reached agreement with its banking syndicate to bring the financial covenants on the remaining 970 million of its UK bank facility in line with those on the US private placement, increasing the groups flexibility.
The transaction exposes the group to interest rate and currency risks.
To address these risks the group entered into five cross currency swaps on 2 December 2005.
These fix the amounts receivable and payable under the private placement to a set Sterling value of 231 million and the interest rate swaps convert the fixed interest liability to a floating interest rate based upon the six month LIBOR rate.
The overall effective borrowing cost of the group is slightly below six per cent.
Liquidity As at 31 December 2005 the group had bank borrowings totalling 994 million, consisting of a term loan of 500 million and 494 million of draw down on the revolving credit facility.
The peak level of daily borrowings on a cleared basis in the year to 31 December 2005 was 1,117 million.
Throughout the year the maximum month end cleared borrowings were 1,036 million.
The groups borrowings are subject to covenants set by the lenders that must be complied with.
Covenant compliance is measured semi-annually using financial results prepared under UK GAAP extant at 31 December 2004.
During 2005 there were no breaches of the covenant limits.
The key financial covenants are the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA and the ratio of earnings before interest tax and amortisation EBITA to net interest.
At 31 December 2005 under UK GAAP the group achieved net debt to EBITDA of 2.9x see note 37 and interest cover 4.9x see note 10.
In addition to these financial covenants the groups borrowing agreements include general covenants and potential events of default.
The group has complied in all respects with the terms of its borrowing agreements at the date of this report.
Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the group is managed.
In the course of its business, the group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The group manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the board of directors and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Treasury activities are managed centrally under a framework of policies and procedures approved by and monitored by the board.
The objectives are to protect the assets of the group and to identify and then manage financial risk.
In applying these policies, the group will utilise derivative instruments, but only for risk management purposes.
Under the policies, derivative financial instruments may only be entered into for risk management purposes with Aor better rated financial institutions.
A total of six such institutions have been identified as potentially suitable for this purpose.
The principal risk facing the group is an exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Having swapped out its US dollar Notes, the group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange risk as most purchases are invoiced in Sterling.
These risks are described further below: Interest rate risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, US dollar Notes and loan notes.
The group borrows in Sterling at floating rates and, where necessary, uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates see note 25 to generate the preferred interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
24 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Currency risk The group usually buys currency at spot rates.
While this was the situation during 2005, forward contracts may be purchased where appropriate.
As previously stated the group has borrowed $400 million.
The US dollar denominated notes have fixed rates of interest.
The borrowings have been converted to Sterling variable rates using currency swaps.
Liquidity risk The groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund on-going operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a term loan and a revolving credit facility and by US institutions in the form of US dollar denominated Notes.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, shortterm bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history and account customers are given credit limits that are monitored.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with A - rated authorised counter parties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counter party exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counter party are within predetermined limits.
Overall, the group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Other risks and uncertainties Market conditions and competitive pressures The groups products are sold to tradesmen and retail customers for a broad range of end uses in the build environment.
The performance of the market is affected by general economic conditions and a number of specific drivers of construction activity, including key drivers, housing transactions, house price inflation, consumer confidence, interest rates and unemployment.
The board conducts an annual review of strategy, which includes an assessment of likely competitor activity, market forecasts and possible future trends in products, channels of distribution and customer behaviour.
Significant events including those in the supply chain that may affect the group are monitored by the group strategy director and reported to the board monthly by the group CEO.
Market trends and competitor performance are also tracked on an ongoing basis and reported to the board each month.
Product availability and product prices Security of supply of products and product quality are monitored by product category directors in the merchant and retail businesses.
Supplier financial strength, product quality and service levels are monitored on a continuous basis.
An annual risk assessment with recovery plans is prepared for the major suppliers across the group.
No supplier accounts for more than 7 per cent of total purchases in 2005.
An established QA process is in place in the retail business and has been launched for the merchanting business during 2005.
The market price of products distributed by the group, particularly commodity products can vary significantly and affect operating results.
The groups business actively takes steps to protect themselves from and maximise the opportunities for significant anticipated price rises.
25 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Acquisitions and other expansion Growth by acquisition continues to be an important part of the strategy of the group.
Significant risk can arise from acquisitions in terms of the initial valuation, the integration programme and the ongoing management of the acquisition.
Detailed internal analysis of the market position of major acquisition targets is undertaken and valuations are completed using discounted cash flow financial models.
Independent advisors are used to comment on the strategic implications and the assumptions in valuation models for larger acquisitions.
A rolling programme of post acquisition audits is completed and reviewed at the board each year.
Human resources The ability to recruit and retain staff at all levels of the group is an important driver of our overall performance.
Salaries and other benefits are benchmarked annually to ensure that the group remains competitive.
A recruitment toolkit is available for both merchant and retail brand branches.
A wide-range of training programmes are in place to encourage staff development and management development programmes are used to assist those identified for more senior positions.
The HR director monitors staff turnover by job type and reports to the board annually.
Succession plans are established for the most senior positions within the group and these are reviewed annually.
Information technology business continuity The operations of the group depend on a wide range of IT systems to operate efficiently.
An IT strategy committee reviews performance levels of the key systems and prioritises development work.
Maintenance is undertaken on an ongoing basis to ensure resilience of the company systems and escalation procedures are in place to resolve any performance issues at an early stage.
An IT disaster recovery plan exists and is tested regularly together with the business continuity plan with arrangements in place for alternative data sites for both merchanting and retail businesses.
Off-site back-up routines are in place for both data centres and application code is also held off-site.
The group distributes products from five major warehouses in Great Britain.
The loss of any single warehouse through fire or other major incident could have a material effect on the availability of product in the merchant and retail outlets.
Each warehouse has fire detection and alarm systems and a business continuity plan is in place for each site.
Customer credit Within our merchanting businesses, one of the key service aspects is the provision of credit to customers and the group carries the associated credit risk.
A detailed review of the credit risk of each customer is carried out using external credit risk services.
Total exposures to all customers are monitored monthly with increased credit levels being approved by both operational and financial management.
No one customer represents more than 1 per cent of sales and the bad debt charge has averaged below 0.5 per cent of sales in the last 10 years.
Pensions The risks in this area relate to the potential for contributions required to meet the benefits promised rising to a level that restricts other corporate activity.
The schemes and the group obtain independent actuarial advice and formal valuations are carried out at least every three years.
The Trustees receive reports on the investment performance quarterly.
The Travis Perkins final salary scheme has recently been closed to all new members.
Recent actuarial valuations showed that on a continuing valuation basis the Travis Perkins scheme and the Wickes scheme to be 62 per cent and 83 per cent funded respectively.
