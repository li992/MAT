Operating and financial review and prospects The Operating and financial review and prospects discusses the operating and financial performance, the financial outlook and the financial resources of the Group.
The results for each year, which have been prepared under IFRS, as adopted for use in the European Union, are compared primarily with the results for the preceding year under the following headings: Financial trends and ratios 56 2005 Year results for the year to 31st December 2005 compared to the year to 31st December 2004 57 Financial position and resources at 31st December 2005 66 Outlook and Risk Factors 71 2004 Year results for the year to 31st December 2004 compared to the year to 31st December 2003 75 The reconciliation to US accounting principles is set out in Note 38 to the financial statements.
Accounting presentation With effect from 1st January 2005, GSK has moved to reporting its financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as required by a European Union Regulation issued in 2002.
This report is prepared under IFRS, as adopted for use in the European Union.
All comparative gures are presented on this basis, except that GSK has taken advantage of an exemption which permits financial instruments to be accounted for and presented on a UK GAAP basis in 2004 and 2003 and only in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39 from 1st January 2005.
Full details of the major differences from UK GAAP as they apply to GSK are given in Note 38 to the financial statements, IFRS transition.
Information prepared under IFRS is not directly comparable with that prepared under UK GAAP.
Data for market share and market growth rates are GSK estimates based on the most recent data from independent external sources, and where appropriate, are valued in sterling at relevant exchange rates.
Figures quoted for product market share reect sales by GSK and licensees.
In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Groups practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate CER growth.
This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year.
CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates.
% represents growth at actual exchange rates.
