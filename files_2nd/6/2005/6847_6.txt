There is likely to be little impact on our adjusted profit and loss account as only small changes will be made with regard to share option and pension costs, which largely offset each other.
There will, however, be a larger impact on our total profit and loss account as goodwill amortisation, which this year amounted to 13.1m, will no longer be required.
The balance sheet will also be affected by the need for the first time to provide for the capital gains tax that we would pay in the highly unlikely circumstance of liquidating our entire property portfolio at market value.
The amount of additional deferred tax to be provided will be of the order of 100m and this will be deducted from our current reserves of 683.7m.

We acquired the Laurel business for cash, increased our borrowings but retain full financial flexibility.
We consider our finances to be strong.
