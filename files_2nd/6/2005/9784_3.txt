The performance of Clothing for the year as a whole was disappointing, with total Clothing sales down 3.1% on last year.
Footfall and clothing volumes were up on the year, but Clothing market share declined by 0.5 percentage points to 10.5%.
Home had a year of transition, as we closed Lifestore and refocused on the traditional areas of bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and dining.
In Food, we continue to benefit from additional footage as we extend the reach of the Food offer.
Food sales were up 2.4% on last year, down 2.6% on a like-for-like basis.
We opened 31 Simply Food stores during the year, 13 in partnership with Compass.
New Simply Food stores opening in 2005 06 will increase our food space by a further 3.3%.
Like-for-like food deation for the year was c. 0.2%.
During the year, we renegotiated terms with suppliers across the business as a whole with the aim of reducing the cost of goods sold by 140m by 2006 07 when compared to 2003 04.
During the year, however, higher markdowns resulted in a 1.5 percentage points decline in the Clothing and Home gross margin.
The Food gross margin was maintained.
Logistics costs of 305.5m, which are included in cost of sales, were marginally below the same period last year benefiting from the full year effect of the changes to the general merchandise logistics operation introduced last year.
UK Retail operating costs of 1,843.1m, excluding exceptional charges, were broadly level on last year: employee costs increased by 1.1% to 922.4m as a result of new stores and the annual salary review, offset by a reduction in headcount: property, repair and renewal costs of 350.4m increased by 8.3% due to the occupancy costs associated with new footage and the move to a new head ofce: depreciation and amortisation was 242.9m, an increase of 6.9%, due to the effect on the charge of prior year additions, store modernisations, closures and amortisation of goodwill arising on the acquisition of per una: and other operating costs of 327.4m decreased by 13.2% as a result of actions taken during the year to reduce the cost of nonmerchandise procurement together with savings in IT.
Including logistics costs, operating costs have decreased by 0.1% on last year.

In the Republic of Ireland, sales were ahead of last year and the performance of the new stores in Blanchardstown and Dundrum has been encouraging.
Our franchisees have seen good like-for-like sales increases and are investing in new footage.
Hong Kong had a strong year, however, in 2005 06 some of our leases will be surrendered to the landlord for development.
Sales at Kings Super Markets were broadly level over the period at constant exchange rates, compared with the same period last year.
Operating profit at Kings over the period was 4.3m as a result of actions taken last year to improve financial performance.
Financial Services The Financial Services business was sold to HSBC on 9 November 2004 for 768.6m and the results of the business up to the date of disposal have been included under the heading of discontinued operations.
The Group has also entered into an agreement with HSBC, whereby the Group will continue to share in the success of the Financial Services business.
Under this agreement, the Group will receive income in the form of fees representing an amount equivalent to costs incurred, 50% of the profits of M&S Money after a notional tax charge and after deducting agreed operating and capital costs plus an amount relating to the growth in sales of financial services products.
Fees received under this agreement since the date of disposal have been included within other operating income in UK Retail.
Exceptional items The Group has recorded exceptional income of 126.8m in the year, as follows: 2005 2004 Exceptional items m m Operating exceptional items Head ofce relocation 8.8 19.6 Head ofce restructuring programme 6.3 22.5 Board restructure 8.4 Closure of Lifestore 29.3 Defence costs 38.6 91.4 42.1 Non-operating exceptional items Loss profit on sale of property and other xed assets 0.4 18.7 profit on disposal of Financial Services 208.9 Release of European closure provision 9.7 218.2 18.7 Total exceptional income charges 126.8 23.4 During the year, 8.8m of revenue costs were incurred in connection with the relocation of the head ofce and have been charged as exceptional operating costs.
This relocation was completed at the end of October.
6 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC Financial review continued We have also incurred a further 6.3m of costs in the year in connection with the implementation of the head ofce restructuring programme which was announced at the end of last year.
Lifestore closure costs represent the anticipated cost of closing the Lifestore programme.
These costs include stock provisions, asset write-offs and other property-related costs.
Defence costs of 38.6m represent the costs incurred, primarily for professional advice, in developing and implementing the new business strategy as a consequence of the possible offer from Revival Acquisitions Limited.
Costs of 8.4m have also been incurred in making the necessary changes to the Board.
The Group successfully completed the sale of the Financial Services business to HSBC on 9 November 2004.
This resulted in a profit on disposal, after costs, of 208.9m.
Following the disposal of two properties in Germany during the year, we have completed the majority of the actions required to close our European operations and we have released, unutilised, 9.7m of the closure provision which we now anticipate is no longer required.
Interest Net interest expense was 102.3m compared to 44.5m 52 week basis for last year.
The average rate of interest on borrowings during the period was 5.7% last year 5.3%.
Taxation The tax charge reects an effective tax rate for the full year of 28.5% before exceptional income, compared to 30.1% last year.
The rate is lower than the standard UK tax rate of 30% due to the impact of prior year credits and relief in respect of the exercise of employee share options.
The European Court of Justice heard the Groups group relief claim on 1 February 2005 and their judgement is expected later this year.
No asset has been recognised in respect of this claim.
Shareholder returns and dividends Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the effect of exceptional items, has decreased by 11.3% to 21.9p per share on a 52 week basis, a decrease of 6.4%.
Return on equity was 41.4% compared to 25.2% last year.
A final dividend of 7.5p per share last year 7.1p per share is proposed, making the total dividend for the year 12.1p per share last year 11.5p per share, an increase of 5.2%.
Capital expenditure Group capital additions for the year were 220m compared to 434m last year.
The major components of the additions are analysed below: 2005 2004 Capital expenditure m m New stores and extensions 88 118 Head ofce relocation 40 Store renewal, refurbishment and new selling initiatives 25 44 Refrigeration equipment 10 39 IT equipment 18 40 Logistics 16 95 Other 29 32 UK Retail capital expenditure 186 408 International Retail 33 20 M&S Money 1 6 Total Group capital expenditure 220 434 The decrease in capital expenditure in part reects the one-off costs last year relating to the acquisition of warehouses, as part of the restructuring of the general merchandise logistics operation, and the relocation of the head ofce.
It also reects a reduction in capital expenditure on new and existing footage as we reviewed the performance of new formats to determine how to revitalise the portfolio in a cost effective way.
Group capital expenditure for 2005 06 is expected to be 350m.

The commentary that follows, where relevant, compares the Group balance sheet at 2 April 2005 to the Retail and Corporate balance sheet at 3 April 2004, which excludes the balance sheet for the Financial Services businesses at that date.
Fixed assets decreased by 45.9m to 3,447.5m.
Included within this are properties owned by the Group with a net book value of 2.1bn, of which 1.7bn was unencumbered, and goodwill of 122.4m relating to the acquisition of per una.
In July 2004, the Group commissioned DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, an External Valuer, to carry out a valuation of the Groups property portfolio.
This valuation was carried out on an existing use value basis for the Groups operational stores and other properties and a market value basis for non-operational properties.
This gave rise to a valuation for the Groups properties of approximately 3.6bn.
Adjusting this valuation for movements in the Groups portfolio since that date gives rise to a surplus over net book value as at 2 April 2005 of approximately 1.3bn.
Had this valuation been incorporated into the Groups balance sheet as at 2 April 2005 then net assets would have increased by 1.3bn to 1.8bn.
Stock at the end of the year was 339.7m, a decrease of 58.3m on the balance at the end of last year largely as a result of better controls over stock and commitment.
Provisions for liabilities and charges increased by 31.1m largely as a result of a 30m reduction in the deferred tax asset attributable to the 400m pension contribution last year.
The net post-retirement liability remained broadly level with the previous year.
Shareholders funds amounted to 521.4m, equivalent to 31.4p per share last year 108.3p per share, a decrease of 1,932.6m in the year primarily due to the 2.3bn Tender Offer.
If the recent property valuation is included, Group gearing would have been 61.8% and return on equity 22.0%.
Cash ow Analysis of free cash ow operating cash ow before acquisitions and disposals and transactions with shareholders is as follows: 2005 2004 Cash ow analysis m m Operating cash ow from continuing operations 857.5 602.3 Operating cash ow from discontinued operations 717.9 64.2 Capital expenditure 232.2 428.8 Proceeds from asset disposals 117.8 126.2 Interest paid 101.6 49.8 Tax paid 166.7 220.4 Free cash ow 1,192.7 93.7 The Group generated an operating cash inow for the year of 1,575.4m last year cash inow 666.5m.
Within this, the cash inow from continuing operations was 857.5m last year 602.3m.
A major factor in the increase in operating cash ow was the year-on-year net decrease in contributions paid to the UK dened benefit pension scheme, following the one-off injection of 400m in March 2004.
During the period, the Group acquired tangible xed assets totalling 219.6m last year 433.5m.
After taking into account the timing of payments, the cash outow for capital expenditure was 232.2m last year 428.8m.
During the year, the Group received 117.8m last year 126.2m from the sale of properties, including 115m from the sale of Michael House.

At the end of the period, net debt was 2,099.0m, an increase of 104.3m, giving rise to retail gearing of 84.5% last year 44.7% including the net post-retirement liability.
Financing and capital structure In August 2004, we signed two new banking facilities totalling 2bn, being a 1.2bn five-year term facility and an 800m bridging loan pending completion of the sale of Financial Services.
Part utilisation of these facilities, together with existing resources and the resultant proceeds from the sale of Financial Services, were used to fund the return of 2.3bn to shareholders.
We currently have committed facilities of 1,260m available together with uncommitted bank facilities of 190m supporting our 1.5bn Commercial Paper programme.
Average interest rates on borrowings were higher during the year at 5.7% last year 5.3%.
Interest cover was 8.2 times and xed charge cover was 4.1 times.
On 28 October, we purchased 635,359,116 ordinary shares, representing 27.9% of the issued share capital, for cancellation at a price of 362p per share and a total cost of 2.3bn.
On 27 September 2004 and 29 March 2005, 16,454,305 and 10,967,542 B shares respectively, were redeemed at par, at a total cost of 19.2m.
Following this redemption, 93,822,916 B shares remain in issue.
The next opportunity for redemption will be on 26 September 2005.
Treasury policy and financial risk management The Board approves treasury policies and senior management directly control day-to-day operations.
The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the treasury committee, comprising one executive director, one non-executive director, the Director of Corporate Finance, the Group Treasurer and the Director, Financial Services.
The treasury committee is empowered to take decisions, as necessary, within that delegated authority.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC 9 The Groups Treasury also enters into derivatives transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and nancing.
It has been, and remains, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, liquidity and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk in respect of debt on the retail balance sheet is reviewed on a regular basis.
At the balance sheet date, interest obligations in respect of the property securitisation and the two Public Bond issues in Sterling were at xed rates.
b Foreign currency risk Currency exposure arising from exports from the UK to overseas subsidiaries is managed by using forward currency contracts, out to 15 months forward, to hedge between 80% and 100% of sales.
Imports are primarily contracted in Sterling but, where relevant, imports arising in a currency other than Sterling are fully hedged using forward contracts.
The Group is increasing the proportion of imports contracted in local currencies and a policy is in place for the hedging of these exposures, principally using forward currency contracts.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss account translation exposures.
Where appropriate, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
c Liquidity risk The objective is to ensure a mix of funding methods offering exibility and cost effectiveness to match the needs of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are nanced by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, commercial paper, medium-term note issuance and securitised loan notes.
Commercial paper issuance and short-term borrowings are backed by committed bank facilities totalling 1,260m.
d Counterparty risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by counterparties.
The risk is managed by using a number of banks and allocating each a credit limit according to credit rating criteria.
These limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
Dealing mandates and derivative agreements are agreed with the banks prior to deals being arranged.
The details of derivatives and other financial instruments required by FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, are shown in notes 19, 22 and 24 to the financial statements.
Pensions The Group provides pension arrangements for the benefit of employees through the Marks and Spencer UK Pension Scheme together with some specic arrangements for our overseas operations.
The dened benefit section of the UK scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
At the year end it had some 35,000 active members, 56,000 deferred members and 36,000 pensioners.
The market value of the assets of the UK dened benefit scheme was 3.9bn at 2 April 2005.
Full details of these assets, together with the FRS 17 liabilities and the valuation assumptions made, are included in note 11 to the financial statements.
Following the last full actuarial valuation which showed an actuarial deficit of 585m as at 31 March 2003, the Group paid additional contributions of 400m in March 2004 and agreed a Schedule of Contributions comprising annual service contributions at a level of 15.8% of pensionable salaries and nine annual payments of 33m, commencing 31 March 2007, to fund the remaining actuarial deficit.
During the year there have been ongoing discussions between the Group and the Trustees of the Marks and Spencer UK Pension Scheme with regard to the funding of the UK dened benefit scheme.
These discussions have resulted in 115m of additional contributions being paid into the scheme during March and April 2005, of which 64m had been paid in before the year end and is reected in the assets as at 2 April 2005.
These amounts are in addition to the agreed Schedule of Contributions referred to above.
They are designed to address the less favourable investment conditions experienced over the last couple of years and anticipate the next full actuarial valuation which is due as at 31 March 2006.
The funding of the scheme will be reviewed again at that time and a new funding plan agreed.
The new dened contribution section of the UK scheme, the Marks and Spencer Retirement Plan, has been open to new members from 1 April 2003 and had some 4,000 active members at the year end.
The contributions paid by the Group are charged in the accounting period to which they relate and details are set out in note 11 to the financial statements.
10 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC Financial review continued International Financial Reporting Standards For the next financial year, the Group will be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards.
We have identied that the greatest impact on the Group arises from changes in the accounting treatment for property, share-based payments, financial instruments and software.
The Group has restated the results for the period ended 2 April 2005 to reect these changes and a summary of the impact is set out below: 2004 05 Change UK GAAP IFRS Change % Turnover m 7,942.3 7,942.3 Operating profit before exceptional items m 709.4 689.2 20.2 2.8 profit before tax and exceptional items m 618.5 596.0 22.5 3.6 Adjusted earnings per share p 21.9 21.0 0.9 4.1 Net assets at 2 April 2005 m 521.4 938.6 417.2 80.0 Going concern statement After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
