12 Operating review Financial review The financial review should be read in conjunction with the Chairmans Statement and the Chief Executives Operating Review set out on pages 3 to 10 which contain comments on revenue, profit, earnings and dividends.
Basis of presentation The group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as from 1st January 2005 and these financial statements, along with the comparatives, for 2004 have been prepared in accordance with these standards.
As previously reported, there has been little net effect on the groups reported operating profits and net assets, excluding the reversal of goodwill amortisation, and the adoption of IFRS has not had any impact on the fundamentals of our business, strategy or future cashflows.
A reconciliation of net assets and profit under UK GAAP to IFRS is provided this year in audited note 34.
In addition, separate parent company accounts have been presented in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are set out on pages 61 to 66.
Kevin Quinn Finance Director Interest Net interest charged for the year was 7.2 million compared with 13.3 million for our continuing business in 2004.
The significant decrease resulted from a lower average net debt, reflecting the good cash flow generation of the business, together with the proceeds of the sale of Elliott, which were held on deposit prior to the return of capital to shareholders.
In addition, we have benefited from the reduction in funding costs as a result of refinancing the group in June 2005 on favourable terms.
We expect to further benefit from these reduced funding costs through 2006.
Taxation The tax charge of 23.2 million compares to 25.4 million in 2004 with an effective rate of 28.8% compared with 31.3% last year.

Treasury policy The group uses foreign currency borrowings and financial instruments to finance its operation and to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from those operations and sources of finance.
The groups strategy for financing its operations and managing the risks associated therewith is summarised below.
Financing The group finances its operations primarily through the groups banking facilities and cash generated through its operations.
In planning the maturity of debt, the groups policy is to seek a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
In addition the group has overdraft facilities with certain clearing banks.
The groups UK current accounts are subject to set-off arrangements covered by cross-guarantees and there is also a cash pooling arrangement taking in the cash generated by the Berendsen businesses.
All the groups borrowings are unsecured.
The group evaluates potential sources of funding on a continuous basis with a view to obtaining alternative sources where appropriate.
Interest rates The interest rate exposure of the group arising from its bank borrowings has been managed by the use of interest rate instruments.
The group has outstanding Debt by currency swaps of 15 million and $25 million in respect of borrowings, which have now been repaid, and which expire in July 2006.
