Revenue FINANCIAL The Groups reported results in sterling showed REVIEW growth in sales revenue of 73% to 150.4 million 2004: 86.9 million.
The majority of this growth was a result of the acquisition of ACMI in July 2005.
Underlying revenue in the Gyrus business grew 15% to 99.9 million 2004: 86.9 million, which represented 14% growth on a constant currency basis.
In addition, the Group charged development fees of 1.5 million to Rhytec Limited, a customer of the Partnered Technologies Division 2004: 0.6 million.
For the first time in some years the US dollar marginally strengthened over the second half of the year, having depreciated further in the first half, to average $1.82:1 for the year 2004: $1.83:1.
Adoption of International Accounting Standards This is the first annual report and financial statements to be produced under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS.
In themselves IFRS have a considerable impact upon reported earnings when compared to previous periods under UK GAAP.
In addition the impact of IFRS on the accounting treatment of the ACMI acquisition is significant.
In order to help shareholders assess the effect of IFRS and the acquisition on the Groups results, the Income Statement is presented to show the effects of the acquisition of ACMI, associated restructuring costs and other material non-recurring items separately.
There are a number of material effects of these items on reported earnings per share under IFRS, so in order to give a measure of the underlying performance of the Group your attention is drawn to the presentation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share in note 17 to the accounts.
In addition, at the end of this annual report on pages 77 to 79 there is a reconciliation of the differences between IFRS and UK GAAP.
Simon Shaw Chief Financial Officer Gross Margin The Groups reported gross margin declined to 55.6% in 2005 2004: 59.1% but this substantially masks the underlying picture.
The Gyrus business continued to increase its gross margin from 59.1% in 2004 to 61.8% in 2005 through volume increases and continued focus on our operating efficiency improvement programme.
The ACMI business produced a post-acquisition gross margin of 52.8% compared with a 2004 margin of 49.8%.
Finally the effect of IFRS 3, which requires the write up of inventory to market selling value on acquisition and associated write down through cost of sales over the period of inventory turn, resulted in a one-off non-cash charge against the margin of 4.7 million: this represented a reduction of 3.1% on the Group gross margin.
Operating Expenses 2005 PERFORMANCE The Groups operating expenses increased as a Group revenues up 73% percentage of sales revenue to 49.7% 2004: 48.2% : approximately 1.6% of the difference is a result of the Organic constant currency revenue restructuring charges incurred in the first six months growth of 14% of the three-year integration programme.
In addition Adjusted operating margin up to 14.2% the amortisation of intangible assets, recognised as a result of the acquisition, represented 2.6% of sales.

The difference between this REVIEW and the effective tax rate represents the net effect of recognising multiple deferred tax assets and liabilities CONTINUED under IFRS.
Earnings Per Share The unusual integration costs, IFRS acquisition adjustments including deferred tax, and material non-recurring items associated with the acquisition serve to mask the underlying performance of the Group.
This can be seen in the IFRS Basic Earnings Per Share of 5.6p in 2005 compared with 10.2p in 2004.
For these reasons, in addition to the prescribed measures of earnings per share, the Group discloses Adjusted Earnings Per Share which excludes the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, integration costs including the cost of the one-off special LTIP award, but not normal annual awards, material non-recurring items and deferred taxation.
In 2005 Adjusted Earnings Per Share increased 27% to 14.2p 2004: 11.2p of which approximately 0.7p related to a lower current taxation charge than was originally anticipated.
It is this measure, which most closely The material non-recurring financial income and matches the Adjusted Earnings Per Share figures expense items, which represent a net pre-tax profit disclosed under UK GAAP in previous years, and so of 2.0 million, came about as a result of the prevailing most readily enables longer term historical earnings interpretation of the application of IAS 39 to one of a comparisons to be made.
