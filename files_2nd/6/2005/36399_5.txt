Financial Review Over the past five years the Group has actively managed its balance sheet, repaying high-coupon or inflexible debt and returning excess capital to shareholders to enhance shareholder returns John Whiteley Finance Director The results for the year ended 31 March 2005 and the movement in net asset value during the period have been significantly affected by a number of factors: the balance sheet has been reshaped, with 101.5 million of cash returned to shareholders in August 2004, the redemption of a high-coupon debenture and the trimming of the two debentures which remain: the sale of seven properties for an aggregate price of 135.5 million: capital expenditure of 116.0 million, comprising 53.3 million of direct property acquisitions, 38.9 million through a corporate acquisition and 23.8 million of development expenditure: the injection of 23.8 million of equity into a 50% joint venture which acquired 133.6 million of central London properties: and the tightening of property investment yields and the growth in rental values within central London, which drove the uplift in the portfolio valuation.
The effect of these events has been to reduce adjusted earnings per share to 11.3p 2004: 12.8p but to increase diluted adjusted net assets per share to 333p 2004: 280p.
Throughout this financial review, where references are made to adjusted figures, their calculation can be found in note 11 on page 53.
The financial statements have been drawn up on the basis of the accounting policies applied for the year ended 31 March 2004, save for the introduction of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the effect of which has been to reduce shareholders funds at 31 March 2005 and 2004 by 3.4 million or 2p per share, as explained in note 24 to the financial statements.
Profit and Loss Account Group rental income fell by 12.0 million from 63.8 million in 2004 to 51.8 million in 2005.
This was largely because rental income in 2004 included an exceptional premium of 8.2 million received on a lease surrender, which added 4.0p to earnings per share in 2004.
Excluding this, rental income fell by 3.8 million compared to last year primarily through property disposals exceeding the effect of acquisitions.

The sale of seven investment properties for 135.5 million generated a profit on sale of 10.1 million, or 8.1% over March 2004 values, after costs.
Two of the seven properties were sold into a new joint venture, the Great Victoria Partnership, in which the Group has a 50% interest, and, therefore, only half of the profit made on the disposal of those two properties was included within the 10.1 million shown on the face of the profit and loss account.
The Great Victoria Partnership began to trade in mid-January, and, therefore, our share of its operating profit in 2005 of 0.5 million represented less than one quarters trading.
Interest receivable of 2.2 million 2004: 5.0 million was less than that of the previous year because the bulk of the cash held on deposit last year was returned to shareholders in August.
Interest payable of 25.0 million 2004: 19.4 million included exceptional finance costs of 6.9 million 2004: nil : these exceptional costs related to 3 the redemption of debentures, primarily our 24 million 11 16% debenture 2009 14.
As the development of Met Building, 22 Percy Street, W1 approached its practical completion, and the strip-out began at 190 Great Portland Street, W1, interest capitalised on developments in the year rose to 2.0 million 2004: 0.5 million.
The effective rate of tax shown on the face of the profit and loss account in 2005 was 2.7% 2004: 13.8% : this was low because the chargeable gain on property disposals was fully covered by capital losses, and tax relief on the exceptional cost of redeeming the debenture exceeded 30% of the book loss: the use of capital allowances on plant and machinery within our investment portfolio lowered the tax charge still further.
It is these capital allowances which reduced the effective rate of tax on the underlying business to 15.9% in arriving at adjusted earnings per share.
A final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2005 of 7.17p per share will, subject to shareholder approval, be paid on 12 July 2005 to shareholders on the register on 3 June, and will make a total dividend for the year of 10.75p per share 2004: 10.5p, an increase on last year of 2.4%.
Adjusted earnings of 11.3p provided dividend cover of 1.05 times.
Balance Sheet Diluted adjusted net assets per share rose from 280p to 333p at 31 March 2005, an increase of 18.9%.
The main driver of the increase was the revaluation of the investment property portfolio which added 37p: the revaluation of the share in the Great Victoria Partnership added 5p, retained earnings 4p and the effect of the return of cash to shareholders and associated share consolidation added 7p.
The return of cash to shareholders of 101.5 million reduced share capital by 81.2 million, share premium by 11.8 million, and distributable reserves by only 8.5 million: at 31 March 2005 the holding company had distributable reserves of 176.6 million.
At 31 March 2005 the effect of marking debt to market would have been to reduce diluted adjusted NAV by 9p 2004: 6p and, had the Groups investment properties been sold for their book value at the balance sheet date, the contingent liability to taxation on chargeable gains would have been approximately 38 million or 21p 2004: 8p per share.
Accordingly, diluted adjusted triple net asset value was 303p, an increase of 13.9% over 266p a year earlier.
Since 31 March 2005, the Group has entered into a second joint venture, the Great Victoria Partnership No.
2, with an investment of 15.6 million, and has sold 55 Drury Lane, WC2 for 16.8 million or 1.0 million above its March 2005 valuation.
GREAT PORTLAND ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2005 19 Financial Review Financing Over the past five years the Group has actively managed its balance sheet, repaying high-coupon or inflexible debt and returning excess capital to shareholders.
The return of cash to shareholders in August 2004 was effected to provide a more efficient balance sheet gearing level, thereby helping to enhance prospective shareholder returns without unduly impairing the Groups financial headroom or investment capacity.
The return of cash to shareholders was structured so as to give shareholders a choice between receiving their return of cash in the form of a capital payment or in the form of dividend income.
As part of the Court-approved scheme, the share capital was consolidated on the basis of four new shares for every five previously held in order to allow a direct comparison between the share price before and after the return of cash to shareholders.
At close of business on 30 July 2004, the first day of trading in the new shares after the capital restructuring, the share price stood at 282p.
The efficiency of the Groups financing was further enhanced in May 2004 with the 3 redemption of our 24 million 11 16% First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2009 14.
This high-coupon debenture had a disproportionately high value of properties charged to it as security: its redemption released 72.5 million of properties from charge in addition to reducing the Groups cost of borrowing.
Also during the year we took the opportunity to acquire 10.1 million of our listed debentures in the market, thereby further reducing the proportion of our investment property portfolio required to be charged as security.
In May we refinanced our main bank facility, replacing a 175 million syndicated loan facility with a five year, 150 million bank club with our three main banks.
At 31 March 2005, 81% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates of interest and the weighted average debt maturity was 16 years.
The weighted average cost of our drawn facilities was 6.1%, and of our total financing, including commitment fees on undrawn facilities, 6.3%.
Ten years ago the Groups weighted average cost of debt was 9.5%, all of it was at fixed rates and had a weighted average maturity of 15 years.
At 31 March 2005 net gearing based on shareholders funds as adjusted for deferred tax on accelerated capital allowances was 49%, interest cover was 2.4 times and the Group had cash and undrawn bank facilities of 212 million, which, if spent in full, would increase pro forma net gearing to 88%.
Financial Instruments The Group raises finance through equity and borrowings, and places surplus cash on short-term deposit.
The primary sources of borrowing are debenture loans, convertible loans and bank and other loans.
The Group also enters into interest rate swaps, collars and caps, but solely as a way of managing the interest rate risks arising from some of the Groups sources of finance, primarily bank loans.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The policies for managing these are reviewed by the Board, and have been in place throughout the year ended 31 March 2005.
Interest rate risk Borrowings are made either at fixed rates of interest, or at floating rates which can be fixed simultaneously, and co-terminously, by means of interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy has been to ensure that most of its borrowings were at fixed rates: at 31 March 2005, 81% of borrowings were at fixed rates.
Liquidity risk The Group operates a long-term business, and its policy is to finance it principally with equity and medium-term and long-term borrowings.
Accordingly, at the year end 62% of the Groups borrowings were due to mature in over 15 years.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by cash balances and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk At 31 March 2005, the Group had 31.2 million on short-term deposit with financial institutions.
It is the Boards policy that deposit and derivative contracts are placed only with counter-parties with a credit rating of F1 or higher.
20 GREAT PORTLAND ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2005 Elsley House, 20 30 Great Titchfield St, W1 Rolling programme of refurbishment due to begin in 2005 Financial Review International Financial Reporting Standards International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS are mandatory for all listed companies within the European Union for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, and, therefore, we will prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the first time next year.
This will not affect the performance or cash flows of the business, but will significantly change the way in which the performance of the business is reported.
The key changes for Great Portland Estates can be split between those which will increase net assets, those which will reduce them and those which will do neither.
Net assets will be increased by the following: proposed dividends will no longer be accrued: and part of our convertible bond will be shown as equity instead of debt.
Net assets will be reduced as follows: contingent tax on chargeable gains will be brought onto the balance sheet as a long-term liability: and the net liabilities of the Groups pension scheme will be brought onto the group balance sheet.
Other changes which will have no effect on net assets will be: surpluses or deficits on the revaluation of investment properties will be shown through the face of the income statement, which may materially affect earnings per share: development properties will be disclosed in the balance sheet separately from other investment properties: and properties held under long leasehold interests will have their value increased by the net present value of future ground rents payable, and a corresponding long-term liability will be set up in the balance sheet.
The preparatory work to convert our Group reporting from UK GAAP to IFRS as at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005 and for the year ended 31 March 2005 is largely complete.
In July 2005 we shall issue a press release explaining in full the effect of changing those numbers from UK GAAP to IFRS with appropriate reconciliations and narrative.
