20 Photo-Me International plc Annual Report 2005 Financial review p Our main target for future years is to use the strength of the balance sheet for expansion, generating sustained improvement in shareholder value.
Financial review Photo-Me International plc 21 Annual Report 2005 Profit & loss The profit and loss account for the year to 30 April 2005 may be summarised as follows: 2005 2004 Change Turnover m 236.0 219.9 7.3% EBITDA m 58.9 52.1 12.9% Operating profit m 35.8 22.8 57.2% PBT m 34.5 21.3 62.0% Basic earnings per share p 6.28 4.06 54.7% Dividends per share p 2.00 1.00 100.0% excluding exceptional items and, where appropriate, goodwill amortisation The turnover figure, up 7.3% on the previous year, was a record.
Demonstrating the usual strength of PMIs cash generation, EBITDA, before exceptional items, was 58.9m 2004: 52.1m.
This represents 25.0% of turnover a high proportion.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 57.2% to 35.8m 2004: 22.8m.
Adjusted excludes an exceptional charge in connection with restructuring in Japan of 0.8m 2004: exceptional credit of 0.4m and a goodwill amortisation charge of 0.7m 2004: 0.5m.
The adjusted operating margin increased to 15.2% 2004: 10.4%.
The net interest charge reduced to 1.3m 2004: 1.5m, reflecting reduced average indebtedness.
The net interest charge was covered 46 times 2004: 34 times by EBITDA and 27 times 2004: 15 times by profit before interest and tax.
The average interest rate was 5.7% 2004: 4.6% and the average gross debt was 29.5m 2004: 36.9m.
Adjusted pre-tax profit advanced by 62.0% to 34.5m 2004: 21.3m.
Adjusted EPS were 54.7% higher at 6.28p 2004: 4.06p, reflecting an increased effective tax rate of 32.6% 2004: 28.5%.
On both adjusted and reported bases, the pre-tax profit was a record by a wide margin.
The adjusted pre-tax profit in the second half traditionally, the weaker half of the year for Vending of 16.2m compared with 6.3m in 2004 and a pre-tax loss of 3.3m in 2003, reflecting in large part the increased importance of Manufacturing.
Net assets The Group balance sheet further strengthened.
At the year end, shareholders funds had increased by 20.7% to 83.5m 2004: 69.1m, whilst shareholders funds less intangible assets totalled 59.2m 2004: 47.7m.
The largest individual asset category remains fixed assets.
The 96.4m of fixed assets can be analysed as to 71.9m tangible assets, 24.2m intangible assets, and 0.3m investments.
Tangible assets include 57.9m of operating equipment, notably 41.0m of photobooths and 11.1m of Digital Media Kiosks.
An impairment review has been undertaken as at 30 April 2005 in respect of intangible and tangible fixed assets.
No adjustment to the carrying value of such assets was required.
They are represented by, in order of value, debtors, stocks, cash at bank and in hand, and investments and short-term deposits.
The principal reason for the increase in current assets is the increase in debtors to 42.7m from 32.3m, which reflects the increase in Manufacturing turnover towards the end of the year.
Cash and borrowings The net cash balance rose to 4.1m 2004: 2.9m, after capital expenditure and financial investment of 34.5m 2004: 21.0m.
This was principally in the following areas: Digital Media Kiosks 12.1m, photobooths 10.9m, the purchase of kiddie ride activities which leverage off PMIs UK infrastructure 2.2m, and the acquisition of the 30.3% minority interest in PMIs German subsidiary,  GmbH 2.5m.
The year end net cash of 4.1m compares with net cash of 2.9m at 30 April 2004, net debt of 33.4m at 30 April 2003 and net debt of 51.4m at 30 April 2002.
This remarkable turnaround reflects the cash-generative nature of the Vending business, the improved Manufacturing result in the last two years, and the receipt of a payment on account from the Groups insurers in respect of a claim for the Bookham fire of 22 December 2004.
Financial review 22 Photo-Me International plc Annual Report 2005 Funding and treasury policy The 1.2m improvement in net cash is explained in the following summarised cash flow statement: 2005 2004 m m Opening net cash debt 2.9 33.4 Gross cash inflow 58.3 52.8 Working capital movement 6.5 5.9 Returns on investments and servicing of finance 1.3 1.6 Tax 5.9 1.1 Capital expenditure and financial investment 34.5 21.0 Acquisitions and disposals 2.5 0.2 Dividends 6.5 Other movements net 0.1 1.5 Closing net cash 4.1 2.9 The Groups funding policy is to maintain a timely flow of funds to meet investment requirements.
The Board regularly reviews the cash requirements of the Group and sets guidelines and policy, which are then monitored and managed by the Finance and Treasury Committees.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases and overdrafts.
These instruments are used to raise finance for the Groups operations and to cover capital expenditure and working capital requirements.
Details of the financial instruments are shown in note 16 to the accounts, including currency and interest rate analysis.
The Group takes the view as permitted by FRS13 that short-term debtors and creditors are not financial instruments that play a significant medium to long-term role in the financial risk profile of the Group.
They are excluded from the FRS13 disclosures, other than currency analysis.
The Bookham fire On 22 December 2004, the Groups 62,000 sq.
ft. warehouse and workshop at Bookham, Surrey were destroyed by fire, together with their contents.
These principally comprised minilabs for resale, vending equipment being refurbished, spare parts and consumables.
The adjacent Group Head Office building was undamaged by the fire.
The Group successfully minimised the disruption caused to its business.
A substantial payment on account was received during the year from the Groups insurers, and the Board is confident that the risk was fully covered.
Furthermore, since the insurance cover is based on replacement cost, a material accounting surplus could arise.
However, as parts of the claim will not be finalised for some months, no gain has been recognised in these accounts.
Financial risks The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks, including changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential risks for the Group.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing risks.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries whose functional currency is not Sterling, being principally Euro, Swiss Francs and Japanese Yen.
As a result, changes in exchange rates can impact on the net assets of the Groups balance sheet.
Borrowings by subsidiaries in local currency help to mitigate the effects of exchange movements.
Individual subsidiaries are exposed to exchange rate movements as a result of selling or purchasing in foreign currencies.
Subject to approval of the Risk Management Committee, hedges may be taken out to cover forward foreign exchange contracts to assist in managing the exchange risk from trading.
During the year under review, hedging commenced and this policy is likely to continue in the current year.
Generally, the amounts hedged are short term less than one year and are monitored for their effectiveness.
Financial review Photo-Me International plc 23 Annual Report 2005 Interest rate risk The Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in interest rates.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profit and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group regularly monitors the possibility of switching from floating to fixed rate and from fixed to floating.
It also monitors the possibility of using cap and floor arrangements.
The Group may also take out derivative contracts to limit interest rate exposure and this activity commenced during the year.
At the year end, 13% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates 2004: 19%.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure adequate facilities are available and to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through use of overdrafts, bank loans and finance leases.
At 30 April 2005, 34.1m 2004: 35.0m of undrawn committed facilities were available.
At 30 April 2005, 16.1% 2004: 15.3% of total borrowings will mature after two years.
Surplus funds are placed in bank deposit accounts and other investments with high credit ratings.
International Financial Reporting Standards Financial statements for EU quoted companies for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 have to be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
PMI will thus publish accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 in accordance with IFRS.
The interim results to 31 October 2005 will be the first reported in line with IFRS.
The accounts for the year ended 30 April 2005 will be the last to be produced under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The International Accounting Standards Board IASB finalised in early 2004 the standards to be applied for IFRS conversion for 2005.
Since then, new standards and amendments have been issued.
These standards have to be endorsed by the EU before they can be applied.
Most standards have been endorsed and the process is continuing.
PMIs IFRS conversion project is on schedule.
The IFRS conversion project team has examined the implementation aspects, including examination of changes in accounting policies, the presentation of the Groups results, system changes and wider business issues arising from the changes.
The Groups IFRS project conversion team will be shortly finalising the restatement of the results for the year ended 30 April 2005.
It is our current view that IFRS will have an impact in the following principal areas: expensing of the fair value of share options, accounting for goodwill acquired in business combinations, and the translation of results at average exchange rates.
The net impact on both profits and the balance sheet is not expected to be significant.
Financial objective Having achieved a healthy financial structure, our main target for future years is to use the strength of the balance sheet for expansion, generating sustained improvement in shareholder value.
