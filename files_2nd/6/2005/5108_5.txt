plc 95 05 Operational and financial review Strategy and business model During the year, management reviewed with the Board the implementation of easyJets strategy and made changes to ensure that the business remains well positioned in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
The business model required no change.
It is tried and tested and has withstood the challenges of this difficult year.
Being mindful of the business environment, our strategy has three cornerstones:focus on our customers, own our markets and reduce our costs.
Focus on our customers We know what our customers value, and we design our core product and ancillary services accordingly.
Every year, we aim to create better value for our customers, whilst decreasing our costs to maintain or improve competitiveness.
Own our markets We will develop and aggressively defend our chosen markets against competitors.
This means quickly establishing a strong base, offering numerous routes with multiple frequencies to existing and new points on the network, and establishing a strong brand in the market.
Reduce our costs Management is focused on increasing the return on equity.
In order to achieve this, we will continue to challenge industry norms and further reduce our cost base through being highly productive, innovative and taking advantage of our scale and local knowledge in procuring goods and services.
For example, in the coming year we will see benefit from the long term maintenance contract that we signed with SR Technics in August 2005.
We will withdraw capacity from any existing markets that are poorly performing or airports which are overpriced.
We are confident that this strategy will bring clarity and focus to the efforts of our people and will provide easyJet with its unique strength to remain best in class, with a leading position in the growing European air travel market.
Network We have continued to develop the network during the year in a manner that absorbed the 18.8% growth in new capacity, measured by sectors operated, without affecting operational performance.
At 30 September 2005, the easyJet network covered 212 routes and 64 airports, compared to 153 and 44 at the same time last year.
Thirteen routes ceased operations in the year due to their poor performance.
During the year, we have added 21 new cities to the easyJet network: Almeria, Asturias, Bratislava, Cagliari, Cork, Grenoble, Hamburg, Knock, Krakow, Maastricht, Mahon, Milan, Murcia, Olbia, Pisa, Riga, Shannon, Tallinn, Turin, Valencia, and Warsaw.
Basel opened as a new base during the year.
Further growth is planned for the forthcoming season and we have already announced four new cities: Bournemouth, Doncaster, Lisbon, and Bremen.
We announced last month the addition of a 16th base in Milan: our first Italian base.
16 Annual report and accounts 05 Fleet and aircraft financing At the end of the financial year, the fleet comprised 54 Boeing 737s and 55 Airbus A319s, giving a total of 109 aircraft.
The fleet at the start of the year comprised 71 Boeing 737s and 21 Airbus A319s.
Details of the fleet at 30 September 2005 are as follows: Under Changes Future 1 Owned operating lease Total in year deliveries Options Airbus A319s 18 37 55 34 65 120 Boeing 737-700s 32 32 1 2 Boeing 737-300s 22 22 16 18 91 109 17 65 120 Notes: 1 Options may be taken as any Airbus A320 family aircraft and are valid until 2012.
2 Excludes one Boeing 737-300 which was held for sale at 30 September 2005.
A further 65 Airbus A319 aircraft are planned to be delivered through to February 2009.
This will give us a modern fleet of aircraft that will underpin our high levels of asset utilisation and increase our operational efficiency.
The average fleet age, currently 3.0 years 2004: 4.5 years, is expected to fall to approximately 2.3 years by 30 September 2006.
Fleet changes: The total fleet over the period to 30 September 2008 based on contractual commitments is as follows: Boeing Boeing Total Airbus A319s 737-700s 737-300s aircraft At 30 September 2004 21 33 38 92 At 30 September 2005 55 32 22 109 At 30 September 2006 87 32 3 122 At 30 September 2007 106 32 138 At 30 September 2008 118 31 149 Whilst we are very confident of growing the business at this rate, we have contractual rights with Airbus that allow us to moderate or accelerate our capacity growth within certain constraints.
Aircraft financing Of the 34 aircraft that were delivered to easyJet during the year, 22 were sold to lessors and leased back under operating leases, and 12 were financed by debt.
During the year, we continued to secure financing through mortgages and sale and leasebacks for the majority of the Airbus delivery stream.
We have now committed facilities available for 97 of the 120 Airbus aircraft ordered.
The arrangements include facilities for deliveries in 2006 and 2007.
Our people At 30 September 2005 there were 4,152 employees in easyJet, an increase of 11.4% during the year from 3,727 at 30 September 2004, well below the overall growth rate in the business.
This is because of management action to increase the efficiency of our crew, and our focus on a more efficient easyLand.
Annual report and accounts 05 17 plc 95 05 Operational and financial review continued The following tables set forth certain consolidated operating and profit and loss account data.
Internally at a Company level, we look at both revenue and cost per seat flown.
Each seat flown incurs a cost of capital: we try and minimise the cost of debt through effective financing: we incentivise our top management to deliver higher returns on equity.
We continue to publish other operating data and performance measures, to facilitate comparison with other airlines.

Annual report and accounts 05 19 plc 95 05 Operational and financial review continued Financial year 2005 compared with financial year 2004 Revenue easyJets revenue increased 23.0% from 1,091.0 million to 1,341.4 million, from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
Revenue per seat increased 2.1% from 37.88 to 38.66.
Passenger revenue, the largest component, comprises the price paid for the seat less government taxes, such as Air Passenger Duty and VAT.
It increased by 21.8% from 1,029.3 million to 1,254.2 million, driven by a 21.4% growth in passenger numbers from 24.3 million to 29.6 million, and a 0.4% increase in average fares.
The number of passengers carried reflected a 17.7% increase in the size of the easyJet fleet in operation from an average of 79.9 aircraft to an average of 94.0 aircraft and a small increase in the average load factor achieved from 84.5% to 85.2%.
Growth was particularly strong in continental Europe, with intra-European revenues growing by 78%.
The performance at our German bases was the key driver to this growth.
Ancillary revenue includes credit card fees, excess baggage charges, sporting equipment fees, infant fees, change fees and rescue fees, profit share from in-flight sales of food, beverages, and boutique items, commissions received from products and services sold such as hotel bookings, car hire bookings and travel insurance, less chargebacks.
In 2005, 87.2 million was earned from ancillary revenues, up 41.3% from 2004.
This has been driven by renegotiation of key contractual arrangements and more consistent application of policies on additional charges.
Ground handling charges, including salaries easyJets ground handling charges increased by 17.2% from 111.3 million to 130.5 million, from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
The increase in ground handling charges reflects the 18.8% increase in the number of sectors flown, set off against mix savings as a result of network expansion decisions and our continued efforts to work with our suppliers.
We exited expensive airports such as Zurich, and expanded at lower cost locations such as Basel and Berlin.
Airport charges easyJets external airport charges increased by 20.2% from 191.4 million to 230.1 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
This increase was attributable to the growth in passengers carried of 21.4%, inflationary cost increases at regulated airports offset by the beneficial impact of growth centred at lower cost airports such as Basel and Berlin.
Fuel easyJets fuel costs increased by 77.1% from 146.9 million to 260.2 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
The increase was significantly higher than the 22.4% increase in number of block hours flown.
This change is primarily due to a 50.5% increase in easyJets average US dollar fuel cost per tonne, compared with the previous year, resulting in additional costs to easyJet of 90.0 million.
The strengthening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which fuel prices are denominated, over the course of financial year 2005 provided a set off benefit of approximately 8.0 million.
In addition, a 4.8% increase in sector length, the introduction of new aircraft and increased optimisation of route planning aided the efficiency of easyJets fuel consumption.
Benefits obtained from Group fuel hedging activities were 12.3 million.
Navigation charges easyJets navigation charges increased by 23.8% from 87.7 million to 108.6 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
This increase was principally attributable to a 26.3% increase in the ASKs flown in financial year 2005, set off against reductions in cost per kilometre flown in Germany, France and the UK.
20 Annual report and accounts 05 Crew costs, including training easyJets crew costs increased by 7.4% from 126.8 million to 136.2 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
The increase in crew costs resulted from an increase in headcount during the financial year 2005 to service the additional sectors and aircraft operated by easyJet during the year, the increase in salaries, and the costs of recruitment.
The increase in crew costs is less than the rate of growth in block hours of 22.4%.
This is due to more efficient use of crew across the network, and because 6.4 million was incurred in 2004 during the migration of certain operations from Boeing to Airbus aircraft.
Maintenance Maintenance expenses increased by 16.9% from 102.0 million to 119.2 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005. easyJets maintenance expenses consist primarily of the cost of routine maintenance and spare parts and provisions for the estimated future cost of heavy maintenance and engine overhauls on aircraft operated by easyJet pursuant to dry operating leases.
The extent of the required annual maintenance reserve charges is determined by reference to the number of flight hours and cycles permitted between each engine shop visit and heavy maintenance overhaul on aircraft airframes.
The increase in maintenance costs was largely due to a 22.1% increase in the average number of leased aircraft from 72.0 to 87.9, offset by the benefits of the new SR Technics maintenance contract.
Advertising Advertising costs increased by 7.4% from 30.5 million to 32.8 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
Spend per passenger was approximately 11.7% lower than the previous year which is principally due to maturity of markets, particularly in the UK.
This set off the additional costs incurred by entering into new markets in eastern Europe during the year.
Costs in 2004 reflected the costs of establishing the easyJet brand in Germany, particularly in Berlin and Dortmund.
While continued investment has been required in these markets in the current year, they have been at a lower level.
Merchant fees and incentive pay Merchant fees and incentive pay increased by 15.0% from 13.6 million to 15.6 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
Merchant fees and incentive pay includes the costs of processing fees paid for all of easyJets credit and debit card sales and the per-seat sold transferred commission paid as incentive pay to easyJets telesales staff.
The increase reflects an increase in passenger revenues of 21.8% since 2004.
This is offset by a decrease in the number of bookings made using credit cards from 72% of bookings in 2004 to 66% of bookings in 2005 due to wider card schemes enabling purchase by debit card in additional European countries.
Incentive pay paid to telesales personnel decreased slightly year on year due to the full-year effect of allowing online changes.
84% of changes were made online in 2005, compared to 73% in 2004.
Aircraft insurance Aircraft insurance costs reduced from 19.8 million in financial year 2004 to 19.3 million in financial year 2005, despite a 21.4% increase in passenger numbers.
This was as a result of lower rates being negotiated and also due to the beneficial effect of the strengthening of sterling against the US dollar.
Other costs Other costs increased by 11.6% from 71.7 million to 80.0 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
Items in this cost category include administrative costs and operational costs not included elsewhere including some salary expenses.
This cost category also includes compensation paid to passengers, and certain other items, such as currency exchange gains and losses and the profit or loss on the disposal of fixed assets.
The major influence of this category of costs was the growth in the scope of the operation.
Annual report and accounts 05 21 plc 95 05 Operational and financial review continued Depreciation Depreciation charges decreased by 14.4% from 19.2 million to 16.4 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
The depreciation charge reflects depreciation on owned aircraft and capitalised aircraft maintenance charges, and also includes depreciation on computer systems and other assets.
easyJet has owned an average of 4.1 Boeing 737-300 aircraft and 10.6 Airbus A319 aircraft during the financial year 2005 2004: 8.0 Boeing 737-300 aircraft and 4.9 Airbus A319 aircraft.
Due to the relative costs of acquisition, Boeing aircraft attract a higher absolute annual depreciation charge than Airbus aircraft.
The decrease in depreciation reflects the disposal of most of the owned Boeing 737-300 aircraft and the 3.8% improvement in the average value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which the majority of easyJets assets are denominated, and the additional depreciation of other assets such as spares and leasehold improvements.
Accelerated depreciation of 737-300 aircraft In 2004, management provided 3.4 million of additional depreciation in respect of the four oldest owned Boeing 737-300 aircraft to align the aircraft carrying value with the residual value.
These aircraft were all disposed of in the year ended 30 September 2004.
The residual values of six owned Boeing 737-300 aircraft were reassessed in 2004 which led to an additional 2.7 million of accelerated depreciation being recognised on these aircraft during 2004 and 2.7 million in 2005.
All of the aircraft have now been sold, with five being sold prior 30 September 2005.
Goodwill amortisation Goodwill amortisation charges increased slightly from 17.1 million to 17.4 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
Aircraft dry lease costs Aircraft dry lease costs increased by 28.3% from 96.4 million to 123.7 million from financial year 2004 to financial year 2005.
During the period 22 new Airbus A319 aircraft were added to the fleet on lease agreements, and the average number of leased aircraft during the year increased by 22.1% to 87.9.
Over the period, easyJet has been impacted by increasing US dollar interest rates which have increased lease payments.
This has been offset by the benefit of the strengthening of the value of sterling against the US dollar, the currency in which lease costs are denominated.
As a consequence, easyJet has seen its average leasing cost per aircraft increase by around 4.5%, year on year.
Share of operating profit of The Big Orange Handling Company The Big Orange Handling Company Limited is a joint venture company owned by Menzies Aviation Limited and easyJet.
It was set up in January 2004 to provide ground handling services at London Luton airport.
During the financial year 2005, the share 26% of the turnover attributable to easyJet was 2.0 million 2004: 1.4 million, and the share of operating profit was 0.2 million 2004: 0.2 million.
Interest receivable Interest receivable increased by 91.2% from 14.2 million in 2004 to 27.2 million in 2005.
This increase is because of an increase in the cash balance during the year from 510.3 million to 695.5 million and the higher sterling interest rates, since most of the Groups cash is retained in sterling.
Interest payable Interest payable increased 202.5% from 2.7 million to 8.2 million.
This primarily reflects an increase in bank loans from 119.8 million to 220.4 million due to the financing of new Airbus aircraft, and the increase in US dollar and sterling interest rates.
22 Annual report and accounts 05 Taxation In financial year 2005, easyJet incurred a tax charge of 25.3 million, an effective tax rate of 37% 2004: 21.1 million charge, being 34% effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate is higher than the UK standard rate of tax principally due to goodwill amortisation not being tax deductible.
A more detailed explanation may be found in note 7 to the accounts.
The deferred tax liability increased by 7.3 million from 20.2 million to 27.5 million, primarily due to capital allowances taken being in excess of depreciation charges.
Retained profit for the year For the reasons described above, easyJets retained profit increased by 3.7% from 41.1 million in financial year 2004 to 42.6 million in financial year 2005.
Earnings per share The basic earnings per share increased by 3.3% from 10.34 pence in the financial year 2004 to 10.68 pence in the financial year 2005.
The basic earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation, increased by 2.7% from 14.64 pence in the financial year 2004 to 15.03 pence in the financial year 2005.
Capital expenditure Group capital expenditure on tangible assets is set out in note 10 to the accounts.
Aircraft expenditure includes purchases of new Airbus aircraft, and the cost of purchased rotable spares and aircraft improvements.
Aircraft deposits include the amount expended on pre-delivery payments to Airbus and in 2004 Boeing in addition.
Fixtures, fittings and equipment includes, amongst other things, IT hardware and software development costs and office fixtures and fittings.
Total capital expenditure in the two years ended 30 September 2005 is summarised as follows: 2005 2004 million million Aircraft 159.2 262.3 Prepayments on account aircraft deposits 83.9 103.7 Leasehold improvements buildings 2.0 0.5 Fixtures fittings and equipment 2.8 3.9 247.9 370.4 In addition, aircraft spare parts totalling 8.5 million were received free of charge during 2005.
As a result of a purchase agreement approved by shareholders in March 2003, the Group is contractually committed to the acquisition of a further 65 new Airbus A319 aircraft with a list price of approximately US $2.9 billion, or 1.6 billion before escalations, discounts and deposits already paid 2004: 99 Airbus A319s, US $4.4 billion: 2.4 billion.
In respect of those aircraft, prepayments on account amounting to US $262.0 million 148.1 million had been made as at 30 September 2005 2004: US $299.4 million, 165.4 million.
It is intended that these aircraft will be financed partly by cash holdings and internal cash flow and partly through external financing including committed facilities arranged prior to delivery.
In addition, certain of the aircraft will be sold and leased back under operating leases.
Annual report and accounts 05 23 plc 95 05 Operational and financial review continued Working capital At 30 September 2005, net current assets were 495.1 million, up 125.1 million from 370.0 million at 30 September 2004.
This change principally reflects an increase in cash, an increase in debtors due to increased sales volumes offset by an increase in creditors, and an increase in the current portion of deferred profits on sale and leasebacks due to an additional 22 Airbus aircraft being sold and leased back during the year.
Unearned revenue including Government taxes increased from 143.0 million to 160.3 million due to increased volumes of passenger bookings.
Cash flow Net cash inflow from operating activities totalled 169.8 million, an increase of 9.3 million from 160.5 million in 2004.
The principal components of the net cash inflow were the operating profit and movements in the working capital cycle, in addition to movements in the maintenance provision of 27.1 million and an increase in long term deferred profits on sale and leaseback of aircraft of 27.5 million.
Net cash inflow before management of liquid resources and financing decreased 21.3 million from 108.4 million in 2004 to 87.1 million in 2005, due to increases in net cash inflow from operating activities offset by capital expenditure.
Financing arrangements The following table sets out the movements in loans for the two years ended 30 September 2005: 2005 2004 million million Balance at 1 October 119.8 72.8 New loans raised 146.2 65.8 Repayment of amounts borrowed 46.9 8.3 Financing fees 3.2 Effect of exchange rates 1.4 10.5 Balance at 30 September 217.3 119.8 34 Airbus A319s were delivered during the year.
Twelve of the aircraft were financed through US dollar or sterling mortgage loans with the remaining being sold and leased back for a period of between seven and ten years.
For the purposes of the financial statements, foreign currency debt is translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates.
Gains and losses on translation on loans which finance US dollar denominated fixed assets are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising on the translation of the related assets.
The debt translation loss taken to reserves in 2005 was 1.4 million 2004: gain of 10.5 million.
Share capital The number of shares allotted, called up and fully paid on 30 September 2005 was 400.4 million 2004: 399.2 million.
During 2005, 1.2 million shares were issued on exercise of options under employee share option schemes 2004: 5.2 million.
24 Annual report and accounts 05 Other matters Liquidity and investments The Group holds significant cash or liquid funds as a form of insurance to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events.
The cash and liquid investment balances at 30 September 2005 totalled 695.5 million 2004: 510.3 million.
The robust increase in cash and liquid investment balances from the prior year represents continued cash inflows generated from the operation of the business together with cash inflows generated from aircraft financing activities.
Group cash resources are used to fund payments made to Airbus in advance of taking delivery of aircraft, and drawdown of the full committed aircraft financing is made only when the aircraft is delivered.
As a result aircraft deliveries are cash generative for the Group.
Surplus funds are invested, in line with Board-approved policy, in high-quality short-term liquid instruments, usually money market funds or bank deposits.
Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any one individual counterparty, taking into account its credit rating.
Such counterparty exposures are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
Accordingly, the possibility of material loss arising in the event of non-performance by counterparties is considered to be unlikely.
Management of financial and fuel price risks The Board of Directors is responsible for setting treasury policy and objectives, and approves the parameters within which the various aspects of treasury risk management are operated.
Approved treasury policy outlines the Groups approach to corporate and asset financing, interest rate risk, fuel price risk, foreign exchange risk and cash and liquidity management.
The policy also lists the financial instruments and time periods which the Groups treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks.
The policy is under ongoing review to ensure best practice in the light of developments in the trading and financial markets.
The treasury function implements the agreed policies on a day-to-day basis to meet the treasury objectives.
These objectives include ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its day-to-day needs and to fund its capital commitments: deploying any surplus liquidity in a prudent and profitable manner: managing currency, fuel, interest rate and credit exposures: and managing the Groups worldwide relationship with banks and financial institutions.
Financing and interest rate risk All of the Groups debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders and other financiers.
These factors are also reflected in the medium-term profile of the Groups loans and operating leases.
The incidence of repayments is shown in note 23.
The Group demonstrated its continued ability to raise new committed financing, with 97 of the 120 Airbus aircraft to be delivered through February 2009 having committed financing in place at 30 September 2005 2004: 82.
Group interest rate management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of its financing.
All Group loans are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months, while a minimum of 40% of operating leases rentals are based on fixed interest rates at the time of aircraft delivery.
Of the operating leases in place at 30 September 2005 approximately 59% of lease payments were based on fixed interest rates and 41% were based on floating interest rates 2004: 58% fixed, 42% floating.
The Groups loan borrowings and operating leases are denominated in US dollars and sterling.
The Groups aircraft are priced in and transacted in US dollars and 60% of loans outstanding at 30 September 2005 were priced in US dollars and 40% in sterling 2004: 100% US dollars.
Annual report and accounts 05 25 plc 95 05 Operational and financial review continued Foreign currency risk The Group is broadly neutral in the key currencies in which it does business, with the exception of the US dollar.
Capital, lease, and some mortgage payments and proceeds from the sale of aircraft are denominated in US dollars.
As a result the Group can experience adverse or beneficial effects arising from exchange rate movements.
The Group seeks to reduce its foreign exchange exposure arising from transactions in various currencies through a policy of matching, as far as possible, receipts and payments in each individual currency.
In addition, the Group uses a limited range of hedging instruments as described below.
The Group has substantial liabilities denominated in US dollars.
Some aircraft owning companies are treated as US dollar branches, and some are sterling denominated.
In US dollar branches, movements in the aircraft values act as a natural hedge against the loans.
As noted below, under International Financial Reporting Standards, this natural accounting hedge will no longer exist, and will cause additional volatility in the income statement due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
We expect to manage this risk through a mixture of drawing down loans in sterling, holding cash in US dollars and entering into foreign exchange options.
Fuel price risk The Group fuel risk management policy aims to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in jet fuel price while ensuring that the Group may also benefit from price reductions.
In order to provide protection the Group uses a limited range of hedging instruments traded on the over-the-counter markets, principally zero-cost collars and forwards, with approved counterparties and within approved limits.
Group policy at 30 September 2005 is to hedge a maximum of 80% of estimated exposures up to 12 months in advance, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated expense up to 36 months in advance.
In exceptional market conditions, the Board may accelerate or limit the implementation of the hedging policy.
Further details can be found in note 23 below.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives with off-balancesheet risk selectively for currency and fuel risk management purposes as described above.
The Groups policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use these instruments to hedge anticipated exposures.
Forward foreign exchange and fuel contracts and zero-cost collars are used to cover currency and jet fuel exposures.
All contracts outstanding at 30 September 2005 are summarised in note 23.
The Group does not permit selling of currency and jet fuel options, except as part of a fully matched options collar hedging structure.
All derivatives are used for the purpose of risk management: they do not expose the Group to market risk because gains and losses on the derivatives offset losses and gains on the matching asset, liability, revenue or cost being hedged.
Counterparty credit risk is generally restricted to any hedging gain from time to time and is controlled through mark-to-market-based credit limits.
Critical accounting policies easyJets consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP.
Significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the stated accounting policies requires easyJets management to make estimates and assumptions that will affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
easyJets estimates and assumptions are based on managements historical experiences, changes in the business environment and advice from specialists.
However, actual results may differ from these estimates if actual conditions are different.
The policies used in determining the carrying value of aircraft, aircraft maintenance liabilities, and corporation tax are material to easyJets financial statements and require a significant amount of management judgement.
26 Annual report and accounts 05 Carrying value of aircraft easyJet typically holds its owned aircraft for a period of seven years, and depreciates aircraft to an estimated residual value over this period.
As aircraft have a useful life beyond 20 years, there is usually a substantial residual value at seven years.
The residual value relates to the expected net sale proceeds which easyJet estimates it could obtain when it sells the aircraft.
In estimating the residual values, easyJet management will consult a range of external valuers, and take into account its own knowledge and experience.
Nevertheless, there can be significant variations between expected and actual residual values, as a result of factors such as the general strength of the global aviation market, the supply of aircraft suitable for low-cost airlines, the supply of the specific aircraft type being sold, and the supply of aircraft generally.
Variations may result in changes to the depreciation estimate or impairment charges, and as this is a significant component of the cost base of the Group, this may cause significant variations in the profitability of the Group.
Aircraft maintenance costs easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of its leased aircraft during the course of the lease term.
These are as a result of legal and constructive obligations in the lease contract in respect of the return conditions applied by lessors, which require aircraft airframes, engines, landing gear and auxiliary power units to reach at least a specified condition on their return at the end of the lease term.
In most instances, to reach the specified conditions, easyJet will need to carry out a heavy duty maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe once during the lease term, usually towards the end of the lease.
Other work may be required on landing gear and auxiliary power units.
A charge is made in the profit and loss account each month based on the number of flight hours or cycles used to build up a provision to cover the cost of heavy duty maintenance checks when they occur.
Estimates involved in calculating the provision required include the expected date of the check, market conditions for heavy duty maintenance checks pertaining at the expected date of check, the condition of asset at the time of the check, the likely utilisation of the asset in terms of either flying hours or cycles, and the regulations in relation to extensions to lives of life limited parts, which form a significant proportion of the cost of heavy duty maintenance costs of engines.
easyJet is also required to pay maintenance reserves to certain lessors on a monthly basis, based on usage, to provide a security deposit for the lessor should the aircraft be returned without meeting its return conditions.
These maintenance reserves are then returned to the Group on production of evidence that qualifying maintenance expenditure has been incurred.
Maintenance reserves paid are deducted from the provision made.
In some instances, not all of the maintenance reserves paid can be recovered by the Group and therefore are retained by the lessor at the end of the lease term.
If management considers this is likely to occur, then an additional provision is made again either on a flying hours or cycles basis to cover the expected liability.
Assumptions made in respect of the basis of the provisions are reviewed for all aircraft once a year.
In addition, when further information becomes available which could materially change an estimate made, such as a heavy duty maintenance check taking place, utilisation assumptions changing, or return conditions being renegotiated, then specific estimates are reviewed immediately, and the provision is reset accordingly.
Corporation tax In the ordinary course of easyJets business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain at the time the accounts are prepared.
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our corporation tax liabilities in each of the jurisdications in which we operate.
This process involves estimating our current tax exposures on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.
Included in the estimation process is making judgements on the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Tax exposures can involve complex issues and can take an extended period to resolve.
The effective tax rate of easyJet is derived from the effective tax rate of the weighted earnings in each jurisdiction that we operate.
Changes in the geographic mix of earnings can affect easyJets effective tax rate.
Annual report and accounts 05 27 plc 95 05 Operational and financial review continued International Financial Reporting Standards easyJet will prepare its consolidated financial statements to 30 September 2006 under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
An IFRS transition project team was put in place in 2003.
Progress continues according to the project plan, and the project is on track to deliver IFRS-compliant information for the 2005 year.
We expect that this information will be communicated to shareholders in January 2006.
Although the project team are still in the process of finalising the full impact of adopting IFRS, we expect the main impacts on easyJet will be as follows: IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 will be adopted on 1 October 2005.
This standard impacts the accounting for a wide range of financial instruments, including certain financing and purchase contracts, and those used by easyJet to manage foreign exchange and fuel price risks.
Systems are in place to measure the effectiveness of hedges of foreign exchange and fuel prices.
Based on tests to date, our fuel price and foreign exchange hedges are largely effective.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Goodwill held in the UK GAAP consolidated balance sheet is being amortised over a period of 20 years.
Under IFRS 3, regular amortisation of goodwill is prohibited.
Instead, an annual impairment test is required to support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any impairment charge will be reflected in the profit and loss account.
The format of the impairment test is different from that used under UK GAAP.
IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment Under UK GAAP, no charge is reflected in the consolidated profit and loss account for easyJets share options.
Under IFRS 2, all options which were issued after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested prior to 1 January 2005 must be fair valued and expensed in the income statement over the vesting period of the options.
IAS 12 Income Taxes Adjustments will be made for the tax impacts of restating the carrying values of fixed assets under IAS 21 and IFRS 1 described below, and the impact of IFRS 2 described above.
In addition deferred tax adjustments will be made for differences in asset bases under IFRS.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 includes the requirement to accrue for all short-term benefits payable during employment, including holiday pay.
IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Under UK GAAP, certain  assets and liabilities are treated as foreign operations or branches with the US dollar as their functional currency, and as a consequence, exchange movements are taken to reserves rather than through the income statement.
Under IAS 21, the criteria used to assess the functional currency of foreign operations differ from those used under UK GAAP.
easyJet has reviewed the impact of this and has at the same time reconsidered its approach to managing currency risk in its foreign operations.
Following the review easyJet has considered that those aircraftowning companies within the Group currently classified as US dollar branches under UK GAAP will under IAS 21 be treated as having a sterling functional currency.
Consequently exchange differences on retranslation of monetary items will be taken to the income statement.
easyJet will implement effective foreign currency risk management policies to mitigate exchange volatility, as described above.
IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Certain tangible fixed assets will be revalued at 1 October 2004, the date of the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet.
This valuation will be taken as the deemed cost of those assets on that date.
