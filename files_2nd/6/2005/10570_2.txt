In addition to its cash resources the Group has a 25m three year revolving facility available until June 2006 and a 30m overdraft facility with its main clearing bankers, which is reviewed annually.
Banking facilities are subject to normal financial covenants, all of which have been met in the year.
The Group has established treasury policies setting out clear guidelines as to the use of counterparties and the maximum period of borrowings and deposits.
Deposits are for periods of no longer than three months and are at rates prevailing on the day of the transaction.
The Group has no exposure to foreign exchange risk because its operations are based solely in the United Kingdom.
Although the Group does not use derivatives, some of its joint venture businesses use interest rate swaps to hedge floating interest rate exposures.
These arrangements meet the hedging rules under International Accounting Standard 39 and hence the Groups share of the movement on these derivatives is accounted for as a movement on reserves.
The hedging reserve at 31 December 2005 was 2.2m.
Overall, the Group considers that its exposure to interest rate movements is appropriately managed.
