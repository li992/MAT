Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 11 Finance Directors Report Tax Charge The tax charge of 92 million represents an effective tax rate of 30.3%, which is in line with the rate reported at the half-year.
The tax charge comprises corporation tax of 67 million and deferred tax of 25 million.
The current year corporation tax represents 22% of profit before tax.
The cash outflow in respect of tax during the year was 53 million and this represents 17% of profit before tax.
Dividend payment The directors are recommending the payment of a final dividend of 12.4 pence per ordinary share.
The dividend, subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 23 January 2006.
This will result in a full year dividend of 18.0 pence per share, an increase of 50% on prior year.
This represents dividend cover of 3.5 times based on adjusted earnings per share of 63.2 pence.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Group will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as the basis on which it will report its financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2006.
Therefore, the first financial statements to be published under IFRS will be our interim results for the period ended 31 March 2006.
The Group continues to prepare for this and has carried out a detailed review of the impact of each standard on the financial statements.
In our annual accounts for the year ended 30 September 2004 we outlined three main areas where we expected differences to arise.
These were fixed assets, hedge accounting and deferred tax.
Having carried out more detailed analysis, we still expect these to be the key areas of difference.
There will also be a relatively small impact from recognising the fair value of share-based incentives over their vesting period and from ceasing to amortise goodwill.
The revised accounting does not impact on the cash flows of the business.
We propose publishing full details of the transition to IFRS in April 2006, prior to the announcement of our Interim Results for the six months ended 31 March 2006, which we expect to announce in May 2006.
Details to be published will include a full reconciliation of the balance sheet under UK standards as published at 30 September 2004 to the opening balance sheet under IFRS and the restated results for the periods to 31 March 2005 and 30 September 2005.
