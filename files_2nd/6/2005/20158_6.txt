Rising leverage ratios often enabled private equity buyers to outbid trade buyers.

In prior years, the SMI figures were included within those of the business line to which individual assets previously related.
For ease of comparison, we have adjusted the 2004 figures to show them on the same basis as those for 2005.
For Buyouts, the gross return of 22% was underpinned by a high level of profitable realisations and the continuing strong performance of the portfolio.
The Growth Capital business line achieved a 24% gross return, mainly as a result of strong realisation profits and good first-time uplifts on a number of recent investments.
Venture Capital made a gross return of 11%, reflecting a good level of realised profits and a number of valuation increases arising as a result of portfolio companies raising funds from new investors at increased values.
Across each of the business lines, we have seen the portfolios health improving and the level of provisions falling.
3i Report and accounts 2005 20 The gross portfolio return from the Table 3: Summary of changes to investment portfolio SMI portfolio was 70 million 7%, 2005 2004 m m which comprises 86 million of income Opening portfolio 4,326 3,939 receipts, realised profits of 2 million and a net unrealised valuation reduction Investment 755 784 of 18 million.

Continental European investment represented 45% of the total invested, the US 7% and Asia 4%.
The share of investment represented by continental Europe reflects our focus on the relatively less mature private equity markets there compared with those in the UK.
3is ability to access and execute deals across Europe through our regional presence and ability to resource transactions on a pan-European basis has also driven investment growth.

Table 6 shows an analysis of realisation proceeds by business line and geography.
Realisations were strong across all business lines, but most significantly within Buyouts, where advantage was taken of the high level of secondary buyout activity.
Geographically, the UK was particularly active, generating 69% of total proceeds.
Although most of our realisation proceeds continue to come from sales of portfolio businesses to trade and financial purchasers, 12 portfolio companies achieved IPOs during the year on six different markets.
The IPOs of Pinewood Shepperton, the film and TV studios business, in May 2004 and E2V Holdings, a supplier of switching, sensing and imaging components, in June 2004, were notable in providing 3i with a 100% cash realisation on IPO.
Significant individual contributions to our realisation proceeds for the year were Yellow Brick Road, the telephone directories group, where we achieved interim realisation proceeds of 61 million through a merger and refinancing completed in April 2004: 3i Report and accounts 2005 22 and the sale in October 2004 of 20 million value increase.
