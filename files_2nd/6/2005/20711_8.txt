In the IFRS restatements published on 27 May 2005, the Group utilised the transitional provisions in IFRS Results by category and business sector 1 that only required financial liabilities fide-recognised The commentary and ratios below are based on after 1 January 2004 to be re-recognised.
a comparison of the 2005 results against the 2004 proforma results, the basis of preparation for which Following a review of industry best practice and the Chancellors announcement in December 2005 of plans are described above.
Statutory results, which are not on a comparable basis, are shown in pages 44 to 88. by the Government to require banks to pay certain inactive balances to a community fund, it is now considered more appropriate to recognise all financial liabilities at their full contractual value.
The impact of this is to increase liabilities at 1 January 2005 by 41m, which after tax reduces shareholder funds by 28m.
Proforma accounts In accordance with the transitional provisions on first-time adoption of IFRS, the 2004 statutory comparatives do not follow either IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation or IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Consequently the statutory income statements for 2004 and 2005 are not on a comparable basis.
To enable a more meaningful presentation of results, in addition to the statutory comparatives, proforma results for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been prepared.
These show how the 2004 results would have looked, assuming the full application of IAS 32, and the application of IAS 39 excluding fair value accounting volatility.
We have not shown the full impacts from all the IAS 39 accounting rules, as hedges and financial assets to be fair valued were only designated and documented from 1 January 2005.
A reconciliation between proforma and statutory IFRS results for 2004 is given on page 90.
Fair value accounting volatility arises from the requirement in IAS 39 to measure all derivatives at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement unless designated as part of a hedging relationship.
The volatility from derivative fair value movements can be mitigated by cash flow hedging, where the fair value movements on hedges which are effective from an accounting perspective are instead taken directly to equity.
The volatility can also be mitigated by fair value hedging, where there is a corresponding opposite entry to the income statement with regard to the hedged asset or liability for hedges which are effective from an accounting perspective.
In practice some accounting volatility will remain, even where the hedges used match the risk exposure on an economic basis.
Also, in some instances it is impractical to apply hedge accounting.
In such cases, the derivative would be recorded at fair value, but the underlying asset or liability may be at amortised cost, creating a mismatch in the income statement.
