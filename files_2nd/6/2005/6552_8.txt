Operating and Financial Review Group Financial Review Another year of value creation Group summary During 2005 the Group continued to generate considerable shareholder value despite a reduction in Group profits.
Return on average capital employed was 22.3%.
Shareholders funds rose by 213 million and a 10% increase in the full year dividend is proposed.
At the same time, the balance sheet was further strengthened with gearing reduced to 34% 2004: 39%.
Group results Generating value for shareholders: The 2005 accounts have been prepared in line with International Accounting Standards and the 2004 numbers have been restated accordingly and in accordance with the accounting policies disclosed in ROACE 22.3% the Interim Report for 2005.
2004 comparative gures have also been restated for land sales which are Shareholders funds increased no longer included in turnover.
by 213 million Group completions grew 2% to 17,021 2004: 16,654 in spite of more difficult market conditions in the Balance sheet strengthened, UK.
Group profit before tax at 366.5 million was 71.1 million below 2004s record performance as a result gearing reduced to 34% of reduced margins in the UK 2004: 437.6 million.
Year end net debt at 521.9 million 2004: 520.9 million Dividend increased by 10% was very similar to the preceding two years resulting in gearing progressively falling 2003: 50%, 2004: 39%, 2005: 34% on an IFRS basis.
The future direction of gearing will depend upon market conditions and the attractiveness of investment opportunities.
Group turnover increased by 1% to 3,003.2 million 2004: 2,976.0 million with the 5% turnover reduction in the UK to 2,157.6 million 2004: 2,277.9 million more than offset by the success of the Morrison Homes organic growth strategy.
Exchange rates had little effect on the Income Statement with profits translated in 2005 at $1.82:1 2004: $1.83:1.
UK operating margins fell from 18.0% in 2004 to 12.9% in 2005 as a result of a weaker market environment resulting in the need to increase the level of incentives offered and increasing land costs.
The UK business continued to focus on improving cost efficiency and during the year incurred 5.2 million of restructuring costs targeted at reducing overheads.
This was treated as a normal operating expense.
In the UK, against a weak housing market, when total transactions fell by 17% on the previous year, George Wimpey sustained total volumes of 12,100 homes, just 1% below the number achieved in 2004 of 12,232.
In contrast the US housing market enjoyed another record year which was generally reected in the markets in which Morrison Homes has focused.
Morrison increased its operating margins from 14.7% in 2004 to 20.0% in 2005 through strong increases in prices and tight cost control.
With lower profits and continued investment to support growth, particularly in the US, return on average capital employed was 22.3% 2004: 28.9%.
Reported interest costs for 2005 totalled 71.0 million, an increase of 11.1 million 2004: 59.9 million.
Within this net interest on borrowings from financial institutions totalled 50.0 million, an increase of 26 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Operating and Financial Review only 2.0 million 2004: 48.0 million, with the effect of average borrowings up 10% to approximately 965 million, mostly offset by lower effective interest rates.
Other items charged to this line under International Accounting Standards include a pensions charge of 8.5 million 2004: 8.1 million, a net 3.8 million 2004: 2.4 million charge for imputed interest on long term land creditors and a mark to market charge on our interest rate derivatives of 5.3 million.
The tax charge for the year totalled 113.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31%.
The tax charge benefited from the resolution of some outstanding tax issues.
Looking forward the effective rate is expected to rise given the increased level of the Groups profits being realised in the US.
Balance sheet and cash ow Shareholders funds continued to grow strongly, increasing by 16% to 1,544.4 million 2004: 1,331.4 million.
Expressed on a per share basis, shareholders funds totalled 389 pence 2004: 340 pence, an increase of 49 pence after allowing for dividends already paid out during the calendar year of 16.5 pence.
Year end net debt levels were fairly constant, despite the impact of the stronger US$ on our US$ borrowings.
Retained shareholders funds have been the source of finance to support the increased investment in the Groups assets.
The increase in net assets employed was 214.0 million to 2,066.3 million 2004: 1,852.3 million.
This is reected in the higher value of land assets and work in progress, which in turn is targeted at delivering further growth.
Land is valued at the lower of historic cost or realisable value and on this basis totalled 2,153.4 million at the end of 2005 2004: 1,932.3 million.
The Group continues to make use of deferred land payment opportunities when it is economic to do so.
The land creditor balance stood at 380.5 million 2004: 274.7 million.
This increase primarily relates to a small number of sizeable, attractive land acquisitions in the UK which were achieved on favourable terms.
Investment in work in progress has also increased from 714.9 million to 778.8 million at the end of 2005, reecting the strong increase in our order books in both the UK and US, which increased by 31% and 36% respectively compared with the order books at the end of 2004.
The Groups net cash outow was 1.0 million after meeting our interest and tax obligations and again raising the level of dividends paid.
Land spend in the year was 839.0 million, 101.6 million in excess of land realisations, reecting our focused strategy to lay the foundations for further growth in the UK and US.

Group completions grew by 6% to 10,452 2004: 9,847 although average prices were lower reecting some mix changes and the challenging market conditions in the UK.
Operating profits fell by 11% to 281.0 million 2004: 315.7 million whilst interest costs rose by 4.8 million to 36.8 million.
Consequently, profit before tax reduced by 14% to 244.2 million 2004: 283.7 million.
In the UK, as we approached the year end, there were early signs that consumer confidence was returning and that affordability was improving in the south of the country.
Total UK completions in the second half grew by 5% to 7,524 2004: 7,139, however this growth was essentially in social housing where lower prices are realised.
The operating margins in the second half showed some improvement at 13.1% compared with 12.6% in the first half.
Whilst gross margins were lower, this was more than offset by improved overhead recovery.
In the US market conditions remained generally strong although parts of the Californian market slowed sharply towards the end of the year.
Robust economic, population and job growth, together with a favourable interest rate environment, continued to sustain a healthy market.
Morrison Homes, second half completions at 2,928 grew by 8% 2004: 2,708.

30 Financial and Treasury Policies The Group has nanced its growth in recent years through a combination of retained profits, bank loans 20 and long term loans in the form of US$ private placements with a group of US insurance companies.
All loans and banking relationships are managed centrally through the Group Treasury Department.
10 We continue to use derivatives to generate the appropriate balance between xed, capped and oating interest rate proles.
It is not our policy to trade actively in derivatives or to use more complex derivatives.
0 03 04 05 The Groups Treasury Committee is responsible for developing and recommending policy to the Board and IFRS for monitoring our finance risks.
The main risks arising from our nancing instruments are liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange currency risk and credit risk.
Shareholders funds per share Liquidity Risk: The Group maintains adequate committed borrowing facilities to ensure that seasonal pence borrowing can be accommodated whilst maintaining prudent headroom and a range of development 500 plans can be nanced.
The Group had committed bank facilities of 1,175 million at the end of 2005.
It also had long term debt raised in the US private placement market of 333 million with maturities 400 ranging up to 13 years.
During 2005 we negotiated further cost reductions in both the cost of our bank borrowings and our 300 oating rate capital market funding.
These reductions were achieved through favourable conditions in the debt markets as well as the excellent relationships we have established with our debt providers over 200 a considerable period of time.
At the same time we took the opportunity to maintain the average debt maturity prole at close to five years.
These cost reductions mitigated against the effect of higher short 100 term interest rates which were particularly notable in US$ interest rates.
Interest Rate Risk: We aim to limit our exposure to uctuations in the cash interest cost of servicing our 0 debt by using xed interest rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and options.
The most adverse scenario 03 04 05 IFRS for the Group is a significant increase in interest rates which would weaken the housing market at the restated for IFRS same time as increasing borrowing costs.
In order to improve the economic mitigation of this risk, we decided to manage with regard to average forecast level of borrowings in each currency rather than forecast year end borrowings.
This resulted in xed rate borrowings approximately equal to year end borrowings, but with a higher amount of Sterling xed rate borrowings than year end borrowings.
As noted last year, after careful consideration on the introduction of IAS 39, we decided that we should continue to hedge interest rate exposure to reduce the economic impact on the business of interest rate movements, even if such hedges did not meet the strict prescriptive conditions to adopt hedge accounting under the new standard.
During 2005 the Groups interest rate derivatives reduced the payments for interest: however the value of the Groups derivatives fell by 5.3 million as a result of an expected more favourable interest rate environment in the future.
Such an interest rate environment should be beneficial for the housing market.
Currency Risk: Our principal currency risk is the translation exposure of our investment in Morrison Homes.
Our policy is to match as far as practicable our Dollar denominated asset with Dollar denominated debt.
Consequently movement in the Sterling Dollar exchange rate has had little effect on the Groups shareholders funds, though it did affect the Sterling value of year end debt as well as reported turnover and profit before tax.
Credit Risk: We have no significant concentration of credit risk.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Treasury Committee.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit which is reassessed periodically by the Treasury Committee.
The Group has continued its policy of managing its exposure to the risk related to major inner-city developments by arranging joint ventures and nancing the schemes with non-recourse project risk facilities.
The third joint venture of this type was arranged in 2005.
These schemes are performing satisfactorily with the first completions and profits being achieved in 2005 on one of the joint ventures arranged in 2004.
28 George Wimpey Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 276 50 340 39 389 34 Operating and Financial Review Accounting Standards We have produced the 2005 Annual Report in accordance with standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The results for 2004 have been restated to be on a consistent basis, apart from the impact from IAS 39 which only applied from 1 January 2005.
Note 28 sets out the reconciling items between the published 2004 accounts, prepared under UK GAAP, and the restated 2004 accounts.
All of the reconciling items are in line with the statements made in the 2004 Operating and Financial Review.
The principal changes affecting the results and net assets of the Group are: Accounting for pension costs under IAS 19: Under SSAP 24 the pension charge in 2004 was 11.0 million.
Under IAS 19 the total charge was 18.9 million, and in 2005 the total charge was 18.4 million.
Accounting for share-based payments under IFRS 2: The charge under UK GAAP in 2004 was 0.5 million, partly reecting the ability under UK GAAP to write back provisions for schemes which were unlikely to vest to participants.
The IFRS 2 charge in 2004 was 2.2 million, and in 2005 the charge was 3.5 million as a result of more option schemes creating a charge due to the cut-off effect of IFRS 2 only applying to options granted after 7 November 2002.
Accounting for long term inventory creditors under IAS 2: Under UK GAAP there was no charge in the reported 2004 results.
In the restated Income Statement under IAS there was an interest charge of 2.4 million net of 1.4 million of capitalised interest offset partly by improved margins due to reduced cost of sales of 0.5 million.
In 2005 there was an interest charge of 3.8 million net of 3.4 million of interest capitalised offset by improved margins of 1.5 million.
In addition to the above, the Group has elected to adopt the policy of full recognition of actuarial gains and losses whereby movements in pension scheme obligations, due to changes in actuarial assumptions or revised terms of the pension scheme, are recognised in full through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
In 2004 this gave a charge of 3.6 million, in line with the gure in the FRS 17 disclosures in 2004.
All of the adjustments, net of tax, together with the Balance Sheet value of the adjustments at the date of transition to International Accounting Standards of 1 January 2004, reduced net asset value at 31 December 2004 by 150.0 million.
This reduction is partially offset by 42.3 million as dividends are no longer recognised as liabilities until declared or, where necessary, approved by shareholders.
The net reduction in net asset value at 31 December 2004 was, therefore, 107.7 million.
Pensions There was a full actuarial valuation of the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme as at 31 March 2005.
The valuation determined the gross deficit as 148 million, 104 million net of deferred tax.
As a result of that valuation the Trustees and the Board have agreed that the Company will continue to make contributions equivalent to 15 million per annum to fund the deficit.
This is in addition to the ongoing costs of providing future service benets.
Pension net liabilities are reected in the 2005 accounts in accordance with IAS 19, which uses different methodology to the triennial valuation.
Shareholders funds are shown net of any pension deficit, which stood at 129 million, net of deferred taxation, slightly below the level of 2004 130 million.
The Board, in conjunction with the Trustees, continues to take a prudent approach to the investment strategy in relation to the pension fund and the actuarial assumptions used in assessing the deficit.
In particular the mortality assumptions have been fully updated to reect the trends identied by a specic George Wimpey study carried out by the actuaries to the Pension Scheme Trustees.
Details relating to the Pension Scheme, as represented in the 2005 Accounts and the most recent Actuarial Valuation, are shown in note 20.
