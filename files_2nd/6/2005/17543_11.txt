The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UK UK GAAP.
UK GAAP differs in certain important respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the US US GAAP.
See the reconciliation of UK GAAP to US GAAP at Note 29 to the audited financial statements for the Group.
US GAAP information is provided in this document because we have US employees who have been granted share options.
Factors Affecting Results of Operations Group Turnover We are the leading provider of classified directory advertising and associated products and services in the UK and the leading independent provider of classified telephone directory advertising in the US.
We currently derive our turnover principally from sales of advertisements in our printed directories, Yellow Pages, Yellow Book and Business Pages.
We also generate turnover from online-related activities such as online advertising, website design and domain-name sales and from our classified telephone directory service Yellow Pages 118 24 7.
Our sales and publishing cycle requires us to agree to an advertising sale often months in advance of the actual delivery of the directories and recognition of the corresponding revenues.
Therefore, we have better visibility of our expected near-term financial results than might otherwise be the case.
We recognise turnover from advertisement sales for a printed directory when we have completed delivery of that directory.
Because the number and type of directories are not evenly distributed throughout the year, turnover and profits do not arise evenly over the year.
Therefore, certain periods have higher-than-average levels of turnover and profits, whilst others have lower-than-average levels.
For example, during our 2005 financial year, the four financial quarters accounted for 22%, 25%, 23% and 30% of Group turnover, respectively.
Different directories may grow at different rates, such that growth may not be evenly distributed between quarters.
We sometimes have to rephase our timing of distributions into an earlier or later period for operational reasons, such as when we rescope directories or integrate acquisitions.
Such changes can also affect the quarterly distribution of turnover.
We recognise turnover from non-printed directories and other activities over the life of the contract from the point at which the service is first provided or, in the case of a single delivery, at the time of delivery.
Growth in our turnover is driven primarily by the volume of advertisement sales to new and existing advertisers and by new product offerings.
In the US, we have also experienced growth in turnover as a result of acquisitions of other independent directory publishers and new printed directory launches.
Our ability to increase turnover in the UK during the period under review was limited by the undertakings given to the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in 2001, under which, from January 2002, we were required to limit the annual growth in advertising rates in our UK printed Yellow Pages directories to RPI less 6% for an expected period of four years.
This has restricted our ability to raise prices on advertisements within our printed Yellow Pages directories in the UK.
When RPI is less than 6%, this price cap requires us to reduce the price in absolute terms that we can charge our advertisers for placing advertisements in our UK printed consumer classified directories.
Relative to inflation, our prices will decrease each year that the price cap remains in effect.
For example, if inflation as measured by RPI were 2% at the time prices are set for given directories in each of the four years commencing January 2002, then advertisement prices would be reduced in absolute terms by 4% each year, and the prices in the fourth year would be approximately 15% lower than they were when the new price cap took effect.
During our 2005 financial year, the average price of advertising in our Yellow Pages directories decreased by 3.3%, as compared to a decrease of 4.8% during our 2004 financial year.
We are not subject to any regulatory price constraints in the US.
In the 2005 financial year, 46% of the Groups turnover was affected by a price cap, as compared to 49% during the 2004 financial year.
In the 2005 financial year, 52% of our turnover came from our UK operations compared with 53% in the 2004 financial year.
While the current Competition Commission review of the market is underway, we will continue to cut prices for advertising in our UK Yellow Pages directories in line with the RPI less 6% formula.
44 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 Cost of Sales Our cost of sales consists principally of costs associated with the publication of directories, including advertising sales, paper, printing and pre-press production, as well as bad debt expense.
The principal components of advertising sales costs, which represent a significant portion of our cost of sales, are employee costs of the sales force, including salaries, benefits and commissions, and associated direct costs.
We recognise the cost of sales for each directory on completion of delivery of that directory.
We anticipate that cost of sales will increase as we expand and introduce new directories and other products.
Our expansion into new markets in the US also increases our employee costs.
In addition to requiring a larger sales force, the commissions we pay to our sales force tend to be higher in new markets, as our commission structure pays higher remuneration for new advertisers.
Paper is our largest raw material and one of our largest variable-cost items.
In recent years paper prices have fluctuated significantly.
In the 2005 financial year, paper costs were equivalent to 6.6% of Group turnover and represented 10.6% of our total cost of sales in the UK and 17.0% of our total cost of sales in the US.
Cost of sales also includes bad debt expense.
Our UK business currently has low bad debt expense relative to our US business due to our established market position in the UK.
Our Yellow Book directories business operates in a number of markets in which we are a relatively new entrant, and as a result a higher proportion of our advertisers are new advertisers, a category in which historically we have intentionally accepted a higher rate of bad debts.
We believe that the benefits of our growth strategy in the US outweigh any risks associated with the credit profile of our advertisers and, over time, as our newer directories become more established in their respective markets, we expect that bad debt expense as a percentage of turnover in the US will decrease.
Nevertheless, because we expect to continue our growth strategy in the future, we expect our bad debt expense as a percentage of turnover in the US to remain higher than in the UK.
Distribution Costs and Administrative Costs Our distribution costs consist principally of amounts payable to third-party delivery companies with which we contract for the delivery of our printed directories.
Our distribution costs related to a directory are recognised when the directory is delivered.
Our administrative costs consist principally of amortisation and depreciation, advertising, promotion and marketing expenses, administrative staff expenses, information technology costs and staff training.
Advertising, promotion and marketing expenses represent our most significant discretionary expenses.
Gross Profit Margins The change in the geographic mix of our business, as well as the strategy we have pursued of rapid growth and geographic expansion of our business in the US, has had an important effect on our financial results during the periods under review, including our profit margins.
These factors are expected to continue affecting our financial results in the future.
In the US, the different market dynamics and the younger portfolio result in lower gross profit margins than in the UK.
In the 2005 financial year, for example, our gross profit margin for our UK printed directories was 62.9%, compared to 44.3% for our US printed directories.
Our overall gross profit margin is therefore affected and will continue to be affected to the extent our US operations continue to form an increasing portion of the geographic mix of our business.
We intend to increase our focus on enhancing our operating efficiencies and organic growth in the US, and we believe there will be opportunities to improve our US gross profit margins as our US operations become more established.
Our printed directories business in the UK, which we view as more developed and which covers substantially all of the UK, has historically had higher gross profit margins than those in the US.

Exchange impact is the difference between the results reported at a constant exchange rate and the actual results reported using current year exchange rates.
b The percentage of total Group turnover.
Group turnover increased by 98.4 million, or 8.3%, from 1,186.9 million in the 2004 financial year to 1,285.3 million in the 2005 financial year, reflecting increased turnover during the period from each business segment.
UK Turnover UK printed directories turnover increased by 3.1%, or 18.2 million, during the 2005 financial year.
We added almost 117,000 new advertisers, exceeding our target of 100,000 new advertisers for the fifth successive year.
We retained 75% of existing customers 74% excluding national and key accounts.
The decline from 77% last year primarily reflects increased competition and the substantial growth in our advertiser base over the last five years as new customers typically dilute retention.
As a result, the total number of unique print advertisers was 478,000 compared with 480,000 last year.
Turnover per unique advertiser increased for all UK printed directories by 3.5% to 1,280 from 1,237, after the effect of the 3.3% price reduction on our Yellow Pages directories.
We rescoped 13 directories into 25 during the year, addressing changes in demographic, shopping and trading patterns and enabling us to compete more effectively with the wide range of alternative classified information available to the user.
We now publish 102 Yellow Pages directories and offer full coverage of the UK, following the publication of the Hull directory for the first time.
com, our UK online directory service, increased by 10.4 million, or 40.3%, from 25.8 million to 36.2 million.
This increase reflected the 36.9% increase in searchable advertisers to 141,000, including 23,000 who do not advertise in our printed products.
This brings our total UK unique advertisers to 501,000 compared to 498,000 last year.
Through our channel neutral approach, Yell.
com has successfully captured new advertisers from new markets, taking advantage of the widening usage of the internet within the classified advertising market.
In the year ahead we expect total UK turnover to grow at around 3% with a significant contribution from Yell.
46 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 US Turnover Turnover from US printed directories increased by 68.9 million, or 12.5%, from 552.0 million in the 2004 financial year to 620.9 million for the 2005 financial year.
Turnover was negatively affected by 54.1 million from a weakening US dollar.
On a constant US dollar basis, US turnover grew by 123.0 million, or 22.3%.
The average exchange rates were approximately $1.85 to 1.00 in the year ended 31 March 2005 and $1.69 to 1.00 in the prior year.
The Group had 455,000 unique advertisers in the US in the year ended 31 March 2005 compared to 386,000 in the prior year.
Average turnover per unique advertiser grew 3.7% from $2,434 to $2,525.
Customer retention increased from 70% to 71%.
Of the 22.3% growth in turnover, excluding the effect of exchange rate movements, 14.2% was from organic turnover growth.
This included 11.1% from same-market growth, which benefitted from the successful relaunch of several major former McLeod directories, as compared with 9.0% last year.
Directories from acquisitions that published for the first time in the most recent year are not included in the same-market growth results.
Same-market growth is derived by comparing the turnover from directories including rescoped directories that we published in a period with turnover from these same directories or predecessor directories covering substantially the same geographic area published in the previous publishing cycle, which is not necessarily the same period in the prior financial year.
Rescoped directories are those where we redefine the geographic boundaries covered by one or more directories, which could include replacing one directory with multiple directories or combining multiple directories into fewer directories.
Remaining growth was due to 19 new directory launches contributing 3.1% to the growth and 32 directories publishing for the first time after acquisition contributing 8.4% to the growth offset by the effect of winding down certain operations 0.3% reduction.
In the year ahead, we expect organic turnover growth of around 12% helped by a heavy schedule of launches in the first half.
We also expect our 2005 acquisitions to contribute an extra 1.5% of turnover in 2006.

b The percentage of related turnover.
Total cost of sales increased by 39.4 million, or 7.1%, compared to last year.
The 3.7 million, or 1.6%, increase in cost of sales for UK printed directories from 228.0 million in the 2004 financial year to 231.7 million in the 2005 financial year reflected higher advertisement volumes.
Cost of sales for other UK products and services increased by 2.2 million, or 17.7%, from 12.4 million in the 2004 financial year to 14.6 million in the 2005 financial year, reflecting the increased turnover from Yell.
Cost of sales for Yellow Book directories as a percentage of turnover was 55.7% in the 2005 financial year, as compared to 56.6% in the 2004 financial year.
Our consolidated bad debt expense was 72.6 million, or 5.6% of Group turnover in the 2005 financial year, as compared with 71.0 million, or 6.0% of Group turnover in the 2004 financial year.
The charge for UK bad debts was 4.1% of UK printed directories and other products and services turnover in 2005 and 4.5% in the 2004 financial year.
The US bad debt expense was 7.3% of US printed directories turnover in the 2005 financial year as compared to 7.7% in the 2004 financial year.

b The percentage of total gross profit.
The increase in gross profit as a percentage of Group turnover from 53.4% in the 2004 financial year to 53.9% in the 2005 financial year reflected improved margins from both the UK and US operations.
Distribution Costs and Administrative Expenses Distribution costs increased by 3.8 million, or 11.0%, from 34.5 million in the 2004 financial year 2.9% of Group turnover to 38.3 million in the 2005 financial year 3.0% of Group turnover.
Excluding the effects of the weakening dollar, distribution costs would have increased by 6.0 million.
Administrative expenses decreased by 39.1 million, or 8.7%, from 449.1 million in the 2004 financial year to 410.0 million in the 2005 financial year.

EBITDA is not a measurement of performance under UK or US GAAP and you should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to a operating profit or net profit loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, b cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs or c any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles.
EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by the Groups cash flow statement and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results and is not meant to be predictive of our potential future results.
We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortisation, which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods particularly when acquisitions have occurred or non-operating factors.
Accordingly, EBITDA has been disclosed in this report to permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our operating performance relative to other companies.
Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA identically, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
EBITDA is one of the key financial measures that we use to assess our success in achieving growth and operational efficiencies.
b Constant exchange rate states current year results at the same exchange rate as that used to translate the previous years results.
Group adjusted EBITDA increased by 42.7 million, or 11.9%.
Group adjusted EBITDA at a constant exchange rate increased by 57.0 million, or 15.8%.
The group adjusted EBITDA margin increased one percentage point to 31.3%, reflecting the strong US performance.
Adjusted EBITDA from the UK operations increased by 7.6 million, or 3.3%.
EBITDA from the UK operations increased 20.8% to 240.7 million.
Adjusted EBITDA growth primarily reflects the increased profitability of Yell.
com reported EBITDA of 9.6 million operating profit of 7.8 million adding back depreciation of 1.8 million for the 2005 financial year as compared to 5.3 million operating profit of 3.6 million adding back depreciation of 1.7 million in the prior year.
The printed directory adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 38.3% to 36.8%, and the overall UK adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2% compared to 36.7% the year before.
In the year ahead, we expect the UK EBITDA margin to reflect increasing competitive pressure and additional charges under International Financial Reporting Standards.
Adjusted EBITDA from our US operations increased by 35.1 million, or 27.6%, compared to the 2004 financial year.
Including exceptional items, EBITDA from Yellow Book for the 2005 financial year increased by 54.8 million compared to the 2004 financial year.
The adjusted EBITDA margin from our US operations increased to 26.1%, as we focused on increasing the benefit and yield from our directory investments.
We increased the profitability of our directories by leveraging our existing operations and administrative cost base to yield additional turnover from our directories without a corresponding increase in costs.
In the year ahead, we expect the US EBITDA margin will continue to grow.
49 YELL GROUP PLC Net Interest Payable Net interest expense was 91.0 million, comprising both cash interest and non-cash interest, in the 2005 financial year, compared to 194.5 million in the 2004 financial year.
Net interest expense in the 2005 financial year comprised 74.5 million of net interest paid or to be paid within a six-month period, 10.4 million of interest rolled-up into our long-term debt and 6.1 million of amortised financing costs.
Net interest before exceptional items was 136.1 million in the 2004 financial year.
The exceptional items of 58.4 million in 2004 comprised 36.4 million accelerated amortisation of deferred financing costs in connection with the repayment of the senior credit facilities on 15 July 2003 and senior notes on 18 August 2003, 19.7 million early redemption of 35% of our senior notes on 18 August 2003, and 2.3 million arrangement fee on the undrawn revolving credit facility.
Taxation Taxation before exceptional items was a charge of 73.2 million for the 2005 financial year and a charge of 44.2 million last year.
Tax credits in the amount of 13.7 million in the 2005 financial year and 37.2 million last year were recognised as a benefit arising from exceptional items.
Our future taxation charge will depend on our taxable income in the UK and the US.
We expect our effective tax rate to be around 30% of profits before amortisation and tax in the 2006 financial year under current UK GAAP and around 33% under IFRS.
Profit Loss Before and After Tax After charging the exceptional costs, the profit on ordinary activities before tax was 153.7 million in the 2005 financial year as compared to a loss of 44.1 million in the 2004 financial year.
Excluding the effect of exceptional costs, the profit before taxation and profit after taxation for the 2005 financial year would have been 190.2 million and 117.0 million respectively.
Earnings per Share Adjusted diluted earnings per share were 30.4 pence before amortisation and exceptional costs: an increase of 20.2%.
Basic earnings per share before amortisation and exceptional costs were 30.8 pence.
This compares with pro forma before amortisation and as if the IPO had occurred before the start of last year basic earnings per share of 25.6 pence last year.
Liquidity Apart from significant acquisitions which we have funded through a combination of borrowings, cash from contributions from the investment funds from the former owners and cash flow from operations, we have funded our existing business largely from cash flows generated from our operations.
We believe that we have sufficient working capital to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements.
In addition, we have access to a 200.0 million revolving credit facility as part of the senior credit facilities, which expires on 7 July 2008, none of which was drawn down at 31 March 2005.
Our net cash inflow from operating activities was 294.2 million in the 2004 financial year and 357.6 million in the 2005 financial year, or a 21.6% increase.
Our net cash inflow from operating activities before payments of exceptional costs 200433.8 million: 200513.6 million and after capital expenditure 200424.5 million: 200524.0 million increased from 303.5 million in the 2004 financial year to 347.2 million in the 2005 financial year.
As a percentage of adjusted EBITDA cash conversion it rose from 84.3% in the 2004 financial year to 86.2% in the 2005 financial year.
We use cash conversion to monitor the efficiency of our operations in converting earnings into cash.
We expect to continue to convert around 80% of EBITDA to cash in the year ahead.
Free cash flow was 229.9 million, comprising net cash inflow from operating activities of 357.6 million, less interest of 72.2 million, taxation paid of 31.5 million and purchase of fixed assets of 24.0 million.
Free cash flow before the payment of exceptional items was 243.5 million.
We made an additional annual pension contribution of 8.2 million in the year, and expect to make an additional annual contribution of approximately 8.5 million in the next financial year.
These contributions are the first step in alleviating the 69.6 million net of tax pension deficit reported under FRS 17.
While the contributions reduce free cash flow, they have no effect on the Groups profit and loss.
Net cash outflow from returns on investments and servicing of finance of 72.2 million for the 2005 financial year comprises 72.2 million of cash pay interest.
Net cash outflow for capital expenditures and financial investment comprises capital expenditure on fixed assets and purchases of subsidiary undertakings, net of cash acquired.
Capital expenditure was 24.0 million in the 2005 financial year compared to 24.5 million last year.
The capital expenditure was principally in respect of the acquisition of fixed assets to support our sales force and central administrative staff.
We continued to augment our growth in the US with further selective acquisitions totalling 31.8 million in the 2005 financial year.
50 ANNUAL REPORT 2004 05 Capital Resources At 31 March 2005 we had cash of 55.5 million.
Since the year end, we have agreed a new 2 billion credit facility to refinance our existing bank debt and to fund an acquisition as explained under Post balance sheet event on page 52.
We expect that any other significant acquisitions or other significant expenditures, including those related to the development of our online services, would in the future be financed through any one or more of operating cash flows, credit facilities and the issue of new debt and equity securities.
We had net debt of 1,106.1 million at 31 March 2005, down 116.9 million from 1,223.0 million at 31 March 2004.
Our net debt at 31 March 2005 is equal to 2.7 times our adjusted EBITDA.
Payments due by period Debt Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Total m m m m m Long-term loans and other borrowings Term Loan A1 denominated in sterling 90.0 150.0 304.0 544.0 Term Loan A2 denominated in US dollars 315.6 315.6 Senior notes 314.7 314.7 Revolving loan under senior credit facilities and other 1.3 1.3 Total debt 91.3 150.0 619.6 314.7 1,175.6 Unamortised financing costs 14.0 Cash at bank 55.5 Net debt at end of the period 1,106.1 We are required to satisfy interest and principal payments on our borrowings as they become due.
To the extent we are not able to fund any principal payment at maturity or any interest payment when due from cash flow from operations, we would be required to refinance this indebtedness pursuant to credit facilities and or the issue of new debt and equity securities into the capital markets.
Any failure to raise additional funds necessary to achieve this would result in default under our debt covenants.
We anticipate that we will have to refinance in part the repayment of the senior notes at maturity.
No one has guaranteed our obligations under the senior notes or has any obligation to provide additional equity financing to us.
The terms of the senior credit facilities require us to maintain specified consolidated financial ratios for net total debt to EBITDA, EBITDA to net cash interest payable and, until 31 March 2005, net senior debt to EBITDA.
Certain of these financial ratios have to be prepared for the preceding twelve-month period and reported to the providers of the senior credit facilities on a six-monthly basis.
We have maintained the financial ratios for the year ended 31 March 2005 in compliance with these debt covenants.
Commitments The following table sets forth our contractual obligations and their maturity dates as at 31 March 2005: Debt Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Total m m m m m Long-term debt 90.0 150.0 619.6 314.7 1,174.3 Operating lease obligations 13.7 23.5 19.0 29.4 85.6 Finance lease obligations 1.3 1.3 a Estimated interest payments 68.6 149.8 85.8 50.4 354.6 Total 173.6 323.3 724.4 394.5 1,615.8 a Interest payments have been estimated based on the assumptions that 1 the long-term debt principal repayments are the same as those presented in this table: 2 floating rate interest rates are the same as those implicit in the long-term yield curve one month LIBOR on UK senior debt remaining at 4.9% in April 2005 to March 2007 and one month LIBOR on US senior debt increasing from 2.7% in April 2005 to 4.7% by March 2007 : 3 floating interest rates do not change after March 2007: and 4 the US Dollar to British Pound exchange rate is $1.90: 1.00 in all future periods.
Our estimated interest payments should not be relied on as fact, because interest rates and exchange rates could vary materially from those that we assumed.
There were no purchase commitments or other long-term liabilities as at 31 March 2005 other than those stated above.
51 YELL GROUP PLC Other Matters Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than the hedges discussed in this document.
Acquisitions In the year ended 31 March 2005, we acquired various directories for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million 31.8 million.
These acquisitions gave rise to 27.0 million of goodwill recorded in the year.
In the year ended 31 March 2004, we acquired directories in the US including Feist for an aggregate purchase price of $198.9 million 108.6 million plus expenses of $0.5 million 0.3 million.
These acquisitions gave rise to 100.4 million of goodwill recorded in that year.
Post Balance Sheet Event On 17 May 2005, we announced that our US business had entered into a definitive agreement for the purchase the Acquisition of Transwestern Holdings, L. P. Transwestern from Thomas H. Lee Partners, CIVC Partners, LLC and Transwestern management for $1,575 million 829 million in cash.
Transwestern is a leading independent directory publisher in the US, with an extensive footprint in 25 states, including core positions in California and Texas, which complements Yellow Books footprint.
Transwestern published 332 directories during the year ended 31 December 2004.
Transwestern also offers online directory advertising services through WorldPages.
The Acquisition establishes Yell as the third largest directory publisher globally and Yellow Book as the fifth largest directory publisher in the US, based on US pro forma revenues in excess of $1.4 billion for the financial year 2005.
The acquisition further strengthens our position as a leading independent directory publisher in the US.
At 17 May 2005 we had agreed in principle a new 2 billion credit facility, fully underwritten by ABN AMRO, BNP paribas, Citibank, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, to refinance all of our existing bank debt of 860 million and to fund the Acquisition, if the Acquisition is completed.
Our senior notes remain unaffected.
Based on Yells and Transwesterns strong cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio net debt pro forma EBITDA to reach 4.0 times by 31 March 2006.
The Acquisition is subject to shareholder approval and Hart Scott Rodino clearance in the USA.
Therefore, completion of the Acquisition cannot be assured.
Litigation The exceptional costs of 36.5 million 22.8 million after tax in the year ended 31 March 2005 are the estimated costs relating to lawsuits brought against Yellow Book USA in relation to an advertising campaign that finished in 2004.
As we previously disclosed, a lawsuit filed by Verizon was settled in October 2004.
Following publication of our half year results, Yellow Book USA was served with complaints filed as class actions in five US states and the District of Columbia.
In these actions, the plaintiffs allege violations of consumer protection legislation and are placing reliance on findings of the New York court in the now settled suit brought against Yellow Book USA by Verizon.
On 13 May 2005, the court in New Jersey gave its preliminary approval to a comprehensive national settlement, with no admission of liability.
Notice of the terms of settlement will be published to class members and the final approval hearing is anticipated to be held in late summer 2005.
Effect of the IPO The IPO in July 2003 raised 433.6 million gross proceeds.
We used the proceeds to settle 109.5 million payable on the vendor loan notes: to pay share issue costs of 23.7 million: to pay 79.6 million of exceptional costs: to repay 48.3 million of debt under the senior credit facilities: and to redeem 35% 172.5 million of the senior notes pursuant to the optional redemption features under the indentures.
We also replaced our remaining senior credit facilities with new senior credit facilities of 664 million and $596 million and a revolving credit facility of 200 million.
As a result of the capital-raising, we incurred a number of exceptional or one-off costs, including: cash and non-cash interest charges relating to premiums paid in connection with the redemption of the senior notes and to the write-off of deferred finance costs: charges relating to option grants under existing share ownership plans: fees paid to the owners before the IPO: and other transaction fees and costs arising out of the IPO.
In addition, participants in a plan implemented for certain key employees of Yellow Book and its subsidiaries were entitled to a payment under the Yellow Book Phantom DDB Plan, under which the participants as a group are treated economically as if they had invested approximately 32 million in the Group in the same manner as the funds advanced by the owners before the IPO.
We recorded a compensation charge of $63 million 39 million in connection with this.
In satisfaction of those obligations, the participants in the Yellow Book Phantom DDB Plan exchanged their interests in the plan for Ordinary shares in the Company.
