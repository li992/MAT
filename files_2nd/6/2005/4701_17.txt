Diageo Annual Report 2005 22 Business description Operating and financial review Introduction Information presented Diageos strategy is to focus on its premium branded drinks businesses with international potential.
Diageo completed the disposal of its quick service restaurants business on 13 December 2002 and in accordance with UK GAAP, the results of the quick service restaurants business have been included within discontinued operations in the comparative periods.
Following a reorganisation of the way the business is managed, the business analysis is now presented under the categories of North America, Europe and International.
The following discussion is based on Diageos UK GAAP results for the year ended 30 June 2005 compared with the year ended 30 June 2004, and the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with the year ended 30 June 2003.
There are a number of accounting differences between UK and US GAAP.
A reconciliation of net income from UK to US GAAP and an explanation of the differences between UK and US GAAP are set out in the US GAAP information in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements, with a further explanation of significant reconciling items between UK and US GAAP net income included in Discussion of US GAAP differences below.
Presentation of information in relation to the business In addition to describing the significant factors impacting on the profit and loss account compared to the prior year for both of the years ended 30 June 2005 and 30 June 2004, additional information is also presented on the operating performance of the group.
Volume Volume has been measured on an equivalent units basis to nine litre cases of spirits.
An equivalent unit represents one nine litre case of spirits, which is approximately 272 servings.
A serving comprises 33ml of spirits, 165ml of wine, or 330ml of ready to drink or beer.
Therefore, to convert volume of products, other than spirits, to equivalent units, the following guide has been used: beer in hectolitres divide by 0.9, wine in nine litre cases divide by five and ready to drink in nine litre cases divide by 10.
Non-GAAP measures Organic movement in volume, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items are measures not specically used in the consolidated financial statements themselves non-GAAP measures.
The performance of the group is discussed using these measures.
Since overall performance is the result of a number of factors, breaking these down into broad categories and discussing each of these categories assists management and the reader in understanding the overall picture.
Once factors such as the effect of currency movements, excise duties and acquisitions and disposals have been eliminated, the above measures enable the reader to focus on the performance of the brand portfolio which is common to both periods.
Organic movement measures also most closely reect the way in which the business is managed, for the same reasons of achieving comparability between periods.
Diageos strategic planning and budgeting process is based on organic movement in volume, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items, and these measures closely reect the way in which operating targets are dened and performance is monitored by the groups management.
These measures are chosen for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes since, as explained further below, they represent those measures which local managers are most directly able to inuence and they enable consideration of the underlying business performance without the distortion caused by uctuating exchange rates, excise duties, acquisitions and disposals.
In addition, management bonus targets are set based on the performance of the business as measured by organic operating profit growth before exceptional items.
The groups management believe these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the groups performance, since they provide information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to inuence and they focus on that element of the core brand portfolio which is common to both periods.
However, whilst these measures are important in the management of the business, they should not be viewed as replacements for, but rather as complementary to, the comparable GAAP measures such as turnover and reported rather than organic movements in individual profit and loss account captions.
These GAAP measures reect all of the factors which impact on the business.
In the discussion of the performance of the business, net sales after deducting excise duties is presented in addition to turnover, since turnover reects significant components of excise duties which are set by external regulators and over which Diageo has no control.
Diageo incurs excise duties throughout the world.
In some countries, excise duties are based on sales and are separately identied on the face of the invoice to the external customer.
In others, it is effectively a production tax, which is incurred when the spirit is removed from bonded warehouses.
In these countries it is part of the cost of goods sold and is not separately identied on the sales invoice.
Changes in the level of excise duties can signicantly affect the level of reported turnover and cost of sales, without directly reecting changes in volume, mix or profitability that are the variables which impact on the element of turnover retained by the group.
Also in the discussion of the performance of the business, certain information is presented using sterling amounts on a constant currency basis.
This strips out the translation effect of foreign exchange rate movements and enables an understanding of the underlying performance of the market that is most closely inuenced by the actions of that markets management.
The risk from foreign exchange translation is managed centrally and is not a factor over which local managers have any control.
In the year ended 30 June 2003, the group disposed of its quick service restaurant businesses Burger King.
As a consequence, results are not comparable from period to period and require additional explanation.
For this reason it is necessary to separate the effects of acquisitions and disposals in order to provide information on the underlying performance of the business.
Adjusting for these items enables group management to monitor performance over factors which local managers are most directly able to inuence in relation to the core ongoing brand portfolio.
The underlying performance on a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals is referred to as organic performance, and further information on the calculation of organic measures as used in the discussion of the business is included below.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 23 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued In order to assist the reader of the financial statements, the comparisons of both 2005 with 2004 and 2004 with 2003 include tables which present the exchange, acquisitions and disposals and organic components of the year on year movement for each of turnover, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items.
Calculation of organic movement Where a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of, or terminated, in the current year, the group, in organic movement calculations, adjusts the results for the prior year to exclude the amount the group earned in that period that it could not have earned in the current period i. e. the period between the date in the prior period, equivalent to the date of the disposal in the current period, and the end of the prior period.
As a result, the organic movement numbers reect only comparable trading performance.
Similarly, if a business was disposed of part way through the equivalent prior period, then its contribution would also be completely excluded from that prior periods performance in the organic movement calculation, since the group recognised no contribution from that business in the current year.
For acquisitions, a similar adjustment is made in the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the current period, the post acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations.
For acquisitions in the prior period, post acquisition results are included in full in the prior period but are only included from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current period.
A further adjustment in organic movement is made to exclude the effect of exchange rate movements by recalculating the prior years results as if they had been generated at the current years exchange rates.
Organic movement percentages are calculated as the organic movement amount in million, expressed as a percentage of the prior period results at current year exchange rates and after adjusting for disposals.
The basis of calculation means that the results used to measure organic growth for a given year will be adjusted when used to measure organic growth in the subsequent year.

Turnover was adversely impacted by exchange rate movements of 228 million, principally arising from weakening of the US dollar.
Operating costs On a reported basis, operating costs increased by 280 million 4% from 7,020 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 to 7,300 million in the year ended 30 June 2005.
Operating exceptional items increased by 168 million from 40 million to 208 million.
On a reported basis before exceptional items, excise duties increased by 98 million from 2,209 million for the year to 30 June 2004 to 2,307 million, while cost of goods sold increased by 7 million and marketing investment was down 2% from 1,039 million to 1,023 million.
Marketing investment on global priority brands excluding ready to drink was 587 million while marketing spend on ready to drink brands was 128 million.
Reported group overheads increased by 23 million in the year to 30 June 2005 to 1,176 million.
Overall, the impact of exchange rate movements reduced total operating costs before exceptional items by 137 million.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 24 Operating and financial review Exceptional operating costs Operating profit for the period is after 208 million of exceptional operating costs.
Exceptional operating costs include a charge of 149 million in respect of payments to the Thalidomide Trust.
Diageo currently makes an annual payment of 2.8 million to the Trust although in the year ended 30 June 2005 an additional contribution of 4.4 million was made.
Based on the current negotiations it is expected that the future annual payment will increase to around 6.5 million per annum.
This amount will be index-linked and is expected to be a final settlement payable over the period to 2037.
Provision has been made for the discounted value of these payments.
Also included in exceptional costs is 29 million of accelerated depreciation in respect of the Park Royal brewery which, as announced in April 2004, closed in June 2005 and 30 million 2004 40 million of final costs related to the integration of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses, acquired in December 2001.
Operating profit Reported operating profit decreased by 135 million from 1,871 million to 1,736 million.
Exchange rate movements reduced operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2005 by 91 million US dollar reduction of 79 million, euro benefit of 3 million, other currencies reduction of 15 million.
Post employment plans Post employment charges calculated under FRS 17 resulted in a charge to operating profit of 96 million 2004 101 million and other finance income of 16 million 2004 charge of 18 million.
In October 2004, four million shares in General Mills with a market value of 100 million were transferred to the groups UK pension fund.
At 30 June 2005, Diageos deficit after taxation for all post employment plans was 902 million 30 June 2004 750 million.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates before exceptional items was 185 million for the year compared to 451 million last year.
Diageo ceased to equity account for its share of the results of General Mills from 23 June 2004.
In the year ended 30 June 2004, General Mills contributed 258 million to share of profits of associates.
In the year ended 30 June 2005 the Groups 34% equity interest in Mot Hennessy contributed 169 million to share of profits of associates before exceptional items 2004 176 million.
Investment income Income from xed asset investments was 17 million, arising on dividends receivable from General Mills.
Finance charges Finance charges decreased from 295 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 to 143 million in the year ended 30 June 2005.
The net interest charge decreased by 120 million 44% from 271 million in the prior year to 151 million in the year ended 30 June 2005: 42 million of this decrease results from lower debt offset by higher oating interest rates year on year.
The balance of the reduction in the net interest charge mainly results from the cessation of equity accounting for General Mills shares 59 million and from the weaker US dollar 11 million.
Other finance income of 8 million included income of 16 million 2004 charge of 18 million in respect of the groups post employment plans.
This beneficial movement principally reects the increase in the value of the assets held by the post employment plans between 1 July 2003 and 30 June 2004.
Non-operating exceptional items Non-operating exceptional items before taxation were a credit of 27 million in the year ended 30 June 2005 compared with a charge of 45 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
This credit includes a loss on disposal of xed assets totalling 19 million comprising a loss on disposal of part of the groups investment in General Mills of 26 million and a net gain on disposal of other xed assets of 7 million.
In October 2004, 49.9 million shares in General Mills were sold for 1.2 billion and a further four million shares were transferred to the groups UK pension fund.
These disposals generated a loss before tax of 26 million after writing back goodwill previously written off to reserves of 247 million and other costs, including the costs of terminating related hedge instruments, of 25 million.
Also included in non-operating exceptional items is the net profit on disposal of businesses of 46 million comprising a credit relating to Burger King Corporation of 53 million, a provision of 8 million in respect of the sale of part of the United Beverages distribution business in Ireland and a net credit of 1 million relating to other disposals.
The credit in relation to Burger King Corporation, which was sold in 2002, reects the release of provisions relating to residual nancing obligations following the successful renancing of Burger King Corporation on 13 July 2005.
This resulted in the repayment of the subordinated debt including accrued interest receivable and the release of Diageo from its obligations under the guarantee.
Profit before taxation After exceptional items, the profit before taxation and minority interests decreased by 147 million from 1,969 million to 1,822 million in the year ended 30 June 2005.
Exchange rates The impact of adverse exchange rate movements on profit before exceptional items and taxation for the financial year ending 30 June 2006 is estimated to be 50 million excluding transaction exchange on share of profits of associates.
This is comprised of an adverse impact in respect of our hedged transaction exposure of around 70 million and 20 million favourable translation exposure a a based on current exchange rates, including 1 $1.80 2005 $1.86 and 1 1.47 2005 1.46.
Taxation The effective rate of taxation on profit before exceptional items for the year was 24%, compared with 25% for the year ended 30 June 2004, the reduction arising primarily as a consequence of the sale of the General Mills shares.
The effective tax rate on exceptional items benets from a provision release related to various disposals in previous years.
25 Operating and financial review Diageo Annual Report 2005 Operating and financial review continued Dividend The directors recommend a final dividend of 18.2 pence per share, an increase of 7% on last years final dividend.
The full dividend would therefore be 29.55 pence per share, an increase of 7%.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 24 October 2005 to shareholders on the register on 16 September 2005.
Payment to US ADR holders will be made on 28 October 2005.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend and the plan notice date is 3 October 2005.
Continuing operations The following discussion provides additional commentary on the trading performance of the business compared with the equivalent period in the prior year.
In the discussion, movements are segregated between reported or organic performance.
Reported means that the measure reects movement in the number disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
Organic represents the movement excluding the impact of exchange, acquisitions and disposals.
In the discussion, under organic brand performance for each market, movements given for volume, turnover, net sales after deducting excise duties and marketing expenditure are organic movements.
A further description of organic movement, how it is calculated and why it is considered useful for the reader is set out on pages 23 and 24.
Corporate For the year ended 30 June 2005, Diageo has presented separately certain corporate revenues and costs.
These corporate revenues and costs are in respect of central costs including finance, human resources and legal as well as certain information system, service centre, facilities and employee costs that are not directly allocated to the geographical operating units.
Additionally, they also include the revenues and costs related to rents receivable in respect of properties not used by Diageo in the manufacture, sale or distribution of premium drink products and the results of Gleneagles Hotel.
Results for the years ended 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2003 have been restated to be on a consistent basis.

2 Acquisitions in the year ended 30 June 2005 comprise the acquisition of The Chalone Wine Group North America, Ursus Vodka Holdings BV Europe and Ghana Breweries Limited International.
Disposals affecting the period comprise the disposal of Kamchatka North America and the disposal of Finches Soft Drinks Europe.
3 In the calculation of operating profit before exceptional items the overheads included in disposals were only those directly attributable to the businesses disposed, and do not result from subjective judgements of management.
4 The organic movement percentage is the amount in the column headed Organic movement in the table expressed as a percentage of the aggregate of the column headed 2004 Reported, the column headed Exchange and the impact of disposals from the column headed Acquisitions and disposals.
The basis of the calculation of the organic movement is explained on page 24.

Diageo Annual Report 2005 27 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Additional information: Organic volume totalled 125.1 million equivalent units.
Reported volume, which includes 0.5 million equivalent units in respect of the acquisitions of Ursus, The Chalone Wine Group, and a controlling interest in Ghana Breweries, totalled 125.6 million equivalent units.
Smirnoffs performance reected the continued strong growth of the base brand offset by declines in Smirnoff ready to drink volume of 4% and net sales after deducting excise duties of 7%.
The base Smirnoff brand grew across all three regions resulting in volume and net sales after deducting excise duties growth of 5% and 7% respectively.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume declined with growth in International offset by a further decline in Europe.
Johnnie Walker also grew across all three regions.
Total volume growth across the Johnnie Walker marque was 5%.
The faster growth of the Johnnie Walker super deluxe variants delivered mix improvement and drove net sales after deducting excise duties growth of 12%.
The beer market has been tough in all three of Guinness major markets and this has resulted in a 2% volume decline.
However, product and packaging innovation and a robust pricing strategy in these three markets led to a 5% increase in net sales after deducting excise duties.
Baileys volume was up year on year despite weakness in Baileys Glide and Minis.
The decline in these two variants has also had an adverse impact on mix.
The core Baileys brand however has continued to grow and build share in the key market of Great Britain.
In North America, where over 85% of Captain Morgans volume is sold, performance remained strong.
This together with successful innovation, such as the launch of Captain Morgan Tattoo, delivered double-digit increases in volume and net sales after deducting excise duties.
J&Bs volume declined 1% reecting the decline of the standard Scotch segment in Spain, offset by growth in markets such as South Africa and Korea.
Increased pricing in Spain, J&Bs single biggest market, mitigated the effect of the volume decline on net sales after deducting excise duties.
Jos Cuervo has returned to strong growth year on year with growth of premium variants delivering mix improvement.
Tanqueray has under-performed the imported gin segment in North America where nearly 80% of its volume is sold.
The brands performance towards the end of the year has improved since new advertising has been aired.
Stronger pricing delivered mix improvement.

Diageo has created a leading position in the worlds most profitable beverage alcohol market.
The strong growth of the spirits sector along with Diageos superior route to market are reected in the results which have been achieved.
Volume growth was led by the global priority brands, which grew 5%.
Local priority brands and the category brands also showed consistent volume growth with both up 3%.
This strong performance in the US spirits market has resulted in an overall share gain of 0.5 percentage points to 25.4%.
Ready to drink volume was at, net sales after deducting excise duties grew 2% and marketing investment declined 7% as competitors exited and Diageo grew share of the segment.

Diageo Annual Report 2005 29 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued In North America, global priority brands represent 61% of volume, local priority brands account for 23% of volume while category brands represent the remaining 16%.
Smirnoff vodka grew volume 6% and net sales after deducting excise duties 8% behind strong base brand performance and even faster growth of Smirnoff Twist.
Share of the vodka category grew by 0.8 percentage points.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume was at although net sales after deducting excise duties grew 2%.
While share of the segment grew 5.9 percentage points, growth was impacted by comparison against the Smirnoff Twisted V launch in late 2003.
In the prior year, marketing investment behind Smirnoff vodka increased nearly 50% to support the Icon packaging launch.
Consequently, year on year Smirnoff vodka marketing declined while Smirnoff ready to drink marketing was focused on continuing to build awareness of Smirnoff Twisted V. Johnnie Walker volume grew 3% and share increased due in part to increasing demand from ethnic minority and 21-29 year old adults.
Net sales after deducting excise duties increased 11% driven by the higher growth of the super deluxe variants and price increases.
Johnnie Walker Black Label grew volume 2% and net sales after deducting excise duties grew 9% as a price increase was implemented in certain areas of the United States.
Johnnie Walker Red Label lost share in its segment as competitive pressure increased.
Johnnie Walker Green Label was launched in October 2004 and contributed to the growth in the super deluxe variants.
Marketing investment increased 7% to support this launch and behind increased gift packaging programmes.
Jos Cuervo volume was up 6%, led by growth in Cuervo Gold and Jos Cuervo Classico.
Marketing investment increased 10% as the brand launched its first television advertising campaign.
While share declined 0.9 percentage points as competitive pressures from super and ultra premium tequilas increased, Jos Cuervo remains the category leader.
Baileys had a difficult start to the year as Minis failed to sustain its initial launch success.
In the second half of the year however the brands volume performance has improved.
Captain Morgan continues to grow very strongly with volume up 11% and net sales after deducting excise duties up 12% as the brand gained 2.2 percentage points of share.
Growth was driven primarily by Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum, together with the successful launch of Captain Morgan Tattoo and Parrot Bay Passion Fruit.
Marketing investment increased 14% to support these launches as well as increased advertising and on trade marketing programmes.
Tanqueray volume fell 4% and the brand lost share although it remains the leading imported gin.
A price increase was taken in certain states mitigating the volume decline and therefore net sales after deducting excise duties were at.
Marketing investment declined 2% in the year as campaigns were withdrawn to prepare for the fourth quarter launch of a new advertising campaign.
Guinness volume grew 5%, signicantly outperforming the import beer category.
This was due to growth across all variants: Guinness Draught in Bottle, Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness Draught.
This performance is the result of successful marketing particularly around the low calorie message and the consumer trend towards premium brands and taste.
Net sales after deducting excise duties increased 9% as a result of stronger pricing.
The local priority brands performed well with volume growth and mix improvement driven by the strong performance of Crown Royal.

Operating profit Reported operating profit increased by 84 million from 1,787 million of which Burger King contributed 53 million to 1,871 million.
Exceptional items charged to operating profit were 40 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with 168 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Exchange rate movements reduced operating profit before exceptional items for the year ended 30 June 2004 by 105 million US dollar reduction of 107 million, euro benefit of 29 million, other currencies reduction of 27 million.
Disposals and the termination of certain distribution rights contributed an incremental 13 million to operating profit before exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2003 compared to the year ended 30 June 2004.
Post employment plans Post employment charges calculated under FRS 17 resulted in a charge to operating profit of 101 million 2003 110 million and other finance charges of 18 million 2003 income of 36 million.
The gures for the year ended 30 June 2003 were restated onto an FRS 17 basis.
At 30 June 2004, the deficit before taxation for Diageos post employment plans amounted to 1,044 million 30 June 2003 1,447 million.
This reduction has largely arisen from actuarial gains recognisable in the statement of recognised gains and losses of 586 million, principally due to the actual return on the assets in the funds being higher than the expected return and changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities.
In addition, at 30 June 2004, a deferred tax asset has been recognised on the post employment deficit in the United Kingdom of 245 million.
The post employment deficit after taxation has therefore decreased from 1,369 million to 750 million.
Associates The groups share of profits of associates before exceptional items was 451 million for the year compared to 478 million last year.
The 21% equity interest in General Mills contributed 258 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with 287 million last year.
The weakness of the US dollar accounted for 25 million of this decrease.
On 23 June 2004, Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo plc, and John M. Keenan, a Diageo plc designated representative, resigned from the General Mills board.
As a result, Diageo ceased to equity account for its share of the results of General Mills from that date.
Diageos 34% equity interest in Mot Hennessy contributed 176 million to share of profits of associates before exceptional items 2003 177 million.
Share of associates exceptional items comprises a 7 million charge for Diageos share of General Mills exceptional costs and 6 million in respect of restructuring within Mot Hennessy.
Finance charges Finance charges decreased from 315 million to 295 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
The net interest charge decreased by 74 million 21% from 345 million in the comparable prior period to 271 million in the year ended 30 June 2004, including 59 million for General Mills 2003 73 million.
Benets of 26 million from the effect of reducing interest rates, 12 million from the disposal of businesses, 16 million from the effect of exchange rates excluding associates, and 13 million from cash ow were partly offset by an increased interest charge arising from the funding of the share repurchases of 15 million.
Other finance charges have increased by 54 million, as a result of a charge of 18 million in respect of the groups post employment plans in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with income of 36 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.
This adverse movement principally reects the decline in the values of the assets held by the post employment plans between 30 June 2002 and 30 June 2003.
Non-operating exceptional items Non-operating exceptional items before taxation were a charge of 45 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 compared with a charge of 1,297 million including 1,441 million in respect of Burger King in the year ended 30 June 2003.
These charges comprise 41 million 2003 41 million in respect of the dilution of the investment in General Mills, following the issue of additional shares by General Mills, and a 10 million cost in respect of disposed businesses, offset by a 6 million gain arising on the disposal of xed assets.
The 10 million cost in respect of disposed businesses represents a 13 million loss on the sale of brands of continuing businesses, and a 26 million charge on the reassessment of the provisions required following the disposal of Burger King, offset by a credit of 29 million arising on the review of the provision held against the guarantee given by Diageo in connection with the sale of Pillsbury.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 37 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Profit before taxation After exceptional items, the profit before taxation and minority interests increased by 1,337 million from 632 million to 1,969 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Exchange rates Based on current exchange rates, the impact of adverse exchange rate movements on profit before exceptional items and taxation for the financial year ending 30 June 2005 is estimated to be 100 million excluding transaction exchange on share of profits of associates.
The group currently has net transaction hedges for US dollars in place which settle in the year ending 30 June 2005 to sell 541 million of US dollars.
Where these hedges are against sterling they are at an average rate of 1 $1.63.
The group currently has net transaction hedges for euros in place which settle in the year ending 30 June 2005 to sell 59 million of euros.
Where these hedges are against sterling they are at an average rate of 1 a1.41.
Taxation The effective rate of taxation on profit before exceptional items for the year was 25%, compared with 25.6% for the year ended 30 June 2003. Dividend The directors recommend a final dividend of 17.0 pence per share, an increase of 8.3% on last years final dividend.
The full dividend would therefore be 27.6 pence per share, an increase of 7.8%.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 25 October 2004 to shareholders on the register on 17 September 2004.
Payment to US ADR holders will be made on 29 October 2004.
A dividend re-investment plan is available in respect of the final dividend and the plan notice date is 4 October 2004.
Continuing operations The following discussion provides additional commentary on the trading performance of the continuing operations compared with the equivalent period in the prior year.

2 Disposals for turnover, net sales after deducting excise duties and operating profit before exceptional items were principally in respect of the termination of distribution rights for Bass Ale in North America and Brown-Forman agency brands in the United Kingdom, the disposals of Gilbeys Green and White Whisky in India, and the partial disposal of Don Julio in Mexico.
3 There were no acquisitions of subsidiaries in the 24 months up to 30 June 2004.
4 In the calculation of operating profit before exceptional items, the overheads included in disposals were only those directly attributable to the businesses disposed of, and do not result from subjective judgements of management.

North America Summary: Continued strong performance by Diageo in this important market Continued growth in global priority brands, together with mix improvement throughout the business, delivered double-digit growth in organic net sales after deducting excise duties Further improvement in operating margin by 1 percentage point Share gains in four of the six spirits categories Smirnoff ready to drink volume up 15%, following new product launches Incremental Seagram synergy benefit of 31 million Marketing investment up 9% behind priority brands Distributor strategy is on track Reported Organic 2004 2003 movement movement Key measures: million million %% Volume 13 Turnover 2,641 2,742 4 9 Net sales after deducting excise duties 2,220 2,283 3 10 Marketing 359 369 3 9 Operating profit before exceptional items 757 773 2 12 Reported performance Turnover was down from 2,742 million to 2,641 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Operating profit before exceptional items decreased 16 million 2%, from 773 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 757 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Organic performance Exchange rate movements accounted for a reduction in turnover of 242 million, principally as a result of a weakness in the US dollar which moved from 1 $1.59 in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 1 $1.74 in the year ended 30 June 2004.
In addition, the termination of distribution rights for Bass Ale in June 2003 and Cuervo 1800 in October 2002 reduced turnover by 58 million and 8 million, respectively.
Other disposals, including Kamchatka in the United States and Gibsons whisky in Canada, adversely affected turnover by 5 million.
At constant exchange rates, the turnover of brands owned or distributed throughout both periods was 212 million higher in the year ended 30 June 2004 than in the comparable period, as discussed within organic brand performance below.
These factors combined to produce an overall decrease in turnover of 101 million.
Operating profit before exceptional items was reduced by 86 million as a result of exchange rate movements.
In addition, the termination of distribution rights and the disposals noted above reduced profit before exceptional items by 13 million.
However, those brands owned or distributed throughout both periods contributed 83 million more in the year ended 30 June 2004 than in the year ended 30 June 2003.
The net result of these factors was a decrease in operating profit before exceptional items of 16 million.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 40 Operating and financial review Volume Net sales movement movement Organic brand performance: %% Smirnoff 312 Johnnie Walker 611 Jos Cuervo 16 Baileys 69 Captain Morgan 13 20 Tanqueray 4 Guinness 55 J&B 2 1 Total global priority brands 510 Local priority brands 4 Category brands 223 Total 310 after deducting excise duties.
Additional information: Smirnoff volume, excluding ready to drink, was at and net sales after deducting excise duties were up 5% Captain Morgan volume, excluding ready to drink, was up 9% and net sales after deducting excise duties were up 11% From 1 July 2003, terms of trade were harmonised between the former UDV and Seagram brands and freight is now billed as net sales after deducting excise duties for all brands.
The actual freight cost is reported as cost of goods sold.
This change increased reported net sales after deducting excise duties in the year by approximately 2 percentage points versus the prior year Crown Royal, Diageos highest volume and most profitable local priority brand, grew volume 3% New packaging was introduced for Smirnoff, marketing investment increased and pricing was revised to enable Smirnoff to compete in the higher growth segment of premium vodka.
In the short term, this has led to at volume and some share erosion for Smirnoff, excluding ready to drink.
However, along with the stronger growth of Smirnoff Twist and the growth of Smirnoff ready to drink, price and mix improved.
Smirnoff ready to drink volume was up 15% due to the launch of Smirnoff Twisted V and share grew 15.1 percentage points to approximately 45% of the segment.
Further strong volume growth of Johnnie Walker, with Johnnie Walker Black Label, up 8%, and continued impressive growth of the super premium offerings, Johnnie Walker Gold Label and Johnnie Walker Blue Label, drove mix improvement in the brand.
Johnnie Walker Red Label, with volume up 2%, and Johnnie Walker Black Label both grew share in their respective segments.
Jos Cuervo volume growth was constrained by pricing pressure from competitors.
Net sales after deducting excise duties increased 6% reecting growth in the higher margin Tradicional tequila and Margarita mixes.
Marketing investment increased to support brand building and focus on Jos Cuervos premium position.
Baileys solid growth continued with volume up 6%, and share improved 1.4 percentage points in the cream liqueur category due in part to the launch of Baileys Minis in May 2003.
Marketing investment continues to build the brands reach with innovative campaigns such as the new broadcast sponsorship deal to produce Baileys in Tune with VH1, a popular cable TV music channel.
Captain Morgan continues to grow volume and share in the fastest growing spirits category in the US, with share up 1.1 percentage points, boosted by the introduction of two new Parrot Bay Flavors.
Net sales after deducting excise duties benefited from a price increase across parts of the United States.
Tanquerays volume performance was held back in the second half as marketing campaigns were postponed until the brands transition from Schieffelin & Somerset to Diageo North America was completed.
Tanqueray grew share of the imported gin segment by 1.1 percentage points.
Guinness volume continued to outpace the total beer market, driven by increased sales and distribution of Guinness Draught in bottles and increased marketing around the St. Patricks Day selling period.
J&B volume and net sales after deducting excise duties improved in the second half as the brands competitive position benefited from price increases taken by competitors.
Volume performance of the local priority brands was at.
Crown Royal, which is at a price premium signicantly above the competition, continued to deliver volume growth.
Together with Beaulieu Vineyard up 35% and Sterling Vineyards up 22%, this volume growth offset declines in other local priority brands.
Growth of these higher value brands, which represent 28% of Diageos local priority brand net sales after deducting excise duties, delivered mix improvement.
Similarly, in the category brands, growth of higher value brands such as Croc, Don Julio and Godiva, was partially offset in volume terms by the weaker performance of other category brands but delivered strong mix improvement.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 41 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Marketing investment increased 9% broadly in line with net sales after deducting excise duties after adjusting for the change in terms of trade.
Marketing investment increased due to higher media spend behind the global priority brands as well as a Crown Royal sponsorship agreement with the International Race of Champions.
These increases were offset by an overall decline in ready to drink spend reecting a shift in the nature of marketing activities, however share of voice increased.
Diageo achieved further synergy benets associated with the acquisition in December 2001 of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses of 31 million.
In part, this was offset by costs in respect of the restructuring of Diageos relationship with Schieffelin & Somerset of 6 million.
Europe Summary: Despite good volume growth in GB, margin pressures negatively impacted on net sales after deducting excise duties Diageos share of UK spirits grew from 23.6% to 24.8% in the year In GB, Guinness volume down 3% and ready to drink volume down 14% both in line with the decline in their respective segments Reduced marketing spend in GB due to fewer new product launches and lower ready to drink investment The results for Ireland reect the continued decline of the beverage alcohol market, down a further 1%, and the shift from the on trade, where Diageo has the majority of its business, to the off trade Guinness volume in Ireland declined 6% and net sales after deducting excise duties decreased by 3%, benefiting from price increases In Spain, performance by brand was mixed, but overall mix improved, driven by volume growth in Johnnie Walker and Cacique as well as price increases implemented in April 2004 Mixed performance across Europe with significant growth achieved in Portugal, Russia and the Nordics Underperformance in balance of Europe largely due to ready to drink segment decline Reported Organic 2004 2003 movement movement Key measures: million million %% Volume 12 Turnover 3,847 3,746 31 Net sales after deducting excise duties 2,535 2,500 1 1 Marketing 435 434 2 Operating profit before exceptional items 666 646 3 Reported performance Turnover was up from 3,746 million to 3,847 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased 20 million 3%, from 646 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 666 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.
Organic performance Exchange rate movements accounted for an increase in turnover of 86 million, principally as a result of the strength of the euro which moved from 1 a1.52 in the year ended 30 June 2003 to 1 a1.45 in the year ended 30 June 2004.
In addition, the termination of distribution rights for the Brown-Forman agency brands in August 2002, 7 million and other disposals of 5 million, adversely affected turnover by 12 million.
At constant exchange rates, the turnover of brands owned or distributed throughout both periods was 27 million higher in the year ended 30 June 2004 than in the comparable period, as discussed within organic brand performance below.
These factors combined to produce an overall increase in turnover of 101 million.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 20 million, principally as a result of exchange rate movement gains 22 million.
However, the termination of distribution rights and the other disposals noted above reduced profit before exceptional items by 1 million, and those brands owned or distributed throughout both periods also contributed 1 million less in the year ended 30 June 2004 than in the year ended 30 June 2003.
The net result of these factors was an increase in operating profit before exceptional items of 20 million.

In the European markets, the economic environment has made trading challenging.
Smirnoff volume rose 6% as 11% growth in the Smirnoff brand, excluding ready to drink, offset declines in ready to drink volume, down 11%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties declined 7%, as a 17% decline in ready to drink net sales after deducting excise duties was only partially compensated by 24% growth in the Smirnoff brand, excluding ready to drink and Smirnoff Red.
Johnnie Walker volume grew 3% driven by strong performances in Johnnie Walker Red label and Black label in Great Britain and Spain, and also by the smaller markets particularly those of Russia and Poland.
Net sales after deducting excise duties grew 4% due to stronger pricing in Johnnie Walkers second largest market, Greece.
Guinness volume declined by 3% mainly due to 6% decline in Ireland caused by an acceleration in the shift from the on to the off trade.
Net sales after deducting excise duties declined by 2%, which was broadly in line with a similar decline in Ireland, Guinnesss largest market.
Baileys volume was at although net sales after deducting excise duties rose 3% due to stronger pricing in Spain.
J&B volume was at in terms of both volume movement and net sales after deducting excise duties.
This was caused by gains in Portugal, Turkey, Great Britain and Poland being offset by wider performance in the rest of Europe.
Local priority brand volume rose by 1%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties declined 1%.
Gordons Gin volume grew 10% in Great Britain in response to increased advertising and a product relaunch.
Cacique volume grew 14% in Spain.
Gains experienced from the local priority brands were offset by declines in volume and net sales of the remaining local priority brands.
Category brands volume grew 3% with a 7% increase in net sales after deducting excise duties in Great Britain, Europes largest category brand sector, which demonstrated positive volume growth of 16% largely due to successful sales of Blossom Hill.
Contributory volume growth generators also came from Pampero in Spain and Italy and from standard Scotch in Greece.
43 Operating and financial review Diageo Annual Report 2005 Operating and financial review continued Great Britain In Great Britain, continued strong performance from spirits and wine, particularly Smirnoff Red up 19%, Gordons up 10% and Blossom Hill up 37%, drove 6% volume growth despite challenging trading conditions in beer and ready to drink.
Share of spirits grew 1.2 percentage points to 24.8%.
Growth in net sales after deducting excise duties trailed volume growth as a result of negative mix due primarily to the decline in ready to drink.
Additionally, the shift in sales from the on to the off trade, as well as further consolidation in both channels, created pressure on pricing.
Smirnoff volume grew 11% as the strong performance of Smirnoff Red, up 19%, was offset by the decline in Smirnoff ready to drink volume, down 13%.
Net sales after deducting excise duty were down 6% reecting mix deterioration primarily driven by the decline in ready to drink.
For Smirnoff Red, Diageo Great Britains largest spirit brand by volume, 2004 was a landmark year.
Volume grew 19% passing the 3 million case mark and gaining 2.6 percentage points of share.
New packaging, a strong marketing programme and new on trade distribution points were key volume drivers.
A price increase was implemented on 1 April 2004.
Smirnoff Ice remains the No.
1 ready to drink brand in Great Britain and increased its share by 1.7 percentage points, in a declining segment.
Volume fell 13% and net sales after deducting excise duty declined 17%.
Diageos share of the ready to drink segment declined slightly, by 0.3 percentage points to 33.9%, as volume declined due to the withdrawal of Gordons Edge and the decline of Archers Aqua.
Baileys volume growth and positive mix is the result of the introduction of Baileys Glide.
Baileys strategy is focused on broadening the brand footprint into new occasions.
Guinness share in the beer category declined slightly, by 0.1 percentage points, the result of a 5% volume decline in the on trade, offset by 2% volume growth in the off trade.
A price increase for Guinness Draught was implemented on 1 February 2004.
The local priority brands delivered 1% volume growth.
Gordons grew overall volume by 10% and gained share, driven by new advertising and the relaunch of Gordons Sloe Gin.
Bells volume was down by 2%, but overall share grew to 16% and Bells remains the market leader.
Archers volume declined 12% primarily due to the decline of Archers Aqua by 27%.
Blossom Hill grew volume by 37% and gained 2.2 percentage share points of the branded wines segment.
The brand now has the best selling red, white and ros wines in Great Britain.
Marketing investment was down by 11% principally due to a reduced number of product launches and lower ready to drink investment following the further decline of the ready to drink segment.
Ireland The beverage alcohol market in Ireland declined by a further 1% in the year, impacted by some decline in consumer confidence and an acceleration in the shift from the on to the off trade.
The shift towards the off trade is largely attributed to lifestyle and demographics changes, continued price competition in the off trade and to the initial impact in the on trade of the smoking ban introduced in March 2004.
The on trade declined by 6% and now represents 57% of the market volume, while the off trade grew by 7%.
Diageos volume declined by 4% in the full year.
The volume decline of 6% in the first half slowed to 1% in the six months ended 30 June 2004, partly reecting comparison against the prior period which had been negatively impacted by duty increases in December 2002.
Diageos share of the total market declined 1.5 percentage points, primarily driven by the shift to the off trade where Diageos brands have lower share than in the on trade.
Increased competition from imported beer, which has been discounted aggressively by off trade retailers, has also adversely impacted on share.
Net sales after deducting excise duties decreased by 3%.
Price increases on beer brands in March 2003 and June 2004 have partially offset the impact of the volume decline.
Guinness share of long alcoholic drinks beer, cider and ready to drink declined 1.5 percentage points in the year due to the continued switch from on to off trade and the hot summer in the first quarter of the financial year that benefited other segments within long alcoholic drinks.
The spirits market in Ireland continued to decline, in part due to the continued impact of the duty increase of over 40% in December 2002.
However, Smirnoff, excluding ready to drink, increased share of the vodka category by 3.0 percentage points.
The ready to drink segment represents only 1% of the Irish market.
Volume in the local priority lager brands, Budweiser, Carlsberg and Harp, was down 3% again affected by the on trade to off trade switch.
Category brands, where volume grew 9%, represent only 8% of total volume.
Marketing spend on an organic basis was up 9%.
This increase was the result of a change in treatment of certain costs.
On a like for like basis, spend was at.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 44 Operating and financial review Spain J&B volume was down in the standard Scotch and local whisky category which continues to decline.
However, J&B remains the number one brand with 26% share of the category.
The withdrawal of J&B Twist negatively impacted on mix and net sales after deducting excise duties were down 3% despite a 3% price increase in April.
Baileys continued to lead the cream liqueur segment with volume up 3% and share up 0.8 percentage points, to 65.3%.
Net sales after deducting excise duties benefited from a 4% price increase implemented in April.
Johnnie Walker volume increased 13% and gained share driven by growth in Johnnie Walker Red Label.
A moderate price increase was taken in April.
Smirnoff volume growth was driven by 4% growth in Smirnoff Red, offset by a decline in Smirnoff ready to drink which negatively impacted on net sales after deducting excise duties.
Smirnoff continues to lead the vodka category with 35.4% share.
Local priority brand performance was up, driven primarily by Cacique whose volume grew 14% despite higher pricing.
Cacique continued to lead the dark rum segment with approximately 37% share, but lost 0.4 percentage points of share as a result of strong promotional activity from smaller competitors.
The category brand volume performance was driven by a decline in Bells of over 40% as distribution agreements were restructured, although mix improved.
This volume decline was partially offset by 9% volume growth of Pampero.
Spanish consumer trends continue to move from Scotch to wine and dark rum, while socio-economic and regulatory pressures have accelerated the switch from on to off trade.
Despite these trends, Diageo grew overall share to 19.3%, which represents an improvement of 0.6 percentage points.
Marketing spend increased 1% driven by increased media spend on Cacique to support higher pricing, offset by a significant reduction in ready to drink spend.
Excluding ready to drink, marketing spend increased 9%.
Overall media investment has increased 17% and new campaigns have been launched on many priority brands.
Diageo introduced new advertising and promotional brand building activities such as J&B Comedy and the Nightology Boat, a oating J&B disco which travels to different cities along the Spanish coast.
Rest of Europe Rest of Europe accounts for 36% of total European volume and 31% of net sales after deducting excise duties.
Total volume was at, with volume excluding ready to drink up 1%, offsetting a 9% decline in ready to drink.
Net sales after deducting excise duties declined 1% as a result of lower ready to drink sales in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Excluding ready to drink, net sales after deducting excise duties declined by 2%.
In France, ready to drink volume increased following the launch of Smirnoff Ice in May 2003.
This was slightly offset by a drop in all global priority brands except sales of Guinness which rose by 66% albeit from a small base.
J&B, the countrys largest global priority brand saw volumes decline by 4%.

Trend information On 7 July 2005, Diageo issued a statement about current trading.
The following is an extract from this statement: Looking forward to the new financial year, Diageo expects that organic growth in volume will be similar to that achieved in the year ended 30 June 2005.
Diageo will be looking to achieve a higher level of price increase in the coming year and, over the next few weeks, price increases will be announced on a number of brands in North America.
Diageo believes that this renewed focus on pricing, together with the positive impact of the cost efficiency programme, will lead to further year on year improvement in operating margin.
The following comments were made by Paul Walsh, chief executive of Diageo, in Diageos preliminary announcement on 1 September 2005: We have successfully resolved our exposure to Burger King, monetised the majority of our shares in General Mills and provided certainty as to the value we will receive from our remaining shares when they are sold as we expect they will be in a couple of months.
With the completion of these transactions Diageos balance sheet is now as focused on our position as the worlds leading premium drinks company as our operations have been for a number of years.
Therefore, given the continued strong performance of our free cash ow, we will now be able to increase the amount of our share buy back programme.
For the financial year ending 30 June 2006 we are proposing a programme of around 1.4 billion.
As we said at our recent trading update, we expect that in the next financial year volume growth will again be 3% and net sales after deducting excise duties will be 4%.
Better pricing and a stabilising ready to drink trend may give us the opportunity to improve on the net sales after deducting excise duties growth we achieved this year.
We believe operating profit growth can be similar to that achieved in the financial year ended 30 June 2005 even after allowing for higher growth in marketing spend and higher pension costs.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 48 Operating and financial review Liquidity and capital resources Cash flow A summary of the cash ow and reconciliation to movement in net borrowings for the three years ended 30 June 2005 is as follows: Year ended 30 June 2005 2004 2003 million million million Operating profit 1,736 1,871 1,787 Exceptional operating costs 208 40 168 Restructuring and integration payments 43 97 185 Depreciation and amortisation charge 224 224 249 Increase in working capital 53 13 227 Other items 71 96 178 Net cash inflow from operating activities 2,143 2,121 1,970 Dividends received from associates 111 224 60 Interest and dividends paid to minority interests 228 299 355 Investment income 23 Taxation 324 298 105 Net purchase sale of investments 6 9 20 Net capital expenditure 278 307 341 Free cash flow 1,441 1,450 1,209 Acquisitions and disposals 936 34 833 Equity dividends paid 849 800 767 Issue of share capital 6 44 Net purchase of own shares for share trusts 29 4 65 Own shares purchased for cancellation or holding as treasury shares 710 306 852 Redemption of guaranteed preferred securities 302 Exchange adjustments 137 371 227 Non-cash items 91 45 37 Decrease in net borrowings 447 726 626 The primary sources of the groups liquidity over the last three financial years have been cash generated from operations and cash received from disposals.
A portion of these funds has been used to fund acquisitions, share repurchases, to pay interest, dividends and taxes, and to fund capital expenditure.
Free cash ow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that comprises the net cash ow arising from operating activities, dividends received from associates, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, and capital expenditure and financial investment.
Free cash ow as used by the group covers all the items that are required by FRS 1 to be on the face of the cash ow statement down to, and including, capital expenditure and financial investment.
It is therefore a natural sub-total but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The groups management believes the measure assists users of the financial statements in understanding the groups cash generating performance as it comprises items which arise from the running of the ongoing business.
Where appropriate, separate discussion is given for the impacts of acquisitions and disposals of businesses, equity dividends and purchase of own shares each of which arises from decisions which are independent from the running of the ongoing underlying business.
The management regards capital expenditure as ultimately non-discretionary since ongoing investment in plant and machinery is required to support the day-to-day operations, whereas acquisitions and disposals of businesses are discretionary.
However, free cash ow does not necessarily reect all amounts which the group either has a constructive or legal obligation to incur.
The free cash ow measure is also used by management for their own planning, budgeting, reporting and incentive purposes since it provides information on those elements of performance which local managers are most directly able to inuence.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 49 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Free cash ow generated was 1,441 million, compared with 1,450 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 and 1,209 million in the year ended 30 June 2003.

It is expected that all contractual commitments will be funded from future operating cash ows and no new borrowings will be required to meet these obligations.
Provisions for liabilities and charges and creditors greater than one year do not include 32 million in respect of vacant properties included in operating leases, 113 million for onerous contracts included in purchase obligations, post employment provisions and deferred taxation.
In addition, the group has resumed service-based contributions to the Diageo UK pension fund.
The contribution is expected to be approximately 50 million per annum.
At 30 June 2004, the group had 312 million of 9.42% cumulative guaranteed preferred securities which were included in non-equity minority interests on the consolidated balance sheet.
The securities were redeemed at the option of the company during the year ended 30 June 2005.
Off-balance sheet arrangements In connection with the disposal of certain businesses, the group has given guarantees of third party debt which were necessary to complete the disposals on the most favourable terms.
The directors are not aware of any instances of default by the borrowers at present, but the ability of the borrowers to continue to be in compliance with the guaranteed debt instruments, and in particular remaining current on payments of interest and repayments of principal, is signicantly dependent on the current and future operations of those borrowers and their afliates.
Diageo guaranteed up to $850 million 475 million of external borrowings of Burger King until December 2007.
These loans had an original term of five years from December 2002, although Diageo and Burger King agreed to structure their arrangements to encourage renancing by Burger King on a non-guaranteed basis prior to the end of five years.
On13 July 2005, Burger King renanced these external borrowings on a stand-alone basis releasing Diageo of its obligations under the guarantee.
See Material contracts Agreement for the sale of Burger King Corporation for further information.
In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in October 2001, Diageo has guaranteed debt of International Multifoods Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The JM Smucker Company as from 18 June 2004, to the amount of $200 million 112 million, repayable in November 2009.
In addition, certain of the acquired Seagram businesses had pre-existing guarantees at the date of the acquisition in relation to the solvency of a third party partnership.
This partnership has outstanding loans of $100 million 56 million.
Vivendi has indemnified the group against any losses relating to these arrangements.
The above guarantees are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the groups business.
The group also has unrecognised gains and losses of 145 million and 61 million, respectively, in respect of financial instruments at 30 June 2005.
For further disclosures with regard to financial instruments, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
Save as disclosed above, neither Diageo plc nor any member of the Diageo group, has any off-balance sheet nancing arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on the groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.
Risk management The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the groups treasury department.
The treasury department uses a combination of derivative and conventional financial instruments to manage these underlying treasury risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board-approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the finance committee this committee is described in the corporate governance report.
These include benchmark exposure and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The benchmarks, hedge cover and overall appropriateness of Diageos risk management policies are reviewed by the board following, for example, significant business, strategic or accounting changes.
The framework provides for limited dened levels of exibility in execution to allow for the optimal application of the boardapproved strategies.
Transactions giving rise to exposures away from the dened benchmark levels arising on the application of this exibility are separately monitored on a daily basis using value at risk analysis.
They are carried at fair value and gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account as they arise.
At 30 June 2005 gains and losses on these transactions were not material.
The finance committee receives bi-monthly reports on the activities of the treasury department, including any exposures away from the dened benchmarks.
The internal control environment is reviewed regularly.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 53 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Currency risk The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the groups transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to uctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign currency net assets by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps.
The groups policy is to seek to hedge currency exposure on its net assets before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies where a liquid foreign exchange market exists.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net assets before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net borrowings and foreign exchange swaps are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments, in accordance with SSAP 20.
Under IFRS, Diageo will continue to hedge its net investment in foreign currency denominated assets.
Net investment hedges will take the form of foreign currency borrowings or derivatives.
From 1 July 2005, Diageo has introduced additional processes to determine, monitor and document the effectiveness of these hedges in the context of the underlying exposure under IAS 39.
For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised at the same time as the underlying transaction.
Diageo expects hedges entered into to be effective, and therefore does not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the profit and loss account to be material.
Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk and is most vulnerable to changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of xed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing long term xed rate bonds, medium term notes and xed and oating rate commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions.
The prole of xed rate to oating rate net borrowings is maintained according to a duration measure that is equivalent to an approximate 50% xed and 50% oating amortising prole.
The number of years within the amortising prole depends on a template approved by the board.
The oating element of US dollar borrowing is partly protected using interest rate collars although, following a policy review in 2002 interest rate collars are no longer being transacted and the existing collars are reducing as the individual instruments reach maturity.
Remaining interest rate collars as at 30 June 2005 will take up to approximately one year to expire.
In addition, where appropriate, the group may use forward rate agreements to manage short term interest rate exposures.
Swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements and collars are accounted for as hedges.
Such management serves to increase the accuracy of the business planning process.
Following the implementation of IFRS from 1 July 2005 the majority of Diageos existing interest rate hedges are designated as hedges under IAS 39.
Capital structure Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency, maximise exibility and give the appropriate level of access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
This is achieved by targeting a range of ratios which are currently broadly consistent with an A band credit rating.
Liquidity risk The groups policy with regard to the expected maturity prole of group nancing companies borrowings is to limit the proportion of such borrowings maturing within 12 months to 50% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits and the level of commercial paper to 30% of gross borrowings less money market demand deposits.
Credit risk A large number of major international financial institutions are counterparties to the financial instruments transacted by the group.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long term credit rating of A or better.
The group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties, together with their credit ratings.
Commodity price risk The group uses commodity futures and options to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity futures and options contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures or options are then either closed out at the time the raw material is purchased or they are exchanged with the company manufacturing the raw material to determine the contract price.
Commodity contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value but any gains and losses are deferred until the contracts are closed out or exchanged.
Open contracts at 30 June 2005 and gains and losses realised in the year or deferred at the balance sheet date were not significant.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 54 Operating and financial review Employee share schemes Awards and option grants vesting under the various employee share schemes are generally satisfied by the transfer of existing shares.
These awards and option grants are hedged through the purchase of shares or call options.
Exceptions to this policy are in respect of exercises under certain GrandMet and international schemes that are satisfied by the issue of new equity.
Insurance The group purchases insurance for commercial, or where required, for legal or contractual reasons.
In addition, the group retains insurable risk where external insurance is not considered an economic means of mitigating these risks.
Sensitivity analysis For financial instruments held, the group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the change in the fair value of the groups financial instruments from hypothetical changes in market rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause uctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes in the fair values of borrowings, the guaranteed preferred securities and the associated derivative financial instruments at 30 June 2005 are set out in the table below.
The fair values of quoted borrowings and guaranteed preferred securities are based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets are estimated by discounting the future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
These are based on rates obtained from third parties.
The estimated changes in fair values for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease of 1% 100 basis points in the specic rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 30 June 2005, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in the fair value for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 30 June 2005, with all other variables remaining constant.
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only as, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
Sensitivity analysis table at 30 June 2005 Fair value changes arising from: 1% fall 10% Estimated in interest weakening fair value rates in sterling million million million Borrowings 4,746 161 505 Interest rate contracts 51 100 6 Foreign exchange contracts: Transaction 23 138 Balance sheet translation 38 57 Written call options re General Mills shares 8 1 Other financial net assets 530 4 66 At 30 June 2005 General Mills had the option to purchase 25 million of General Mills shares held by Diageo subject to certain limitations.
The call options have a strike price of $51.56 and expire in October 2005.
The estimated fair value of the call options was derived using a Black Scholes model using market volatility, share price and interest rates as at 30 June 2005.
It is estimated that a 5% increase in the share price of General Mills would increase the negative fair value by 9 million.
On 24 August 2005 Diageo purchased an option to dispose of its remaining interest in General Mills see Related party transactions Agreements with General Mills.
Critical accounting policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
Diageos accounting policies are set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.
In applying these policies the directors are required to make estimates and subjective judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit for the year.
The directors base these on a combination of past experience and any other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The actual outcome could differ from those estimates.
Of Diageos accounting policies, the directors consider that policies in relation to the following areas are of greater complexity and or particularly subject to the exercise of judgement.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 55 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Brands, goodwill and other intangibles Acquired brands are held on the consolidated balance sheet at cost.
Where brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.
Assessment of the useful economic life of an asset, or that an asset has an indefinite life, requires considerable management judgement.
Impairment reviews are carried out to ensure that intangible assets, including brands, are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
In particular, the group performs a discounted cash ow analysis annually to compare discounted estimated future operating cash ows to the net carrying value of each acquired brand.
The analysis is based on forecast cash ows with terminal values being calculated using the lower of the growth rate implicit in the companys strategic plan and the long term growth rate the real GDP growth rate of the country plus its ination rate of the principal countries in which the majority of the profits of each brand are generated.
The estimated cash ows are discounted at the groups weighted average cost of capital in the relevant country.
Any impairment write downs identied are charged to the profit and loss account.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash ows, and the discount rate applied to these cash ows.
Post employment benefits Diageo accounts for post employment benets in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement benets.
Application of FRS 17 requires the exercise of judgement in relation to various assumptions including future pay rises in excess of ination, employee and pensioner demographics and the future expected returns on assets.
Diageo determines the assumptions to be adopted in discussion with its actuaries, and believes these assumptions to be in line with UK practice generally, but the application of different assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reected in the profit and loss account and balance sheet in respect of post employment benets.
The assumptions vary among the countries in which the group operates, and there may be an interdependency between some of the assumptions.
A list of the major assumptions used by the group for the three years ended 30 June 2005 are set out in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
It would be impracticable to give the impact of the effect of changes in all of the assumptions used to calculate the post employment charges in the profit and loss account and balance sheet, but the following disclosures are provided to assist the reader in assessing the impact of changes in the more critical assumptions.
The finance charges included in the profit and loss account for post employment benets are partly calculated by assuming an estimated rate of return on the assets held by the post employment plans.
For the year ended 30 June 2005 this was based on the assumption that equities would outperform xed interest government bonds by three and a quarter percentage points.
A one percentage point increase in this assumption would have improved profit before taxation by approximately 28 million.
The rates used to discount the liabilities of the post employment plans are determined by using rates of return on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the profit and loss account charge in the year ended 30 June 2005 would have reduced profit before taxation by approximately 9 million.
A half a percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption used to determine the post employment liability at 30 June 2005 would have increased the liabilities by approximately 450 million.
The net liability for post employment benets is partly determined by the market value at the end of the year of the assets owned by the post employment plans.
A 10% movement in worldwide equity values would increase decrease the net pension liability before tax at 30 June 2005 by approximately 319 million.
The mortality assumptions used in the UK plan are based on the mortality experience of the plan and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
For example, it is assumed that members who retire in 2023 at age 65 will live on average for a further 20 years if they are male and for a further 23 years if they are female.
The current mortality assumptions will be re-assessed in 2006.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for the UK plans, the charge to the profit and loss account would have increased by approximately 9 million and the deficit would have increased by approximately 150 million.
Operating exceptional items Operating exceptional items are those that, in managements judgement, are material items that arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the group but, by virtue of their size or incidence, should be separately disclosed if the consolidated financial statements are to properly reect the results for the period.
The determination of which items should be separately disclosed as operating exceptional items requires a significant degree of judgement.
Exceptional items under UK GAAP do not represent extraordinary items under US GAAP.
Financial instruments The group uses financial instruments to hedge its exposures to uctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are structured so as to reduce the market risk associated with the underlying transaction being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
While UK GAAP includes prescriptive disclosure requirements in relation to financial instruments, it does not include a comprehensive standard on hedge accounting.
Nevertheless, under UK GAAP, hedging principles are generally applied whereby the cash ows on hedge instruments are matched to the underlying hedged risks, with hedging instruments held in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
In the absence of detailed guidance under UK GAAP, judgement must be applied in the establishment and application of accounting policies in relation to financial instruments accounted for as hedges.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 56 Operating and financial review Taxation The group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the timing differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
These timing differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included within the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply when the timing differences reverse.
The group operates in many countries in the world and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules.
As a consequence the group is subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Management judgement is required to determine the total provision for income tax.
Amounts accrued are based on managements interpretation of country specic tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
However the actual tax liabilities could differ from the provision and in such event the group would be required to make an adjustment in a subsequent period which could have a material impact on the groups profit and loss and or cash position.
Tax benets are not recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained.
Once considered to be probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
All such provisions are included in creditors due within one year.
Any interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised where it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realised in the future.
This evaluation require judgements to be made including the forecast of future taxable income.
Discussion of US GAAP differences Diageos consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which is the groups primary reporting framework.
Reconciliations between UK and US GAAP are set out in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements and this section explains the principal differences.
Year ended 30 June 2005 2004 2003 million million million Turnover UK GAAP 9,036 8,891 9,281 US GAAP 9,170 8,777 9,153 Effect on net income of significant differences between UK and US GAAP: Net income in accordance with UK GAAP 1,375 1,392 50 Adjustments to conform with US GAAP: Inventories 24 37 46 Pensions and other post employment benets 5 10 95 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares 27 28 4 Other derivative instruments 53 111 189 Disposal of businesses 5 69 177 Burger King 17 13 693 Disposal of General Mills shares 87 Other items 23 3 25 Deferred taxation 52 143 13 Net income in accordance with US GAAP 1,470 1,700 434 Turnover US GAAP turnover sales in US terminology for the year ended 30 June 2005 was 134 million higher than turnover under UK GAAP.
This principal difference was in respect of the accounting treatment of a number of joint arrangements, involved in the marketing and distribution of premium drinks, that the group has with Mot Hennessy in France and the Far East.
Under UK GAAP, the group consolidates the attributable share of the joint arrangements measured according to the terms of the arrangement as a result of which the group only consolidates the turnover of the Diageo brands sold to third parties by the joint arrangements.
Under US GAAP, the sales to third parties of the Mot Hennessy brands by the joint arrangements are also included in group turnover as Diageo is regarded as the primary beneciary of the joint arrangements.
In the year ended 30 June 2004, turnover under US GAAP was 114 million 2003 128 million lower than under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, during the period before the implementation of FIN 46 R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, joint arrangements with Mot Hennessy were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the groups share of sales of the joint arrangements was not included as part of group turnover.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 57 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Net income The significant reconciling items in net income are as follows: Inventories Under UK GAAP, the merger of GrandMet and the Guinness Group was accounted for under merger accounting principles pooling of interests where the results and balance sheets of both entities, having made adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, were aggregated with no adjustment to fair value.
Under US GAAP, the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet with an effective acquisition date of 31 December 1997.
As a consequence the fair value of the net assets under US GAAP of the Guinness Group was higher than the net assets under UK GAAP, primarily in respect of maturing whisky inventories.
The fair value of the inventories at the date of acquisition 17 December 1997 was 601 million higher under US GAAP than the book value under UK GAAP.
The increase in inventory values is unwinding over a number of years on the sale of the whisky to third parties.
Pensions and other post employment benets Under UK GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using the market value of assets, are charged credited to other finance charges in the profit and loss account.
Any amount arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The surplus or deficit in post employment plans at the balance sheet date is reported as part of the groups consolidated net assets.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost, the interest being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using a smoothed market value of assets are all charged credited to operating profit.
The cumulative amounts arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are amortised through operating profit over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
Only when the plan is in deficit, calculated on the plans accrued rather than projected liabilities, is the liability included in the groups consolidated net assets.
If the plan is in surplus, the groups consolidated net assets include a prepayment or provision which is the difference between the cumulative charges to operating profit and the cumulative cash contributions made to the plan.
Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares Under UK GAAP, the premium received from the sale to General Mills of options over 29 million ordinary shares of Diageos holding in that company was deferred in the balance sheet pending exercise or lapse of the options.
On 4 October 2004, 4 million of the shares over which the option was exercisable were disposed of to the groups UK pension fund.
The premium in respect of the option over the 4 million shares has been realised in the profit and loss account under UK GAAP in the year ended 30 June 2005.
Also under UK GAAP, the contingent value right, received in connection with the disposal of Pillsbury, was treated as a contingent asset and was therefore not recognised until the realisation of the contingent asset became virtually certain.
The group received cash in settlement of the contingent value right on 1 May 2003, and as a consequence it was accounted for in the consolidated profit and loss account in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Under US GAAP, the option contract and the contingent value right represent derivatives and, accordingly, have been held at their estimated fair values at the balance sheet dates with changes in fair value included in the statement of income.
Other derivative instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Under UK GAAP, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and derivatives hedging forecast transactions are not recognised until realised.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, all derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Certain of the groups derivatives qualify for and are designated as hedges under US GAAP.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives, and gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are charged or credited in determining net income under US GAAP.
In the year ended 30 June 2005, under US GAAP, there were losses of 71 million recognised on foreign exchange derivatives 2004 gains of 62 million: 2003 losses of 148 million and gains of 31 million recognised on interest rate instruments 2004 gains of 62 million: 2003 losses of 45 million.
The year on year movements were primarily a product of the portion of the groups hedging instruments and hedged items for which mark-to-market movements are taken to net income under US GAAP but not under UK GAAP, and the movements in exchange and interest rates in each period.
Other differences arising between UK and US GAAP on derivative instruments, in respect of the groups share of results of associated companies, amounted to losses of 13 million 2004 losses of 13 million: 2003 gains of 4 million.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 58 Operating and financial review Disposal of businesses Under UK GAAP, in the year ended 30 June 2005, the group made a gain of 46 million on disposal of businesses including the release of provisions of 53 million in respect of Burger King compared with a loss of 2 million under US GAAP excluding the release of provisions of 53 million in respect of Burger King.
In addition, there was an impairment charge to goodwill of 5 million in respect of a distribution business in Ireland which has not been recognised under US GAAP.
In the year ended 30 June 2004, the principal reason for the difference between UK and US GAAP was the recognition of the deferred gain established on the sale of Pillsbury.
In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in the year ended 30 June 2002, Diageo guaranteed the debt of International Multifoods Corporation IMC to the amount of $200 million 112 million.
Under US GAAP, Diageo had deferred the element of the gain on disposal of Pillsbury equivalent to the amount guaranteed.
As a result of the acquisition of IMC by The JM Smucker Company in the year ended 30 June 2004, the deferred gain under US GAAP was recognised in that year.
In the year ended 30 June 2003, under UK GAAP, excluding the pre-tax loss in respect of the disposal of Burger King described below and the receipt of 173 million under the terms of the contingent value right connected with the disposal of Pillsbury described above, the group made gains on disposals of other businesses of 14 million compared with gains of 16 million under US GAAP.
Burger King Under UK GAAP, the sale of Burger King on 13 December 2002 was accounted for as a disposal and the results prior to the disposal date were presented within discontinued operations.
Net income for the year ended 30 June 2003 reected a pre-tax charge in relation to the sale of Burger King of 1,441 million and 750 million under UK and US GAAP, respectively, representing 691 million of the total UK US GAAP difference in net income.
Under US GAAP, the transaction was not accounted for as a disposal due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continuing involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance.
However, a charge for impairment was recognised rather than a loss on disposal.
The charge for impairment under US GAAP was lower than the loss on disposal under UK GAAP principally because the goodwill and brands acquired on the original acquisition of the quick service restaurants business were being amortised over 40 years up to 30 June 2001 prior to the adoption of SFAS No.
142, whereas no amortisation had been charged on the goodwill and brands under UK GAAP.
By the date of disposal, Diageo had incurred additional cumulative amortisation including related deferred tax under US GAAP of 609 million on the goodwill and brands of Burger King.
Other differences arising between UK and US GAAP, principally in respect of derivative instruments, reduced the charge under US GAAP by 82 million.
In the US GAAP balance sheet, the total assets and total liabilities of Burger King at 30 June 2005 including consideration deferred under US GAAP classied within other long term assets and other long term liabilities were each 1.2 billion 2004 1.2 billion.
On 13 July 2005 Burger King renanced its external borrowings on a stand-alone basis, releasing Diageo of its obligations under the guarantee relating to that debt.
Accordingly, the transaction will be accounted for as a disposal under US GAAP in the year ending 30 June 2006.
Disposal of General Mills shares Under UK GAAP, in the year ended 30 June 2005, the group made a pre-tax loss of 26 million on the disposal of 53.9 million General Mills shares.
Under US GAAP, the group made a pre-tax gain of 61 million in respect of the disposal of these shares.
The main reason for the difference was the different carrying values under UK and US GAAP of the General Mills investment, which principally arose from the varying historical accounting treatments for intangible assets.
Under US GAAP, until 30 June 2001, the goodwill and brands in respect of the General Mills investment were being amortised over 40 years, whereas no amortisation on these assets had been charged under UK GAAP.
In addition, interest rate swaps were closed out at a cost of 25 million and charged to the loss on disposal under UK GAAP but, under US GAAP, these instruments had been carried at fair value with gains and losses arising being accounted for through the statement of income prior to the sale.
Partially offsetting these differences, cumulative unhedged currency translation losses of 37 million were included in the gain on disposal under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, cumulative currency translation gains and losses are not included in the loss on disposal.
Exceptional and extraordinary items Under UK GAAP, exceptional items are those that, in managements judgement, are material items that arise from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the group but, by virtue of their size or incidence, should be separately disclosed if the consolidated financial statements are to properly reect the results for the period.
US GAAP does not have such a category.
Under US GAAP, certain of these items are treated in accordance with paragraph 26 of APB 30 as a separate component of income from continuing operations, if appropriate.
The group has had no extraordinary items under either UK or US GAAP for the three years ended 30 June 2005.
New accounting standards No new UK accounting pronouncements have been issued in the year which impact the UK GAAP information reported.
The following new US GAAP pronouncements issued by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB have recently been issued.
151 Inventory Costs In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
151 Inventory Costs to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognised as current period charges.
151 requires that the allocation of xed production overheads to inventory values be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
151 is effective for costs incurred in respect of inventories for reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
151 is not expected to have a material effect on the results or net assets of the group.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 59 Operating and financial review
