23 BUSINESS OVERVIEW Smith & Nephews operations are organised into three core business segments that operate globally: orthopaedics, endoscopy and advanced wound management.
These three businesses comprise the Groups Ongoing Operations.
Smith & Nephew believes that its businesses have the opportunities for strong growth due to their markets benefiting from an ageing population, an increase in active lifestyles and trends toward less .
Sales in Sterling accounted for only 8% of group turnover in 2003 2002 8%, 2001 7%.
Consequently, fluctuations in the exchange rates between Sterlingandthe  Groupoperates have a significantaffect ongroupturnover.

This is calculated by excluding the effects of foreign currency translation movements and acquisitions see Note 2 b of the Notes to the Accounts.
Management believes that sales growth on an underlying basis provides a consistent year-on-year measurement of performance without the distortions created by the translational effect of foreign currency movements and acquisitions which are separate from the Groups normal operations.
Underlying sales growth is used bymanagement inits , budgetingand planning.

Smith & Nephew operates predominantly in the well-developed healthcare markets of the Americas 54% of group turnover of which 51% is in the US, Europe 31% of group turnover and Japan andAustralia 9% ofgroupturnover.
These markets are characterised by an increase in the average age of the population caused by the immediate post-World War II baby boomer generation approaching retirement, increased longevity and more active 25 lifestyles.
The ageing population combined with more active lifestyles and increased affluence has created significant demand for more effective healthcare products which deliver improved outcomes through technology advances.
Furthermore pressure to resist increases in overall healthcare spending has led healthcare providers todemand  lengthof hospital stays and surgeonand nursingresources.
A recent trend has been increasing consumer awareness of available healthcare treatments through the Internet and direct-to-customer advertising.
This has led to increased consumer influence over product purchasing decisions.
In orthopaedics, improvements in technology have lengthened the effective life of reconstructive implants and have facilitated the implantation of knees and hips in relatively young patients thereby improving the quality of life for a new generation.
The decision to create separate divisions for orthopaedic reconstructive and trauma was a strategic move intended to generate greater customer focus.
With experienced managers responsible for sales, marketing and product development in each, management believes that divisionalisation has resulted in increasedsales momentumforSmith& Nephewintrauma inthe US.
The endoscopy business is expected to benefit from the continued trend worldwide towards less invasive surgery but with particular focus on arthrosopic repair of the knee, hip and shoulder using a broad range of technology.
The Group also expects to benefit from the demand for less invasive approaches to spinal disc repair.
The advanced wound management business is focused on the treatment of chronic wounds of the older population and other hard-to-heal wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, burns and certain surgical wounds and is therefore also expected to benefit from demographic trends.
The market for advanced wound treatments is relatively unpenetrated and it is estimated that the potential market is significantly larger than the current market of 1.6 billion.
This increased penetration is expected to be driven by improved outcomes from new technology, health economic benefits, demographics, increasing nursing shortages, quality of life expectations and education   advanced treatments.
Sales Force The Groups sales force, which includes independent commissioned sales agents, increased by 5% to 2,612 during 2003.
The biggest increase was 11% in orthopaedics where the most significant increases were in the focus markets of the US at 13% and Japan at 17%.
The size of the endoscopy sales force remained unchanged.
The advanced wound management sales force increased by 4%, the main increases being in the US.
The increase in the indirect market unit was 4%, principally due to increases in Spain and South Africa.
Further sales force increases are planned in the US and Japan by orthopaedics, endoscopy and advanced wound management in2004.
Currency Movements Smith & Nephews results of operations are significantly affected by exchange rate movements.
A substantial proportion of its sales and operating expenses are earned and paid in currencies other than Sterling, the Groups reporting currency.
Accordingly, the Group is subject to exposure arising from the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries into Sterling for financialreporting purposes.
In addition, the Group is subject to exposures arising from sales made in a currency different from the related costs and expenses.
The Group attempts to manage the impact of exchange rate movements on cost of sales by a policy of purchasing forward all its foreign currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed.
In addition, businesses are required to purchase forward at least 50% of all of their forecast foreign currency requirements on a twelve-month rolling basis.
The Group also incurs interest expense on its indebtedness denominated in currencies other than Sterling to the extent that other currencies, particularly the US Dollar and Euro, decline in value against the Sterling, Smith & Nephews turnover and operating profit may be adversely affected offset by a reduction in the effective cost of servicingdebt.
See FinancialPosition, Liquidityand Capital Resources.
2003YEAR The following discussion and analysis is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, the Group Accounts of Smith & Nephew included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The Groups Accounts are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Reconciliations reflecting the effect of the  between UK GAAP and US GAAP are set forthinNote40 of Notes to the Accounts.
26 Critical Accounting Policies The Groups most significant accounting policies are set out in Note 1 of the Notes to the Accounts.
Those  most use ofmanagement judgment are as follows: Stocks A feature of the orthopaedic business whose finished goods stock makes up 47% of the Group total is the high level of finished product stock required, some of which is located at customer premises and is available for customers immediate use.
Complete sets of finished product, including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way.
The outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of requirements.
Adjustments to carryingvalue are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic stock to anticipate this situation.
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of stock compared with historical or forecast usage.
This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two years.
This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgements on effectiveness of stock deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of .
Intangible Fixed Assets  to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth and the level of market penetration for the products acquired, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals and the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products.
If actual results should differ or changes in expectations arise impairment charges may be required which .
Post-Retirement Benefits The cost of the Groups defined benefit pension plans are charged to operating profit so as to spread the expense of providing future pensions to employees over their remaining working lives with the Group, in accordance with SSAP 24.
In this way, actuarial variations are charged or credited to operating profit over periods of ten to thirteen years.
The principal assumptions used in calculating pension costs are set out in Note 33 of the Notes to the Accounts with the most critical being the return on investments and increase in pensionable earnings for the UK and US plans.
If actual results should differ from these assumptions the Groups financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected.
The currently optional alternative accounting treatment, FRS 17, which requires immediate recognition of actuarial variations direct to reserves, has not been adopted because management believes that it has the effect of overstating plan deficits sincea short-termrate of interest is used to discount plan liabilities which are long-term in nature.
If FRS 17 had been adopted a liability, net of related deferred tax, of 86.5m would have been recognised on the balance sheet compared with 1.7m underSSAP 24.
New Accounting Policiesin 2003 The Group has adopted UK Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38.
This has required the investment in own shares to be reclassified in the balance sheet and prior periods have been restated accordingly see Note 27 of the Notes tothe Accounts.
Financial Highlightsof 2003 Group turnover was 1,178.9m for the year ended 31 December 2003, representing 6% growth compared to 2002.
Profit on ordinary activities before taxation was 230.1m, compared with 177.9m in 2002.
Profit before taxation goodwill amortisation and exceptional items calculated as set out in the Five Year Record, improved 15% to 242.2m.
Basic earnings per Ordinary Share were 15.92p, a 31% increase compared to 12.11p for 2002.
Adjusted basic earnings per share Ordinary Share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items calculated as set out in the Five Year Record was 18.49pcomparedto 16.02pfor2002, representing a 15% increase.
ii Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items comprises 220.7m from Ongoing Operations 2002 196.0m fromOngoing Operationsand 2.1m fromdiscontinued operations.
Group Turnover For the year ended 31 December 2003, group turnover totalled 1,178.9m, an increase of 6% or 69.0m compared to 1,109.9 for 2002.
Underlying growth of Ongoing Operations was 11%.
Translation of foreign currencies had the effect of decreasing turnover by 2%, primarily due to the depreciation of the US Dollar against the pound sterling.
The loss of revenues from the Groups discontinued rehabilitation business resulted in an adverse impact to the Groups turnover of 26.2m 3%.
Selling price increases accounted for approximately 2% ofthe underlyingsales growth.
Cost of Sales Cost of sales at 345.1m represents 29.3% of sales compared to 29.7% in 2002.
This improvement arose from manufacturing cost and efficiency savings and transactional currency benefits from the decline in the value of the US Dollar reducing the product cost in many countries outside the US, notably in Europe and Australia.
The reduction in cost of sales would have been greater but for the acquisition, in late 2002, of the remaining DERMAGRAFT interests notalready  Groups productioncosts forthis product.
Marketing, sellingand distribution expenses At 440.1mthese costs represented 37.3%of sales, the same percentage as in2002.
Administration Expenses At 125.5m, administration expenses were 1.3% lower than in 2002 and represented 10.6% of sales compared with11.5%ofsalesin2002.
Research and Development Expenditure on research and development increased by 5.5m 9% compared with2002.
Thisrepresented 5.7% of sales compared with 5.5% in 2002.
Smith & Nephew continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate the group from its competitors.
In 2003, 20% of Smith & Nephews sales were from  last three years.
28 BSN Medical Agency and Management Fees Agency and management fees are received in respect of services provided to BSN Medical for sales force resource, physical distribution and logistics and administration in certain countries.
The calculation of the fees is designed to result in a neutral, cost-recovery position for Smith & Nephew and is for a transitional period only.
In 2003, recoveries fell by 1.3m 6% as a number of the shared service arrangements expired and BSN Medical established its ownstand-alone operations.
This trend of lower agency fees is expected to continueas more BSN Medicalentities exit the arrangements.
Operating Profit before Goodwill Amortisation and Exceptional Items Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items from Ongoing Operations was 220.7m, an increase of 24.7m compared to 196.0m in 2002, resulting from profit arising from additional sales together with cost and efficiencysavings.
These two factors more than offset  of 7.3mdueto the need to amortise the deficits of the Groups principal plans and increased DERMAGRAFT costs of 7.2m followingthe acquisitionof50% ofthe  owned.
Operating profit margins before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items from Ongoing Operations improved from 18.1% to 18.7% of which 1.5% points was due to cost and efficiency savings and 0.3% points was due to transactional currency benefits offset partly by 0.6% points in respect of higher pension costs and 0.6% points fromthe effect .
Goodwill Amortisation The amortisation charge on acquisition goodwill increased by 1.0m to 18.5m.
The increase was due to a full years amortisation of ORATEC goodwill compared with nine months in 2002, offset partly by the translational currencyeffect ofa weakerUS Dollar.
Exceptional Items Operating exceptional items were a net cost of 22.4m compared to a net cost of 29.9m in 2002.
In 2003, 17.6m of net costs were incurred as a consequence of Smith & Nephews unsuccessful public offers to purchase Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital AG and 4.8m of costs arose on the integration of the ORATEC acquisition, principally in the relocation of manufacturing and development operations.
Exceptional items in 2002 consisted of 17.5m for the writedown of the Groups trade investment in the common stock of ATS following its filing for bankruptcy, 4.0m for further rationalisation due to the contribution of businesses to BSN Medical and  acquisitionof ORATEC and DERMAGRAFT.
Share of Operating Profit of the Joint Venture The Groups share of operating profit before exceptional items increased by 3.1m from 19.6m in 2002 to 22.7m in 2003.

Operating Profit Operating profit from the advanced wound management business before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increasedby7.9m 22% from36.1min2001 to 44.0min2002.
Losses arising from the DERMAGRAFT joint arrangement increased from 7.0m in 2001 to 8.0m in 2002 as a result of additional sales force expense following the launch of DERMAGRAFT in the US in April 2002 and the consolidation of 100% of losses from 25 November 2002 following the acquisition of the remainder of the ATS arrangements.
OUTLOOK AND TREND INFORMATION The discussion below contains statements that express managements expectations about future events or results rather than historical facts.
These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the Groups actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements.
Smith & Nephew cannot give assurance that such statements will prove correct.
These risks and uncertainties include factors related to: the medical devices industry in general, the geographical markets in which the Group operates, the nature and efficiency of the Groups products, the Groups ability to research, develop, manufacture and distribute its products, the translation of currencies to pounds sterling and the values of international securities markets.
For additional information on factors that could cause the Groups actual results to differ from estimates reflected in these forward-looking statements, you shouldread RiskFactors beginningonpage 20 of this document.
The markets on which the Group focuses continue to demonstrate robust growth and are expected to benefit for many years to come from an ageing population, active lifestyles and the development of less invasive techniques in orthopaedic and endoscopic surgery.
Management believe that Smith & Nephews continuing innovation in advanced wound management products and the potential for further penetration of moist wound healing and woundbed  expansionof this market.
Smith & Nephew continues to achieve strong sales growth in these markets and is demonstrating its ability to grow market share in orthopaedics and maintain market leadership in endoscopy and advanced wound management.
Management believes that the Group is well placed to achieve strong underlying sales growth in 2004 and plans to invest in expanding its sales force, with at least 10% growth planned in 2004.
Smith & Nephew also intends to continue to invest in research and development and manufacturing capacity where necessary  strengthen its long-termprospects.
For 2004, Smith & Nephew expects increasing growth in its orthopaedics business, improved growth rates in endoscopy supported by the launch of a new progressive scan camera system and the next generation varicose vein removal system, and sustained growth in the advanced woundmanagement business.
TheGroups aim is to accelerate underlying sales growth within the orthopaedics business to high teens and to grow endoscopy and advanced wound management sales in high single digits.
It also aims to increase its operating marginsbyaround1%.
A significant external influence on Group sales and profits in 2004 and beyond will be the translational effects of currency to the extent that average rates of exchange differ from those in year 2003.
Reported sales and profits would benefit from a strengthening in the value of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling compared with average rates of exchange in 2003 but would be reduced by a strengthening in the value of Sterling against those currencies.
A further influence on profit and on operating profit margin trends in 2004 and beyond will be the transactional effects of currency to the extent that rates of exchange differ from those in 2003.
Operating profit 36 margins will improve if the effective rate of exchange of the Euro compared with the US Dollar increases and will be reduced by a relative strengthening of the US Dollar.
The effective rate of exchange will determine the average cost of finished goods purchased by the Groups selling operations from its manufacturing operations and will be affected byactualrates ofexchange, forwardpurchases of foreigncurrencyand stockutilisation.
Translation of foreign currency net debt into sterling had the effect of decreasing net debt by 108.1m in the  31December2003.
Acquisitions and Disposals In the three-year period ended 31 December 2003, 75.7m of cash was spent on acquisitions, net of disposal proceeds, funded from net debt.
Acquisitions totalled 279.9m and comprised ORATEC 191.2m, Beiersdorf Advanced Woundcare30.0m, Collagenase 27.3m, Acticoat13.5m, DERMAGRAFT 7.8mandother10.1m.
In the same three-year period, 204.2m was received from the disposal of businesses and the formation of the BSN Medical.
This comprised 61.7m for the ear, nose and throat business, 18.3m on the formation of BSN Medical, 71.8mforthe  .
Capital Expenditure The Groups ongoingcapital expenditure andworkingcapital requirementshave been  generated by business operations and, where necessary, through short-term committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
Capital expenditure on tangible and intangible fixed assets normallyrepresents approximately 6% to7% of continuing group turnover although it reached 7.7% in 2002 as several projects were completed in the same year.
In 2003 capital expenditure of 73.8m 71.4m net of disposals of fixed assets was incurred.
The principal areas of investment were in facility expansions in Memphis, Andover and Largo to create additional , informationsystems and .
At  expenditure had been contractedfor.
Operating Cash Flow Management assesses available cash flow in terms of operating cash flow before outgoings on rationalisation, divestment, acquisition integration and other costs for example, Centerpulse bid costs in 2003.
This figure 37 169.7m for 2003 is after several adjustments to net cash inflow from operating activities, the most comparable UK GAAP figure.
Management believes that this figure represents a truer reflection of cash flow generation because it excludes exceptional cash flow items.
This measure is used in the Groups management reporting, budgeting and planning.
Management also analyses the conversion rate i. e. the percentage of this cash flow figure compared to group operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, which was 77% for 2003 2002 73%, 2001 78%.
Management uses this conversion rate to monitor the efficiency of its use of capital employed and to provide meaningful year-on-yearcash flow trend information.
Management has set longterm targets forthe Groupof70% 80% cashflowconversion.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities to operating cash flow before , divestment,  Centerpulse costs.

At 31 December 2003, the Group held 26.0m in cash and balances at bank and had committed and uncommitted bank facilities of 358m and 231m respectively.
Undrawn bank facilities amounted to 393m, of which 198m were committed.
Of the undrawn committed facilities, 9m expire within one year and 189m after two but within five years.
Of the drawn facilities, 96.9m expire within one year, 26.2m expire in 1-3 years and 73.4 expire within 3-5 years.
Smith & Nephew intends to repay the amounts due within one year byusingavailable  .
The principal variations in the Groups borrowing requirements result from the timing of the bi-annual dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals of businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital fluctuations.
Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure needs and its working capital funding for 2004, as well as its otherknownorexpected , canbe met fromits existing resourcesand facilities.
Further information regarding borrowings at 31 December 2003 is set out in Note 20 of the Notes to the Accounts.
The Group believes that the borrowing facilities do not contain restrictions that are expected to impact  policyforthe foreseeable future.
Pension Funding The falls in the stock market values over the last four years have adversely affected the funding levels of both of Smith & Nephews major defined benefit plans in the UK and US.
These plans continueto be accountedforunder SSAP 24 and their combined SSAP 24 deficit is estimated as 55m at 31 December 2003 2002 80m.
This is less than the combined deficit under FRS17 of 121.2m 2002 111.2m, which is due to the noninvestment return discount rate required to be applied to liabilities under FRS17.
The SSAP 24 deficit is to be funded over members average future working lives.
Existing provisions and planned increases in future contributionsare consideredadequate tocoverthe .
Payment Policies It is Company policy to ensure that suppliers are paid within agreed terms.
At the year end, the Companys trade creditorsrepresented the equivalent of35days credit.
38 EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATERISK AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Board of Directors of the Company has established a set of policies to manage funding, currencyand interest rate risks.
The Group only uses derivative financial instruments to manage the financial risks associated with underlyingbusiness activities andtheirfinancing.
Foreign Exchange Exposure The Group trades in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
The Groups policy is to protect shareholders funds by matching foreign currency assets, including acquisition goodwill, with foreign currency liabilities wherever practicable.
These liabilities take the form of either borrowings or currencyswaps.
It is the Groups policyfor operating units not to hold unhedged monetary assets .
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly on translation of overseas sales and profits into sterling and secondly, the currency cost of purchases by Group companies of finished products and raw materials.
The principal flows of currency are purchases of US Dollars and Sterling from Euros, Japanese yen and Canadianand Australian dollars, as wellas crosspurchases between the US and the UK.
The Group partly mitigates the translational impact on profits through the interest arising on foreign currency borrowings or swaps.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use .
The Group manages 310m of foreign currency purchase transactions by using forward foreign exchange contracts, of which the major transaction flow is Euro into US Dollars.
The Groups policy is for firm purchase commitments to be fully covered and forecasts to be covered between 50% and 90% for up to one year.
If the Euro were to weaken against US Dollar by 10% on average over the year, the fair value of forward foreign .
Had the Group not transacted forward foreign exchange purchase contracts and if Sterling were to have weakened on average over the year by 10% against all other currencies, Smith & Nephews profit on ordinary activities before taxation in 2003 would have increased by 27m on account of transactional and translational movements: if the Euro were to have weakened an average over the year by 10% against all other currencies, profit on ordinary activities before taxation in 2003 would have reduced by 10m: if the US Dollar were to have weakened on average over the year by 10% against all other currencies, profit on ordinary activities before taxation in2003wouldnothave changedmaterially.
The Groups net debt is exposed to movements in exchange rates on foreign currency liabilities.
If Sterling were to weaken against the US Dollar by 10% at 31 December 2004 the increase in the Groups net debt would be 53m.
If Sterling were to weaken on average over the year against all currencies excluding the US Dollar by 10%, the Groups net debt would be increased by 19m.
Thus, in total, if Sterling were to weaken against all currencies by10%, the Groupsnet debt wouldincreasewouldbe 72m.
Interest Rate Risk The Group uses fixed rate currency swaps and uses simple floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs and differentials between borrowing and deposit rates within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for as hedges and, as such, changes in fair values resulting from changes to market rates are not recognised in the Group balance sheet nor in reported profits.
The cash flow effects of interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying instruments such that there is no net cash floweffect frommovements inmarketinterest rates.
As at 31 December 2003, the majority of interest costs and differentials had been protected through to .
If the Group had not transacted interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk, based upon the net debt position at 31 December 2003 an increase in short-term interest rates across all currencies by one percentage point would increase the Groups annual net interest payable by 1.3m.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities were principally at floating interest rates and thus their fair values are not directly affected by movements inmarketrates ofinterest.
At 31 December 2003, an increase of one percentage point in sterling and US Dollar interest rates would have reduced the fair value of Sterling interest rate swaps by 7m and increased the fair value of US Dollar interest 39 rate swaps by 6m.
In the case of decreases in interest rates of one percentage point, the changes to the fair values of the interest rate swaps would have been an increase of 7m relating to sterling and a reduction of 6m relatingtoUS Dollars.
Financial Instruments The Groups financial instruments are subject to changes in fair values as a result of changes in market rates of exchange and forward interest rates.
All financial instruments are accounted for as hedges.
As a result, changes infairvalues  the Groups profit onordinaryactivities before taxation.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
Smith & Nephew does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject tomaterial .

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Management believes that the Group does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC in Item 5E of Form 20-F, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Groups financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures orcapital resourcesthat ismaterial to investors.
RELATED PARTYTRANSACTIONS Except for BSN Medical and AbilityOne see Note 36 of Notes to the Accounts, no other related party has had material & Nephewoverthe last three financialyears.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS Under European regulation, from 2005 Smith & Nephew will be required to publish its financial statements under IFRS.
The transition is being managed internally by a Project Committee reporting to a Steering Committee which ischairedbythe FinanceDirector.
40 The Project Committee has performed a full assessment of the extant standards and their impact on both the reported financial statements and underlying business processes, and continues to monitor the progress of standards yet to be finalised.
Bi-annual reports have been made to the Audit Committee on the likely impact of these changes.
Smith & Nephews transition plan is in place and implementation has commenced, with changes to internal reporting systems, training and required amendments to financial processes underway.
Management believes that the Group is on track to meet the convergence timetable and throughout 2004 intends to ensure appropriate  to investors.
Based on those standards currentlyin issue and managements understandingof future developments, the major differences in accounting policies which are expected to impact Smith & Nephew are for employee benefits in particular pensions accounting and a requirement for the expensing of all share options granted acquisition goodwill which will no longer be amortised but will be subject to annual testing for impairment and increased recognition of intangible assets arising on acquisition.
In addition, management expects the recognition criteria for deferred tax will change, resulting in a net write back of provisions, principally related to goodwill set-off against reserves.
Although the standards on Financial Instruments have necessitated a change to the process of Smith & Nephews hedging practice and enhancements to documentation, the overall hedging strategy remains essentially unchanged.
Management intends to continue monitoring developments as the standards and .
