Financial Review PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT Net rental income was 189.5 million in 2003 compared with 175.9 million in 2002.
Within net rental income, 3.3 million related to turnover rent and there was 8.8 million of accrued rent receivable allocated to rent free periods.
An analysis of net rental income is shown below: 2003 2002 m m Properties owned throughout 2003 and 2002 142.6 133.4 Acquisitions 28.6 13.7 Developments 5.0 2.7 Properties sold 13.3 30.3 Exchange translation and other 4.2 189.5 175.9 Administration expenses in 2003 rose by 0.5 million to 24.8 million, although 2002 included 2.6 million for rationalisation costs at Grantchester.
Increased staff costs and professional fees relating to tax restructuring in France were the principal reasons for the increase.
The groups net financing costs were 78.7 million in 2003 compared with 66.0 million in 2002, reflecting higher levels of debt following the purchase in late 2002 of Grantchester and other acquisitions and the holding costs of completed developments.
The average cost of borrowing was 6.0% compared with 6.1% in 2002.
Interest cover was 1.8 times compared with 1.9 times in 2002.
Profit before tax was 67.1 million, after deducting losses on the sale of investment properties of 18.8 million.
This loss arose principally on the sale of the Luisencenter, Darmstadt.
Adjusted profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, was 85.9 million, an increase of 0.4% compared with 2002.
The tax charge in 2003 was 14.8 million, of which 13.1 million was deferred tax.
The current tax charge of 1.7 million represented an effective tax rate of 2.0% on profits before disposals.
The low tax rate was principally due to tax losses available from previous years being offset against UK tax payable for 2003, together with capital allowances and relief for capitalised interest.
Adjusted earnings per share, after excluding losses on disposals and deferred tax, were 29.8 pence compared with 29.2 pence in 2002, an increase of 2.1%.
A final dividend of 11.71 pence per share is proposed which, together with the interim dividend of 5.12 pence per share, makes a total of 16.83 pence per share for the year.
This represents an increase of 6.5% over the total dividend for 2002.
CASH FLOW Cash flow from operating activities was 174 million, with the increase of 26 million compared to 2002 mainly attributable to increased rental income and the favourable timing of working capital receipts and payments.
This increase was largely offset by the additional cost of financing acquisitions and development expenditure.
The cash outflow from acquisitions and other capital expenditure was 441 million, which was more than offset by the proceeds of 556 million from the disposal of assets.
After paying dividends of 44 million there was a cash inflow, before financing, in 2003 of 139 million.
BALANCE SHEET At 31 December 2003, Hammersons investment property portfolio was valued at 3,956 million, compared with 3,908 million at the end of 2002.
The increase arose from capital additions of 364 million, a revaluation surplus of 111 million and exchange translation gains of 109 million, partly offset by the disposal of properties with a book value of 536 million.
The development properties within the investment portfolio were valued at 328 million, 26 million above cost.
Developments are shown at a valuation that is discounted for the estimated costs to complete, including interest, and a profit margin that a potential purchaser might apply.
The group does not intend to dispose of any of its developments prior to their completion.
Adjusted net asset value per share, after excluding deferred tax, increased by 52 pence or 6.9% to 803 pence at the year end.
The portfolio revaluation accounted for 40 pence of this increase, with the balance reflecting exchange translation movements and retained profits.. 01 Financial Review BORROWINGS At 31 December 2003, the groups borrowings were 1,772 million.
Undrawn committed facilities at the same date were 182 million.
The weighted average maturity of borrowings at 31 December 2003 was approximately eight years.
During the year, secured borrowings of 184 million were repaid and cancelled, so that at the year end 99% of debt was unsecured.
With cash and deposits of 187 million, net debt amounted to 1,585 million.
Gearing at 31 December 2003 was 73% compared with 81% at the end of 2002.
The market value of borrowings at the year end was 1,940 million, some 168 million greater than the book value, equivalent, after tax relief, to 42 pence per share.
During 2003, the margin above government bonds of Hammersons bonds fell significantly which had the effect of increasing the market value of debt by 42 million.
In February 2004, Hammerson issued 300 million 6% unsecured bonds maturing in 2026.
The proceeds of the issue have been swapped into floating rate debt, currently at a rate of 5.2%.
As a result of this issue, the average maturity of the groups debt has increased to ten years.
RETURN ON SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY At 9.3%, Hammersons return on equity was above the groups estimated cost of equity of 8.0%.
The principal reason for this was the uplift in value of the property portfolio.
Over the last three years the group has achieved an average return on equity of 7.3%.
TAXATION At the end of 2002, the French Government announced new regulations enabling real estate companies listed in Paris to elect for the Socits dInvestissements Immobiliers Ctes SIIC tax status, under which property income and capital gains are exempt from French tax.
Hammerson is applying for a listing of its shares on the Premier March of Euronext, Paris, the French Stock Exchange.
Such a listing, provided it is obtained by 30 April 2004, will enable Hammerson and its French subsidiaries to elect for SIIC tax status.
It is envisaged that elections will be made, with retrospective effect from 1 January 2004, covering all the groups properties in France with the exception of 9 place Vendme, Paris.
Hammersons elected French subsidiaries will be required to pay a one-off exit charge, payable in four equal annual instalments, calculated at 16.5% of their latent capital gains at the time they enter the SIIC regime.
There is an additional requirement that Hammerson plc continues to be a French-listed property investment business for ten years to avoid the charge being recalculated at full rates.
The elected French subsidiaries will be required to pay dividends equal to 85% of their net accounting profit on income and 50% of their net accounting capital gains on disposals.
However, the dividend payment obligations of the French subsidiaries will be reduced by interest and depreciation.
These intercompany dividends will, when received, be taxed in the UK.
Hammerson plc will be under an obligation to pay dividends at least equal to the intercompany dividends received but, in the foreseeable future, the amounts are expected to be small and therefore will not affect the Companys dividend policy.
If elections are made, the following effects on the groups 2004 accounts are anticipated: Provision for exit tax of approximately 70 million 100 million, payable in four equal annual instalments with the first payment in December 2004.
The write back of previously provided deferred tax of approximately 45 million 64 million.
The exit tax of 70 million will be accounted for as a charge in the profit and loss account of 45 million and a charge in the statement of recognised gains and losses of 25 million.
The release of 45 million of deferred tax will be credited in the profit and loss account.
Pro forma shareholders funds following these two adjustments would be: Pence per million share Shareholders funds at 31 December 2003 2,168 784 Exit tax payable 70 25 Deferred tax provision no longer required 45 16 Pro forma shareholders funds at 31 December 2003 2,143 775 In addition to the deferred tax release, the groups contingent tax liability as at 31 December 2003 would be reduced by approximately 121 million.
Therefore, taking the 45 million deferred tax release and the 121 million contingent tax reduction net of the 70 million exit charge, Hammersons pro forma triple net NAV would increase by 96 million or 35 pence per share.. 02 Financial Review INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS With effect from 1 January 2005, all companies quoted in the European Union will be required to adopt IFRS.
Hammerson will continue to report under UK Accounting Standards up to and including 31 December 2004, but will move to IFRS in 2005.
The International Accounting Standards Board is in the process of finalising the standards that must be adopted in 2005 and has stated that this work will be completed by the end of March 2004.
If the adopted standards are substantially unchanged from the existing proposals, they will have a significant impact on Hammersons financial statements.
It is likely that the main changes will include the recognition of property revaluation surpluses and deficits in the income statement rather than the statement of recognised gains and losses: the inclusion in the balance sheet of contingent tax that may arise on the disposal of properties: and the treatment of certain leasehold property interests as finance leases rather than investment properties.
There remain areas of uncertainty which have not yet been resolved.
These include the application of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and guidance from the Inland Revenue on the tax implications of the adoption of IFRS.
Hammerson will continue to monitor developments and manage the transition to IFRS and will provide more information on the impact on its financial statements as it approaches the change.
URGENT ISSUES TASK FORCE UITF ABSTRACT 38 ACCOUNTING FOR ESOP TRUSTS UITF 38 was issued in December 2003 changing the accounting treatment for a companys own shares held for Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs.
The UITF requires that such shares be included in the balance sheet as a deduction from shareholders funds rather than held as an asset.
Comparative figures have been restated and net assets have been reduced by 2.2 million at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account.
TREASURY Hammerson operates a centralised treasury function with clear authorities for the implementation of the treasury objectives and policies adopted by the Board.
The treasury department operates as a cost centre and not as a profit centre and there are internal controls to ensure that no transactions can be undertaken on a speculative basis.
Regular reports are produced, which enable management to monitor and control treasury activities closely.
Policies and practices followed to achieve these objectives are as follows: Debt management The group aims to borrow on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant to maintain operational flexibility.
Management arranges the groups borrowings to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and maintain short term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are most appropriate.
Short term funding is principally raised through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Medium and long term debt mainly comprises the groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to floating rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the groups ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
Foreign currency management The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring foreign currency denominated assets with foreign currency borrowings.
The group borrows in euros as well as using currency swaps as an alternative means of matching foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
Profit and loss account and balance sheet management The group operates internal guidelines for interest cover and gearing.
Management monitors the groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Cash management Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the groups operational requirements.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.. 03
