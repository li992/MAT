Underlying results, excluding the effects of a 7.3 million surplus on the sale of the credit card portfolio and 5.6 million costs relating to certain branch closures are set out in the table below.
On an underlying basis, profit before tax increased by 18.1% to 385.2 million and profit after tax increased by 19.1% to 273.5 million.

The adjustment to total income relates to the surplus on sale of the credit card portfolio.
Non-recurring expenses in 2003 relate to the cost of closure of certain branches.
The covenant to The Northern Rock Foundation has been adjusted for the effects of 1 and 2 above.
Reported earnings per share grew to 66.6p in 2003 2002 - 55.6p, an increase of 19.8%, with underlying earnings per share growing 19.2% to 66.3p.
Assets under management, including loans and advances subject to securitisation, at 31 December 2003 amounted to 52.0 billion, an increase of 24.0% 2002 - 41.9 billion.
The balance sheet, including the securitised bonds shown as a deduction from assets grew by 13.8% to 37.2 billion 2002 - 32.7 billion.
TOTAL INCOME 2003 2002 m m Net interest income 450.7 391.2 Other income 201.7 169.8 Total underlying income 652.4 561.0 Surplus on sale of credit card portfolio 7.3 - Total income 659.7 561.0 Total income : mean total assets underlying 1.87% 1.90% Total income : mean total assets 1.89% 1.90% Total income : mean assets under management underlying 1.39% 1.54% Total income : mean assets under management 1.40% 1.54% 33 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Total reported income in 2003 amounted to 659.7 million 2002 - 561.0 million, an increase of 17.6%.
Excluding the surplus on the sale of the credit card portfolio of 7.3 million, underlying total income amounted to 652.4 million an increase of 16.3%.
On the same basis, total income as a proportion of mean total assets at 1.87% improved slightly compared with the 1.85% reported in the first half of 2003 and shows only a slight reduction from 1.90% for 2002.
The ratio of underlying total income to mean total assets under management at 1.39% for the year was stable compared with 1.38% for the first half of the year as expected, having eased from 1.54% in 2002 following the rapid growth in assets under management.
MARGINS 2003 2002 m m Interest receivable 2,153.8 1,832.1 Interest payable 1,703.1 1,440.9 450.7 391.2 Average interest earning assets 46,435.1 36,035.5 Average interest bearing liabilities 45,570.6 35,207.6 Interest margin 0.97% 1.09% Interest spread 0.90% 0.99% Interest receivable and payable represent amounts reported in the Profit and Loss account, adjusted to transfer securitisation interest payable to interest payable, and include income from equity shares and other variable yield securities in interest receivable.
Average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities include assets subject to securitisation and non-recourse finance and average interest earning assets include equity shares and other variable yield securities.
In 2003 interest margin and spread were 0.97% and 0.90% respectively compared with 1.00% and 0.92% in the first half of the year 2002 - 1.09% and 0.99%.
During the second half of 2003 spreads on lending were stable compared with the first half, consistent with the mix of lending volumes.
Liability spreads were, however, adversely affected by the relationship between money market interest rates and bank base rate resulting in a net increase in our cost of funding.
The differential in rates is expected to return to more normal levels in the current year as evidenced by the reduction in swap rates towards the end of 2003 and reductions in money market rates seen in early 2004.

Total operating expenses amounted to 199.9 million.
Excluding one off costs of 5.6 million, underlying operating expenses amounted to 194.3 million 2002 - 169.0 million.
Costs in 2003 include the effects of head office expansion, extra resources in our enhanced retention programme, the costs of running the Legal & General banking operations acquired in 2002 as well as additional pension and national insurance costs.
34 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued During 2003 underlying operating expenses increased by 15.0%, assets under management increased by 24.0% and underlying total income by 16.3%.
We have again achieved our strategic objectives of growing our underlying cost base at no more than one half to two thirds the growth in assets under management and less than the growth in total income.
As a result, our underlying cost to income ratio fell to 29.8% 2002 - 30.1% and our underlying ratio of cost to assets under management fell to 0.41% 2002 - 0.46%.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY - THE NORTHERN ROCK FOUNDATION Northern Rock donates 5% of pre tax profit to The Northern Rock Foundation under a deed of covenant.
Such donations are used to support community and charitable causes mainly in the North East of England and Cumbria.
The donation from 2003 profits amounts to 19.3 million 2002 - 16.3 million, resulting in almost 100 million having been distributed since its inception in 1997 as an integral part of Northern Rocks conversion to a plc.
PROVISIONS FOR BAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBTS The arrears position of our residential mortgage book has further improved despite the growth in mortgages under management.
At 31 December 2003 there were 2,414 2002 - 2,737 accounts three months or more in arrears representing only 0.45% 2002 - 0.56% of all mortgage accounts, less than half the UK average at 30 June 2003 of 0.96%.
The together secured advances default performance has also remained robust as the portfolio matures, with three months plus arrears at 0.77% at 31 December 2003 2002 - 0.74% which is also significantly below the UK average for all mortgages.
At 31 December 2003 there were 179 properties were in possession compared with 170 at the end of 2002.
Other loan portfolios continue to perform extremely well, with only 0.53% of our commercial loans 2002 - 0.60% and 0.98% of our personal unsecured loans 2002 - 1.30% three months or more in arrears.
The together unsecured loans continued to perform better than traditional personal unsecured loans with only 0.80% three months or more in arrears at 31 December 2003 2002 - 0.69%.
The charge for provisions for bad and doubtful debts amounted to 48.7 million for the year 2002 - 43.1 million representing 0.19% of mean advances to customers 2002 - 0.19%.
The combination of high quality lending, low interest rates, low arrears and strong house price inflation have continued to contain the levels of specific provisions required for residential mortgages.
Provisions for the other secured lending portfolio have been maintained consistent with performance and expected economic conditions for this sector.
The growth in provision balances against our personal credit portfolios reflects growth in balances, the maturing nature of the portfolios and our continued prudent provisioning policy.
As a result, general provisions as a proportion of total provision balances for these portfolios increased to 51% 2002 - 38% and total provision cover increased to 1.70% 2002 - 1.64%.
Total provisions against our personal credit portfolios are considered appropriate given the potential risks facing this sector.
TAXATION The corporation tax charge for the year as a percentage of profit before tax was 29.0% 2002 - 29.6%, compared with the standard corporation tax rate for the year of 30%.
The difference is explained as follows: % Standard corporation tax rate for 2003 30.0 Effect of non-allowable provisions and permanent timing differences 0.14 Adjustment to prior year tax provisions 1.14 Effective tax rate 29.0 LENDING During 2003 Northern Rock achieved record levels of total lending.
Total gross lending was 17,315 million, an increase of 37.6% 2002 - 12,584 million, with total net lending of 8,514 million, an increase of 27.1% 2002 - 6,697 million.
Prospects for 2004 are good, with an opening pipeline of 3.9 billion 2003 opening - 3.5 billion.
The residential lending market remained buoyant during 2003 with record levels of both gross and net lending.
House price inflation finished the year at around 15%, down from 25% seen in the previous year.
During 2003 the low interest rate environment continued and affordability in terms of debt servicing costs remained good.
In addition, realistic credit assessment continued to provide safeguards for Northern Rock against the dangers of borrowers overstretching their finances.
Competition remained strong throughout the year, mainly from established lenders.
35 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued We achieved gross residential lending of 15,212 million 2002 - 10,524 million and net residential lending of 7,861 million 2002 - 5,707 million, representing increases of 44.5% and 37.7% respectively.
Our market share of gross residential lending was 5.6% and our market share of net residential lending was 8.2%.
Our share of redemptions was 4.1%, significantly lower than our closing share of mortgage stock of 4.8%.
This was due to our retention process and our transparent policy allowing existing customers, subject to contractual terms, to transfer their loan to any product available to new borrowers.
Despite strong growth in new lending, our risk profile has improved.
The proportion of lending to first time buyers reduced to 23% 2002 - 26% with 77% of new customers having a proven payment track record.
The average Loan to Value ratio LTV of new lending in 2003 remained similar to 2002 at around 75%, with an improved 71% 2002 - 61% of new lending below 90% LTV.
The average indexed LTV of our mortgage book is now 55%, providing strong cover in the event of default.
We have minimal exposure to large loans with only around 4% of new loans over 500,000 and we maintained an excellent geographic spread of lending.
We offer customers a wide range of innovative and attractive products including lifestyle products and price-led products.
Our together family of products, which combines a secured and unsecured loan at one interest rate and one monthly payment, remained popular.
Gross lending of together products amounted to 4.0 billion of which 3.5 billion were advances secured on residential property representing 25% of new residential lending, excluding further advances, an increase over the first half proportion of 22%.
Outstanding balances of together mortgages remained a constant proportion of our mortgage portfolio throughout 2003, and as house price growth slows and first time buyers return to the market we expect it to gently increase.
Home Equity Release Mortgages HERM, aimed at homeowners aged over 60 who wish to utilise equity in their homes to improve their quality of life, accounted for 474 million of new residential lending, an increase of 75% compared with 2002.
In total our lifestyle products, which are margin enhancing, represented around 30% of our gross new residential lending.
Of our traditional price-led mortgage products, fixed-rate mortgages remained the most popular with 46% of total new lending accounted for by short term fixed products, up to two years, and 10% by longer term fixes up to a maximum of seven years.
As fixed rate pricing increased during the second half of the year, in line with swap rates, demand for discount and tracker products noticeably increased.
This resulted in fixed rate lending being less than 50% of new mortgage lending in the second half of 2003, compared with 62% in the first half of the year.
Given the economic background, we have remained cautious in the expansion of our commercial lending portfolio.
Gross lending in the second half of the year was similar to the first half, resulting in gross lending for the year of 409 million 2002 - 406 million.
An increase in redemptions in the second half resulted in moderate net advances of 84 million for the full year 2002 - 196 million.
In the first half of 2003 growth of our personal credit portfolios was deliberately constrained.
In addition, in the first half we improved the risk profile of our personal credit portfolios following the sale of our 217 million credit card book.
In the second half, we were able to increase our volume of gross lending at the same time as constraining redemptions, resulting in an overall growth in outstanding balances.
During 2003 gross unsecured lending amounted to 1,694 million 2002 - 1,654 million with net lending of 569 million 2002 - 794 million.
At 31 December 2003 our unsecured lending balances were 3,293 million 2002 - 2,941 million of which 48.7% 2002 - 48.9% represented together unsecured advances.
RETAIL FUNDING Total retail deposit balances for the year increased by 1,007 million to 16.3 billion 2002 - 15.3 billion, an increase of 6.6%.
his increase comprised a net inflow of retail funds for the year of 578 million plus interest credited of 429 million.
The funding during the year was largely due to flows of new funds into our Tracker Online account, ISAs and fixed rate bonds.
These are all contractual accounts where the transparency of terms and conditions provides clarity for the customer and less volatility for us to manage.
On-line balances, including those off-shore, now account for over 3.1 billion of our retail deposit base.
Balances in our Ireland based operation have risen to 531 million, with 1,875 million in our Guernsey based off-shore vehicle.
36 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW continued NON-RETAIL FUNDING Total net non-retail funding for the year amounted to 3,317 million with balances at 31 December 2003 amounting to 17.0 billion 2002 - 13.7 billion.
Our non-retail funding provides a balanced mixture of short and medium term funding with increasing diversification of our global investor base.
In July 2003 Moodys confirmed an upgrade to our long-term credit rating from A2 to A1, which will further benefit diversification and the cost of funding.
During 2003 several notable transactions were successfully concluded, contributing to the 3.6 billion of medium term funds raised during the year.
We completed the first benchmark senior fixed rate Euro transaction for a single A rated UK financial institution raising 750 million.
In October 2003 we raised US$600 million of Floating Rate Notes achieving 40% placement with Asian investors.
In May 2003 we signed a 750 million syndicated revolving loan facility which at the time was the largest plain vanilla term facility ever established by a UK financial institution.
We intend, subject to market conditions and regulatory approval, to strengthen our funding this year with the introduction of a covered bond programme.
SECURITISATION Funding through securitisation has remained an integral part of Northern Rocks funding strategy.
During 2003 three issues were completed raising 7.7 billion.
Diversification of our investor base has continued with over 70% of the securitised bonds in 2003 being issued in Continental Europe and the United States.
The characteristics of the mortgages securitised, in terms of product type, LTV and geographic distribution remain similar to those of our on-balance sheet mortgages, ensuring that we are maintaining the quality of our balance sheet.
On a comparable basis, the average rate of interest earned on our on-balance sheet mortgages is a few basis points more than on the securitised mortgages: primarily reflecting the retention of higher margin HERM loans and pre-1995 loans on-balance sheet.
At 31 December 2003 assets under management subject to securitisation amounted to 15.7 billion 2002 - 9.8 billion, representing 36% 2002 - 29% of our total lending portfolios.
Already in the current year we have completed a very well received 3.5 billion securitisation of residential mortgages.
Our programmes will continue to be developed with further issues during 2004.
SALE OF CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO On 30 May 2003, the Group sold its credit card portfolio to The Co-operative Bank.
The surplus on sale amounted to 7.3 million and is recorded in other income.
The credit card portfolio comprised approximately 90,000 accounts with outstanding balances of 217 million.
As part of the agreement Northern Rock will offer credit cards, issued by The Co-operative Bank, to Northern Rock customers under the Northern Rock brand.
DIVIDENDS The interim dividend paid in October 2003 was 7.5p per share.
The proposed final dividend of 15.8p per share is payable on 28 May 2004 to shareholders on the register on 30 April 2004.
This results in a total dividend payable for the year of 23.3p per share 2002 - 20.2p an increase of 15.3%.
CAPITAL At 31 December 2003 total capital amounted to 2,814 million resulting in a total capital ratio of 14.3%, comfortably above regulatory and internal requirements.
Tier 1 capital was 1,832 million and the Tier 1 ratio 9.3%.
The comparable ratios at 31 December 2002 were 15.5% and 9.4% respectively.
As from the beginning of 2004, we have in place the systems to capture the data for credit risk measurement under Pillar I of Basel II.
During 2004 we will fully integrate them within our business operations.
Also during 2004 we will address the requirements of Pillar II and complete our assessment of our approach to Operational Risk under Pillar I.
Our low risk balance sheet means that we expect to achieve significant reductions to the levels of our total regulatory risk weighted assets for credit exposures compared to current levels.
This should result in future capital efficiencies.

Our strategic targets of growth in assets under management of 20% 5%, growth in pre-tax profits of 15% 5%, return on equity in the 19%-22% range, allied to cost growth less than income growth and in the range of half to two-thirds asset under management growth are confirmed for 2004 and beyond.
These targets demonstrate that Northern Rocks virtuous circle strategy is in good shape and continues to support the business performance we anticipate in the current year.
