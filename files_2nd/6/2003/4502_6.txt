Financial Review Financial Results In a challenging year, net profit before taxation, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation was 48.1m, down from 90.6m in the previous year.
Despite difficult trading conditions, we maintained our strong cashflow performance, generating free cash flow of 72.7m before dividends from associates, exceptional cashflows, capital expenditure, acquisitions and share buy back costs closing the year with net cash of 8.2m.
Exceptional Items The net after tax exceptional loss was 39.2m 2002 gain of 15.1m.
Exceptional pre-tax costs of 49.2m were charged to operating profits comprising cash costs of 24.0m and non-cash costs of 25.2m.
Stephen King A summary of the main cash costs and non cash charges are tabulated below: Finance Director Cash Non cash Total m m m Reorganisation Global Services inc. Security Products 12.7 5.9 18.6 Cash Systems 8.5 2.0 10.5 Sequoia 2.8 2.8 24.0 7.9 31.9 CSI Goodwill write-off 16.0 16.0 Loss on impairment of investment in JV 1.3 1.3 Exceptional pre-tax costs 24.0 25.2 49.2 The cash component of the exceptional charge includes 12.7m which will be a cash outflow in 2003 2004.
The non cash charges predominantly relate to the Boards view that the carrying value of goodwill in relation to the Currency Systems International acquisition acquired in May 2001 for 27.0m is impaired as a result of trading experienced since acquisition.
An exceptional write down of 16.0m has been made at the year end, leaving a remaining carrying value of 8.2m which will now be written off over a reduced estimated life of ten years eight years remaining.
The Groups 1.3m investment in Valora a 25 per cent associate has also been impaired reflecting uncertainty over future cash flows.
Cash Flow and Borrowings Cash flow performance was again excellent.
A strong fourth quarter performance led to a reduction of 14.7m in working capital for the year.
Dividends from associates were lower at 9.0m compared with 28.3m last year which included a significant amount relating to retained surpluses from Camelots first licence period.
During the year the Group returned 71.3m to shareholders through the share buy back programme 38m and 33.3m on dividends, including an accelerated payment of our interim dividend for the current year which amounted to an additional 7.9m dividend payments.
Despite this, fide La Rue still closed the year with net cash of 8.2m.
Interest Charge The Groups net interest income was 0.9m including interest received by associates of 0.4m.
Excluding interest received by associates, the Group net interest credit of 0.5m was a 0.9m improvement on the previous year.
Taxation Excluding exceptional items, the underlying effective tax rate was 28.0 per cent 2001 2002 27.6 per cent.
The effective tax rate of 28.0 per cent is currently lower than the standard UK corporate tax rate of 30.0 per cent but in future years is expected to rise as fewer of our Group activities are based in lower rate tax regimes.
Tax payments at 3.7m were 7.5m down on 2001 2002, reflecting a combination of lower UK taxable profits and some prior period tax recoveries.

The Accounting Standards Board has announced subsequently that full implementation of the standard has been deferred in order for a consensus on pensions accounting to be reached with the International Accounting Standards Board.
The Company consequently decided in September 2002 to defer full implementation, but will continue to comply with the transitional arrangements.
The net charge to P&L under FRS 17 for the UK pension scheme would have been 2.4m in the full year compared to the actual charge on a SSAP 24 basis of 1.9m.
The Company is presently amortising the pension scheme surplus identified at the last triennial actuarial valuation in April 2000.
The impact of this amortisation in 2002 2003 was a credit to the profit and loss account of 6.1m.
The next triennial valuation, which will be available later this year, is unlikely to show a surplus, and the amortisation credit will not, therefore, benefit the 2003 2004 results.
In addition, it is likely that the underlying regular pension cost will also increase as a result of the current depressed levels in the world equity markets.
