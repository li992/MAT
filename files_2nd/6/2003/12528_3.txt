In respect of 2003, the group purchased oil price options with floors at a Brent price of $20 bbl and a ceiling price averaging $28.3 bbl, and a small volume of swaps at $23.2 bbl.
Approximately one third of the Indonesian gas production was also covered using zero cost collar options at an equivalent floor price of $20.2 bbl and a ceiling price of $29.5 bbl.
These oil and gas hedges produced a combined loss of 4.0 million in the year 2002: loss 1.4 million.
Hedges for 2004 have been undertaken, almost exclusively with zero cost collars, covering 56 per cent of anticipated liquids production at a floor price of $20 bbl and ceiling price of $29.5 bbl.

Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The Council of the European Union requires all EU listed companies to report consolidated results using endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS with effect from 1 January 2005 including comparatives for 2004.
Premier has set up a project team to manage the implementation: it is looking at all aspects of the requirement including the wider business issues that may arise from such a major change.
Our preliminary view is that differences between our current accounting practices and IFRS will be in respect of deferred tax, accounting for joint ventures, accounting for employee costs, and any other items resulting from ED6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, when endorsed.
We expect the group to be fully prepared for this transition in 2005.
