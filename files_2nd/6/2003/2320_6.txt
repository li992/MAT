Directors are assisted in complying with the internal control requirements of the Combined Code by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales publication Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code the Turnbull guidance.
The board has reviewed the groups corporate governance policies and practice and has determined that the company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code throughout the period.
Board composition Details of the board of directors are shown on page 13 and in the directors report on page 31.
During the year there was a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the company, with Mr J B McGrath as chairman and Mr S G Russell as chief executive of the company.
Mr S G Russell ceased to be chief executive on 31st May 2003, and Mr J B McGrath will act as both chairman and chief executive until 15th September 2003.
On 15th September 2003 Sir Nigel Rudd will become chairman, and Mr R Baker, the new chief executive, will join the company.
The board considers all its non-executive directors to be independent.
Sir Nigel Rudd is the deputy chairman and has also been identified as the senior independent non-executive director.
The board considers that an independent director is one who is independent in character and judgement and where there are no relationships or circumstances which could affect the directors judgement.
Relationships or circumstances which could affect judgement include dependence on the company for his or her primary source of income or being paid by the company in any capacity other than as a non-executive director, having been previously a senior manager of the company, or having had a material relationship with the company or participating in the companys incentive bonus schemes or pension schemes.
Conduct of board meetings The board normally has eight regular meetings in the year plus two further meetings to deal specifically with full year and half year results.
Strategy meetings are convened as required.
A schedule of powers reserved to the board is maintained comprising key events and decisions.
For all board meetings an agenda is established.
For regular meetings this generally comprises reports from the chief executive, chief financial officer and human resources director, reports on the performance of the businesses, major items of strategic expenditure to be approved and other significant policy issues.
The board is also notified of any permissions given to directors and senior managers to deal in the shares of the company under the companys dealing code.
Written reports are provided to the directors in advance of the board meeting.
In addition the board considers at least annually the strategic plans of the group and individual businesses and is provided with other information as requested.
From time to time directors receive presentations from management about key areas of the groups operations.
Full year and interim results are reviewed by the board audit committee and approved by the board prior to publication.
Other price sensitive announcements may be published under the authority of a director.
In the furtherance of their duties, the directors have full access to the services of the company secretary and may take independent professional advice, at cost to the company, subject to a limit of 25,000 and prior notification to the chairman of the audit committee.
The group has a policy of providing corporate governance training for directors on appointment, if this is their first appointment to a public limited company board.
Board committees There are four principal board committees, all of which operate within written terms of reference.
Details of the composition and the main responsibilities of these committees are as follows: Board nominations committee J B McGrath chairman J Bennink Dr J G S Buchanan F M Harrison resigned 6th November 2002 H Ploix Dr M P Read Sir Nigel Rudd The board nominations committee meets as dictated by circumstances and met once during the year.
The main responsibility of the board nominations committee is to consider and make recommendations to the board about the appointment of directors, the standing for reappointment of directors and the structure and composition of the board generally.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 19 Corporate governance Board audit committee Dr J G S Buchanan chairman J Bennink F M Harrison resigned 6th November 2002 H Ploix Dr M P Read Sir Nigel Rudd The board audit committee met twice during the year.
The main responsibilities of the board audit committee are: to review and advise the board on the interim and annual financial statements.

to review the major findings of internal investigations.
The external auditors are appointed annually at the annual general meeting.
The board audit committee considers the reappointment of the auditors and reports its findings to the board.
The board audit committee periodically considers the performance, cost and independence of the external auditors, including a comparison of audit fees with those of other retail and FTSE100 companies and a review of the level of service provided by the audit team throughout the group.
The audit committee also reviews the non-audit work carried out by the auditors to ensure that their independence is not compromised.
The audit firm may perform non-audit work for the group but only when its tender is considered superior to that of other consultants.
A schedule of this non-audit work is provided annually to the board audit committee.
Board remuneration committee Sir Nigel Rudd chairman J Bennink Dr J G S Buchanan F M Harrison resigned 6th November 2002 J B McGrath H Ploix Dr M P Read The board remuneration committee met six times during the year.
The committee, having no members who are executive directors or who have a personal financial interest in matters to be decided, is responsible to the board for determining, on behalf of the board, the remuneration, terms and conditions and bonus schemes for the executive directors, having regard to performance.
A report on the remuneration of directors appears on pages 21 to 28.
Board social responsibilities committee H Ploix chair, appointed 26th March 2003 J Bennink appointed 26th March 2003 Dr J G S Buchanan appointed 26th March 2003 F M Harrison resigned 6th November 2002 Dr M P Read A P Smith The board social responsibilities committee met once during the year.

In addition, a magazine for private investors is produced.
All members of the board usually attend the annual general meeting.
A business presentation is given at the meeting, followed by a question and answer session.
The notice of the meeting together with any related papers is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting, or for those who have elected for electronic communication, notice is given to such shareholders of the availability of documents on the companys website.
Shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on each separate issue.
Postal proxy votes will be counted and summary figures are announced after the vote on show of hands on each item.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 20 Corporate governance Internal control The directors have overall responsibility for the groups system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to the achievement of business objectives.
Such a system can, however, provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Members of the board have responsibility for monitoring the conduct and operations of individual businesses within the group.
This includes the review and approval of business strategies and plans and the setting of key business performance targets.
The executive management responsible for each business are accountable for the conduct and performance of their business within the agreed strategies.
Business plans and budgets provide a framework from which performance commitments have been agreed between the chief executive and each business.
These commitments incorporate financial and strategic targets against which business performance is monitored.
This monitoring includes the examination of and changes to rolling annual and half year forecasts and monthly measurement of actual achievement against key performance targets and plans.
The group has clear requirements for the approval and control of expenditure.
Strategic investment decisions involving both capital and revenue expenditure are subject to formal detailed appraisal and review according to approval levels set by the board.
Operating expenditure is controlled within each business with approval levels for such expenditure being determined by the individual businesses.
Executive management are responsible for the identification, evaluation and management of the significant risks applicable to their areas of business.
These risks are assessed on a regular basis and may be associated with a variety of internal or external sources.
This continuous process has been in place for the year ended 31st March 2003 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts and accords with the Turnbull guidance.
Annually, businesses provide certified statements of compliance with the groups system of internal control, which are supported by assessments of key business risks, controls and resulting exposures.
The internal audit function works throughout the group to further develop, improve and embed risk management processes and tools in the business operations.
It also provides assurance to the board that risk management practices address the key risks faced by the group including risks that could arise from social, environmental and ethical matters.
Its work includes an assessment of the risks and controls throughout the group and its findings are reported to senior management responsible for the area concerned.
Internal audit also reports regularly to the audit committee.
The audit committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, primarily reviewing the reporting of financial and non-financial information to shareholders, the systems of internal control and risk management, and the audit process.
The external auditors and the director of internal audit attend all meetings.
The groups system of internal control is monitored regularly by the board, its committees, the internal audit function, and management.
Social, environmental and ethical matters The board recognises the importance of social, environmental and ethical matters to its business.
Identifying and managing risks to the companys reputation has been described above and has a high priority, and the adoption and implementation of the companys code of ethical trading, described on page 11, has addressed one of the most important of them.
Moreover, the company has for many years recognised the benefits that accrue from responsible employment, environmental and community policies which are also described elsewhere in this report.
The evaluation of the companys performance in social, environmental and ethical matters is ongoing.
Going concern Having considered group cash flow forecasts and strategic plans, the directors are satisfied that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 21 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report This report has been prepared in compliance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and Schedule B of the Combined Code annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The remuneration committee the Committee The members of the Committee during the year were: Sir Nigel Rudd chairman J Bennink Dr J G S Buchanan F M Harrison resigned 6th November 2002 J B McGrath H Ploix Dr M P Read The main responsibilities of the Committee are summarised in the corporate governance statement on page 18.
The Committee appointed Towers Perrin to provide it with external advice in determining the appropriate remuneration, terms and conditions and bonus schemes for directors.
Mr S G Russell, former chief executive, and Mr A P Smith, human resources director, have also advised the Committee when requested.
Towers Perrin has also provided market data for executives and senior managers and consulting support in reviewing pensions and understanding current remuneration trends.
Contracts of service The chairman, Mr J B McGrath, has an agreement with the company dated 18th May 2001 relating to his services as chairman, which is terminable by either party without notice or compensation.
Mr J B McGrath will retire as chairman and from the board on 15th September 2003.
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract or contract for services.
Each director is required to stand for reappointment every three years and may be required to stand for reappointment at an earlier date in order to satisfy the provisions in the companys articles of association requiring not less than one third of the board to seek reappointment at each AGM.
The articles of association of the company contain provisions relating to earlier vacation of office without notice and non-executive directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office.
All executive directors service contracts terminate when the director in question reaches the age of 60.
All serving executive directors service contracts are terminable by the company on one years notice and the Committee has determined that one years notice is the appropriate period of notice to be given to an executive director.
Exceptionally, in circumstances such as the appointment of a chief executive from outside the company, the Committee may consider an initial period of greater security to be appropriate and agree that the one years notice should not be given before the first anniversary of appointment.
The Committee has taken this view in respect of the appointment of Mr R Baker, who will join the company as chief executive on 15th September 2003.
Details of the contracts of executive directors who served during the year are as follows: Date of Unexpired Notice Provision for contract term period compensation P Bateman 25th July 2002 1 year rolling 1 year Nil B Clare 7th April 1999 Terminated on 31st January 2003 1 year Nil H Dodd 4th June 2003 1 year rolling 1 year Nil K S Piggott 25th July 2002 Terminated on 31st December 2002 1 year Nil S G Russell 25th July 2002 Terminated on 31st May 2003 1 year Nil A P Smith 10th April 2001 1 year rolling 1 year Nil D A R Thompson 1st July 1990 Terminated at age 60 on 4th September 2002 1 year Nil Resigned on 31st January 2003.
Resigned from the board on 31st December 2002.
None of the above contracts contain provisions relating to compensation on termination and in the event of any service contract being terminated by the company giving less than the contractual period of notice, the requirement for the director to mitigate their loss where appropriate has been taken into account in determining any resulting compensation.
In the case of Mr R Baker, however, the company has agreed provisions relating to pay in lieu of notice liquidated damages under which if Mr R Bakers contract is terminated with less notice than his contract provides, then he will receive 85% of the salary, pension and short term bonus and other benefits he would have received had he been given the notice to which he was entitled under his contract, but without receiving any compensation for any loss of long term incentives or share options.
Following the announcement in December 2002 that the company was seeking to appoint a new chief executive to succeed Mr S G Russell, the Committee agreed terms with Mr S G Russell under which he would, subject to him remaining in office as chief executive until 31st July 2003, or until such earlier date as the company wished him to step down, receive his pay and benefits until 31st July 2003, and then, on leaving the company, receive 757,732 in compensation for loss of office, being the value of one years salary, short term bonus and car allowance, and be credited with one years additional service in his pension arrangements.
He will also continue to participate in the Long Term Incentive Plan performance periods ending on or before 31st March 2004.
On 31st January 2003 Mr B Clare resigned from the boards of Boots Group PLC and of The Boots Company PLC, and received 528,000 as compensation for loss of office, being the equivalent of nine months salary and the estimated value of other benefits that he would have received had he been given nine months notice.
Mr B Clare, and certain of his dependants, also agreed with the company to surrender their accrued entitlements under the unfunded unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme, in which Mr B Clare had participated since he joined the company for, 1,200,000, being the sum agreed by actuaries as the value of those benefits.
In addition the company met the cost of Mr B Clare receiving legal and financial advice and the cost of providing life cover for nine months equivalent to that to which he would have been entitled under the funded unapproved death benefit scheme in which he participated.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 22 Directors remuneration report Details of the payments agreed with Mr B Clare upon termination of his contract are set out in the emoluments table on page 24.
It is recognised that directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that the additional experience and knowledge that this brings will benefit the company.
Accordingly, the policy is to allow executive directors to accept up to two such appointments where no conflict of interest arises, and to retain the fees received.
Remuneration policies In determining remuneration policies for the current, following and subsequent financial years, the Committee has followed the provisions of Section B of the Combined Code.
Policy in relation to remuneration, and practice, inevitably evolves over time and the policy with regard to future years will be subject to ongoing review by the Committee.
Executive directors salaries and non-executive directors fees have been positioned at the market median in the light of independent assessment of market practices.
The Committee intends that executive directors salaries assuming no change in responsibilities will be increased annually in line with inflation, subject to total pay being benchmarked against the market every three years and that over time the proportion of executive directors total remuneration that is dependent upon performance will become greater.
The committee has also introduced a personal performance measure into the executive directors short term bonus scheme, in addition to the business performance tests.
The terms of the current Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Executive Share Option Plan were approved by the shareholders of The Boots Company PLC in 2001, and at the time were designed to have a value equal to 59.8% of executive directors base pay.
The current short term bonus scheme is likely to increase the percentage of directors total pay dependent upon performance, but using the binomial valuation model, the value of the Executive Share Option Plan has reduced by 10.2% of base pay.
Based upon current estimates of the value of short and long term incentive plans and share option schemes, variable performance based remuneration is likely to form 49.8% of the chief executives total remuneration and 43.6% of other executive directors total remuneration in 2003 04.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or share option schemes.
Bonus schemes provide an opportunity for executive directors to receive additional rewards, if and only if, personal and business performance meets specified objectives and targets.
The way that business performance is measured for bonus and share option schemes for executive directors flows from, and is consistent with, business strategy, and with the boards governing objective of maximising the value of the company for the benefit of shareholders and is described below.
The short term executive bonus scheme rewards executive directors for achieving operating efficiencies and profitable growth in the relevant year by reference to challenging but achievable forecasts derived at the beginning of the year from strategic plans, and from 2003 04, also rewards personal performance.
During 2002 03, the performance criteria were profit after tax and sales growth and a combined bonus of up to 60% of base salary was payable depending upon performance against target.
The maximum short term bonus that can be earned in 2003 04 has been increased from 60% of base salary to in the case of the chief executive 100%, and for all other executive directors 75%.
In 2003 04 one third of the available bonus depends on individual performance against personal targets, and two thirds depends upon business performance targets for sales, profit and return on capital.
The business targets have been chosen for their relevance in driving short term performance of the business.
The long term bonus scheme can provide executive directors with a maximum potential bonus award MPBA worth up to 125% of base salary, and provides a direct link between the pay of executive directors and the creation of value for shareholders by rewarding directors for the companys performance in terms of total shareholder return TSR over a three or four-year performance period relative to a peer group of ten other leading companies which the Committee consider to be appropriate comparators by virtue of their size and markets in which they operate.
TSR was chosen as the appropriate performance measure for the LTIP as it aligns the interests of the executive with the actual return received by shareholders.
For the performance cycles which commenced in 1999 and thereafter a MPBA is calculated for all executive directors by multiplying the basic annual salary at the beginning of the cycle by a factor of 125%.
The MPBA is then expressed in share units using the average share price over the previous three months.
At the end of the performance cycle a percentage of the MPBA is gained based on the TSR performance against a peer group of ten other leading companies.
The scale applied is: Comparative position in peer group league table 1 2 3 456789 10 11 % of MPBA gained 100 80 64 48 36 24 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil The value of the award is affected by share price movement over the performance period.
Performance cycles commence on 1st April.
The performance cycles that commenced in 1999 and 2000 were four-year cycles.
For these performance cycles, one half of the award is paid in cash after the end of each performance cycle and one half in shares.
The value of the cash bonus is calculated by multiplying one half of the number of earned share units by the average share price over the last three months of the performance cycle, as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
No performance cycle commenced in 2001 and the performance cycles which commenced in 2002 and thereafter are three-year cycles.
For these cycles the whole of the award is payable in shares.
The peer group is reviewed before each performance cycle to maintain its relevance.
For the three-year period from 1st April 2003 the relevant peer group is: Alliance UniChem Reckitt Benckiser Debenhams J Sainsbury Great Universal Stores Smith & Nephew Kingfisher Tesco Marks & Spencer WHSmith Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 23 Directors remuneration report Under the Executive Share Option Plan executive directors and other employees can be granted options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the company.
The maximum number of options that can be granted under the plan to any executive director in any financial year of the company is options having an exercise price of twice the annual basic salary of the director.
Grants are not normally expected to exceed one times annual salary.
Options granted to executive directors must be subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
The Executive Share Option Plan aligns returns to shareholders with reward to executives but only if share price growth is achieved and if a performance target is met.
The value of the options is directly linked to share price movement.
The condition imposed in respect of all options granted to date is average annual growth in earnings per share EPS over the relevant period at least equal to the increase in the index of retail prices 3% calculated as follows: Base EPS is the EPS for the financial year preceding the performance cycle.
An EPS target is calculated each year by applying the following formula: Base EPS x 100 increase in RPI y where y is 3 in year one, 6 in year two and 9 in year three and so on.
Target EPS for the performance cycle is determined by taking the average of the annual EPS targets during that cycle.
If the average of the actual EPS over the performance cycle equals or is greater than the target EPS, the performance condition is met.
If the performance condition is not met, performance is re-tested annually until the end of the sixth year using the same methodology.
If the performance condition has still not been met at the end of the sixth year, the options lapse.
The EPS performance measure in the share option scheme was chosen because it provides an absolute as opposed to relative financial measure of company performance and complements the TSR performance measure in the LTIP.
RPI is taken from the index published in March each year, and EPS is calculated in accordance with FRS14 Earnings Per Share.
The Committee believes that share ownership provides an effective way to align the interests of shareholders and executives.
For all performance periods commencing on or after 1st April 2002 the whole of an executive directors long term bonus is payable in shares of the company: the executive directors participate in a share option plan, and the Committee has adopted a policy of requiring executive directors over time to achieve a holding in the companys shares having a value equivalent to their base salary.
Share options granted under the SAYE share option scheme are not subject to performance conditions and, given the all employee nature of the scheme and its revenue-approved status, it would not be appropriate to do so.
The Committee does not currently intend to propose any amendments to the executive share option or long term bonus schemes.
It is the practice of the board to maintain contact where appropriate with its major shareholders about remuneration issues.
Performance graph The following graph, required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, shows the total shareholder return over the five-year period to 31st March 2003 for the companys shares and the FTSE100 index.
The FTSE100 is considered to be an appropriate index for comparison as the company forms part of that index, investors in the company are likely to regard other FTSE100 companies as alternative investments, and investors are familiar with it.

Entitlements based on completed long term bonus periods Outcome of the 1999 2003 performance cycle At the end of the cycle for the four-year period up to 31st March 2003 the relevant peer group was identical to that shown on page 22.
For this cycle, the company achieved position 9 in the league table.
Accordingly, no long term bonus was earned by executive directors in respect of periods while serving as such 2002 nil.
However Mr K S Piggott earned a bonus derived from a long term bonus scheme for Halfords in respect of service before he became an executive director.
The earned bonus is shown in the table below and will be paid in June 2003.
Half will be paid in cash and the remaining half will be paid as a grant of a share award.
The share price used to determine the MPBA was 927p and the share price used to determine the value of the cash half was 602p which in this case was the average share price for the three months ended 30th August 2002, the date of sale of Halfords.

Performance conditions are set out on page 22.
Share Options The Executive Share Option Plan An explanation of the way the plan operates is shown on pages 22 and 23.
The exercise price of options granted under the scheme is the average of the market value of the shares in the three days preceding the grant of an option.
The rules of the plan allow the exercise of options in the period between 3 and 10 years from grant, subject to prior satisfaction of any performance condition stipulated at the time of grant.
Upon exercise, the benefit received by the participant is derived from the increase in the market value of the companys shares in the period between grant and exercise.
Gains arising from the exercise of share options are set out below.
Executive share options may be exercised following termination of employment by reason of redundancy or retirement or in such other circumstances of termination of employment as the Committee approves, before the expiry of the initial three-year period subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions over the shorter period.
The Boots SAYE Share Option Scheme Under a savings-related scheme options may be offered to employees, including executive directors, enabling employees to subscribe for ordinary shares in the company at approximately 80% of the market price of those shares at the date of grant, subject to participation in a designated savings scheme.
No options have been granted since July 1999, but certain executive directors hold options under that scheme as follows: At 31 March At 31 March Exercise Earliest date Expiry 2002 Awarded Exercised Lapsed 2003 price of exercise date B Clare @485p 3,216 3,216 K S Piggott @588p 1,173 1,173 K S Piggott @808p 341 341 01 09 03 29 02 04 K S Piggott @624p 324 324 01 10 04 31 03 05 S G Russell @624p 2,704 2,704 01 10 04 31 03 05 A P Smith @624p 1,552 1,552 D A R Thompson @588p 1,760 1,760 The market price of the companys shares at 31st March 2003 was 530.5p and the range of market prices during the year was 492p to 725p.
Directors interests in share options on 26th May 2003 remain unchanged.
Gains on share options Gains on share options represent the number of shares under options which have been exercised, valued at the difference between the market price at the date of exercise and the exercise price paid.
The total gains on share options exercised during the year was nil 2002 3,000.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 27 Directors remuneration report All Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP In the period to 31st March 2001 Boots established an AESOP to enable staff, including executive directors, to become shareholders in the company.
Under the free share part of the plan, the executive directors were each given the opportunity to be awarded 39 shares 42 in 2001, the same number as any employee with average contracted hours of 35 or more per week.
All the eligible executive directors except for Mr D A R Thompson opted to receive this award.
Mr P Bateman and Mr H Dodd were not eligible as they had not completed 12 months service.
Shares in this part of the AESOP must normally be held in trust on behalf of the employees for at least three years.
In the period to 31st March 2002 Boots implemented the partnership share element of the plan, giving employees including executive directors the opportunity to purchase shares from their pre-tax income, subject to a maximum of 125 per month, with effect from April 2002.
Shares purchased under the partnership plan are included in total shareholdings in the table below.
Directors shareholdings The beneficial interests of the directors in office at 31st March 2003 and their families in the share capital of the company at 31st March 2003 are shown below.
The companys register of directors interests, which is open to inspection, contains full details of directors interests in the companys shares.

No director holds any loan capital.
The personal shareholdings of directors in office at 31st March 2003 remain unchanged on 26th May 2003, other than each of Mr P Bateman, Mr H Dodd and Mr A P Smith now hold a further 21 shares purchased under the partnership share element of the AESOP, and the number of shares held by Boots QUEST Trustee Limited, the Boots ESOP Trust Ltd and the Boots Share Plan Trustees have reduced, thereby reducing directors deemed interest.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 28 Directors remuneration report Pension entitlement All executive directors in office at 31st March 2003 receive pension entitlements from the companys principal UK defined benefit pension scheme, referred to in note 26, and supplementary pension arrangements which provide additional benefits aimed at producing a pension of two-thirds final base salary at normal retirement age, subject to completing 20 years service.
Non-executive directors are not members of any company pension arrangements.
Pension entitlement is calculated only on the salary element of remuneration.
Those directors who are subject to the earnings cap are also members of an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement which provides similar benefits on basic salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Details of pensions earned by the executive directors in office at 31st March 2003 or at date of retirement are shown below: Transfer value of net-of-inflation Increase in Increase in Increase in increase in pension during pension during Transfer value Transfer value transfer value of accrued Accrued the year to the year to of accrued of accrued benefits benefits less pension at 31st March 2003 31st March 2003 benefits at benefits at less directors directors 000 31 March 2003 gross of inflation net of inflation 31st March 2002 31st March 2003 contributions contributions P Bateman 21 13 13 96 295 187 175 B Clare 38 3 2 1,425 584 82 18 H Dodd 999 98 83 83 K S Piggott 203 13 10 2,933 3,446 498 154 S G Russell 377 27 21 5,936 7,009 1,045 370 A P Smith 42 10 8 344 504 147 88 D A R Thompson 316 7 2 5,605 6,085 470 22 The total accrued pension entitlement for Mr S G Russell, the highest paid director, at 31st March 2002 was 349,000.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
Retained benefits from previous employments are taken into account.
The increase in accrued pension during the year is after deducting the increase due to inflation, at the rate of 1.7%, on the previous years accrued pension.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Mr B Clare left the company on 31st January 2003 taking a deferred pension in respect of his approved benefits.
A payment of 1.2m was made to him and his dependants in lieu of benefits they had accrued in the unapproved arrangement.

Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 37 Accounting policies Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the group and company financial statements except as noted below.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention, modied to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings.
However, compliance with SSAP19 Accounting for investment properties requires a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to the depreciation of investment properties as described in note 11 to the financial statements.
A separate profit and loss account for the company has not been presented as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
In May 2002, the group signalled that following the reorganisation to create a more integrated business, it would use a new segmental analysis to present its financial results.
Restated gures on the revised segmental basis are shown in note 1 to the financial statements.
Consolidation The group financial statements combine the results of the company and all its subsidiaries and joint ventures, to the extent of group ownership and after eliminating intra-group transactions.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Joint ventures are those undertakings, not recognised as subsidiaries, in which the group has a participating interest and are jointly controlled.
The groups share of the results of joint ventures, which are accounted for under the gross equity method, are included in the profit and loss account and its share of their net assets is included in investments in the group balance sheet.
In the company balance sheet, investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost being the par value of shares issued where merger relief applies less impairments.
During the year Boots Group PLC formerly Halfords Group PLC was introduced as the new holding company of the Boots Group by way of a Scheme of Arrangement under section 425 of the Companies Act 1985.
This has been accounted for as a capital reorganisation and merger accounting principles have been applied, as if the company had always been the holding company of the group.
Foreign currencies The results and cash ows of overseas subsidiaries and the results of joint ventures are translated into sterling on an average exchange rate basis, weighted by the actual results of each month.
Assets and liabilities including currency swaps are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries, less offsetting exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings and currency swaps hedging those assets net of any related tax effects, are dealt with through reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The cost of the company investment in shares in overseas subsidiaries is stated at the rate of exchange in force at the date each investment was made, except where hedge accounting applies in which case the year end rate is used.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 38 Accounting policies Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill on acquisitions comprises the excess of the fair value of the consideration for investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Fair values are attributed to the identiable assets and liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are also made to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the group.
The costs of integrating and reorganising acquired businesses are charged to the post-acquisition profit and loss account.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1st April 1998 has been set off against reserves.
On disposal of such businesses, any goodwill previously set off against reserves is charged in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
For subsequent acquisitions goodwill is recognised within xed assets in the year in which it arises and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, generally not exceeding 20 years.
The cost of intangible assets acquired which are capitalised only if separately identiable is not amortised except where the end of the useful economic lives of the acquired intangible asset can be reasonably foreseen.
Similar assets created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
The carrying value of intangible assets including in particular those being amortised over periods greater than 20 years is reviewed annually and any impairment in value charged to the profit and loss account.
Tangible xed assets and depreciation Depreciation of tangible xed assets is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less residual value, by equal instalments over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Freehold land, investment properties, assets in the course of construction not depreciated Freehold and long leasehold buildings, including shops with physical lives of more than 50 years depreciated to their estimated residual values over their useful economic lives of not more than 50 years Short leasehold properties remaining period of lease when less than 50 years Computer equipment including software 3 to 8 years Motor cars 4 or 5 years Other motor vehicles 3 to 10 years Fixtures and plant 3 to 20 years Any impairment in the value of xed assets is recognised immediately.
The company adopted the transitional provisions of FRS15 Tangible Fixed Assets to retain the book value of land and buildings many of which were last revalued in 1993 and has not adopted a policy of annual revaluations for the future.
Investment properties are revalued annually and included in the balance sheet at their open market value adjusted to exclude the benefit of formal lease arrangements with group companies.
To qualify as an investment property, over 50% of rental income from the property must derive from non-group tenants.
profits and losses arising from the disposal of properties which have previously been revalued are calculated by reference to their carrying value.
Interest is capitalised on tangible xed assets in the course of construction or development.
The capitalisation rate applied depends on whether the construction is nanced by a specic borrowing based on actual interest rate or whether it is nanced by general borrowings based on the weighted average rate on all non-specic borrowings.
Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash ow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year other than cash, government securities and investments in money managed funds.
Derivative financial instruments During the year the group reviewed its accounting policy for hedging instruments.
The effect of adopting the new policy on the current and prior year is shown in note 5.
The new policy is as follows: Where the group holds financial instruments as a hedge against interest rate exposure and the hedge is effective, gains and losses on the derivative are recognised in the same reporting statement and the same period as changes in the value of cash ows of the hedged item.
If a hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, the resulting gain or loss is recognised in full in the period in which it is sold, terminated or exercised only if the group no longer has the related hedged item.
Where financial instruments are held which are not hedges, provision is made in full for all anticipated losses, and profits are recognised when realised in both cash and in economic terms.
Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 39 Accounting policies Turnover Turnover comprises sales to external customers excluding VAT and other sales taxes and rental income.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises purchase cost of goods, direct labour and those overheads related to manufacture and distribution based on normal activity levels.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development, other than on buildings and plant, is charged against profit in the year in which it is incurred.
Pensions The company and its UK subsidiaries operate pension schemes under which contributions by employees and by the companies are held in trust funds separated from the companies nances.
Actuarial valuations of the schemes are conducted at three year intervals and include a review of contributions.
The cost of providing pensions is spread over the employees working lives with the companies.
The cost charged to the profit and loss account in any year may not always equal the employer contributions to the pension schemes.
Leases The rental costs of properties and other assets held under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis.
Benets received as an incentive to sign a lease, whatever form they may take, are credited to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term or, if shorter than the full lease term, over the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate.
The cost of assets held under finance leases being leases which give rights to the group approximating to ownership is included under tangible xed assets and depreciation is provided in accordance with the policy for the class of asset concerned.
The corresponding obligations under these leases are shown as creditors.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account to produce, or approximate to, a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the outstanding obligations.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date except as allowed by FRS19 Deferred Tax as detailed below.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
No provision is made for taxation liabilities which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures as there is no commitment to remit these profits.
It is not anticipated that any significant taxation will become payable on the revaluation surplus or sale of properties, as taxation on gains on properties used for the purpose of the groups trade is expected to be deferred indefinitely or eliminated by capital losses.

Boots Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 43 Notes relating to the financial statements 4 Acquisition and disposal of businesses i Acquisitions All businesses acquired have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
None of these were individually significant and are therefore not shown separately.
During the year the company agreed to acquire Granadas 40% stake in Digital Wellbeing Limited DWL for 1.
In addition, Boots placed DWL in funds to settle 5.1m of Granadas loan funding of the company.
Additionally, Boots The Chemists acquired a number of pharmacy businesses for 1.2m.
There were no significant fair value adjustments in respect of any of these acquisitions.

Halfords has been treated as a discontinued operation.
The consideration of 396.0m reects the final settlement on completion of the net asset value statement in December 2002.
The principal disposals in the year to 31st March 2002 were the sale in July 2001 of the skincare brands, Onagrine and Nobacter, to Beiersdorf, the disposal of the factory in France, an agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation a joint venture partner in July 2001 to close trial retail stores in Japan, and the disposal in August 2001 of the Halfords garage service business to the Automobile Association.

Following redemption there is no further impact on the profit and loss account.
See note 18. b Interest rate swaps During the year the group reviewed its interest rate management policy and concluded that certain interest rate swaps were no longer an effective hedge to liabilities.
As a result the group closed out 1,315m of interest rate swaps.
1,100m of these were lease related, and their closure resulted in the receipt of a net cash premium of 53.8m.
a The group has also reviewed its accounting policies for hedging instruments to take account of recent developments in this area of accounting.
In the light of current best practice and consistent with its change in treasury management practice the group has decided to adopt a new policy.
This is shown in the accounting policies note on derivative financial instruments on page 38. a Under the groups previous accounting policy the 53.8m premium referred to above would have been released to the profit and loss account over the remainder of the original terms of the swap contracts, which at 31st March 2002 had an average maturity of 10 years.
The group would also have continued to treat the unamortised surplus of 53.0m at 31st March 2002 from previous swap contract closures in the same way.
The effect would have been to increase profits in future years as a consequence of a past treasury policy which has now been discontinued.
a Under the groups new policy the surplus received in cash on closing out lease related swaps of 53.8m has been reported in the profit and loss account as an exceptional item.
The unamortised surplus of 46.8m 53.0m at 31st March 2002 from replacing swaps last year with equivalent derivatives has also been reported as an exceptional item following the closure of those replacement swaps.
In addition a further 200m of interest rate swaps have been closed since 31st March 2003, and a cost of 13.0m has been included in the accounts to reect this.
This along with the surpluses noted above and other related items leaves a net exceptional credit to interest of 92.1m that would not have been credited under the previous policy.
a A surplus of 12.2m arose in the period on closing out a portion of the swaps related to debt other than leases to which, therefore, hedge accounting continues to apply.
Accordingly, this surplus 11.0m at 31st March 2003 is held in the balance sheet and will be released to profit and loss account in accordance with the original maturities of the interest rate swaps closed out.
a On adopting the new policy the directors have considered the extent to which it requires a restatement of gures reported in prior years.
The change in accounting policy affects transactions where swap contracts are closed out without replacement by economically equivalent arrangements.
As the group has not previously encountered these circumstances the directors have concluded that no prior year restatement is required.

Following the disposal of Halfords Ltd on 30th August 2002 properties retained by the group, but let to Halfords, were reclassied as investment properties and revalued to open market value.
All but one of these properties was subsequently disposed of during the year.
Surpluses and deficits arising and the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to the revaluation reserve except that any permanent diminution in value of an investment property is taken to the profit and loss account for the year.
In accordance with SSAP19, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
This treatment represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements concerning depreciation of xed assets.
However, these properties are held for investment, rather than consumption, and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation is only one of many factors reected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identied or quantied.

iv Contingent liabilities Knoll Pharmaceutical Co. Knoll is a defendant in a number of consumer class actions in 30 states of the USA, Canada and Puerto Rico.
Knoll is the successor to Boots Pharmaceuticals Inc. formerly an indirect subsidiary of the company, which was sold to the BASF group under agreements made by the company in March 1995.
The company has been named as a defendant in some of these actions, which allege that the marketing of the product Synthroid did not comply with consumer protection and business practice laws.
The substance of a settlement by Knoll of consumer actions and claims of insurers and state attorneys general in the United States has been approved, and a settlement of most of the actions in Canada has been approved.
The company asserts that the relevant courts in North America have no jurisdiction over it in these cases and this has been approved by a state court in Illinois.
In the light of current information, the directors believe that the company has good defences to claims concerning Synthroid including any that might be brought by BASF and, while the outcome of such claims remains uncertain, they believe that it should not have a material adverse impact on the group.
