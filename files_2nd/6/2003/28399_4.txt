The salaries paid to our 7,600 employees and the commission paid to 29,000 self-employed agents help to support many individuals and their families.
Similarly, the taxes we pay to governments help to fund public services and the payments we make to suppliers help to sustain businesses and jobs.
One way to measure this creation and distribution of wealth is through a value added statement, as set out below.
2003 m Value added: Net income from sales 1,134 Payments to policyholders, brokers and suppliers of goods and services 639 Value added 495 Value distributed: Employees 153 Agents 139 Shareholders 83 Community contributions and donations 1 Government, taxation excluding employee taxes 61 Retained by the business 58 Value distributed 495 This statement shows, in monetary terms, the value we add to the goods and services we buy in, measured as the difference between income received from customers and payments made to our suppliers.
The value created in this way is then available for distribution to our stakeholders.
Some is retained in the business and invested for future growth, so benefiting tomorrows stakeholders.
In 2003 nearly 60% of the value added was distributed to employees and agents.
