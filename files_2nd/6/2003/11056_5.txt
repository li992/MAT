The vendors, Emile, Charles and David Amzallag are regarded as related parties under the Listing Rules, and for THOUSAND SQUARE FEET that reason the acquisition requires shareholder approval.
The maximum consideration is Euro 42.0m payable in cash, including an initial payment of Euro 40.0m payable upon completion.
The remaining Euro 2.0m is payable only if certain profit targets for the financial year ending March 2004 are met.
The payment is based on a graduated calculation relative to profits 331 achieved in excess of budget.
The cost of the acquisition will be satisfied out of sterling funds.
A euro option contract has been purchased to cap 254 the initial payment at a rate of Euro 1.4153 to the.
1,377 219 We expect the NewMim purchase to be earnings enhancing in 2004.
Loss 1,258 of interest will amount to approximately 1.0m, with additional goodwill 1,136 amortisation of approximately 1.0m.
The impact of this on Group profit before tax should be more than offset by the elimination of minority interests from post tax profits.
Financial objectives New Look is now established as a leading player in the fast-growing UK fashion value market, and is poised to accelerate the further development of its business in France.
As we move forward into our next phase of development, we reiterate the Groups firm commitment to our financial objectives of rigorous cost control, stringent cash management and careful monitoring of new store investment.
