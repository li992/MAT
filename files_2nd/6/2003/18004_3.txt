08: Operating and Financial Review Central London Market Overview Supply and Demand During the last year, the group has been impacted by the difficulties in the wider UK property market but we are encouraged by the levels of serious enquiries now being experienced.
We observe sentiment improving and are witnessing the announcement of notable transactions, in particular at Canary Wharf, where recently both British Petroleum and Reuters have agreed terms with the group to lease 128,800 sq ft and 281,000 sq ft respectively.
Additionally, a number of significant occupiers are now undertaking strategic real estate reviews which could lead to a renewed stimulation of the pre-let market.
A noticeable improvement in business confidence has been detected, with the forecast of future growth in business volumes standing at its highest level for a year and respondents stating that profitability has improved for the first time in three quarters.
Furthermore, indications are that in the first quarter of 2003, UK corporate profitability has improved to its highest level since 2000.
Confirming the improvement in sentiment, an Ernst & Young survey shows the number of profit warnings by London companies had fallen to its lowest level since 2000 during the first half of this year.
Office availability continues to rise but the double digit increases seen in each of the previous 4 quarters have now slackened.
This is principally due to a slowing in the rate at which occupier driven disposals reach the market, a trend that is expected to persist in coming quarters.
The development cycle is also easing as those schemes initiated in 2001 2002 reach completion with a very low level of new building starts.
The City market faces the prospect of increases in supply as the last significant tranches of new speculative space are completed in this cycle.
A total of 12 schemes of over 100,000 sq ft are due to be completed in the next 12 months, although it is notable that such new, high quality accommodation tends to be absorbed before older, secondary product.
The past 12 months has seen a reduction in take-up across all submarkets by approximately 15% on the previous year to approximately 8.8 million sq ft: this compares with a ten year average of approximately 11.9 million sq ft. As shown in the table on page 9, total availability has risen to 25.83 million sq ft, pushing the vacancy rate from 9.2% a year ago to 12% Source: Knight Frank.
Although this is a significant increase and above the long term average, availability remains below the levels witnessed in the early 90s when vacancy rates reached 18-20%.
The release of tenant space back to the market in response to weakening economic conditions has largely slowed.
A primary driver of supply increases over the last year has been the imminent completion of new space in the City market, also buoying the volume and proportion of good quality accommodation available.
Set against this, however, the past few months have provided a number of new substantial requirements in excess of 100,000 sq ft, and agents are reporting increased viewing figures across all sub-markets, many of whom would be seeking to lease higher quality space, rather than lower quality second-hand space.
Whilst it is generally believed that vacancy rates in the West End market should peak in the short term, development activity and subdued demand will see a further uplift in City supply.
There is currently 5.38 million square feet under construction in Central London on a speculative basis Source: Knight Frank, the majority of which will have been delivered to the market within the next 12 months.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :09 Vacancy rates across the various submarkets in London during the second quarter of 2003 were as follows: Vacancy Rates June 2003 Overall Vacancy New Available Second-hand & Rate Space Refurbished Space % 000 sq ft % 000 sq ft % 000 sq ft Central London 12.0 25,834 24 6,168 76 19,666 City 12.9 13,369 25 3,358 75 10,011 West End 11.6 10,226 14 1,475 86 8,751 Docklands 11.7 678 100 678 Canary Wharf district 12.5 1,561 85 1,335 15 226 Source: Knight Frank Research and Consultancy.
These figures include space marketed by both the group and the tenants on the estate, but do not include option space that Skadden, Lehman Brothers and Barclays may exercise nor for space where breaks have been exercised but the tenant is still in occupation, most notably LUL in 30 The South Colonnade.
For the group itself, a vacancy rate at 30 June 2003 of 10.6% reflects the current 1 million sq ft being marketed, which could fall to 8.7% if those deals currently under offer complete.
For over a year, across Central London second-hand space has accounted for around 80% Source: CB Richard Ellis of the space available in completed buildings.
However, a greater proportion of the second-hand space available is of a higher specification than has been the case in previous downturns.
This provides an expanded range of tenant choice for Grade A buildings and puts pressure on developers of new space to compete on price.
Rents Over the last year, rents have continued to fall across Central London following a trend which started in the previous year.
Typically, City headline rents have fallen some 15-20% in the past year, with year end figures likely to be between 42.50 per sq ft and 47.00 per sq ft, depending upon the definition of Prime Rent used.
The rate of decline in the West End has slowed and, typically, prime headline rents will have fallen by some 11% by the end of 2003 to 60 per sq ft from 67.50 per sq ft 12 months previously.
In general, falling rents have been accompanied by increased incentive packages, coupled with tenant demand for shorter, more flexible leases.
Generally, landlords are responding positively to these market dynamics.
For a typical 15 year lease, a tenant would expect an incentive package equivalent to 3 years rent and, for a longer term of say, 20 years, a greater package would be expected or a lease break.
For Canary Wharf, recent evidence of terms being agreed although not yet completed, shows headline rents having stabilised at between 38 per sq ft and 40 per sq ft on recent new Grade A space, with levels of between 35 per sq ft and 37.50 per sq ft on re-lettings in first generation buildings.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 10: Operating and Financial Review Leasing Activity In respect of the groups completed investment properties 1.0 million sq ft is currently available to let following the completion of 40 Bank Street HQ3.
In addition certain tenants have short term options to sub-let back to the group over the next two years space approximating 600,000 sq ft, of which 202,800 sq ft relates to Lehman Brothers and up to 58,500 sq ft relates to Skadden, both of which may be exercised and become effective during 2003.
A further 360,000 sq ft relates to Barclays in 1 Churchill Place BP1 which is not due to complete until July 2004.
If all of these options were exercised, the availability of space would increase to 1.24 million sq ft by the end of 2003 and to 1.6 million sq ft by the end of 2004.
There are no further options to sub-let space back to the group.
LUL announced in April 2003 its intention to exercise its break option over 282,000 sq ft in 30 The South Colonnade.
In addition, tenants in the existing investment properties have break options over 30,500 sq ft which are exercisable over the period to the end of 2004.
This would take the available space in the ownership of the group to 1.9 million sq ft less any space which may be leased during the period, including the recently announced British Petroleum, Reuters, Goldenberg Hehmeyer and EMEA agreements and any other space which may be leased.
Other than the available space mentioned above from the group, the following space is being openly marketed by tenants: Citigroup c300,000 sq ft, Edward Jones 13,000 sq ft, Skadden 28,000 sq ft, State Street Bank 7,000 18,000 sq ft, CSFB 225,000 sq ft, Euler Hermes 56,000 sq ft and EFPIA 3,300 sq ft.
Furthermore, we understand that Morgan Stanley and Citigroup may be able to provide additional space in their buildings.
As regards space marketed by tenants Tube Lines recently sub-leased 170,000 sq ft at 15 Westferry Circus from Morgan Stanley, following a low key targeted marketing campaign.
The major announcement regarding Reuters means that, in a highly competitive market, the group has announced approximately 440,000 sq ft of space under offer during September 2003 alone, a strong indication of improved sentiment.
The variety of space that the group can offer, from small units through 19,000 sq ft tower floors to 40,000 sq ft trading floors, means opportunities exist for the group to respond to an upturn in leasing demand across the board.
Canary Wharf Gr Canary Wharf Group plc oup plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 2003 Report & Financial Statements :11 In terms of sector by sector activity, banking and finance continues to remain depressed, and represents only 12% of City of London activity during 2003 to date Source: CB Richard Ellis against an average of 42% per annum between the years 1997 to 2002.
However, both the insurance sector and professional services sector particularly law firms continue to remain active and, in recent weeks, a resurgence in activity in US law firms has been especially prevalent.
Sites which remain for pre-letting include DS3 up to 700,000 sq ft and BP3 4 up to 600,000 sq ft and, while availability prevails on built stock i. e. HQ3, HQ4, DS4 in particular those pre-let sites will remain available to satisfy the anticipated emergence of demand for build to suit space.
In terms of visits by Principals and Agents, despite a fluctuating start to this year, visits have picked up, with 75 Principals attending and 15 by agents to date.
This compares with 89 and 21 for the same period last year and 44 and 14 for 2001.
Based upon the past three months, we believe that the number of visits for the year will be greater than last year.
Retail leasing has experienced strong demand over the year.
Jubilee Place, the latest retail phase, opened on 18 September 2003 with all 38 units committed.
Tenants include Marks & Spencer, Boots, French Connection, Reiss, L K Bennett, Books etc and Wagamama.
Additionally, through active asset management, new quality tenants have been secured in the previous retail phases including T M Lewin, Hobbs, Crabtree & Evelyn and Robert Dyas.
Waitrose opened their new 100,000 sq ft flagship store to much acclaim in September 2002 and has recently been awarded the Retail Store Design of the Year Award.
In October 2003, Conran opens a 9,000 sq ft white tablecloth restaurant private dining brasserie and bar known as Plateau on the fourth floor of DS8, providing panoramic views over Canada Square park.
By way of adding to existing medical facilities, the group announced a letting to HCA, comprising some 5,300 sq ft: this sophisticated medical centre will provide a significant variety of treatments, most notably an MRI scanner.
Canary Wharf is now established as a 7-day a week shopping destination and with the opening of Jubilee Place in September, it has over 200 shops and restaurants trading.
Retail turnover has increased in total by 12% in the year to March 2003.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 12: Operating and Financial Review Property Portfolio The activities of the group are focused on the Canary Wharf development including Heron Quays and the adjacent sites at Canary Riverside and North Quay.
The group has two principal business streams: property investment and property development.
The investment arm comprises twenty completed properties out of the twenty five constructed at Canary Wharf totalling 8.4 million sq ft of net internal area NIA.
The properties included in this total are shown in the table below: Approx.

The properties of the group are under lease to high quality tenants which provide a diversified income stream.
At 30 June 2003 the weighted average unexpired lease term for the office portfolio built and under construction was 22.8 years or 19.0 years assuming exercise of Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :13 :13 all outstanding break options and those sub-let options which could be for the remaining term of the leases.
Of the square footage under lease 76.2% does not expire or cannot be terminated by tenants in the next ten years.
In calculating the above, sub-lets for less than the remaining term of the leases have been disregarded.
In the case of such sub-lets, space totalling 372,570 sq ft or 3.0% of the total portfolio, is capable of being sub-let back to the group for periods between 5 and 10 years at the end of which the space reverts to the tenant to the end of the lease term.
Of this total, 218,370 sq ft is for a maximum period of 5 years and 154,200 sq ft is for a maximum period of 10 years.
A table summarising the sub-let options, both exercised and unexercised, is included within Note 26 to the financial statements.
During the year ended 30 June 2003 the group completed the construction of five properties, all of which were retained as investment properties 5 Canada Square, 16-19 Canada Square, 20 Canada Square, 20 Bank Street and 40 Bank Street.
5 Canada Square is a 515,100 sq ft office building which has been leased to CSFB in its entirety.
20 Canada Square is a 527,200 sq ft building of which 266,200 sq ft has been leased to The McGraw Hill Companies.
This tenant had previously agreed to lease 313,200 sq ft but exercised an option on 3 January 2003 to omit one floor of 47,000 sq ft from the lease.
20 Bank Street is a 546,500 sq ft building which has been leased by Morgan Stanley in its entirety.
40 Bank Street is a 607,400 sq ft building of which 211,300 sq ft has been leased to Allen & Overy and Skadden.
Allen & Overy has leased 78,300 sq ft and Skadden has leased 133,000 sq ft but subject to certain conditions has options to sub-let back up to 58,500 sq ft to the group.
Skadden can choose to lease this space back for either 5 years or, at their 1 sole choice, 7 2, 10 or 20 years.
The exercise date for the Skadden options was originally 28 February 2003 but this date was extended first to 31 May 2003, then to 31 August 2003 and then to 28 November 2003 to allow the tenant more time to determine its space requirements.
16-19 Canada Square is a 203,300 sq ft retail building of which 100,000 sq ft has been let to Waitrose, 92,000 sq ft has been leased to Sportsplex Canary Wharf Limited Sportsplex, the operator of the Reebok Sports Club, 2,300 sq ft to Robert Dyas and 9,000 sq ft to Conran Restaurants.
Subsequent to the year end, in July 2003, Sportsplex was placed into administration and the administrator is currently seeking an alternative operator.
In the meantime, the group has the benefit of a 2.2 million guarantee from Reebok International Ltd, one of the shareholders in Sportsplex.
This equates to approximately one years rent and service charge.
There were five properties under construction at 30 June 2003 totalling 3.1 million sq ft net, of which 99% is covered by agreements for lease, subject to the sub-let arrangements referred to in the table below.
Upon completion it is intended that all of these properties will be held as investments.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 14: 14: Operating and Financial Review Properties under construction at 30 June 2003 comprised the following: Approx.

Completion of base build works was also achieved on 25-30 Bank Street HQ2 in July 2003 and completion of fitout is expected during the last quarter of 2003.
As well as the properties under construction referred to above, the group is continuing substructure works on the remaining sites on Canary Wharf.
In connection with this work, buildings DS3 650,000 sq ft and BP2 200,000 sq ft are being constructed up to street level.
Uncommitted development sites on the original Canary Wharf site could accommodate a total of 1.5 million sq ft.
In addition the development sites at North Quay and Canary Riverside allow development of 2.1 million sq ft net based on existing planning applications.
Applications have been made to modify and increase the permitted density to 4.2 million sq ft, but construction of new buildings will only commence as and when market conditions allow.
Valuations The net assets of the group, as stated in its consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2003, were 1,519.4 million.
In arriving at this total: i properties held as investments were carried at 4,182.8 million, which represents the Market Value MV of those properties of 4,230.5 million at that date as determined by the groups external valuers, FPDSavills or CB Richard Ellis, less an adjustment for lease incentives as required by Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 28 Operating Lease Incentives UITF 28 of 47.7 million.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :15 :15 ii properties under construction and properties held for development, were carried at 909.2 million and 223.8 million respectively, representing their cost to the group.
The valuation of the investment portfolio includes those properties which were completed during the year.
These properties were revalued resulting in a revaluation surplus over their cost of 415.4 million.
For those properties held throughout the year the carrying value reduced from 3,268.1 million at 30 June 2002 to 3,006.3 million at 30 June 2003, a reduction of 263.6 net of additions and adjustments for UITF 28, or 8.1%, of which 87.5 million arose in the six months to June 2003.
The net revaluation surplus of 151.8 million has been taken to the revaluation reserve and of this amount 139.8 million arose in the six months to 30 June 2003.
As well as valuing the investment properties, FPDSavills or CB Richard Ellis have valued all properties under construction, comprising those properties set out in the table on page 14.
The Market Value of properties under construction at 30 June 2003 was 1,336.0 million in comparison with a carrying value for accounts purposes of 909.2 million.
In valuing the properties under construction, the valuers have allowed for estimated costs to complete, including fit-out.
In addition they have allowed for letting, marketing and financing costs.
As regards properties held for development, the valuers have provided a joint opinion as at 30 June 2003 that the Market Value was 245.0 million in comparison with a carrying value for accounts purposes of 223.8 million.
In valuing the properties held for development, the valuers have allowed for estimated costs to complete, including an allowance for fit-out.
The Market Value of 245.0 million represents a reduction of 43.8% excluding additions from that at 30 June 2002, which reflects a reduction in assumed rental growth, a longer development horizon and consequently a larger allowance for developers profit.
Of the reduction in the year of 190.9 million, excluding additions, 56.2 million arose in the six months to 30 June 2003.
Excluding additions in the year to 30 June 2003, the valuation of the property portfolio on the basis of Market Value reduced by 553.8 million to 5,811.5 million 8.7%.
Of the reduction in the year 126.2 million 2.1%, arose in the six months to 30 June 2003.
As noted in the Property Portfolio section, there are a number of properties which are subject to sub-let options.
These options, whether exercised or not, are taken into account in the valuations summarised in the table on page 17.
At the same time as providing their joint opinion of the Market Value of properties under construction or held for development, the valuers were also instructed to give their joint opinion of the present value of the Net Realisable Value NRV of such properties.
Net Realisable Value is defined in SSAP 9 Stocks and Long-term Contracts as the actual or estimated selling price net of trade but before settlement discounts less: a all further costs to completion: and b all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distributing.
This same definition of Net Realisable Value is reproduced in UKPS 1.14 of the RICS Manual Standards of Trading Stock.
The Net Realisable Value of the groups properties under construction and properties held for development comprises an assessment of the total value to the group, arising from owning and developing those properties, being the aggregate of: a the Market Value of the land: Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 16: 16: Operating and Financial Review b developers profit: c the effect on value of Enterprise Zone Allowances EZAs : and d finance holding costs on the site value and other minor items arising from the fact that the land is already in the ownership of the group.
Thus, Net Realisable Value allows consideration to be given to the enhancement in value to the group arising from b, c and d which do not form part of Market Value in the properties existing state.
The approach adopted by the valuers in arriving at the present value of the Net Realisable Value at 30 June 2003 is consistent with that adopted for the previous year end.
In summary this involves the following six steps: Step One Consider a phased development programme for the remaining sites on the estate, taking into account the amount of space to be developed and the rate of take-up.
Step Two Estimate the completed development value, with growth, of the buildings, but excluding EZAs.
Step Three Estimate the value enhancement resulting from EZAs.
Step Four Estimate the cost of development, with inflation.
Step Five Calculate the Net Realisable Value on completion of development by deducting the cost of the development, with inflation, from the total value with growth of the completed buildings.
Step Six Discount the Net Realisable Value at completion back to the date of assessment in recognition of the time cost of money, in order to arrive at the present value of the Net Realisable Value.
At 30 June 2003 the valuers adopted a discount rate of 6.15%, which represents a notional cost of borrowing equal to 2% above the 10 year gilt rate.
This compares with a rate adopted at the previous year end of 7.15%.
On the basis outlined above the valuers joint opinion of the present value of the Net Realisable Value of the properties under construction at 30 June 2003 was 1,685.1 million.
Their joint opinion of the present value of the Net Realisable Value of properties held for development at that date was 620.0 million in comparison with 903.8 million at 30 June 2002, a reduction of 34.7% after additions.
Excluding additions in the year to 30 June 2003, the valuation of the property portfolio on the basis of the present value of Net Realisable Value reduced by 1,014.2 million to 6,535.6 million or 13.4%.
Of the reduction in the year, 532.3 million or 7.5% arose in the six months to 30 June 2003.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :17 :17 The carrying value of the groups properties for accounts purposes in comparison with the supplementary valuations provided by the external valuers is summarised in the table below: 30 June 2003 30 June 2002 Present Value Present Value Market of Net Market of Net Carrying Value in Realisable Carrying Value in Realisable Value Existing State Value Value Existing State Value m m m m m m 1 2 3 1 2 3 Investment properties 4,182.8 4,230.5 4,230.5 3,268.1 3,278.8 3,278.8 2 2 Properties under construction 909.2 1,336.0 1,685.1 936.6 1,915.1 2,586.6 4 4 Properties held for development 223.8 245.0 620.0 178.7 390.8 903.8 Total 5,315.8 5,811.5 6,535.6 4,383.4 5,584.7 6,769.2 Notes: 1 The carrying value of investment properties represents Market Value less an adjustment for UITF 28.
This adjustment has not been made to the Market Value in existing state or the Present Value of Net Realisable Value.
2 Stated at Market Value in existing state before adjustment for UITF 28.
The UITF 28 adjustment attributable to investment properties at 30 June 2003 was 47.7 million 2002 10.7 million and the adjustment attributable to properties under construction which reached base building practical completion subsequent to the year end was 179.0 million 2002 Nil.
3 Investment properties are stated at Market Value excluding adjustment for UITF 28 and any potential value attributable to EZAs.
4 Interests in Heron Quays West included at Market Value of 15.0 million.
Taxation Property development is carried out by the groups development companies each of which is a trading company for tax purposes.
The trading companies realise development profits for tax purposes on the sale of each property either to a group property investment company which profit is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements or to a third party.
This profit is broadly equivalent to the difference between the Market Value of the property on the date of sale and the cost to the group of constructing the building.
If the group property development company does not sell the property immediately on completion, until it does so the property is treated as trading stock for the purposes of its own financial statements but will be shown as an investment property in the consolidated balance sheet, unless it is intended to sell the property to a third party when it will be shown as trading stock.
On the transfer of the completed properties to a group investment company, the group becomes eligible to claim EZAs.
For properties held within the group, the EZAs are available as a 100% initial allowance in the year the qualifying expenditure is incurred by the investment company, or as a 25% writing down allowance if claimed in subsequent accounting periods.
For group investment companies purchasing properties directly from the group property development companies, the expenditure which qualifies for EZAs is based on the propertys market value at the time of its transfer to the group property investment company, less a disallowance for the value of land and other non-qualifying expenditure.
EZAs can be claimed by the group, when required, to shelter taxable profits arising including trading profits in the property development companies on the transfer of completed buildings once the accumulated trading losses have been fully utilised.
The group may claim any remaining available EZAs to shelter future operating profits when necessary.
In arriving at a Market Value of the properties in the consolidated balance sheet, the value of all completed properties is included in Investment Properties.
This Market Value, summarised in the table above, ignores any potential value attributable to EZAs.
The group also instructed its valuers to assess the Market Values of the properties inclusive of EZAs and Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 18: 18: Operating and Financial Review has been advised that the increase in the market value of the groups properties attributable to EZAs is in the region of 525.0 million.
This increase represents the valuers assessment of the additional amount that a third party purchaser would pay for the property recognising that a purchaser would pay more for a building that attracts EZAs compared to a building that does not.
However, this amount does not reflect the value of the EZAs to the group for two reasons.
Firstly, a disposal of any property may trigger a clawback of any EZAs previously claimed by the group which would generate a tax liability.
A deferred tax liability has been provided in respect of this and is disclosed in Note 18.
Secondly, if the group were to utilise the EZAs available by way of internal sales of properties, claims for EZAs would be made to shelter the groups taxable profits and thereby mitigate the payment of corporation tax.
The cash value of the EZAs to the group would then be by reference to the net present value of the tax savings.
The claiming of EZAs will give rise to a deferred tax liability and so result in no net tax benefit being recognised in the profit and loss account.
In arriving at the Market Value inclusive of the value of EZAs, the group provided the valuers with the quantum of EZAs which it expects to be available on all properties that are completed and held on investment account for tax purposes.
The Inland Revenue has not yet agreed the quantum of the allowances in all instances as the EZA claims are still in the process of agreement in the ordinary course of dealing with the groups corporation tax affairs.
For completed and partly completed properties held on trading account for tax purposes, the valuers made their own assessment of the quantum of EZAs which would be available thereon after making an appropriate disallowance for the value of land and other non-qualifying expenditure.
In the 2003 Budget the Chancellor gave full stamp duty relief on properties in defined disadvantaged areas.
This relief covers all of the properties held by the group, regardless of value, and consequently the allowance for purchasers costs in the valuations has been reduced from 5.75% to 1.75% to take account of this relief.
This concession required approval from the European Commission as state aid and is to be reviewed in 2006.
If the group were to dispose of its property portfolio at the Market Value disclosed in this Operating and Financial Review, which excludes any value attributable to EZAs, a tax liability of 258.1 million would arise after taking account of available losses and provisions.
This amount includes tax on trading profits and capital gains that would arise on sale of properties under construction and properties held for development, including land interests.
It does not reflect any amount in relation to capital allowance balancing charges.
The maximum reversal of allowances would be 292.1 million.
Deferred tax has been properly provided in respect of this liability and is a component of the 85.4 million deferred tax in respect of accelerated capital allowances shown in Note 18 to the financial statements.
The potential tax liability comprises corporation tax on chargeable gains of 45.5 million and corporation tax on development surpluses of 212.6 million.
Capital losses have reduced the corporation tax on chargeable gains by 172.8 million and revenue losses have reduced tax on development surpluses by 207.7 million.
In line with FRS 19, the benefit of these losses has not been recognised through the creation of a deferred tax asset in the balance sheet.
The total potential tax liability of 258.1 million differs from that in Note 18 because that note relates solely to buildings that are treated as investment properties for consolidated accounts purposes which have been recognised in the balance sheet at their Market Value.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :19 :19 Operating Results In the following review of operating results, references to 2003 and 2002 should be read as references to the years ended 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2002 respectively.
The groups turnover is generated primarily by the rents and service charges earned from its property interests at Canary Wharf.
Turnover increased from 206.8 million in 2002 to 250.3 million in 2003, an increase of 43.5 million or 21.0%.
The impact of UITF 28 was to increase rental income by 15.8 million in 2003 2002 15.5 million.
Excluding the impact of UITF 28, rental income increased from 149.1 million to 182.6 million, an increase of 22.5%.
This was primarily attributable to the expiry of rent free or rent reduced periods and the commencement of rent on recently completed properties.
Service charge income increased from 32.8 million to 38.0 million, an increase of 5.2 million or 15.9%, due primarily to the increased level of occupancy on the estate.
Miscellaneous income, comprising ground rents, insurance recoveries and tenant service income increased from 9.4 million to 13.9 million, reflecting the provision of tenant specific services outside of the standard service charge on the estate and the recovery of the increased cost of insurance cover.
Lease incentives include rent-free periods and other incentives given to lessees on entering into lease arrangements.
Under UITF 28, the aggregate cost of lease incentives is recognised as an adjustment to rental income, allocated evenly over the lease term or the term to the first market rent review if earlier.
The cost of other lease incentives is included within prepayments and spread on a straight line basis over a similar period.
Accordingly the external valuation of investment properties is reduced for these incentives.
The effects of UITF 28 are summarised below: Year Ended Year Ended 30 June 2003 30 June 2002 m m Profit and loss account: Increase in rental income 15.8 15.5 At At 30 June 2003 30 June 2002 m m Balance sheet: Decrease in investment properties net of amortisation in the year of 7.7 million 47.7 10.7 Increase in prepayments and accrued income 265.7 26.2 Increase in provisions Note 18 150.8 Increase in accruals 28.2 Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 20: 20: Operating and Financial Review Rents payable and property management costs increased from 39.2 million to 50.4 million, an increase of 11.2 million or 28.6%, due primarily to the increase in occupancy on the estate and the increased insurance costs.
After allowing for service charge and other recoveries included within turnover, there was a full service charge recovery for the year ended 30 June 2003.
Gross profits increased from 167.6 million in 2002 to 199.9 million in 2003, an increase of 32.3 million or 19.3% over the previous year, attributable to the increase in rental income.
Administrative expenses for 2003 were 36.4 million excluding pre-operating profit exceptional items in comparison with 38.1 million for the previous year.
During the year, a charge of 2.8 million was also incurred in writing down the carrying value of the groups investment in own shares which has been treated as a pre-operating profit exceptional item Note 1.
The directors estimate that administrative expenses of 26.9 million or approximately 74% of the total for 2003 were attributable to the groups corporate and property investment activities.
For the previous year administrative expenses attributable to these activities were estimated at 23.2 million, or 61% of the total.
The remainder of the administrative expenses are attributable to unallocated overheads associated with the groups development programme which are expensed to the profit and loss account as opposed to costs directly attributable to and capitalised as part of the cost of construction of particular buildings.
For 2003 such unallocated development overheads totalled 9.5 million representing approximately 26% of administrative expenses.
For the previous year development overheads totalled 14.9 million or 39% of the total.
The reduction in development overheads over the previous year is largely attributable to letting costs.
The current year included letting costs of 0.1 million whereas for the previous year such costs totalled 5.3 million.
The directors consider that these development overheads will in due course reduce to an insignificant level upon completion of the development programme.
For 2003 operating profit was 162.4 million, in comparison with a profit of 299.7 million for 2002.
Included within the total for 2002 was a net profit of 169.5 million on the disposal of 8 Canada Square which was sold under the terms of an agreement with HSBC entered into in October 1998.
Before exceptional items the operating profit for the year of 165.2 million compares with 130.2 million for the previous year, an increase of 35.0 million or 26.9%.
The improvement in underlying profit earned by the group is primarily attributable to the increase in turnover.
Net interest payable increased from 107.6 million in 2002 to 178.5 million in 2003.
The increase in net interest payable was attributable to the securitisations completed in February 2002 and October 2002, a refinancing of 20 Canada Square in March 2003 and the groups return of capital programme.
The long term financing of the ten properties which were added to the groups securitisation vehicles ahead of completion enabled the return of capital programme to be accelerated whilst also providing funding for the completion of these properties.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :21 :21 The loss on ordinary activities after interest for the year was 13.2 million, in comparison with a profit of 203.1 million for 2002.
The profit for 2002 included the net profit on the sale of 8 Canada Square of 169.5 million and deferred consideration on disposal of certain subsidiary undertakings in 1996 of 13.4 million, partially offset by costs associated with the groups restructuring.
The result for the current year included a further 2.9 million of deferred consideration on disposal of the subsidiary undertakings in 1996 and a charge of 2.8 million incurred in writing down the carrying value of the groups investment in own shares.
Excluding these exceptional items the loss on ordinary activities before tax for the year of 13.3 million compares with a profit of 22.6 million for the previous year, a decrease of 35.9 million as a result of higher interest payable.
The loss on ordinary activities before tax for the six months to 30 June 2003 was 18.2 million.
This compares with a profit of 5.0 million for the six months to 31 December 2002.
Operating profit excluding exceptional items increased in the second half of the year from 81.2 million to 84.0 million, but this was offset by a higher net interest charge.
For 2003 and 2002 taxation was entirely attributable to deferred tax following the adoption of FRS 19.
This accounting standard has no effect on cashflow.
Moreover, the directors believe it does not reflect the actual tax which may become payable in the future absent any property disposals.
The loss on ordinary activities after tax for the year ended 30 June 2003 was 9.5 million in comparison with a profit of 193.0 million for the previous year, a reduction of 202.5 million, of which 180.4 million was attributable to the exceptional items referred to above.
On 22 October 2002 the directors declared a special dividend of 64.27p per share totalling 372.8 million, which was paid on 29 November 2002 as part of the ongoing return of capital programme.
Balance Sheet On the basis of the groups statutory balance sheet, which does not reflect any revaluation of properties under construction or held for development, net asset value reduced by 340.9 million from 1,860.3 million at 30 June 2002 to 1,519.4 million at 30 June 2003.
The reduction in net asset value was largely attributable to the loss of 9.5 million and the return of capital during the year, comprising the special dividend of 372.8 million and share buy-backs of 108.1 million.
This was partially offset by a revaluation surplus of 151.8 million.
Net asset value per share at 30 June 2003 was 2.60 in comparison with 2.38 at 31 December 2002, the increase of 0.22 per share being attributable to the surplus on revaluation of completed investment properties at 30 June 2003 of 139.8 million, equivalent to 0.24 per share.
At 30 June 2002 net asset value per share was 3.06.
The reduction of 0.46 per share which arose in the year was attributable to the loss for the year of 9.5 million and the special dividend of 372.8 million.
This was partially offset by the revaluation surplus in the year of 151.8 million and the reduction in the number of shares from 608 million to 585 million which served to offset the impact of share buy-backs in the year.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 22: 22: Operating and Financial Review Allowing for the revaluation of properties under construction or held for development to Market Value or the present value of Net Realisable Value summarised on page 17, net asset value per share at 30 June 2003 was as set out in the table below: Market Value Net Realisable Value At 30 June At 30 June At 30 June At 30 June 2003 2002 2003 2002 m m m m Net assets per statutory balance sheet 1,519.4 1,860.3 1,519.4 1,860.3 Revaluation of property portfolio: 1 1 1 1 Properties under construction 426.8 978.5 775.9 1,650.0 Properties held for development 21.2 212.1 396.2 725.1 1,967.4 3,050.9 2,691.5 4,235.4 Add: Discounted deferred tax provision 47.9 51.6 47.9 51.6 Adjusted net assets 2,015.3 3,102.5 2,739.4 4,287.0 2 Adjusted net assets per share 3.44 5.10 4.68 7.05 Fully diluted adjusted net assets 3 per share 3.44 5.01 4.58 6.83 Notes: 1 Stated at Market Value in existing state and Net Realisable Value in existing state excluding adjustment for UITF 28 on properties which reached base building practical completion subsequent to the year end of 179.0 million 30 June 2002 Nil.
2 Adjusted net assets per share has been calculated by reference to the closing number of shares of 585.0 million 30 June 2002 608.3 million.
3 The fully diluted net assets per share calculation increases adjusted net assets by 176.9 million 30 June 2002 169.2 million and the number of shares by 52.2 million 30 June 2002 44.6 million reflecting the assumed exercise of all outstanding share options and warrants.
The reduction in adjusted net assets per share on a Market Value basis from 5.10 at 30 June 2002 to 3.44 at 30 June 2003 is partly attributable to the special dividend of 372.8 million, equivalent to 64.27p per share.
In addition, the reduction in the value of the property portfolio on a Market Value basis, excluding additions, was 553.8 million or 0.95 per share based on the closing number of shares.
At 31 December 2002 net assets per share on a Market Value basis were 3.70, and the reduction of 0.26 per share to 30 June 2003 was primarily attributable to a reduction in the Market Value of the portfolio of 126.2 million or 0.22 per share.
The reduction in adjusted net assets per share on a Net Realisable Value basis from 7.05 at 30 June 2002 to 4.68 at 30 June 2003 is also partly attributable to the special dividend.
The reduction in the value of the property portfolio on a Net Realisable Value basis excluding additions, was 1,014.2 million or 1.73 per share based on the closing number of shares.
In arriving at the adjusted net asset value per share, the provision recognised in accordance with FRS 19 has been added back.
FRS 19 requires, inter alia, provision for deferred tax on capital allowances claimed notwithstanding that no tax would become payable in respect of the profits which would be realised unless the related properties were disposed of.
In contrast no provision is required for the tax which would become payable if the group were to dispose of its properties at their revalued amount.
This inconsistency in the standard has therefore been reversed in calculating the adjusted net asset value per share.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :23 :23 Treasury Objectives The principal objectives of the groups treasury function are to ensure the availability of finance to meet the groups current and anticipated requirements and to minimise the groups cost of capital.
The treasury function operates as a cost centre rather than a profit centre and does not engage in the trading of financial instruments.
The groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The group enters into derivatives transactions principally interest rate swaps, caps and collars only in order to manage the interest rate risk arising from the groups variable rate borrowings.
The Executive Committee of the board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks associated with the groups financial instruments and these policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year, are summarised below.
Interest Rate Risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of surplus cash, bank borrowings and debentures.
The group borrows principally in sterling at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps, caps or collars to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The groups policy is to keep the majority of its borrowings at fixed rates and at 30 June 2003 97.3% 2002 94.5% of the groups borrowings were fixed after taking account of interest rate hedging and cash deposits held as cash collateral see Note 17 15.
Liquidity Risk As regards liquidity, the groups policy is to ensure continuity of funding and to have the majority of its borrowings mature in 10 years or more.
At the year-end the average maturity of the groups debt was 17.5 years.
Shorter term flexibility is achieved by holding cash on deposit, through construction facilities with a term of typically 3 to 5 years arranged to fund the development of new properties, and by using the short term revolving notes of the June 2000 securitisation.
Exchange Rate Risk Although the groups policy is to maximise all financing in sterling, it currently has some borrowings in Euros and US Dollars.
Such borrowings are fully hedged with all principal and interest liabilities swapped into sterling at fixed rates.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 24: Operating and Financial Review Borrowings In October 2002 a further tap issue on the June 2000 second securitisation was completed, involving the issue of 510 million of AAA and AA rated notes.
The proceeds were used to fund a special dividend totalling 372.8 million see Note 7 and in addition 39.8 million was set aside in certain reserves required to fund the completion of the three additional properties included in the tap issue.
The combined pool of notes for the second securitisation is now 3,117.0 million of which 3,027.0 million 97% is rated AAA or AA.
The balance of 90 million, rated A or BBB, has been repurchased by the group but will be available for resale following completion of the buildings on Heron Quays.
During the year ended 30 June 2003, the group reduced the amount available for drawdown under its main construction loan facility from 1 billion to 750 million.
At 30 June 2003 76.8 million of a 407 million commitment had been drawn down as funding for construction of 1 Churchill Place leaving a further 343 million available to fund future construction in the event of a pre-let.
During the year, 48.1 million was drawn down under a separate 125 million loan facility used to fund construction of 20 Canada Square, bringing the total drawn down on this facility to 82.3 million.
In March 2003, upon completion of the building, a group company entered into a 225 million loan secured against 20 Canada Square, the proceeds of which were used in part to repay the balance on the construction loan Note 17 9.
Interest on the new loan is charged at LIBOR plus 1.125%.
The loan has been fully hedged at 6.056% and is repayable in instalments from April 2008 with a financial maturity in January 2025.
In December 2002, the group entered into a facility to borrow up to 605 million secured against 1 Churchill Place, a property that is currently under construction.
The facility may be drawn down when the property has reached practical completion, which is expected in July 2004, and the related construction facility has been repaid.
The amount which may be drawn is dependent on the amortisation period chosen.
A minimum of 529 million may be drawn on the basis of paying interest only for the first ten years of the facility whereas drawings can be increased to 605 million if the loan is placed initially on a fully amortising basis.
The loan is currently hedged to reflect the 529 million minimum drawing resulting in a hedged interest rate of 5.82% and a final maturity in July 2034.
To the extent that the loan is greater than 529 million, the increased borrowings will require additional hedging.
Also in December 2002 the group entered into a facility to borrow 85.0 million which was drawn down in January 2003 to fund the redemption of the D Notes BBB rated of the December 1997 securitisation.
The term of the facility is 18 months from first drawing and the loan carries an interest charge of LIBOR plus 2.1%.
The group has entered into an interest rate collar arrangement which serves to cap the portion linked to LIBOR to 5.5%.
An analysis of net debt is given below.
The increase in gross borrowings from 3,950.0 million to 4,710.0 million reflects the 510 million October 2002 tap issue of the second securitisation, drawings under the 750 million construction loan facility, and the drawdown of the 225 million loan facility secured against 20 Canada Square, offset by the repayment of the 125 million construction loan facility.
The increase in gross borrowings was accompanied by a reduction in cash and term deposits from 1,327.2 million to 1,029.1 million.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :25 At 30 June 2003 the groups weighted average cost of debt was 6.0% 2002 6.3%.
The group expects initially to fund its future construction activities either from existing resources or from its construction facility.
At 30 June 2003 net debt after allowing for cash in hand and cash collateral stood at 3,680.9 million, up from 2,622.8 million at the previous year end, comprising: At 30 June 2003 At 30 June 2002 m m Securitised debt 3,741.4 3,317.9 Loans 385.6 55.1 Finance lease obligations 583.0 577.0 Total borrowings 4,710.0 3,950.0 Less: cash collateral for borrowings 751.1 899.8 Less: other cash collateral excluding prepayments 1.2 5.9 3,957.7 3,044.3 Less: cash deposits 276.8 421.5 Net debt 3,680.9 2,622.8 The increase in net debt of 1,058.1 million was primarily attributable to development costs totalling 503.4 million including land acquisitions, the special dividend of 372.8 million and share buy-backs of 108.1 million.
Cashflow Net cashflow from operating activities increased from 81.2 million in 2002 to 189.4 million in 2003, an increase of 108.2 million, driven primarily by the increase in rental income and movements in working capital.
Capital expenditure reduced from 987.2 million in 2002 to 503.7 million in 2003.
Expenditure in 2003 included development expenditure of 454.1 million and payment for land and density purchases of 49.3 million whilst expenditure in 2002 included development expenditure of 957.2 million and land and density payments of 28.0 million.
Financing cashflows reduced from 902.5 million in 2002 to 644.7 million in 2003, a reduction of 257.8 million.
In 2003, financing cashflows reflected the 510 million tap of the groups second securitisation, the 225 million refinancing of 20 Canada Square and construction loan drawings.
This was partially offset by repayment of the construction loan facility on 20 Canada Square and share buy-backs of 108.1 million.
In 2002, financing cashflows reflected the second tap of the groups second securitisation of 1,340.1 million.
This was partially offset by repayments under the groups construction loan facilities of 382.8 million and share buy-backs of 392.4 million.
The increase in borrowings has also impacted the net cash expended on debt service which rose from 173.6 million in 2002 to 258.6 million in 2003.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 26: Operating and Financial Review Segmental Reporting The financial statements incorporate disclosure concerning the results and net assets of two segments.
The properties in each segment comprise: Canary I Those properties in the groups ownership within the original Canary Wharf estate identified at the time of the groups flotation, including the benefit of the agreement with the British Waterways Board concerning the removal of the density cap.
The status of these properties at 30 June 2003 was as follows: Net Internal Area million sq ft % Completed and let subject to options 7.6 58.0 Completed and available to let 0.9 6.9 Under construction and pre-let subject to options 3.0 22.9 Under construction and available to let 0.1 0.8 Uncommitted development sites 1.5 11.4 Total owned by group 13.1 100.0 Owned by third parties 2.5 Canary Wharf estate following removal of density cap 15.6 Canary II Those properties outside of the original estate which, at 30 June 2003, and subject to obtaining planning consent to increase the approved density, comprised: Net Internal Area million sq ft Uncommitted based on existing planning permission : North Quay 1.4 Riverside South 0.7 2.1 Applications for increased planning density 2.1 Potential future development assuming successful application to increase planning density 4.2 The total excludes interests in land at Heron Quays West which as a site is in the process of being assembled.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :27 Taking the valuations summarised on page 17, the net asset value attributable to each segment at 30 June 2003 was as follows: Canary I Canary II Book Value MV NRV Book Value MV NRV m m m m m m 1 2 3 Investment properties 4,182.8 4,230.5 4,230.5 2 Properties under construction 909.2 1,336.0 1,685.1 4 Properties held for development 72.0 105.0 325.0 151.8 140.0 295.0 5,164.0 5,671.5 6,240.6 151.8 140.0 295.0 Other net liabilities prior to funding 114.5 162.2 162.2 1.0 1.0 1.0 Net assets prior to funding 5,049.5 5,509.3 6,078.4 150.8 139.0 294.0 Net debt external 3,680.9 3,680.9 3,680.9 Intra-group funding 150.8 150.8 150.8 150.8 150.8 150.8 Net assets liabilities 1,519.4 1,979.2 2,548.3 11.8 143.2 Notes: 1 The carrying value of investment properties is Market Value less an adjustment for UITF 28.

2 Stated at Market Value in Existing State before adjustment for UITF 28.
3 Investment properties are stated at Market Value which excludes any adjustment for UITF 28 and potential value attributable to EZAs.
The segmental analysis of the groups profit and loss account and balance sheet prior to revaluation of properties under construction and held for development for 2003 is set out in Note 2.
For 2003, Canary I recorded a loss before tax of 8.7 million 2002 profit of 207.7 million including exceptional items giving rise to a net gain of 0.1 million 2002 gain of 180.5 million.
Canary II recorded a loss before tax of 4.5 million for 2003 2002 4.6 million, attributable entirely to administrative expenses associated with working up proposals for its development sites.
The directors estimate that of the total development overheads of 9.5 million for 2003 2002 14.9 million 5.0 million was attributable to Canary I 2002 10.3 million and the remaining 4.5 million was attributable to Canary II 2002 4.6 million.
The directors consider that development overheads attributable to Canary I will in due course reduce to an insignificant level upon completion of its development programme.
Throughout 2002 and 2003, Canary II was funded by way of an interest free intra-group loan.
