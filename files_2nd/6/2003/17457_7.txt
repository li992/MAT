FRS 17 Retirement Benefits approaches pension cost accounting from a balance sheet perspective with the net deficit in Xansas pension schemes being incorporated into the balance sheet.
Changes in the deficit will flow through the profit and loss account and the statement of recognised gains and losses.
The use of fair values in the balance sheet is likely to give rise to increased volatility in the charge to the profit and loss account from period to period.
The phased transitional disclosures required by FRS 17 are included in Note 26 to the accounts and indicate a deficit of 67.6 million.
The 32.0 million increase in the deficit since April 2002 can largely be attributed to poor investment returns over the period resulting from weak equity markets.

Treasury policies Financial instruments, other than derivatives, principally comprise cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts and loans, loan capital and various other items such as debtors and creditors arising directly from operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance business activities and to manage liquidity and working capital.
Derivative financial instruments principally forward interest rate agreements and forward currency contracts are agreed in order to manage the interest rate and currency risks derived from operations and sources of finance.
31 Xansa Report and Accounts 2003 A treasury committee of the Board approves treasury policies and matters of a treasury or banking nature.
The committee also periodically reviews the conduct of worldwide treasury activities.
These activities are subject to internal audit and it is policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.

and liabilities in the Companys pound sterling balance sheet.
Our policy seeks to minimise financing costs, while taking advantage of currency appreciation and protecting against currency depreciation, by anticipating expectations of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate environment.
This is achieved through selectively altering the capital structure of the Companys overseas businesses, for example by borrowing money in the same currencies as the functional currencies of their assets.
In addition, transaction foreign exchange risks arise from sales and purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currencies.
The policy seeks to optimise operating profit margins.
This is achieved through choosing the currency of denomination of sales and purchases and by managing the residual transaction foreign exchange risk through the selective use of derivative financial instruments.
