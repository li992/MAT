The effect of this was not analysed separately in 2002 and the comparatives have therefore been restated.
Deferred tax has been provided throughout the Group in accordance with the accounting policy shown in note 1 I.
Deferred tax does not include any potential tax liabilities which might arise in the event of the distribution of unappropriated profits or reserves of overseas subsidiary companies as there is no intention to distribute such profits or reserves.
Deferred tax assets of 147 million 2002: 160 million have not been recognised as recovery is likely to be after more than one year.

Fair value adjustments principally relate to asset valuation adjustments, recognising pension commitments and other liabilities not previously recorded.
Adjustments made to the fair value of assets of businesses acquired in 2003 are provisional owing to the short period of ownership.
Adjustments to prior year acquisitions relate to the restatement of the values of assets and liabilities in the light of knowledge arising from a more extended period of ownership and additional consideration and costs, all in respect of acquisitions made during the year ended 30 September 2002.
There was no material difference between operating profits arising from acquisitions and cash flows contributed by those acquisitions.
23 Pensions Pension schemes operated The Group operates a number of pension arrangements throughout the world which have been developed in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practices.
The majority of schemes are self administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
UK Schemes Within the UK there are two main arrangements: i Compass Group Final Salary Pension Plan ii Compass Pension Scheme A third arrangement, the Compass Retirement Income Savings Plan CRISP was launched on 1 February 2003.
This is the main vehicle for pension provision for new joiners in the UK but existing members of the two plans mentioned above will continue to accrue benefits under those arrangements.
CRISP is a contracted-in money purchase arrangement whereby the Group will match employee contributions up to 6% of pay minimum 3%.
The Compass Group Final Salary Pension Plan and the Compass Pension Scheme are defined benefit arrangements operated on a prefunded basis.
The funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the Actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
The actuarial assessments covering expense and contributions are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.
PART2 01 05 04 10:59 AM Page 65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 23 Pensions continued The Compass Pension Scheme was set up from 1 February 2001 to mirror the Granada Pension Scheme and accept the seamless transfer of pension rights for the former Granada Compass plc employees who transferred to Compass Group PLC.
All accrued rights in respect of the Granada Pension Scheme of and in respect of the employees and former employees including pensioners of, or who are attributed to, the hospitality businesses previously owned by Granada Compass plc were transferred to the Compass Pension Scheme together with an agreed share of all the assets of the Granada Pension Scheme under the terms of a specific agreement.
The share of assets was determined on a share of fund basis, whereby the assets transferred were in the same proportion of all the relevant assets of the Granada Pension Scheme as the liabilities transferred to the Compass Pension Scheme bear to the whole of the relevant liabilities of the Granada Pension Scheme.
This has been calculated as approximately 30% but is subject to the final agreement between the actuaries of the respective Schemes and to all applicable legal and Inland Revenue requirements being met.
An interim transfer was made at the end of October 2001 and a further payment in June 2003.
The final transfer adjustment is not finalised.
Any balancing amount is expected to be small and positive.
Overseas Schemes In the USA the main plan is a defined benefit plan.
The funding policy, in accordance with government guidelines, is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as achieves a 100% funding level on a projected salary basis.
In Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland the Group operates insured defined benefit pension plans where the Group contributions represent the insurance companies assessment of the annual cost of the benefits earned in that year.
In Switzerland the Group participates in funded defined benefit arrangements.
In other countries the Group employees participate primarily in state arrangements to which the Group makes the appropriate contributions.
The pension cost of these plans for the year was 60 million 2002: 50 million of which 39 million 2002: 25 million relates to overseas plans.
Of the total cost of 60 million, 43 million 2002: 40 million relates to defined benefit schemes and 17 million 2002: 10 million relates to defined contribution schemes.
The pension cost of the Compass Group Final Salary Pension Plan the Plan for the year to 30 September 2003 has been assessed in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified consulting actuaries based in the UK on an actuarial valuation at 6 April 2001.
This was made using the projected unit method.
The pension cost of the Compass Pension Scheme the Scheme for the year to 30 September 2003 has been similarly assessed based on an actuarial valuation at 31 December 2001.
The most significant actuarial assumptions adopted for determining pension costs and contributions were as follows: i Rate of return on investments 6.5% per annum ii Rate of increase in pensionable pay 4.0% per annum iii Rate of increase in pension 3.0% per annum The asset valuation method used was the market value approach.
The market value of the Plans assets was 157 million as at 6 April 2001.
The results of the valuation on the above basis showed that the value of the assets at 6 April 2001 represented 99% of the value of the accrued benefits after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable pay and pensions.
Payments to the Plan in the year total 11 million more than the profit and loss pension cost, consequently, this amount is included within prepayments.
The total prepayment is 14 million 2002: 3 million.
The market value of the Schemes assets as at 31 December 2001 was 447 million.
The results of the valuation on the above basis showed that the value of the assets represented 112% of the value of the accrued benefits at 31 December 2001 after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable pay and pensions.
Payments to the Scheme total 4 million more than the profit and loss pension cost which has been charged against provisions for liabilities and charges.
There have been no material changes to the pension arrangements since the valuation and review dates although both the Plan and Scheme are effectively closed to new entrants.
The assets are held in separate funds administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
The assets in the US Group final salary pension plan had a market value of $88 million as at 1 January 2003 representing 83% of the accrued benefits under the scheme, after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable pay and pensions in the course of payment.
The most significant assumptions used for the US Group final salary pension plan were: i Expected rate of return on assets 8.5% per annum ii Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.0% per annum iii Discount rate 6.0% per annum At the balance sheet date outstanding employer and employee contributions for all schemes amount to 10 million and 1 million respectively.
Unfunded Pension Liabilities Unfunded pension liabilities have accrued for a total of 43 individuals.
The total value of the unfunded liabilities at 30 September 2003 was 20 million 2002 : 17 million which has been provided for in full.
