12 Annual Report and Accounts 2003 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES The Group is required by SSAP 19 to revalue Investment Properties annually.
The valuation of the three investment properties, Court & Tower offices, Los Angeles: Kings Tanglin Shopping Centre, Singapore: and Birkenhead Point Shopping Centre and Marina, Sydney resulted in a revaluation deficit of 1.4m.

FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARD 17 The Group adopted the transitional accounting disclosures of FRS 17 - Retirement Benefits in 2002.
Had the Group implemented FRS 17 at 31 December 2003 then the balance sheet would have contained a liability, net of tax, of 5.8m 2002: liability of 6.6m, relating to the deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme net assets.

TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS For reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, the consolidated accounts of the group must comply with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards.
The consolidated financial performance and financial position as disclosed in these financial statements may be significantly different if determined in accordance with IFRS.
Major differences between UK accounting standards and IFRS identified to date as potentially having a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements may include: fair value accounting for all financial instruments, including derivatives: the requirement to provide for deferred taxation on potential capital gains calculated on the book value of revalued hotel properties and on acquisition fair value adjustments: recognition in the financial statements of actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit pension schemes: and accounting for the intrinsic fair value of the cost of share options granted to employees in the profit and loss account.
The group has not quantified these differences.
This summary should not be taken as an exhaustive list of all the differences between UK accounting standards and IFRS that potentially have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
No attempt has been made to identify all disclosure, presentation or classification differences that would affect the manner in which transactions or events are presented.
In addition, the bodies that establish UK accounting standards and IFRS have significant ongoing projects that could affect the potential differences and the impact of these differences on the future consolidated financial statements.
The actual impacts on the consolidated of the adoption of IFRS will depend on the standards applicable and the particular circumstances prevailing on adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2005.
The group is already required to report its results to its parent undertaking under Singapore GAAP, which is more aligned with IFRS than current UK accounting standards.
The group will develop this framework as part of the IFRS conversion project being undertaken during 2004.
