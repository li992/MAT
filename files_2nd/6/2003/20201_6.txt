Wholesale Banking exit portfolios credit exposure analysis The analysis that follows defines total exposures as being net of specic provisions and includes undrawn commitments.
In total these comprise 0.6bn and 0.2bn respectively.
In total, approximately 60% of the Wholesale Banking exposures in the Portfolio Business Unit have external ratings.
This results mainly from the exposure amounts including amounts due from leasing counterparties rather than the asset value of leasing businesses 1.7 bn and the small exposure in respect of the Newark Junior note, rather than the assets held within the structure 0.6 bn.
2 In some instances there are now less than five individual counterparties.
In these cases a true average is reported, which results in an apparent disconnect between the average of the top five and the total exposure.
