Financial Review The weighted average cost of borrowings fell to 6.6% at March 2003 from 7.8% a year earlier John Whiteley The major transactions to affect the results for the year ended 31 March 2003 were Finance Director property disposals of 215.6 million and the repurchase of a high-coupon debenture for 196.6 million.
There were no new accounting standards which applied for the first time in the year, but, with the advent of the Groups first major development programme for many years, we have changed our accounting policy in order to capitalise interest on expenditure on developments and major refurbishments.
This change of accounting policy brings the Group into line with industry practice and complies with international as well as UK accounting standards, and will affect the results of the Group for the first time in the year ending 31 March 2004.
Results The profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2003 comprises four distinct elements: the underlying core business, which generated profits before tax of 38.7 million 2002: 36.2 million and earnings of 13.3p 2002: 12.7p : the disposal of investment properties: exceptional finance costs: and a deferred tax adjustment for accelerated capital allowances occasioned by FRS 19.
Rent receivable of 72.6 million was 12.7 million, or 15%, lower than last year.
Property disposals reduced rent by 18.5 million and expires by 1.0 million, whereas new lettings and acquisitions added 3.0 million and rent reviews a further 3.8 million.
We have 269 tenants on 357 leases, but, despite maintaining the portfolio virtually fully let throughout the year, we have been required to provide for bad debts equivalent to only 0.3% of gross rents.
This year saw a significant turnover of personnel, particularly within the property group, and the costs of those changes, together with professional fees associated with initiatives put in place by the new team, were largely responsible for the increase in property and administration costs in the year.
The sales of investment properties of 215.6 million were in line with the valuation at 31 March 2002, and the loss on their sale of 2.4 million comprised associated selling costs.
Net interest payable of 93.4 million was distorted by 3 the premium of 66.6 million paid on the purchase of the 130 million 10 4% First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2021 and the provision for the future cost of interest rate swaps unlikely to be matched by borrowings in the coming year: in 2002 it was similarly distorted by a debenture redemption cost of 28.2 million and a 2.1 million cost of cancelling an interest rate swap.
Excluding these exceptional items, net interest payable fell by 17.1 million, or 42%, from 40.3 million to 23.2 million, largely reflecting the use of disposal proceeds to cancel the high-coupon debenture in the year.
24 Annual Report 2003 Financial Review Adjusted profits before tax of 38.7 million attracted a tax charge of 11.7 million, representing a tax rate on the underlying core business of 30% 2002: 27.1%.
Crystallising the loss on the debenture purchased in the year will largely preclude our paying any corporation tax in 2003 and 2004, as the tax charge on the underlying business in 2003 will be offset against the tax credit available on the exceptional debenture loss.
In total, exceptional items attracted a tax credit of 20.7 million, 9.3 million of which has been carried forward as a deferred tax asset.
The loss on disposal of investment properties attracted no immediate tax relief, and the requirement of FRS 19 to account for the potential tax payable on the reversal of all capital allowances claimed, produced a tax credit of 4.7 million, in respect of capital allowances which did not reverse on disposals made during the year.
The aggregate effect of these various elements is a tax credit on the face of the profit and loss account of 13.7 million.
The final dividend will be paid, subject to shareholders approval, on 17 July 2003 to shareholders on the register at 13 June: the total dividend for the year of 10.25p per share 2002: 10.0p reflected a 2.5% increase on last year, and was covered 1.30 times by adjusted earnings 2002: 1.27 times.
Financing 3 The purchase of the 130 million 10 4% First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2021 in April 2002 saved approximately 5.5 million in interest costs in the year, and had the purchase been effected on 31 March 2003, falls in interest rates and margins on corporate bonds in the intervening period would have increased its cost by over 20 million before tax.
Importantly, purchasing the debenture released 20% of the portfolio from charge, enabling the property disposals to be made later in the year.
Purchasing the 2021 debenture has reduced our weighted average cost of borrowing, but the significant number of property disposals in recent years has enabled us to pay off all of our bank borrowings against which we had entered into interest rate swaps to fix their effective rates.
Accordingly, the weighted average cost of borrowing of those facilities which were drawn down fell to 6.6% at 31 March 2003 2002: 7.8%, and the future costs associated with interest rate swaps unlikely to be matched by borrowings have been provided for.
Gearing at 31 March 2003, adjusted to exclude the capital allowances element of the deferred tax provision, was 32% 2002: 47%, net of cash balances of 103.5 million, and the Group had in place undrawn bank facilities of 210 million.
Under FRS 13, the market value of the Groups financial instruments at 31 March 2003 exceeded the amount at which they were shown in the group balance sheet by 9.2 million, representing a potential reduction in diluted net assets per share of 4p.
Financial Review Annual Report 2003 25 The 51,531 share options exercised in April 2002 represented the last of those issued under the 1988 Executive Share Option Scheme, and there were no other movements in share capital during the year.
At the Annual General Meeting on 15 July 2003 the Board will seek to renew shareholders authority to be able to buy up to 15% of the Companys issued share capital.
Cash Flow The Group Statement of Cash Flows is set out on page 55.
Net cash from operating activities, after the payment of interest and tax, was 39.9 million, from which dividends of 20.4 million were paid, leaving 19.5 million of cash generated by the underlying business retained within the Group.
Of the proceeds from the disposal of investment properties of 210.5 million, 197.4 million was used to repay loans, and 12.5 million to finance capital expenditure, resulting in a small surplus of 0.6 million.
18.3 million of these net cash inflows was placed on short-term deposit, and the remaining 1.8 million accounted for the increase in the cash balance over that of twelve months earlier.
Net Assets Shareholders funds at 31 March 2003 were 568.5 million 2002: 701.8 million or 578.7 million 2002: 716.7 million excluding the capital allowances effect of FRS 19.
The fall in adjusted net assets of 138.0 million comprised a reduction in the value of the property portfolio of 91.4 million, exceptional items, which will be earnings-enhancing in the future, of 49.8 million, and retained profits of 5.6 million, before exceptional items, which offset capital losses of 2.4 million.
Excluding the effect of FRS 19, net assets per share fell from 353p to 285p, and diluted net assets per share from 349p to 287p.
Had the Groups investment properties been sold for their book value at the balance sheet date, the contingent liability to taxation on capital gains would have been approximately 14 million, or 7p per share 2002: 13p, and disposing of the high coupon debenture during the year was the principal reason for the fall from 22p to 4p per share in the effect of marking the Groups financial instruments to market.
Accordingly, fully diluted adjusted triple net asset value fell by 12.1% from 314p to 276p.
26 Annual Report 2003 Financial Review Financial Instruments The Group raises finance through equity and borrowings, and places surplus cash on short-term deposit.
The primary sources of borrowing are debenture loans, convertible loans and bank and other loans.
The Group also enters into interest rate swaps, collars and caps, but solely as a way of managing the interest rate risks arising from some of the Groups sources of finance, primarily bank loans.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The policies for managing these are reviewed by the Board, and have been in place throughout the year ended 31 March 2003.
Interest Rate Borrowings are made either at fixed rates of interest, or at floating rates, which can be fixed simultaneously, and co-terminously, by means of interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy has been to ensure that most of its borrowings were at fixed rates: at 31 March 2003, 98% of borrowings were at fixed rates.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, provision has been made for expected future costs of interest rate swaps no longer matched by bank borrowings.
Liquidity The Group operates a long-term business, and its policy is to finance it primarily with equity, and medium-term and long-term borrowings.
Accordingly, at the year end 69% of the Groups borrowings were due to mature in more than 15 years.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by cash balances and overdraft facilities.
Credit At 31 March 2003, the Group had 101.7 million on short-term deposit with financial institutions.
It is the Boards policy that deposits and derivative contracts are placed only after consideration of the current credit worthiness of the counter-party.
