decided to pursue actively a sale of the whole of the Managed Retail business.
This decision was reached following extensive negotiations to release capital from only part of the estate through an innovative sale and manage-back agreement.
During the negotiations it became clear there are a number of credible and well-funded groups with an interest in investing in managed retail estates, thus stimulating a new phase of consolidation.
The Board believes that a full sale is the best option to maximise value for the shareholders of S&N and to optimise the growth prospects of the Managed Retail business.
The intended sale of S&N Retail is being effected through an auction, managed by S&Ns advisers, Deutsche Bank and UBS.
It started immediately and information memoranda were dispatched at the end of June 2003.
The intended sale will require the approval of S&Ns shareholders in due course.
Completion is targeted before the end of 2003.
It is intended that a beer supply contract will be negotiated as part of the sale.
The proceeds of the sale will have a significant effect on the capital structure of the business.
By reducing net debt the sale will provide additional flexibility in financing the development of the beer business.
The Board of S&N remains committed to maintaining an efficient capital structure and will take appropriate actions to maintain this efficiency.
The sale of the Managed Retail business will be earnings dilutive but will enhance the Groups free cash flow.
