The items excluded from Business Performance are exceptional items as defined by Financial Reporting Standard FRS 3 i. e. items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of BG Group but which require separate disclosure in order to present a true and fair view of the performance during a period.
In the three years presented, the only exceptional item within operating profit is a 34 million profit relating to a legal ruling in favour of BG Group see Exceptional items operating results, below.
In addition, all profits and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and investments are reported as exceptional items see Exceptional items profit loss on disposals, below.
