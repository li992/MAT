TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Finance directors report For the year ended 31 December 2003 RESULTS Pre-tax profits were 162.7 million 2002: 137.6 million after charging goodwill amortisation of 15.3 million 2002: 12.1 million.
Pre-tax profits before goodwill amortisation of 15.3 million 2002: 12.1 million and property profits of nil 2002: 1.2 million were 178 million 2002: 148.5 million, an increase of 19.9 per cent.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and goodwill amortisation EBITDA as defined in note 34 were 218.3 million 2002: 180.1 million, an increase of 21.2 per cent.
Net interest payable for the year was 9.1 million compared with 8.9 million in 2002.
The tax charge was 53.8 million 33.1 per cent compared with 45.8 million 33.3 per cent in 2002.
The rate is higher than the UK corporation tax rate of 30 per cent principally because the effect of claiming a statutory deduction for share options exercised during the year is more than offset by goodwill amortisation and certain expenditure, which does not qualify for tax relief.
The effective tax rate, after adjusting for property profits and goodwill amortisation, was 30.2 per cent 2002: 30.8 per cent.
CASH FLOW As a result of higher profits and strong working capital management during 2003, operating cash flow was 230.8 million, an increase of 51 million or 28.4 per cent on 2002.
Like-for-like free cash flow as defined in note 32 for the year was 136.2 million 2002: 128.1 14 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC million.
The free cash generated by the group was used substantially to fund capital expenditure on the existing business and new acquisitions, which in total cost 119.2 million 2002: 143.9 million.
NET DEBT AND BORROWING FACILITIES In 2003 the group repaid a further 25 million of the term loan used to purchase Keyline in 1999.
Net debt at the year-end was 128.5 million 2002: 159.7 million, which represents a gearing level as defined in note 31 of 26.9 per cent 2002: 40.4 per cent.
Borrowings include 12.2 million 2002: 14.1 million of unsecured loan notes, which are redeemable at six monthly intervals ending in June 2015.
The group has 200 million of committed facilities, comprising a 75 million term loan repayable in April 2004, a 50 million loan due for repayment in November 2005, a 25 million loan repayable by instalments between 2004 and 2007 and a 50 million revolving syndicated credit facility available until April 2004.
It has overdraft facilities of 54 million.
At the year end the group had unutilised committed facilities of 50 million and unused overdraft facilities of 54 million.
With the expiry of the interest rate swap in November 2003, all of the groups borrowings are at variable rates.
The group is highly cash generative.
As a result it does not currently require significant long-term borrowings to fund its operations.
In April 2004, when the final tranche of the term loan is repaid and the revolving credit facility expires, it is likely that additional bilateral facilities will be obtained.
Interest cover, before goodwill amortisation as defined in note 5 is approximately 21 times 2002: 18 times, well within our borrowing covenants.
PENSIONS Whilst the recent improvements in world stock markets have boosted investment returns and so, together with higher funding, have increased the underlying pension scheme assets, the weakness in corporate bond yields, and the rise in anticipated inflation has caused a compensating increase in the 15 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC discounted value of scheme liabilities.
As a result the pension scheme gross funding deficit has reduced during the year by only 0.9 million to 121.6 million.
At 31 December 2003 the net deficit, after allowing for deferred tax, was 85.1 million compared with 85.8 million at 31 December 2002.
SHAREHOLDERS FUNDS Total equity shareholders funds, after deducting the pension scheme deficit at 31 December 2003, were 477 million, an increase of 81.6 million on 31 December 2002.
The return on equity shareholders funds before taxation as defined in note 33 increased to 29.3 per cent in 2003 from 29 per cent in 2002.
This level of return, after tax, was substantially higher than the groups weighted average cost of capital.
At the year-end the share price was 1,278 pence 2002: 1,005 pence and the market capitalisation 1,449 million 2002: 1,132 million, representing 3.0 times 2002: 2.9 times shareholders funds.
GOODWILL The net book value of goodwill in the balance sheet is 285.7 million, which is being amortised over 20 years.
Additions to goodwill in the year totalled 51.1 million.
TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT Treasury activities are managed centrally under a framework of policies and procedures approved and monitored by the board.
The objectives are to protect the assets of the group and to identify and then manage financial risk.
In applying its policies, the group will utilise derivative instruments, but only for risk management purposes.
The principal risk facing the group is an exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange risk as most purchases are invoiced in sterling.
These risks are described further on the next page.
16 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Interest rate risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and loan notes.
The group borrows at floating rates and, where necessary, uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates see note 20 to generate the preferred interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Currency risk The group usually buys currency at spot rates.
While this was the situation during 2003, forward contracts may be purchased where appropriate.
Liquidity risk The groups policy has been to ensure that it has committed borrowing facilities in place in excess of its peak forecast gross borrowings for at least the next twelve months.
The current refinancing is discussed above under Net Debt and Borrowing Facilities.
