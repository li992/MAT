Operating and Financial Review The following discussion of our operating and financial condition includes certain financial information extracted without adjustment from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
This financial information is a summary and you should read the entire Annual Report carefully.
Overview We were incorporated on March 21, 1996, and commenced commercial operations in July 1996.
We delivered our software products to our first customer in November 1996.
We established our U. S. operations, which are conducted through Autonomy, Inc. in 1996.
Revenues Substantially all of our revenues currently are derived from licenses of our technology, through direct and indirect sales, including royalty-based licenses to OEM customers and provision of support and maintenance under licenses.
"We recognize license revenue under SOP 97-2 ""Software revenue recognition"" issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants."
Under the terms of SOP 97-2, where an arrangement to deliver software does not require significant production, modification or customization, we recognize license revenue under the residual method when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists: delivery has occurred: our fee is fixed or determinable: and collectability is probable.
Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenues primarily consists of packaging and shipping: printed software documentation: third-party labor, primarily for training: third-party license fees for incidental technology such as installation packages: other costs associated with the delivery of software products from which license revenue is derived which arise from time-to-time such as specific technology to address emerging technology and delivery platforms: and the cost of providing after-sale support and maintenance services to customers, including labor costs.
Operating Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses, consultant fees and expenses related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our family of products.
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs of marketing programs, including advertising, trade show, public relations and promotional expenses, provisions for doubtful accounts, and salaries, commissions and related personnel expenses for our sales force and marketing staff.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive, accounting and administrative personnel, professional fees such as accounting and legal services and other general corporate expenses.
Amortization of stock-based compensation results from the granting of stock options to employees and consultants with exercise prices per share determined for financial purposes to be below the deemed fair value per share of our ordinary shares on the dates of grant.
Results of Operations Years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Revenues.......................................................................... $ 54.9 7.7% $ 51.0 3.1 % $ 52.6 The increase in revenues from 2002 to 2003 was primarily the result of improvement in the general economic environment which affected worldwide IT spending patterns leading to increased activity levels at the end of 2003.
2003 results also include revenues from our acquisition of Virage, Inc. in September 2003, but which accounted for less than 10% of total revenues for the year and which offset revenues we otherwise may have received in the rich media markets from Dremedia and SoftSound.
The decrease in revenues from 2001 to 2002 was primarily the result of the general worldwide slowdown in the macro-economic environment which affected IT spending patterns including, in particular, the lengthening of purchasing cycles.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Cost of revenues................................................................ $ 2.3 142.1% $ 0.9 51.0 % $ 1.9 The increase in cost of revenues from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to costs of $0.8 million relating to services performed by Virage, and costs of $0.4 million relating to Autonomy training, each of which were not incurred during 2002.
During 2003 new costs of revenue associated with Virage included approximately $0.2 million relating to license royalties, $0.1 million for hosting services, $0.4 million for salaries of services personnel, $0.1 million for hardware and $0.1 million for packaging.
During 2003 we incurred approximately $0.4 million in costs for training by third-party services providers in connection with larger customer contracts.
The decrease in cost of revenues from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to lower hardware expenditures, third party licenses and appointing third parties for training, implementation and other services.
In particular, third party licenses for development of software for new mobile phone networks decreased by $0.7 million from 2001 to 2002, and costs of training decreased by $35,000 from 2001 to 2002.
28 Operating and Financial Review 2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Amortization of purchased intangibles............................... $ 0.4 N M $ $ Amortization of purchased intangibles arose in 2003 in connection with acquisitions during the year.
In particular, during 2003 we incurred costs of $0.4 million for the amortization of purchased intangibles relating to the acquisition of Dremedia Limited in May 2003 and Virage, Inc. in September 2003.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Research and development................................................ $ 11.9 29.2% $ 9.2 7.6% $ 8.5 The increase in research and development expenses from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to increased research and development headcount and an increase in reported U. K. and European expenses due to the weaker U. S. dollar.
Research and development headcount increased from approximately 75 at December 31, 2002, to approximately 105 at December 31, 2003, primarily as a result of the Virage acquisition, resulting in increased expenses of approximately $1.6 million.
Research and development expenses in the U. K. and Europe increased by approximately $0.7 million, primarily due to the increase in the value of the pound sterling and Euro versus the U. S. dollar.
The increase in research and development expenses from 2001 to 2002 was due to costs of $1.4 million associated with the development of new products, including Autonomy's Collaboration and Expertise Networks, Legacy Compatibility Modules and the new development of PODs, offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in personnel costs.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Sales and marketing.......................................................... $ 28.7 8.0 % $ 31.2 4.6 % $ 32.7 The decrease in sales and marketing expenses from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in labor, travel and expenses costs and spending on specific projects, offset by the effect of the increase of the value of the pound sterling and the Euro versus the U. S. dollar.
More specifically, during 2003 labor costs decreased by $1.4 million due to lower average headcount for the first nine months of the year prior to our acquisition of Virage in September 2003, and sales commissions decreased by $0.6 million due to a change in the geographic and size-of-transaction mix.
During 2003 we also reduced travel and expenses expenditure by $0.3 million due to tighter controls.
Finally, other marketing costs, including advertising, media, tradeshows and direct marketing initiatives, decreased by $1.4 million.
The decreases in expenses were offset by $1.5 million due to the effect of the increase in the value of the pound sterling and Euro versus the U. S. dollar on expenses incurred outside the United States.
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses from 2001 to 2002 was due to a number of factors, including a decrease in advertising, promotion, marketing and public relations rates, representing savings of approximately $2.8 million, offset by increased sales commissions of approximately $0.3 million.
During 2003 expenses for accounting and tax advice increased by $0.5 million, primarily due to due diligence relating to mergers and acquisitions.
General and administrative personnel increased during 2003 due to expansion of our U. S. operations, resulting in increased expenses of $0.3 million, and legal costs for employment matters increased by $0.2 million.
Finally, expenses increased by $0.4 million due to the effect of the increase in the value of the pound sterling and Euro versus the U. S. dollar as the majority of our general and administrative staff is located in the U. K. The decrease in general and administrative expenses from 2001 to 2002 was principally due to a decrease in staff costs in 2002 of approximately $0.5 million, and a decrease in office costs in 2002 of $0.7 million due to lower rates on and closure of serviced office facilities.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Share-based compensation............................................... $ 0.1 N M $ 100 % $ 0.2 The increase in share-based compensation from 2002 to 2003 was wholly related to options granted by Virage, Inc. which we assumed when we acquired Virage in September 2003.
The credit in 2001 principally related to options which were cancelled when an employee's employment terminated against which we previously had recorded a charge.
Operating and Financial Review 29 Interest income, net.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Interest income................................................................. $ 3.8 26.6 % $ 5.1 20.5 % $ 6.4 The decrease in interest income from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates and lower cash balances as a result of our acquisition of Virage in September 2003 and our share repurchase program in 2003.
Cash balances were $102.3 million and $147.5 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
During 2003 we repurchased for cancellation approximately 12.3 million shares at a total cost of $32.7 million, and purchased Virage for a net cash cost of approximately $13.3 million.
The decrease in interest income from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to decreases in interest rates.
Cash balances were $147.5 million and $143.6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Impairment of investments................................................. $ 100% $ 1.9 625% $ 0.3 During 2003 we did not write down any investments, compared to the write-down of four investments during 2002 and the write down of two investments during 2001.
We normally write down the entire value of investments when we are informed or become aware the company in which we have an investment faces a solvency issue and any expected funding round has failed.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Gain on foreign exchange.................................................. $ 0.7 437.4% $ 0.1 97.3 % $ 5.1 The increase in gain on foreign exchange from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to the value of debtor balances in currencies other than the U. S. dollar such as the Euro and pounds sterling increasing in value due to the weakening of the U. S. dollar versus these other currencies.
The decrease in gain on foreign exchange from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to conversion of substantially all of our dollar denominated cash deposits into sterling in May 2001, and the relative weakening of the U. S. dollar versus other currencies.
Profit before provision benefit for income taxes and share of loss of associated company and minority interest.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Pro t before provision bene t for income taxes and share of loss of associated company and minority interest... $ 7.7 17.8% $ 6.5 51.2 % $ 13.3 Net Pro t.......................................................................... $ 6.2 0.7% $ 6.1 34.6 % $ 9.4 The increase in profit before provision benefit for income taxes and share of loss of associated company and minority interest from 2002 to 2003 reflects an increase in revenues of 7.1% from 2002 to 2003 compared with a smaller increase in operating expenses and a $1.9 million write-down of investments in 2002.
The decrease in profit before provision benefit for income taxes and share of loss of associated company and minority interest, and net profit, from 2001 to 2002 was primarily attributable to a decrease of gain on foreign exchange of $5.0 million or 98.0% from 2001 to 2002 due to conversion of substantially all of our dollar denominated cash deposits into sterling in May 2001, and the relative weakening of the U. S. dollar versus other currencies discussed above.
Our effective tax rate in 2003 increased primarily due to the availability of fewer operating losses offsetting against increased profits compared to 2002.
Our effective group tax rate fell from 29% in 2001 to a benefit of 4% in 2002 primarily through the use of operating losses and research and development credits to offset against profits from operations.
In each period a valuation allowance was recorded against net deferred tax assets to reduce the amount of such assets to that which is more likely than not to be realized.
Share of loss of associated company and minority interest.
2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Share of loss of associated company and minority interest.
$ 0.1 87.7 % $ 0.6 646% $ 0.1 Share of loss of associated company and minority interest consisted of losses of Dremedia Limited in 2002 and 2003 through May 13, 2003, when we acquired a 100% interest in Dremedia and SoftSound Limited in 2001, 2002 and 2003 through September 4, 2003, when we acquired a 100% interest in 30 Operating and Financial Review SoftSound.
The decrease in share of losses of associated company and minority interest from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to lower losses of the associated companies and the inclusion in 2003 of only five months of operations for Dremedia and nine months of operations for SoftSound, versus 12 months for each of Dremedia and SoftSound in 2002.
Conversely, the increase in share of losses of associated company and minority interest from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to the inclusion of 12 months of operations for Dremedia in 2002 compared to six months in 2001, and increased investment by SoftSound.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents totalled $102.3 million at December 31, 2003, compared to a balance of $147.5 million at December 31, 2002.
During 2003 cash was primarily utilized for our share repurchase program and for acquisitions, as discussed below.
Net cash used in provided by operating activities was as follows: 2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Net cash used in provided by operating activities............. $ 5.7 274.6 % $ 3.3 48.5 % $ 6.4 The decrease in cash generation from 2002 to an operating cash outflow in 2003 was primarily due to one-time expenses related to the acquisition of Virage, including approximately $2.0 million relating to the termination of a lease for excess office space, and approximately $1.3 million relating to the unwinding of net working capital liabilities acquired with Virage.
The increase in cash generation from 2001 to 2002, was primarily due to fluctuating revenues during periods of comparatively stable operating expenses.
Net cash used in investing activities was as follows: 2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Net cash used in investing activities................................... $ 16.2 1,036% $ 1.4 35.0 % $ 2.2 Cash was used during all of these periods to acquire office equipment and software licenses and to purchase investments.
In particular, in 2003 net cash of $13.3 million was used for the purchase of Virage, Inc. net cash of $0.6 million was used for general trade investments and net cash of approximately $0.8 million was used to acquire software licenses for internal business use.
In 2002 net cash of $0.9 million was used for general trade investments.
In 2001 net cash of $1.7 million was used for office equipment in connection with movement to our new corporate headquarters and $0.4 million was used to invest in Dremedia Limited.
We currently do not have significant capital spending or short-term purchase commitments, but expect to continue to engage in capital spending in the ordinary course of business.
Net cash used in provided by financing activities was as follows: 2003 % change 2002 % change 2001 dollars in millions Net cash used in provided by nancing activities.............. $ 32.6 168.8% $ 12.1 NM $ 0.7 Net cash used in financing activities in 2003 and 2002 was primarily used for our share repurchase program, which commenced during 2002 and continued during 2003.
During 2003, we purchased for cancellation 12,332,084 shares at an average price of approximately $2.63 per share.
During 2002, we purchased for cancellation 4,980,286 shares at an average price of approximately $2.38 per share.
In total we have purchased for cancellation an aggregate of 17,312,370 shares at an average price of approximately $2.55 per share.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 primarily consisted of the receipt of the exercise price of employee share options.
We do not have any indebtedness.
Our annual contractual commitment under operating leases is $3.3 million, as discussed below.
We do not have any financial guarantees or related covenants.
Substantially all of our cash balances are held in short-term deposits paying market interest rates.
We hold material cash balances in U. S. dollars, pounds sterling and Euros.
We do not currently undertake currency hedging transactions to cover our transaction or translation exposures, but we may choose to hedge a portion of these exposures in the future.
Any losses incurred in connection with currency hedging transactions would adversely affect our operating results.
We expect to experience growth in our working capital needs for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan.
Our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing, marketing, selling and supporting our products and the timing and extent of establishing international operations.
We expect to continue to devote substantial capital resources to hire staff and expand our sales, support, marketing and product development activities, to expand marketing programs, to establish additional facilities world-wide and for other general corporate activities including share repurchase programs.
This may constitute a material use of our cash resources.
In addition, we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, technologies or products.
We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
We do not maintain a line of credit or overdraft facility.
