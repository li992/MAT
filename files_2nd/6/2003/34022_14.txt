Regulatory guidelines define three Tiers of capital resources.
Tier 1 capital, comprising mainly shareholders funds and including Reserve Capital Instruments and Tier One Notes, is the highest tier and can be used to meet trading and banking activity requirements.
Tier 2 includes perpetual, medium-term and long-term subordinated debt, general provisions for bad and doubtful debts and xed asset revaluation reserves.
Tier 2 capital can be used to support both trading and banking activities.
Tier 3 capital comprises short-term subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of two years.
The use of tier 3 capital is restricted to trading activities only and it is not eligible to support counterparty or settlement risk.
The aggregate of tiers 2 and 3 capital included in the risk asset ratio calculation may not exceed tier 1 capital.
