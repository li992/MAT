This issue increased the level of corporate bonds from 585 million at September 2002 to 835 million at September 2003.
The proceeds of the issue were used to repay syndicated bank debt.
Following the end of the financial year, on 23 October 2003, a further issue of 350 million of bonds was made which has been consolidated with the issue made in March 2003, to bring the total amount to 600 million.
The proceeds were used to repay syndicated bank debt.
A total of 1,185 million of long-term debt facilities are now in place at a weighted average interest cost of 6.5% per annum and with a weighted average life to maturity of almost 19 years.
Balance Sheet The net assets of the Group at the year end were 1,082.3 million which compares with 693.5 million as at 30 September 2002.
The book value of the pub estate has increased by 13% in the year from 2,233.0 million to 2,512.4 million.
This increase includes a revaluation surplus of 283.5 million, following completion of the annual valuation exercise.
Pubs within the estate are valued on an existing use basis, principally by Humberts Leisure Limited Humberts, the Companys retained valuer.
They report that during the year there has been increased demand and competition for good quality individual pubs which has resulted in higher prices being achieved.
These recent market developments have been reflected in the valuation of the Enterprise estate which does not include a lotting premium.
In the past, Humberts had advised this would have been about 20%, but given the significant increase in individual pub values, Humberts now advise that a lotting premium would be in the order of 10%.
Enterprise Inns Annual Report 2003 10 Finance Directors Report Interest Excluding the contribution in the year from Unique, net interest payable was 92.0 million, which was covered 2.8 times.
At the time of the acquisition of Laurel, interest rate swap contracts swaps of 550 million were put in place at an interest rate payable of 5.75% until 30 November 2004, and at a rate of 6.66% thereafter, until termination on 1 June 2012.
These swaps, along with interest rates fixed through the issue of secured bonds, result in 99% of the Groups debt at the year end being fixed at a blended interest rate of less than 7% for a weighted average life of almost 16 years.
Tax charge The tax charge of 48.6 million represents an effective rate of 28.1% and is in line with the rate reported at the half year.
The effective rate is below the statutory rate of 30% due to the release of 4.9 million of provisions no longer required following the closure of prior years computations.
The tax charge of 48.6 million comprises corporation tax of 17.6 million and deferred tax of 31.0 million.
The current year corporation tax charge represents only 10.2% of profits.
This reflects a one-off tax deduction of 17 million in respect of a write-down in value relating to interest rate swaps in subsidiary companies, which will reverse over the 10 year life of the swaps.
Dividend payment The directors are recommending the payment of a final dividend of 11.4 pence per ordinary share of 10 pence each to be paid on 26 January 2004.
This will result in a full year dividend of 17.1 pence per share, an increase of 21% on prior year.
The dividend is covered 4.3 times.
