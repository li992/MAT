Financial review Introduction The review is divided into the following The 2003 financial year was characterised by a focus sections: on implementing and delivering the three-year strategy 28 Introduction announced in April 2002 and further corporate 30 Group results transactions in the continued restructuring of the group 30 Line of business results and reduction of net debt.
The corporate transactions 31 BT Retail included the unwind of the Concert joint venture on 33 BT Wholesale 1 April 2002 and the disposal of our interest in Cegetel 34 BT Global Services for 2.6 billion.
35 Other operating income The 2002 financial year was dominated by a series of corporate transactions designed to focus and 35 Operating costs transform the group and reduce its net debt position.

In this Financial review the 45 Balance sheet commentary is therefore focused principally on the 45 Return on capital employed trading results of the continuing activities of BT Group 45 Pensions before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
In 46 Regulation and prices comparing the continuing activities of the group, the 46 Competition and the UK economy results of our discontinued activities, namely our 46 Environment Japanese telecom and Spanish mobile investments, Yell and mmO are excluded.
Goodwill amortisation is 46 Geographical information 2 excluded because the annual charge has varied 47 Regulatory financial information signicantly during the period under review as a result 47 Critical accounting policies of the corporate transactions noted above and the 47 New UK accounting standards exceptional impairment charges.
The exceptional items 48 Economic and Monetary Union EMU are excluded because they predominantly relate to the 48 US GAAP corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group.
This is also consistent with the way that Please see cautionary statement regarding forwardfinancial performance is measured by management and we believe allows a meaningful comparison to be made looking statements on page 142. of the trading results of the group during the period under review.
The goodwill amortisation and exceptional items are therefore analysed and discussed separately from the line of business results in this Financial review because they are considered to be a reection of the corporate activity rather than the trading activity of the lines of business.
The following table shows the summarised profit and loss account which includes a reconciliation of the key performance measures before and after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and is discussed further in this Financial review.
The operating results by line of business are discussed in addition to the overall group results as we believe the activities and markets they serve are distinct and this analysis provides a greater degree of insight to investors.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
The consensus addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve multiple revenue generating activities, for example, the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and or rights to use assets.
In applying this guidance, separate contracts with the same party, entered into at or near the same time, will be presumed to be a package, and the consideration will be measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values.
This consensus guidance will be applicable to agreements entered into after 15 June 2003.
BT is currently evaluating the impact of this new pronouncement.
In January 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Method Loss Recognition.
This consensus states that if the additional investment, in whole or in part, represents the funding of prior losses, the investor should recognise previously suspended losses.
When appropriate to recognise prior losses, the amount recognised would be limited to the amount of the additional investment determined to represent the funding of prior losses.
The consensus is effective for additional investments made after 5 February 2003.
This consensus is not expected to have a material impact on BTs consolidated financial statements.
