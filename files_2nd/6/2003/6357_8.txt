Financial review For the year ended 30 September 2003 Operating Results The overall results are commented upon by the Chairman in his statement and operational trading is reviewed by Nick Buckles and in the regional reviews.
Acquisitions significant acquisitions in the year were 1 the extension of our ownership of Geldnet, the Dutch cash services company, from 25%, accounted for as an associate, to 100%, a wholly-owned subsidiary, and 2 the merger of our associate in Malaysia with Safeguards Corporation.
Other acquisitions were made in Africa and Asia.
Acquisitions are detailed in note 21 a on page 65 and their contribution to the turnover and profit of the group during the year is shown in note 1 on pages 47 and 48.
Disposals The most significant disposal in the year was the sale of our 50% interest in the Securicor Distribution joint venture.
We also completed the exit from the communications sector with the sale of Securicor Information Systems, sold Securicor Cash Machine and exited from operations in Angola and Equatorial Guinea.
Disposals are detailed in note 21 b on page 66 and their contribution to the turnover and profit of the group during the year is shown in note 1 on pages 47 and 48.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are shown in note 2 b on page 49.
They comprise three main elements: 1 a profit of 65.7m on the sale of our 50% share of Securicor Distribution, 2 a loss of 30.5m on the sale of Securicor Information Systems, and 3 a goodwill impairment charge of 28.6m relating to the exit from the US aviation security business.
The net cash inow in respect of these exceptional items was 182.0m.
Accounting standards FRS17 Retirement benets was issued by the Accounting Standards Board in November 2000, but in November 2002 it was announced that it will not be fully mandatory until 2005.
The disclosures required prior to full implementation are made in note 4 c on pages 50 to 52 and pension fund valuation is discussed later in this review.
As a group operating across the world, we welcome moves towards the harmonisation of accounting standards, including the adoption of International Accounting Standards by the European Union.
We are required to report in accordance with these standards for the year ending 30 September 2006.
22 Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Accounting for goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life which is not expected to exceed 20 years.
The charge for goodwill amortisation in the accounts for the year to 30 September 2003 excluding joint ventures and associated undertakings amounted to 12.5m.
Goodwill included in the balance sheet as an intangible asset at 30 September 2003 amounted to 219.2m.
Taxation The taxation charge of 18.3m provided upon profit before exceptional items and goodwill represents a tax rate of 29%.
The disposal of Securicor Information Systems gave rise to a significant tax benefit and 14.4m tax relief has been provided against exceptional items and goodwill amortisation totalling 13.4m.
Potential tax assets amounting to 20.3m have not been recognised as their utilisation is uncertain and or long-term.
Cashow Cash generation in the year to 30 September 2003 was good after a strong prior year.
Net cash ow from operating activities was 96.9m 2002: 127.4m, and free cash ow after capital expenditure was 57.2m 2002: 70.5m.
Net cash inow from acquisitions and disposals amounted to 156.0m, including 156.9m net of associated costs on the disposal of the remaining 50% of the Distribution joint venture.
75m of these proceeds was returned to shareholders by way of a special dividend.
Net cash inow in the year was 106.9m and the decrease in net debt, after allowing for finance leases, borrowings acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries and translation adjustments, was 84.0m.
Financing and treasury activities The groups treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability of adequate and costeffective finance for the groups operating activities and for managing both exchange rate and interest rate exposures.
It is not permitted to speculate in foreign currency or derivative financial instruments, although it does make limited use of such instruments to hedge exposures on interest rate or currency uctuations which arise from the groups operations.
At the beginning of the year committed or guaranteed credit lines in place totalled 316m.
During the year net repayments of 3m and favourable exchange rate movements of 8m increased the value of the facilities reported in sterling to 321m.
The facilities comprise a 123m term loan from four major UK banks, repayable in tranches in December 2003, December 2004 and December 2005, 80m available by way of a revolving credit facility with the same four banks, committed until December 2005, and a further 118m repayable in December 2003 and throughout 2004.
Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 23 Financial review continued At 30 September 2003 net debt of 114.5m represented a gearing of 42%.
The group has substantial capacity to finance growth, which will be enhanced by future cash generation from the groups focus upon security activities.
Interest rates The groups deposits and borrowings, including those negotiated after 30 September 2003, are at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
Foreign currency The group has many foreign subsidiaries and associates denominated in many different currencies.
Group policy is to match significant net investments denominated in foreign currencies with borrowings in the same currencies.
The translation exposure arising from revenues and expenses of foreign businesses is not hedged.
significant transactions denominated in a foreign currency may be hedged using forward contracts.
The group currently has no such contracts outstanding.
Dividends As referred to above, the group paid a special dividend of 12.0p per share, totalling 75m, from the proceeds of the sale of our 50% share of Securicor Distribution.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 1.62p per share which, taken with the interim dividend of 0.78p per share, makes a total ordinary dividend of 2.40p per share for the year ended 30 September 2003.
This represents an increase of 13.7% over the previous years dividend per share.
In proposing this final dividend, the directors considered both the appropriate level of dividend cover and the future strategy and prospective earnings of the group.
The company intends to follow a progressive dividend policy whilst maintaining a long-term dividend cover in the range 3.5 to 4 on normalised profit after tax excluding goodwill amortisation, compared to 3.4 in the current year.
Corporate governance The groups policies regarding risk management and corporate governance are set out in the corporate governance report on pages 32 and 33.
Pensions The full triennial actuarial assessment of the groups main UK final salary pension scheme which is closed to most new entrants was carried out as at 5 April 2003 and updated to 30 September 2003.
24 Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 The assessment revealed the schemes funding levels in respect of past service under the different regulatory measures to be as follows: Minimum Funding Requirement The funding level was approximately 110%.
SSAP24 There was a shortfall of 21m 15m after tax.
The improved performance of the equity markets since the end of September has resulted in this shortfall being completely eradicated.
FRS17 This valuation indicated a shortfall of 135m 95m after tax.
The value of the fund had increased by approximately 40m by 31 December 2003.
There has been a degree of recovery in equity values in the year to 30 September 2003, but the funding valuations must also take account of increasing longevity expectations.
We continue to believe that, over the long-term, improved investment returns should eliminate the deficit in the scheme in respect of past service liabilities.
However, in recognition of the currently reported deficits, an additional cash contribution of 5m 3.5m after tax is being made to the scheme in the year commencing 1 October 2003.
This will not affect the profit and loss account.
As regards future service benets, contribution rates have been increased, following actuarial advice, from 12% to 14% as from 1 October 2003, which will increase the cost of the scheme by approximately 1.5m a year before tax.
Going concern The directors are confident that, after making enquiries and on the basis of current financial projections and available facilities, they have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
