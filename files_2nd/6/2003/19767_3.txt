Operating and financial review The business, its objectives and strategy Group activities TBI plc is the holding company of an international group of companies.
It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 350 index.
Our trading companies are almost exclusively in the business of airports: either Keith Brooks owning and operating airports, managing airports or providing services to Chief Executive airport customers.
Most of our earnings are generated from airports we both own and operate.
Analysis of airport EBITDA-2003 % Airport ownership 92% Airport services 2% Airport management 6% Dynamics of the business The key economic driver of our business is passengers.
The more passengers using our airports the greater our revenues and, therefore, our profitability.
We have two key customer groups influencing this key economic driver: airlines Caroline Price and their passengers.
We earn from the airlines, primarily on a price per passenger.
Finance Director We earn from the passengers by dint of spend related rental arrangements with retailers and similar.
Unlike many airports, TBIs airports are not financially regulated: we charge the airlines what the market will bear, and earn from the passengers in proportion to the amount that they spend whilst at the airport.

As a consequence, incremental passengers should mean incremental profits.
At various points in time passenger volume related constraints will arise and, at that time, the fixed cost element of our business can change.
Strategy Our strategy remains consistent: to be an operator of regional airports where we can make a difference.
That ability to make a difference reflects a variety of aspects: the exact nature and role of our involvement, the political environment, as well as the economic fundamentals of the airport and the region in question.
Our past behaviour bears out this strategy.
TBI people Our people are loyal, committed and highly skilled.
We operate in an industry which has been subject to enormous change over the past few years and the flexibility and efforts of our people have helped us to move forward continuously.
Whilst we definitely have a TBI type, that type defies absolute definition and much of the fun and the enthusiasm generated as we work together arise from our differences.
Again, thank you to our people for everything that they have brought to the business in what has been another challenging year for the industry and for TBI.

Our airline customer base has significantly changed within the past two years.
In the year to March 2001, 32% of our terminal passengers were travelling on Paul Kehoe full service airlines.
In the year to March 2003 this number fell to 21%, and in the Executive Director UK it represented only 10%.
However, the absolute number of terminal Managing Director passengers travelling through TBI airports increased by 1% to 15.2 million in London Luton Airport 2003.
This was because, in the meantime, the low cost airlines increased the number of routes, flights and passengers taking their proportion of our traffic from 39% in 2001 to an anticipated 63% in 2004, based on services already announced by those airlines.
It is interesting to see how the passenger composition of each of our UK airports has tended towards a certain profile: Actual anticipated pax profile from Actual anticipated pax profile from UK airports UK airports Pax m Pax mix % Charter Charter Scheduled Scheduled Low cost Low cost Larry Gouldthorpe Executive Director Luton Luton Managing Director 2001 2001 00.0 Orlando Sanford 2004 2004 Belfast Belfast 2001 2001 00.0 2004 2004 Cardiff Cardiff 2001 2001 2004 2004 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% In 2004 we anticipate having fewer than 0.9 million full service scheduled passengers using our UK airports.
The low cost airlines using TBI airports have also altered significantly during the year.
In November 2002 bmibaby established its second UK base at Cardiff Airport: initially flying over 100 times a week and carrying some 180,000 passengers within the five month period.
The people of Wales have responded with enthusiasm to the Baby and bmibaby have recently based a further aircraft at Cardiff which will increase the flying to some 160 times a week and provide anticipated annualised passenger numbers of some 750,000.
In London Luton, easyJet started its Paris route during the year and announced new routes into Faro and Alicante for 2003 4.
In Belfast, MyTravelLite began operations to Birmingham: bmibaby launched services to East Midlands and Cardiff and continues to grow with the recent introduction of services to Manchester.
In addition, despite the takeover of Go by easyJet previously both customers of Belfast, absolute passenger numbers from the two airlines increased by 34%.
Perhaps the most dramatic news for TBI on the low cost front was that Ryanair started a base operation at Stockholm Skavsta with effect from 4 April 2003 with an immediate anticipated increase in annual passenger numbers for Skavsta from 0.3 million in 2003 to 1.5 million in 2004.
07 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Different airlines use the airports in different ways, and as a consequence pay us differently.
For example, low cost airlines at London Luton remain at a stand to allow passengers to disembark and embark for an average 25 minutes: when we had flag carrier airlines at Belfast the same process could take approximately 60 minutes.
This rapid turnaround time enables us to manage more passengers through the airport within the same time: a more efficient use of the airport.
With that comes a price though we charge low cost airlines only a proportion of the per passenger fee we would charge a flag carrier.
This fundamental shift in the economic model has been seen most vividly in the Albert Harrison past year or two.
We are now at a revised base level of revenues, retaining Managing Director almost no flag carrier services within the UK.
Henceforward we should be able Belfast International Airport to demonstrate once again the financial dynamics of the airport business more flights, more passengers, incremental revenues, more profits.
In addition to the per capita passenger fee, airlines also pay us for the use of landside airport facilities and reimburse certain security costs.
Our customers: the passengers Approximately 35% of our owned and operated airport turnover is generated directly from passengers spending as they pass through the airport.
In 2001, before full fare airlines largely departed UK regional airports, only 20% of our turnover, on a similar basis, was derived from passengers retail, catering and car parking expenditure.
In these changing times it must remain an objective to increase this proportion.
Jon Horne Generally we do not undertake passenger spend opportunities ourselves.
Managing Director Instead, we enter into rental arrangements so that the outlet pays us a turnover Cardiff International Airport related rent, usually subject to a minimum guarantee.
Our major sources of income are car parking, retail and catering: Analysis of airport commercial income % Car park 40% Retail 30% Catering 11% Car hire 5% Other 14% The average passenger generates some 6.61 of revenues for the Group on a round trip travelling from, and then returning, to our UK airports as follows: Average passenger spend in UK airports Car park Banking Other retail Car hire Duty Free Amusements Catering Other 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 08 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review RET RETAIL AIL Our focus is on updating the retail offer in our terminals to appeal to a changing passenger profile Over 4,000 bottles a week Over 4,000 bottles of perfume are sold a week in our European airports SAFETY AND SECURITY CHECK-IN Safety and security are given priority 24 hours a day, 365 days a year using advanced technology and trained staff SAFETY AND SECURITY RETAIL 09 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review 20,000 hot drinks 20,000 cups of tea and coffee are consumed in our UK airports each week AIRFIELD OPERATIONS Co-operation between TBIs airports helps us to enhance the quality and efficiency of our airfield operations and safety units CATERING CHECK-IN The wide range of landside and airside catering facilities in all our terminals offers something for every kind of passenger, including food and drink to go for passengers on the move AIRFIELD CATERING OPERATIONS 10 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Car parking revenues can be substantial.
In London Luton we earned some 21% of total turnover from car parking activities: and we are almost at the point where demand exceeds supply.
As a result, decisions as to capacity and pricing must be taken in the foreseeable future.
We are also considering ways in which to optimise the performance of our car parks across the Group insourcing, out-sourcing and everything in between.
Taken together, there are currently some 18,700 spaces at our three UK airports, generating net revenues of 18.4 million.
Car park usage by passengers is relatively complex on average, passengers travelling on charter airlines tend to stay longer than other passengers: but have a higher number of passengers per car.
Passengers using low cost airlines tend to have a shorter duration of stay and are generally less likely to park but if they do decide to drive to the airport there will be fewer people in the car.
Retail, both airside and landside, has been the subject of a revised contract covering Belfast and Cardiff airports.
At both locations, the increases in passenger numbers will open more doors and provide more options as to which retailers will consider establishing an outlet.
Perhaps Skavsta most graphically represents the importance of exceeding base levels of passengers before being able to attract concessionaires to an airport.
Previously we have had to operate the car park, retail and foreign exchange activities ourselves because we could not attract any concessionaires.
We simply could not persuade a bank to put in a cash point machine since the establishment of the Ryanair base we have had seven offers of cash point machines and numerous approaches on the retail and car parking front!
At London Luton most of our retail concessions reach the end of their lease term in 2004: this offers us an excellent opportunity to ensure that our retail mix is improved to better reflect our passenger profile.
Catering activities in the UK have this year been subject to a cross airport deal which has resulted in a better quality of catering and a better financial deal for us.
This has been a prime example of the power of the Group the ability to offer a significant contract within the context of UK regional airports has undoubtedly resulted in a better deal for TBI as a whole as well as the individual entities.
In addition to a single substantial contract we also have other catering concessions in our airports which, taken together, mean that we earned on average some 28 pence per arriving or departing passenger.
This represents a 17% increase on prior year income levels.
In Belfast, in particular, we have high hopes of further increases as a result of the new landside food court which opened in April 2003, and the more recent opening of an airside restaurant run by Paul Rankin, the renowned Belfast, Michelin-starred chef.
Other sources of commercial income include areas such as foreign exchange, car hire, advertising income and gaming machines.
Anthony Alicastro Dot Gade Kulovuori Managing Director Managing Director Bolivian Airports Stockholm Skavsta Airport 11 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Operational activities The change in our customer profile and their different requirements and objectives means that we need, as operators of airports, to be open minded and responsive.
We also need to develop new ways to do things, ever better, ever more efficiently.
Alongside the commercial imperative to adjust the way that we do business there is the overriding challenge of operating within a heightened security environment.
We are confident that both imperatives are continually being addressed and it is a plaudit to our operational team at each airport, and to our business risk team, that these challenges are being taken forward so effectively.
It is good to witness the benefits of a broad experience base with each airport able to pass on the benefit of its particular expertise to the others within the Group.
In March 2003, London Luton Airport opened its new operations and communications centre: bringing together a range of previously segregated skills.
Belfast is currently going down the same route and benefiting from the experiences and solutions developed at London Luton.
Again in London Luton we have introduced interactive information kiosks to respond to passengers enquiries given that at least 90% of the easyJet passengers at London Luton have proven their comfort level with technology of this sort simply by having booked their flights on-line the information kiosks have been very well received.
This was an initiative which has delivered cost savings as well as customer satisfaction: but will not necessarily be suited to airports with a different passenger profile.
Interestingly, the sharing of technical know-how is not limited to the larger airports showing others the way.
For example the fruits of the co-operation in snow management planning between our Skavsta and London Luton management teams were borne when London Luton remained open during snowfall which left other airports in similar conditions closed.
Also, our operations team in La Paz, Bolivia who at 14,000 ft above sea level endure the widest variety of weather conditions have developed a superb runway preventative maintenance programme which they will be rolling out to the rest of our airports.

Mostly this took the form of normal maintenance and investment.
However there were two particular projects that were very substantial for the entities undertaking them.
The first was at London Luton where a 5.0 million project to develop and construct a walkway and holding areas for passengers was designed and delivered on budget and on time.
This facility has improved the operational efficiency of the airport as well as the customers experience.
The other significant project, at Stockholm Skavsta, will straddle 2003 and 2004.
Our existing terminal building had capacity for approximately one million passengers, which offered comfortable headroom for Skavsta with its 0.3 million passengers.
It was announced in late February 2003 that Skavsta would become a Ryanair base, with an immediate increase in passenger numbers to 1.5 million per annum expected.
Ever cautious, we had not begun any construction work but the operational, logistical and development challenge that this has placed on the local team and its supporters around the Group has been immense.
An extended terminal, designed specifically to suit the requirements of a low fare operator and its passengers, has been designed and construction has commenced.
In the meantime temporary measures, such as a tent the size of a football pitch, have been adopted true ingenuity and a fine example of the mentality required in order to do good business going forward.
We are confident that all our airports will benefit from the experiences of the Skavsta team.
South East Regional Air Study SERAS and London Luton Airport In July 2002, The Department for Transport DfT, in its consultation document on the future of aviation, recognised the valuable contribution which London Luton plays in the airport infrastructure in the UK and in particular the south east of England.
The document put forward a number of options to facilitate meeting the forecast future demand for passenger growth over the next thirty years.
This initial paper was superseded by a second edition, which included the expansion of Gatwick as an option but confirmed the need for London Luton to grow to meet demand under any future scenario.
We have long recognised London Lutons importance to the debate both in terms of its strategic value and catchment area and also as a true competitor to the quasi monopolistic BAA plc.
Notwithstanding the DfTs options, which suggest that London Luton can provide capacity of 31 million passengers per annum, we believe that London Luton has the capability of making a greater contribution than that foreseen in the original documents.
15 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Financial review Overall results The trading results for the year ended 31 March 2003 are the first full year to reflect a fundamental rebasing of our airline customer base and reflect a new foundation level for the future.
Operating profit has increased marginally from 23.4 million to 23.6 million.
This is largely a result of a reduction in turnover of 8.6 million offset by the reduced cost of exceptional items.
"Profit before tax in 2003 fell to 10.2 million from 16.5 million reflecting the impact of ""below the line"" exceptional items."
In 2003, we had below the line additional costs of 2.6 million on the disposal of our property business and in 2002 there was a 4.9 million profit on sale of our Australian interests.
Further commentary on our financial performance is set out below, where we concentrate on EBITDA, rather than operating profit, as the directors believe this is the performance measure most relevant to readers of our financial statements.
In a tough environment for the market as a whole, and the air transport sector in particular, TBI has again demonstrated its resilience.
This 11% decrease reflects fully the demise of the flag carrier airlines from our Belfast airport, some 0.7 million fewer passengers of flag carrier airlines flew from Belfast in 2003 than in 2002.
Despite this and the other challenges facing the industry, including the threat of war with Iraq hanging over much of the year, the number of passengers using our airports increased marginally during the year to 15.2 million passengers.
Turnover Total turnover in the year was 177.6 million 2002: 186.2 million : and is analysed segmentally in Note 2 to the financial statements.
Of this 8.6 million decrease, some 7.3 million arose in our owned and managed airports, and is reflected all the way to EBITDA.
This bears out the adage that these airports are relatively fixed cost businesses: and the corollary of this is that from our base level of turnover we should see any incremental revenues likewise reflected all the way through the profit and loss account.
Costs During the year the costs of business increased.
Insurance premiums, on a net basis, increased by some 50% to 3.5 million, and we expect to see a further increase in 2004.
We do not self insure to any significant degree.
However, central costs, at an EBITDA level, reduced by a further 10% to 4.6 million.
These costs have reduced by over 30% since 2001, and are now at a sustainable level for this business.
Central costs reflect the cost of being a plc: a properly composed board, appropriate advisers, a group risk management team, a group company secretariat, a group IT function and a group financial accounting team.
16 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review 17 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review Operating and financial review continued Group EBITDA Our airports performed stoically and the results demonstrate the resilience of our business to many of the issues affecting the market and our industry.
Of our Group EBITDA, excluding central costs, 86% is generated by our operations within the UK.
EBITDA from our UK airports was 42.2 million 2002: 48.6 million.
EBITDA less net Capital EBITDA less net EBITDA less net interest employed interest as a interest as a Year ended percentage of percentage of 31 March 2003 capital employed capital employed 2003 2002 m m % % Belfast 10.0 106.1 9 15 Cardiff 10.9 65.5 17 23 London Luton 21.3 159.5 13 12 UK airports 42.2 331.1 13 15 Bolivia 3.2 24.0 13 16 Orlando Sanford 0.8 24.1 3 4 Stockholm Skavsta 0.4 28.5 n a n a Airport management 2.9 8.3 35 36 Airport services 0.8 18.1 4 8 Airport total 49.5 434.1 11 13 Other operations 2.4 27.3 9 5 Head office 4.6 11.7 n a n a Net interest Net debt 12.5 149.1 8 8 Total 34.8 300.6 12 14 Capital employed excludes all net debt, including inter-company debt, but includes all applicable goodwill.
The shift from full fare to low cost airlines during the year, together with increased security and insurance costs, has resulted in a reduction in EBITDA at Belfast International of 5.6 million to 10.0 million.
For similar reasons, EBITDA at Cardiff International reduced by some 1.7 million to 10.9 million and EBITDA at London Luton increased by some 0.9 million to 21.3 million largely as a result of previous reorganisation initiatives.
EBITDA performance for our other businesses, on aggregate, is similar to last year at some 9.7 million.
This includes improved performances at Stockholm Skavsta and the Cardiff Hilton with a decline in EBITDA performance in Bolivia and in our Airport Services business.
Exceptional items Exceptional costs comprised predominantly two items reorganisation and other staff related costs at London Luton of some 2.0 million, and the redemption of a loan note which resulted in us forgiving: 1.0 million of the 20.0 million deferred consideration relating to our disposal of the property business in 1999: effectively a 0.5% discount from the original 190.0 million purchase consideration, and 1.6 million of accrued interest receivable.
18 TBI Annual report and accounts 2003 Operating and financial review Net interest The net interest charge for the year was 12.5 million 2002: 11.8 million : including 1.6 million interest previously accrued but forgiven in relation to the redemption of the property business loan note mentioned above.
The weighted average interest cost was 6.35% 2002: 6.50%.
One of the more expensive debt facilities in the Group relates to the old project finance we inherited at London Luton and, further to considerable debate with the minority shareholder at London Luton, refinancing on better terms is expected to be completed shortly.
Tax The total tax charge for the year was 4.0 million 2002: 6.4 million.
Due to the utilisation of historic losses only 2.3 million will be reflected as a cash cost, the balance being mainly the reversal of a deferred tax asset as we utilise our brought forward tax losses.
As highlighted last year the benefit of those historic losses in the UK has been felt over the past seven years or so.
Many of those losses have now been utilised, but we still have over 25.0 million of UK tax losses available to mitigate the cash cost of tax to the Group in 2004 and beyond.
In addition we still have substantial losses available in some of our overseas operations and the extent to which we can benefit from these will depend on the profitability of those operations.
Earnings per share Earnings per share and earnings per share adjusted for goodwill and exceptional items were 0.82 pence 2002: 1.47 pence and 2.86 pence 2002: 3.52 pence respectively.
Dividends The dividend is held and the proposed final dividend is 1.60 pence, making a full years dividend of 2.30 pence.
The dividend is currently not covered by profits for the financial year but is being distributed from brought forward reserves.
However, the dividend is being paid from cash inflows from the operating activities of the Group for the year after allowing for tax, net interest and capital expenditure.
Cashflow We generated 42.9 million of cash 2002: 40.3 million from the operating activities of the Group.
The cash outflow on capital expenditure during the year was 16.9 million, of which approximately 11.5 million was on recurrent capital programs.
The two large projects undertaken during the year were at London Luton and at Skavsta, and are detailed earlier in this review.
Defined benefit pension schemes We operate defined benefit pension schemes in London Luton, Belfast International, and Cardiff International and in certain of our US operations.
As set out in Note 27 to the financial statements, we have complied with the transitional arrangements of FRS17 and the current excess of liabilities over assets, as defined in FRS17, is some 14.8 million after allowing for the associated tax effects.
The defined benefit pension schemes at Belfast and Cardiff have been closed to new members for some years now.
Accounting policies We have reviewed our accounting policies as set out in the financial statements and we consider them to be the most appropriate to our business activities.
