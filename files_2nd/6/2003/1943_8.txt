Treasury Policy and Liquidity Risk The Groups treasury policy has as its principal objective the maintenance of flexible bank facilities in order to cover anticipated borrowing requirements.
A sophisticated cash forecasting system enables the Group to plan and assess its future treasury needs.
Short-term cash surpluses are placed on deposit.
Other than mentioned above, there are no financial instruments, derivatives or commodity contracts used.
Interest Rate Risk The Groups attitude to interest rate risk is influenced by the existing and forecast conditions prevailing at the time that each new interest-bearing instrument is entered into.
This will determine, amongst other things, the term and whether a fixed or floating interest rate is obtained.
The Group is able to make arrangements to convert floating rates to fixed.
Foreign Currency Risk The Group has a foreign currency risk arising from the annual retranslation of the investment in its Australian subsidiary.
The maximum potential exposure arising from this is insignificant.
