Overview Financial Review The Group delivered a mixed set of results, with overall profits falling due to a disappointing performance from UK Retail and a material increase in the charge for pensions as a result of the deficit in the Groups dened benefit pension schemes.
Aspac Retail traded robustly despite the severe impact on sales of SARS and Publishing had a creditable performance, although was held back by higher levels of provisioning and the impact of the schools funding crisis towards the end of the year.
News Distribution traded well, driven by cost efficiencies across the business.

These shares are held for the sole purpose of satisfying obligations under the employee share schemes.
Pensions The Group has adopted FRS 17 with effect from 1 September 2002.
The adoption of FRS 17 has required a change to the accounting treatment of pensions and other post-retirement benets and the prior year results have been restated accordingly.
The financial position of the Group is sensitive to the financial position of its dened benefit pension schemes, which had 631m of assets as valued at 31 August 2003.
The present value of the schemes liabilities has been calculated at 846m as at 31 August 2003.
The resulting deficit in the pension schemes is 215m, with the net deficit, i. e. including the related deferred tax asset, equal to 151m.
An additional net 5m liability arises relating to post retirement medical benets for certain pensioners.
The size of the calculated deficit in the pension schemes is highly sensitive to changes in financial conditions in the equity and bond markets.
For example, a 10 per cent movement in equity markets would all other factors being equal alter the gross deficit by approximately 41m, and a 0.5 per cent movement in real bond yields used to discount the liabilities, would alter the gross deficit by approximately 70m.
In combination, therefore, movements of this magnitude could, if favourable, reduce the deficit by roughly half and, if unfavourable, increase it by the same amount.
Pension fund assets are held by a trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and some present employees.
The Group has undertaken to meet any shortfalls against the liabilities should they arise.
The Group closed its main dened benefit scheme to new members in 1995 but continues to fund the benets accruing in respect of the remaining 4,050 active members.
Employees who have joined the Group since 1995 are able to benefit from a dened contribution pension arrangement.
