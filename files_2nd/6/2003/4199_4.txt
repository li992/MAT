Our largest single scheme is our long-standing UK defined benefit scheme.
As I did last year, in order to show our current UK pension situation, I have summarised the pension position at 31 December 2003 and 2002, together with the latest actuarial valuation in a table below.
The net asset under SSAP 24 and the net liability under FRS 17 are both only marginally different this year end compared to last.
The FRS 17 deficit has not reduced, despite some recovery in the stock market, because the rate at which liabilities are discounted has fallen and the rate of inflation applied to future pension payments has increased.
As I reported last year, it is the triennial actuarial valuation which forms the basis of our long term funding decisions and is, therefore, of more importance than the accounting assets and liabilities.
2002 2003 2003 2002 2002 Actuarial SSAP 24 FRS 17 SSAP 24 FRS 17 m m m m m Asset liability 35.1 33.1 91.8 32.2 89.7 Deferred tax 10.5 10.0 27.6 9.7 26.9 Net asset liability 24.6 23.1 64.2 22.5 62.8 I have also produced a table showing the charge to the Profit and Loss Account for our UK schemes under the two Accounting Standards and our estimate of the 2004 expense.
As is evident from the table we do not expect a significant change in our pensions expense in 2004 under SSAP 24.
Had we been applying FRS 17 in 2004 our pension cost would have reduced to 4.4m.
Again, you may recall I mentioned in last years Financial Review that under FRS 17 there is likely to be more volatility in pension expenses than under SSAP 24.
These figures clearly illustrate that point.
