Operating and financial review continued We have also calculated a Grainger NAV.
This reflects our estimate of the present value of the reversionary surplus in our regulated and life tenancy portfolios, being the difference between vacant possession value and market value after tax.
Using our knowledge of the age profile of these tenants we have estimated the expected average timing of future vacancies based on standard current mortality rates, which may change in the future and the subsequent realisation of the reversionary surpluses.
We have calculated the present value of those surpluses net of tax using 8.9% our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium of three percentage points as a discount rate.
This adjustment increases NNNAV by 4.49 per share to 18.40 per share 2002: 14.43.
Our calculation is based upon current house prices, i. e. no future house price movement is assumed.
