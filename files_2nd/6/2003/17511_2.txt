Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Despite undertaking a major transaction that almost doubled the size of the Group, Xstrata ended 2003 with net debt of US$2.2 billion.
This equates to a gearing level of 31.1%, down from 47.3% US$2.7 billion at the half-year and consistent with our long-term target range of 30-35% on a net debt to equity basis.
As indicated in the interim report, the Group issued US$600 million of seven year Convertible Bonds at a conversion price of 610 pence in 2003.
The issue achieved a number of nancing objectives, including diversifying Xstratas funding base, extending the average maturity prole of the Groups debt by some 18 months and reducing the cost of the bank nancing facility put in place at the time of the MIM acquisition.
Net proceeds were used to renance a portion of the Groups amended syndicated loan facility.
Free cash ow, before discretionary expansionary capital expenditure was US$449 million on a pro forma basis.
Working capital, at US$586 million at year-end, reected an increased investment mainly as a result of higher commodity prices at year-end, stronger local currencies and certain shipments that were delayed until early-January 2004. Dividend The Directors have declared a dividend of 13.3USc per share, representing two-thirds of the full year dividend.
This distribution is consistent with the 2002 implied dividend, adjusted for the bonus factor implicit in the Rights Issue associated with the MIM acquisition.
The record date for the dividend is 30 April 2004 and payment will be made on 21 May 2004.
The Board has affirmed the Groups progressive dividend policy.
Xstrata SA Chrome Venture The announcement of the establishment of a shared venture the Venture between Xstrata and SA Chrome & Alloys Pty Limited, to which each party will contribute its respective South African chrome and ferrochrome assets, addresses one of the major challenges facing the Group and represents a significant achievement for our Alloys business.
SA Chrome is an empowerment company, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and controlled by Royal Bafokeng Resources Holdings Limited 33.2% and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa Limited 25.2%.
The Venture will operate under a single management, which will be led by Xstrata Alloys Chief Executive, Peet Nienaber.
A joint Board will oversee operations and comprises three representatives from both Xstrata and SA Chrome.
Peet will chair this Board and retain a casting vote in the event of deadlock, save for certain investment and budgetary decisions.
The Venture enables both SA Chrome and Xstrata to realise significant operational efficiencies through the transfer of best operational practice, the optimisation of ore feed from the reserves of the two parties, and the introduction of new technology.
The transaction, which we expect to be earnings neutral for Xstrata, will introduce meaningful and sustainable empowerment ownership and involvement in Xstratas South African ferrochrome business, fullling a key requirement in the new Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act in South Africa and doing so without any diminution in value to Xstratas shareholders.
In fact the Venture goes beyond the requirements of the new legislation, providing empowerment participation not just in mining, but also in the beneficiation of ore to produce ferrochrome.
Under the agreement, SA Chrome and Xstrata will retain ownership of all their respective assets, mining rights and land, with both parties undertaking to contribute to the Xstrata SA Chrome Venture their ferrochrome assets, with the exception on Xstratas side of the two furnaces at the Wonderkop plant that form part of our joint venture with Samancor Pty Limited and the production offtake agreement with Mitsui at our Lydenburg plant, in exchange for set participation interests in the Venture.
Both parties will share in the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA of the Xstrata SA Chrome Venture in proportion to their respective participation interest.
From the third year onwards, Xstrata and SA Chrome will participate 82.5% and 17.5% respectively, with the relative proportions changing from 89:11 in the first year to 86:14 in the second year.
Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 13 CHIEF EXECUTIVES REVIEW The Venture will have pro forma annual ferrochrome capacity of 1.45 million tonnes representing around 26% of current global output.
I am delighted with the positive response that this transaction has received from the Minister of Minerals and Energy in South Africa and reaffirm our confidence in being able to manage the transfer of all Xstratas mining rights under the new legislation, without any significant loss of value for shareholders.
With the promulgation of the relevant legislation this year, we now have five years in which to address the remaining ownership issues in our South African coal business.
In that regard, meaningful discussions are continuing with a potential empowerment partner.
Outlook The resurgence in the prices of all our commodities towards the end of 2003 has created a huge amount of interest and speculation in the outlook for the mining sector in 2004.
Across almost all the base metals, and both the thermal and coking coal markets, prices have been driven upwards by a combination of real and sustained demand for product, particularly in the Far East and associated with China, and tightness in supply.
While we see little evidence that the demand side of the equation will change for the worse in fact there are encouraging signs that it is continuing to increase on the back of returning growth in the western economies and continuing strength of the Chinese economy, the outlook for increased supply varies between the different commodities.
However, in this respect our major businesses are also well positioned.
In coking coal, a shortage of physical supply and the absence of any new production has created an exceptionally tight market, and as a consequence current contract negotiations for 2004 are expected to settle signicantly above last years levels.
Similarly in the Asian thermal coal markets, supply remains tight, with production increases in Indonesia likely to be easily absorbed by the market, export growth from China diverted to feed massive internal demand and on-going congestion at Newcastle limiting export increases from New South Wales.
The same is true on the supply side in the Atlantic thermal coal market, which is characterised by restrained growth from Colombia, stable export volumes of South African product, the absence of significant Asian imports, due to high freight rates, and anticipated reductions in domestic European supply.
In copper, supply looks similarly disciplined, with little new production coming on stream and operational difficulties at some operations in South East Asia, the Americas and Australia reducing expected output.
As a consequence, a net deficit of production over demand is forecast for copper in 2004.
On a more ambivalent note, it is true that zinc concentrate production remains restrained, and while this has positively affected the zinc price, it has continued to depress treatment charges at zinc smelters a key profit driver for our zinc business.
All in all, this augurs well for Xstrata in 2004.
Xstratas business model does not rely on an improving cycle to offer value to shareholders.
Our operating regimes and investment strategy are the key drivers for sustained value creation.
In these areas we will not allow our focus to waiver, and we will continue to identify and exploit all opportunities for further improvement and enhancement across every aspect of our business.
I pay tribute to the guidance and support of our Chairman, Willy Strothotte, and his Board, which has been crucial to our endeavours.
Last but by no means least, I thank all of my colleagues across the Group, whose commitment and energy have been critical to the success of our venture.
Mick Davis 14 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 FINANCIAL REVIEW Basis of Presentation of Financial Information The financial information is presented in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP.
The reporting currency of Xstrata is US dollars.
Financial statements of subsidiaries are maintained in their functional local currencies and converted to US dollars on consolidation of Group results.
The financial information for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002 include both UK GAAP statutory statutory and pro forma gures assuming the results of the Duiker and Enex Coal and MIM Groups had been taken through the income statement from 1 January 2003 and 2002.
Xstrata assumed control of the MIM Group at the end of June 2003 and of the Coal Group from the beginning of March 2002.
Unless indicated to the contrary, all data and commentary in this report relates to the pro forma results for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002.
All pro forma and statutory operational results in the Chief Executives report and the Financial and Operational Review exclude the discontinued operations Avonmouth, Duisburg and Magnesium for both 2003 and 2002.
Xstrata assumed 100% ownership of Carpentaria Gold Pty Ltd Ravenswood with the acquisition of the MIM Group and it is considered non-core to the Groups business.
It is reported in the balance sheet as an investment: asset acquired held for resale and is not consolidated in the statutory or pro forma consolidated results.
In January 2004, Xstrata entered into an agreement with Resolute Mining Limited for the sale of Ravenswood, for a headline price of US$45 million, with completion expected on 1 March 2004.
The investment is carried at expected net proceeds, after loss on disposal of the gold hedge book and associated selling costs.
Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS To comply with European Union legislation, Xstrata will be required to present its 2005 annual report in accordance with IFRS as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The platform of standards to be applied in 2005 is scheduled to be completed by the IASB by the end of March 2004.
In order to ensure a successful transition from UK GAAP to IFRS, Xstrata has established a high level Steering Group, consisting of the Chief Financial Officer and senior finance management, and a Working Group consisting of various Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 15 FINANCIAL REVIEW financial controllers.
The Steering Group reports to the Audit Committee and is responsible for setting and monitoring the high level strategy to ensure a successful conversion.
The Working Group is responsible for implementation of that strategy, which includes review of and changes to the format of the financial statements, accounting policies and systems, and assessment of the impacts of IFRS on key performance indicators and broader commercial issues.
It is expected that Xstrata will be fully prepared for the transition in 2005.
Restatement of Certain pro forma 2002 Figures The 2002 pro forma results have been extracted from the supplementary prospectus for the recommended acquisition of MIM Holdings Limited and Rights Issue dated 17 April 2003 Rights Issue Documentation.
Following a post acquisition review, and based on information not available at the time, minor corrections have been made to the 2002 gures published in the Rights Issue Documentation as follows: i Fair value adjustments relating to the MIM Group foreign currency hedgebook have been reclassied from unallocated costs to unallocated turnover.
Further details regarding the treatment of MIM hedge contracts under UK GAAP is available in the section on consolidated pro forma operational results below.
ii Silver loan nancing costs of US$11 million were classied within unallocated by the MIM Group, and were reclassied from Zinc Lead in the Rights Issue Documentation.
These costs are now correctly reclassied from unallocated costs to interest expense.
iii The MIM Group inconsistently reported the Copper operating profit between the interim and full year results during the year ended 30 June 2002.
This resulted in the Copper EBITDA and EBIT being overstated and unallocated being understated by US$27 million for the year ended 31 December 2002. iv Ravenswood has been classied as an asset held for resale, consequently it has been removed from the consolidated results.
v Xstrata Technology, previously included in unallocated costs, has been reclassied to other businesses in 2002 to allow comparability with 2003. vi Transport, Bowen Coke, Pastoral and other non-core businesses were included in unallocated costs by MIM.
They have now been reclassied to core businesses principally Coal Queensland and Copper Australia for both 2002 and 2003, to reect new reporting lines within the Group.
vii The attributable net assets of the MIM Group have been adjusted under UK GAAP so that tax balances, project debt and outside equity interests are included whilst Group balances are excluded.
viii Treatment and rening charges have been netted against gross turnover to allow comparability to the presentation in the financial statements.
This resulted in a US$167 million reclassication from net operating costs to turnover for the year ended 31 December 2002.

The results of the Coal Group were consolidated in the UK GAAP statutory profit and loss account from 1 March 2002.
Statutory Group turnover for the year ended 31 December 2003 increased from US$1,806.1 million to US$3,478.9 million.
The acquisition of the MIM Group added US$949.9 million and contributed to the material turnover increases in the coal and zinc lead business units.
In addition, turnover in 2003 included a full years contribution from the Coal Group, as compared to only ten months in 2002.
The Nordenham zinc smelter, acquired at the end of 2002, added US$147.2 million to turnover in 2003.
Stronger ferrochrome prices drove the increase in turnover from the Alloys business unit.
Statutory Group EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2003 increased from US$418.6 million to US$700 million or 67%.
The MIM Group contributed US$289.2 million additional EBITDA, with the Nordenham acquisition adding a further US$12.9 million.
Overall, the positive impact of higher prices was more than offset by the impact on operating costs of a weak US dollar.
The negative impact of a strong Australian dollar was partially mitigated by currency hedging.
Statutory Group EBIT for the year ended 31 December 2003 increased from US$274.1 million to US$320.1 million or 17%.
The MIM Group accounted for US$132.7 million of EBIT for the year ended 31 December 2003, with the Nordenham acquisition adding a further US$7.5 million.
The weaker US dollar and higher ferrochrome and coal production led to an increase in depreciation and amortisation contributing to the decrease in EBIT compared to the previous period.
For the year ended 31 December 2002, MIM recorded hedging losses of US$119.2 million and under UK GAAP these losses were reversed against the fair value provision.
As the Australian dollar strengthened during this period, an additional reversal of the provision was required, resulting in a gain of US$47.7 million.
As the MIM foreign currency hedge book was at the money on the acquisition date, the pro forma financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2003 of the MIM Group have been presented at spot foreign currency exchange rates by reversing realised hedging losses for the first half of 2003 amounting to US$20.2 million.
From 1 July 2003, all MIM hedging gains and losses are directly allocated to the respective business unit turnover.
Group turnover, excluding the fair value foreign currency hedging provision and unallocated, increased by 13% or US$499.3 million to US$4,411.7 million.
Including the fair value foreign currency hedging provision and unallocated items, total group turnover increased by US$451.2 million or 11% to US$4,412.4 million.
Alloys turnover increased by 48%, or US$176.4 million, to US$543.0 million.
This increase was due to stronger demand for ferrochrome from growth in stainless steel melt capacity and the associated positive pricing environment during 2003.
Higher prices substantially compensated for the increased strength of the South African rand.
Attributable ferrochrome saleable production rose 15% versus the previous year due to re-commissioning of idle furnaces and termination of the furnace lease agreement with AngloPlatinum in April 2003.
Vanadium turnover decreased by 7% or US$5.6 million as a consequence of placing the Windimurra operations on care and maintenance.
Lower vanadium sales volumes were partially offset by higher vanadium prices from reduced worldwide supply and the Groups ongoing strategy of converting a higher proportion of vanadium pentoxide production into higher margin ferrovanadium.
Coal turnover increased US$43.4 million or 2%.
Thermal coal turnover for the South African operations increased by 20% or US$76.2 million due to higher volumes, marginally higher prices and an increase in third-party coal purchases.
Thermal coal turnover in Australia increased by 4% or US$40.9 million due to higher sales volumes and hedging gains that were partly offset by lower prices into the Asian market.
Coking coal turnover decreased by 21% or US$73.7 million mainly due to lower sales volumes.
The 23% decrease in coking coal production was a result of an extended longwall change time and roof falls at Oaky North and reduced production at the Oaky No.
1 mine, due to frictional ignition events.
Copper turnover increased US$96.1 million or 10% to US$1,057.1 million.
The increase was driven by higher copper prices during the second half of 2003, partially offset by lower volumes due to lower copper and gold head grades at Alumbrera and the difficult mining conditions encountered underground at Mount Isa in the first half of 2003, combined with the copper smelter rebrick in July 2003.
Zinc Lead turnover increased by US$184.8 million or 25% due to the acquisition of Nordenham on 31 December 2002 and higher zinc and lead prices, offset to some extent by lower treatment charges received at the European smelters.
Group EBITDA decreased 22% or US$262.5 million to US$955.7 million.
Alloys increased 5% or US$3.8 million, as the negative impact of a stronger South African rand and continued high ination in South Africa were more than offset by higher prices and increased saleable production in ferrochrome.
Coal EBITDA decreased by US$215.4 million or 38% mainly due to the adverse impact of the stronger South African rand and Australian dollar on US dollar costs.
In Australia, however, the impact was partially negated by favourable Australian dollar hedging.
Coal EBITDA was further depressed by lower prices in Asia, with the South African business adversely affected by similar inationary pressures to that of Alloys.
20 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 Copper EBITDA increased marginally by 2% as the positive impact of higher copper prices was offset by lower sales volumes, the negative impact of the stronger Australian dollar and difficult mining conditions at Mount Isa.
Zinc Lead EBITDA decreased by 11% or US$12.1 million mainly due to lower treatment charges and the negative impact of the stronger Euro, Australian dollar and Sterling on costs, partially offset by the Nordenham acquisition and substantial cost savings achieved at the European zinc operations.
EBITDA from Other businesses includes Technology and Forestry and decreased by US$2.2 million compared to 2002.
Corporate and unallocated costs decreased by US$3.9 million.
MIM corporate and unallocated costs declined by US$14.3 million in 2003, mainly due to the restructuring of the former MIM head office.
MIM corporate costs for 2003 are shown net of US$11.4 million 2002 US$13.2 million of cost recoveries charged to operations.
Restructuring costs amounting to US$13.3 million were included as an exceptional item in 2003, representing primarily redundancy expenses associated with reduction of former MIM head office functions.
Group EBIT decreased 46% or US$362.7 million to US$431.1 million with depreciation and amortisation charges increasing by US$100.2 million.
The increase in depreciation and amortisation was due to higher thermal coal and ferrochrome production, reallocation of xed asset economic lives and fair values in the MIM Coal and Copper Americas operations, compounded by stronger local currencies which in itself led to a US$70 million higher charge than would have been the case at 2002 exchange rates.

Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 21 FINANCIAL REVIEW The US$257.9 million sales price variance reects higher prices received for alloys, copper, zinc and lead partially offset by lower Asian coal prices.
The US$72.7 million negative volume variance is principally driven by lower coking coal and copper production in Queensland, reduced sales volumes at Alumbrera from lower head grades and a delayed shipment at year end.
Higher thermal coal and ferrochrome sales volumes partly mitigated the impact.
The former Xstrata Group continued to make real cost savings in 2003 amounting to 3.0% of the operating cost base, excluding depreciation and amortisation.
Real cost reductions in the Coal and European Zinc operations amounted to US$61.1 million as compared to the previous year.
The Australian thermal coal business increased productivity by pursuing initiatives including the introduction of longwall mining at United, the replacement of production with lower cost mines such as the Ravensworth East low cost tailings pit, and an overall reduction in staffing levels.
The improved performance occurred despite increased demurrage costs of approximately US$0.80 per tonne, due to port congestion at Newcastle.
The successful expansion of the San Juan fide Nieva smelter in Spain, where production was increased by a further 25,000 tonnes per annum at a capital expenditure of only US$7.4m, further reduced unit costs in the European Zinc business.
Ferrochrome experienced a marginal real cost increase as a result of difficult mining conditions and reduced metallurgical efficiencies which were successfully resolved by year end, together with higher reductant and energy costs.
The Alloys business has undertaken initiatives to improve operating performance, including the acquisition of a South African charcoal producer in January 2003, commissioning of a pelletising plant at Rustenburg in the fourth quarter of 2003 and enhancing the quality of the ore mix in order to improve metallurgical efficiencies.
In the former MIM Group, real cost increases of US$47.4 million were mainly due to difficult mining conditions at both the Oaky coal operation and Mount Isa copper, together with the impact of the scheduled rebrick of the Mount Isa smelter.
Further commentary, and where applicable, more details of remedial actions taken by Xstrata since acquisition is included in the operating reviews.
The former MIM zinc and lead operations achieved cost efficiencies of US$11.3 million, principally due to the closure of unprofitable operations in the UK Lead business.
Other cost savings of US$16.1 million result from the restructuring of the former MIM Group head office.
The negative impact of ination on costs amounted to US$58.3 million compared to 2002.
US$35.2 million for Xstrata was higher than that of MIM mainly due to high ination in South Africa.
As at the half year, the weaker US dollar had a material negative impact on Group EBIT, with local exchange rates strengthening 28% for the South African rand, 20% for the Euro, 20% for the Australian dollar and 9% for the Pound Sterling period on period.
The negative foreign exchange impact on Group EBIT, when compared to the corresponding prior year period, was US$552.4 million.
This includes losses arising from the stronger Australian dollar US$314.2 million, South African rand US$221.0 million and Euro US$37.3 million partially offset by the gains arising from the Argentine Peso US$21.3 million.
These numbers exclude the positive impact of Australian dollar hedging, which contributed a gain of US$128.8 million versus the prior year.
Nordenham was acquired on 31 December 2002 and is not included in the pro forma results for 2002 as comparable information is not available.
The Nordenham operation contributed US$7.5 million to Group EBIT for the year ended 31 December 2003.
Although the operating performance of Nordenham is not included in the above variance calculation, the cost cutting focus of the Zinc operating team has been evident in the results of Nordenham where real unit costs have declined by approximately 10% since Xstrata gained control.
Xstratas other income and expenses increased as a result its rapid growth in the past year and Windimurra care and maintenance costs.
The US$47.7 million foreign currency hedge book provision reversal relates to the gain on the reversal of the out of the money MIM Group hedge book provision in 2002 as explained in the section on consolidated pro forma operational results above.
22 Xstrata plc Annual Report 2003 As stated previously, strengthening local currencies against the US dollar, increased thermal coal and ferrochrome production and reallocation of economic lives and fair values for the xed assets of the MIM Coal and Copper Americas operations were the major factors driving the increase in depreciation and amortisation.

Impairment of assets relates to the Avonmouth and Duisburg zinc smelters, Windimurra and Magnesium operations in 2002.
The profit on sale of operations in 2003 includes the gain on sale of the interest in the Queensland coal assets of US$136.6 million and the loss on the sale of the magnesium plant of US$1.6 million.
The loss on disposal of operations in 2002 relates to the disposal of the Duisburg operation.
Statutory net interest and similar items increased from US$37.4 million to US$77.7 million.
The increase reects higher levels of borrowings as a result of the MIM Group acquisition.
The statutory pre-exceptionals tax charge of US$48.3 million represents an effective rate of 20% against 13% for 2002.
The increase in 2003 is mainly due to the higher effective tax rate of the acquired MIM operations.
On a post-exceptionals basis, the effective tax rate decreased from 17% for 2002 to 13% for 2003.
The statutory minority interest share of profits increased to US$30.8 million from US$5.8 million for 2002, reecting the 50% minority interest in Alumbrera.
Statutory attributable profit pre-exceptionals decreased US$31.1 million or 16% to US$162.0 million.
Statutory basic pre-exceptionals attributable earnings per share decreased from US$0.58 to US$0.37.
On a post-exceptionals basis, attributable profit increased US$134.7 million or 95% to US$277.0 million.
Basic attributable earnings per share increased from US$0.43 to US$0.63.
The 2002 comparative earnings per share have been restated after adjusting for the bonus element of the Rights Issue.

The pro forma cash ow includes the MIM Group results from 1 January 2003.
Consequently, the additional cash inow, debt acquired and other cash ow items reect the activities of the MIM Group in the first six months of 2003 and have been adjusted to include the estimated position at 1 January 2003.
Inclusion of the MIM Group added US$218.0 million to net cash ow from operations and US$106.0 million to free cash ow in the pro forma compared to the statutory cash ow.
The pro forma net cash inow from operating activities increased from US$297.5 million in the first half of 2003 to US$830.2 million for the full year due to higher EBITDA with a slight decrease in net working capital in the second half of the year.
The foreign exchange adjustment is principally due to an increase in the book value of non-US dollar denominated loans and finance leases as a result of strengthening local currencies against the US dollar.

In addition, the average maturity of the Groups debt has been extended by 18 months to four years.
The objective of maintaining an investment grade balance sheet able to fund long-term growth has been achieved.
Net debt at 31 December 2003 has increased by US$1,647.6 million to US$2,221.5 million.
This is principally due to drawdowns on the amended syndicated loan facility to fund the MIM Group, Nordenham and Oakbridge acquisitions and the assumption of MIM Group net debt of US$1,180.9 million.
The MIM Group net debt acquired included US$255.1 million in relation to Alumbrera, comprising cash US$79.6 million, non-recourse project nancing US$206.2 million, the third-party shareholder loans US$131.0 million and arrangement fees US$2.5 million.

Stocks have increased by US$153.6 million compared to 31 December 2002 pro forma.
The increase in stocks is a consequence of higher cost of concentrate supplies for smelters, increased ferrochrome production, delayed Alumbrera shipments and stronger local currencies against the US dollar.
Debtors have increased by US$68.7 million compared to 31 December 2002 pro forma due to a portion of the sales proceeds from the sale of the Queensland coal assets not yet collected at year end, and Thermal Coal Australias settlement period increasing to approximately 60 days for shipments delivered to Mexico.
Creditors have increased by US$19.0 million compared to 31 December 2002 pro forma principally due to the higher value foreign currency creditors due to the weaker US dollar offset in part by the Avonmouth smelter closure and reduced interest payable on the Alumbrera shareholder loans.
