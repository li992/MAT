30 31 financial review Turnover As a result of delays in concluding a number of key deals in 2003, turnover for the year decreased by 24% to 53.2 million, compared with 69.6 million in 2002.
The major transactions postponed from 2003 to 2004 included the licensing of a package of products in the pulmonary field, the licensing of DepoMorphine for Europe and the licensing of an unnamed pipeline product subsequently filed for approval with the FDA in March 2004.
In April 2004 SkyePharma announced the licensing of DepoMorphine for Europe to Medeus Pharma and its dermatology assets to Trigenesis Therapeutics.
Contract development and licensing revenue decreased by 47% to 29.7 million due primarily to the delay in the above licensing transactions.
Revenues recognised from milestone payments and payments received on the signing of agreements amounted to 24.2 million compared with 47.7 million in 2002.
The 2003 total included revenue from Endo upon the FDA formally accepting Donald Nicholson Finance Director for filing a NDA for DepoMorphine, Mundipharma for the rights to market and distribute DepoCyt in most European countries, King for developing and commercialising a modified-release formulation of Altace ramipril and the signing of an option agreement in respect of an undisclosed pulmonary product.
In addition, SkyePharma received milestones from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca on the initiation of phase III clinical trials of Requip ropinirole and budesonide HFA respectively.
Milestone payments and payments on signing are expected to continue to be an important component of turnover in the near term.
Royalty income almost tripled to 18.7 million, compared with 6.8 million in 2002, following a fourfold increase in 2002.
Royalty income in 2003 derives principally from Paxil CR, Xatral OD, DepoCyt and Solaraze.
Manufacturing and distribution revenues decreased by 35% to 4.8 million, compared with 7.4 million in 2002, due principally to the way in which the revenue from the new licensing arrangements agreed with Enzon, signed in December 2002, is accounted for.
Revenue from Enzon is split between royalty and manufacturing and distribution income in accordance with the contract.
Under the previous arrangements with Chiron the Company recorded its 50% share of sales as manufacturing and distribution income.
This category also includes 1.0 million from Kowa under our collaboration on NK-104 and 0.9 million in respect of Foradil Certihaler for Novartis.
Deferred income During 2003, the Group released a net 2.1 million of turnover and other operating income under its revenue recognition policy, leaving a total deferral of 15.9 million at the end of 2003 comprising: 31 December 31 December 2002 Received Recognised 2003 million million million million Contract development and licensing revenue 10.2 26.6 29.7 7.1 Other operating income 7.8 7.1 6.1 8.8 18.0 33.7 35.8 15.9 This deferred income will be released in later years in line with the related costs or as the associated obligations under the relevant contracts are satisfied.
In addition, the Group recognised 2.0 million of revenue through the statement of total recognised gains and losses rather than the profit and loss account, as the amount earned did not meet the definition of qualifying consideration.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of research and development expenditures, including the costs of certain clinical trials incurred on behalf of our collaborative partners: the direct costs of contract manufacturing: direct costs of licensing arrangements and royalties payable.
Cost of sales was 29.8 million in 2003, SkyePharma annual report 2003 compared with 24.8 million in 2002.
This was mainly due to increased royalty payments made to Paul Capital of 2.5 million and increased manufacturing and distribution costs.
The resulting gross profit decreased by 21.4 million to 23.4 million, primarily as a result of the decreased milestone payments and payments received on the signing of agreements and a 4.8 million increase in manufacturing losses.
The manufacturing losses arise primarily due to inadequate overhead recovery in the US and Lyon prior to the start of manufacture or increased sales of the Companys own products and licensee products.
Expenses Selling, marketing and distribution expenses decreased marginally to 4.3 million, compared to 4.8 million in 2002.
Other administration expenses before exceptionals were 18.0 million in 2003, compared with 13.7 million in 2002.
The increase mainly relates to the cost of reacquiring the DepoCyt European rights from Elan and writing down the Groups investment in GeneMedix plc to market value at the year-end.
Exceptional items and amortisation amounted to 16.2 million in 2003, comprising exceptional items of 9.5 million and amortisation of 6.7 million.
Amortisation of intangible assets increased slightly by 0.2 million from 6.5 million.
The exceptional charge includes 2.7 million cash costs relating to the reorganisation of some research and development operations and other business functions, involving reductions in staff at most sites.
The remaining restructuring provision of approximately 1.8 million will be utilised in 2004.
A further charge will be recognised in 2004.
A further non-cash charge of 4.0 million is in respect of the impairment of associated intellectual property and tangible fixed assets.
In addition, 1.6 million of the charge relates to a write-down in the value of investments.
A further 1.2 million of the charge relates to the settlement of a licensing dispute on favourable terms.
Our own research and development expenses in the year increased by 1.2 million to 30.5 million, as contrary to our previous expectations we were unable to transfer certain costs to our partners due to the delays to completion of new agreements.
Other operating income Paul Capital Royalty Acquisition Fund provided a total of $30 million between 2000 and 2002, in return for the sale of a portion of the potential future royalty and revenue streams from DepoMorphine, Xatral OD, Solaraze and DepoCyt.

Operating results The delay in concluding a number of key new deals in 2003 was the most significant factor contributing to the Groups operating loss after exceptionals of 39.5 million, compared with an operating profit of 4.7 million in 2002.
The exceptional charge of 9.5 million and the reduction in income being recognised under the Paul Capital agreements of 8.1 million have also contributed to the 2003 loss.
The net loss was 43.2 million in 2003, compared with a net profit of 1.1 million in 2002.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA, a commonly used performance indicator, was a loss of 26.6 million in 2003 compared with a profit of 17.3 million in 2002.
