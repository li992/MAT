Following actuarial reviews of the funding of the main UK schemes in June 2003, the operating companies increased their Warren Tucker Group Financial Director contribution rate.
Additional contributions of 3.8m have been 18 March 2004 made during 2003.
In addition, the majority of employees have elected to increase their contributions by 2 percentage points from the beginning of 2004.
Foreign exchange The groups aim has been to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, foreign exchange risk.
The pound sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the group is concerned.
This is primarily due to the level of US dollars which the UK and European subsidiaries expect to receive from their business activities, as certain global aerospace and defence contracts are denominated in US dollars.
Equally, some exposure arises from operating companies based in the USA, offset partially by dollar denominated borrowings.
All significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the parent company.
In addition to the structured borrowing, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange exposure, such as forward rate contracts and options.
Details of the most significant of these are described in note 30 of Notes to the Financial Statements.
In January 2004 the group entered into additional forward contracts to sell US$ for sterling and euros throughout 2004.
As a consequence, the majority of the anticipated exposure to US$ in UK and European subsidiaries is hedged at average rates of 1.59 for sterling and 1.23 for euros respectively.
