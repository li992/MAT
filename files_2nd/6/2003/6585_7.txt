International Financial Reporting Standards The European Union requires all listed companies to report under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005 with prior year comparatives on the same basis.
In 2002 the Group initiated a project to review the requirements of IFRS, recommend appropriate accounting policies for consideration by the Audit Committee and identify their impact on Group results and balance sheet.
The project operates under a steering committee chaired by the Group Finance Director and consisting of divisional finance directors together with other senior employees with responsibility for external and internal reporting and systems development and implementation.
