The Group protects the interest charge on bank debt from increases in interest rates by using interest rate caps.
Some of the subsidiaries acquired have been financed by fixed rate loan notes.
This has produced a mixture of fixed, floating and capped debt.
The Group has subsidiaries in 29 countries and trades in over 120.
Subsidiaries may trade in currencies other than their functional currency of operation usually sterling or US dollars.
It is the Groups policy to eliminate transactional currency exposures through forward currency contracts as soon as the contractual commitments are known.
The Group is subject to currency exposures on the translation of the net assets of, and profits earned by, its overseas subsidiaries, primarily in the US and Europe.
The Group invests its cash and cash equivalents, and enters into contracts for derivative financial instruments, with institutions of high credit quality, and limits its exposure to any one counterparty.
The Groups revenue is derived from various industries and could be directly affected by the overall condition of those industries.
The large number of customers, their geographical distribution, and the reasonably short collection terms mitigates the credit risk associated with this.
The Group routinely monitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains an allowance for anticipated losses.
