The principal reasons include lower operating profit performance from the US and the UK and a reduction in dividend receipts from joint ventures and associates.
Capital expenditure to maintain the operating capacity of our power stations has increased compared with the previous year, reflecting the completion of our new build capacity in Massachusetts and Texas in 2002.
Capital expenditure to increase our operating capacity amounted to 57 million as compared to 98 million in the previous year, reflecting spend on the build of our US and Al Kamil plants.

Net interest of 79 million 2002: 88 million was paid in the year reflecting a small reduction in average debt levels over the course of the year, together with a slightly lower average cost of debt.

Net debt at 31 December 2003 of 692 million is down from 812 million at 31 December 2002.
This reflects the strong operating cash flow of the business and the positive impact of translation of net debt balances denominated in foreign currencies, offset by the write-off of unamortised facility fees in the US.
Net debt at 31 December 2003 is shown net of facility fees of 15 million, which have been capitalised and offset against the debt in accordance with accounting standard FRS 4.
