12550 Tullow R&A03 p30-p72 aw 5 27 04 2:49 PM Page 30 Financial Review 2003 was a year of solid financial progress for Tullow.
The group reported record levels of production, turnover, operating profitability and cash flow, although net profit was adversely impacted by the write-off of costs associated with unsuccessful exploration under the groups successful efforts accounting policy and taxation.
The Company declared its maiden dividend of 1p per share, which was paid in November.
Significant advances were also made in relation to reducing abandonment cost estimates on UK assets, and the disposal of non-core UK onshore production interests.
These events have left the group well placed to continue its progress during 2004.
Turnover The UK Southern North Sea assets continue to represent the majority of Group turnover, accounting for some 79% of the 2003 total 2002 81%.
Gas sales in 2003 totalled 43.8 bcf representing an average of 120 mmscfd.
This was some 19% ahead of 2002, driven principally by additions to production in the Murdoch-Boulton area via the CMS III project.
Tariff income also benefited from stronger production, reaching 10.8 million 2002 - 9.7 million.
During 2003 Tullow terminated a number of its long-term gas sales contracts in order to better manage production during periods of peak demand and pricing.
As a result of this, contracted gas fell to 20% of overall production 2002 - 60% at an average price of 24.7p 2002 - 23.7p, with uncontracted gas representing the balance at an average price of 19.85p therm 2002- 20.1p.
While the overall gas pricing environment and outlook is currently favourable, 2003 pricing was negatively impacted by weak summer and autumn pricing.
In addition to strong performance from the SNS assets, 2003 also saw major production increases from West Africa, where the Espoir project reached full production in September 2003.
Turnover from Espoir was 25.1 million 2002 - 14.5 million from production which averaged 4,000 boepd net to Tullow.
Espoir turnover was also impacted positively by the strength in global oil pricing, with the price received averaging $27.50 barrel 2002 - $26.60 barrel.
Production from the Sara and Suri fields in Pakistan was adversely impacted by the water ingress into the Sara-1 well and reduced customer demand in the last quarter.
Average production for the year was 8 mmscfd net to Tullow 2002 - 10 mmscfd.
During 2003 Tullow sold its UK onshore production interests in the West Firsby oil field and the North Yorkshire gas fields.
Operating Profit Operating Profit before Exploration Activities amounted to 47.1 million 2002 - 33.3 million showing the benefits of increased Group production and reduced unit operating costs in both the UK and West Africa.
SNS Operating Costs, which include tariff costs, totalled 34.6 million 7.9p therm while Depreciation and Amortisation charges for the UK assets totalled 33.7 million 7.7p therm.
These costs include transition and acquisition costs of 1.4 million associated with Tullows acquisition of an additional interest in, and operatorship of, the Hewett Bacton complex and 0.8 million associated with termination of the Boulton gas sales contract.
During 2003 Tullow also modified the basis on which Depletion and Amortisation on the SNS assets is computed to standardise the approach across the main producing hubs of Thames, Hewett and CMS.
This modification, whereby individual reservoirs are now grouped into fields based on common geological characteristics, resulted in a net reduction of 4.5 million in the charge for the year.
The unit Depletion and Amortisation charge also benefited from reductions in abandonment cost estimates of approximately 30% on the Thames and Hewett assets.
Tullow, as operator of Hewett, will continue to pursue further reductions in these costs on behalf of the joint venture.
Espoir Operating Costs, which are substantially fixed, totalled 6.2 million during 2003.
Tullows successful efforts accounting policy requires that all costs associated with unsuccessful exploration are written off to the Profit and Loss Account.
During 2003 Tullow participated in a number of unsuccessful wells in the UK Gawain South East and the Squirrel wells, Algeria Block 222b and India GK-OSJ-1.
All costs of these wells, along with certain additional costs associated with relinquished acreage in the UK and India, have been written off in full, resulting in a total charge of 12.8 million to the Profit and Loss Account 2002 - 4.2 million.
30 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 12550 Tullow R&A03 p30-p72 aw 5 27 04 2:49 PM Page 31 Disposal of Non-Core assets During 2003 Tullow undertook an active programme of rationalisation of assets and territories that are no longer central to the group.
As part of this initiative, the Group withdrew from Algeria following the unsuccessful 222b exploration well.
In addition the groups remaining Onshore UK interests in West Firsby and North Yorkshire were sold for a total consideration of $9.0 million 4.3 million, after completion adjustments.
Although these funds were principally reinvested in international development and exploration activities which are dollar-denominated, exchange movements between the agreement and completion dates have resulted in a loss of 0.9 million being booked to the Profit and Loss Account for 2003.
Interest Charge The net interest charge for the period was 6.7 million, comprising 3.9 million of interest associated with Group Debt after capitalisation of 0.9 million associated with development projects, 2.0 million of interest income, 4.6 million of non-cash costs arising from the amortisation of debt arrangement fees and the unwinding of discount on abandonment provisions and 0.2 million in respect of interest rate swaps.
Of this total, 0.6 million represents additional amortisation of arrangement costs of the Groups Espoir financing facility.
This facility will now be repaid on an accelerated schedule in conjunction with the arrangement of new Group facilities associated with the proposed acquisition of Energy Africa Limited and accordingly the costs are amortised on an accelerated basis.
Taxation The tax charge of 15.7 million includes 13.6 million of current Corporation Tax and Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT, 2.9 million of a notional tax charge representing the Cte dIvoire states profit oil interest in 2003 production from the Espoir field and a net credit of 0.8 million in respect of Deferred Tax.
There has been a material increase in the Groups charge to PRT in 2003 due primarily to a full year of production from the Murdoch K field part of CMS III development, which falls within the determination of the Murdoch field for PRT purposes.
This factor, combined with reserves upgrades on Murdoch, lower available oil allowance and higher gas prices during 2003, resulted in significant increases in the Groups charge to PRT.
2003 was also the first full year in which the additional 10% Supplementary Corporation Tax on Oil and Gas profits applied.
Tullows exposure to this tax during 2003 was mitigated by the availability of 100% capital allowances on UK exploration and development costs incurred during the year.
In addition, the Group also received a rebate on taxes due of 2.7 million in respect of Corporation Tax over-assessed in previous years, principally associated with the timing of 2002 profits and consequent liability to SCT.
Cash Flow Tullow generated a total of 85.0 million 2002 - 62.9 million in operating cash flow.
This record operating cash flow allowed the Group to spend a total of 46.0 million on exploration and development activities whilst also making net repayments totalling 14.8 million under its financing facilities.
During 2003, Tullow also declared and paid its first dividend and completed 3 bolt-on acquisitions to its SNS portfolio.
Development expenditure in 2003 was associated with the East Espoir and CMS III projects, which were both substantially complete at year end.
The outlook for 2004 is for a lower level of development expenditure, with the Horne and Wren UK and West Espoir Cte dIvoire projects likely to be the main areas of focus in Tullows current areas of activity.
Tullow participated in a total of 6 exploration wells during 2003.
The key areas of exploration expenditure were in the UK where the Squirrel and Gawain South East wells were drilled, Cte dIvoire where Tullow participated in the Acajou discovery and South Asia where exploration work continued on Block 9 onshore Bangladesh and the Rasulpur well was spudded in December 2003.
At 31st December 2003 the Group held total cash balances of 66.7 million, of which 29.8 million was held as security for future decommissioning obligations.
Tullow Oil plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 31 12550 Tullow R&A03 p30-p72 aw 5 27 04 2:49 PM Page 32 Financial Review continued Balance Sheet Tullow fully applies the requirements of the Statement of Recommended Practice Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and Decommissioning Activities.
Under its successful efforts accounting policy, the group capitalises all costs of exploration and related activities to the Intangible Fixed Assets caption of the Balance Sheet pending determination of commerciality.
During 2003, costs of the Groups exploration and appraisal activities in the SNS, Cte dIvoire, Cameroon, Gabon, Romania, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India were capitalised as Intangible Fixed Assets.
Upon determination of commerciality, costs are transferred from Intangible to Tangible Fixed Assets.
The reduction in Tangible Fixed Assets during 2003 principally arises from Depletion and Amortisation of 39.6 million offset by development expenditure totalling 32.0 million, the disposal of UK onshore assets and currency translation adjustments in respect of US Dollar denominated activities.
Liquidity and Financial Management The Groups core financial objectives are to increase operating profitability and cash flow so as to enable active exploration and development programmes to be pursued while at the same time reducing group gearing.
In addition, the Group places a high priority on retaining financial flexibility in order to enable business development opportunities to be pursued as they arise.
During 2003 Tullow undertook a 5% Placing to raise 14.4 million before expenses to supplement an acquisition-related debt facility which was negotiated during the first quarter.
Net debt reduced by 33.0 million during 2003, as net repayments totalling 14.8 million were made, principally under Tullows SNS related debt facility: since 31st December further repayments totalling 15.0 million have also been effected and the life of the SNS debt facility extended to reflect additions to reserves and extensions of field lives since first drawdown in 2001.
During 2003 the first phase of the Espoir development satisfied all completion tests under the related $15 million Cte dIvoire banking facility, which is now fully non-recourse to Tullow Oil plc.
The first repayment under this facility was made in January 2004 and it is anticipated that the facility will be fully repaid in conjunction with the arrangement of a debt funding package associated with the proposed acquisition of Energy Africa Limited.
The International Divisions revolving $15 million Corporate Facility has recently been extended and will not be affected by the proposed arrangements.
Financial and Derivative Risk Tullow does not assume speculative derivative or hedge positions: all group hedging and forward sales are undertaken with the sole intention of safeguarding group revenue and managing exposure to seasonal and annual resource price volatility.
During 2002 and 2003 Tullow has progressively reduced the proportion of its gas that is sold under life-of-field contracts and active gas marketing and forward sales remains a high priority.
The principal sales contract termination during 2003 related to the Gawain field, which supplied gas to Powergen at Bacton - this contract has effectively been replaced by a term supply agreement.
In addition the Boulton life-of-field gas contract was also formally terminated in early 2003, providing the Group with exposure to prevailing market prices compared to the below market price under the life-of-field contract.
The fundamentals of UK Gas pricing continue to be strong and at 31st March 2004 Tullow had achieved an average price of 24.5p therm for uncontracted gas sold to date in 2004.
The Espoir project attained its threshold level of production during 2003.
In recognition of this, Tullow has initiated a limited programme of oil price hedging covering approximately 30% of anticipated 2004 production utilising a mix of swaps and put options with an average price protected in excess of $29 barrel on hedged volumes.
Due to the natural hedge between its UK-based activities, which are denominated and funded in Sterling, and its international business, which is principally denominated and funded in US dollars, the Group does not undertake active currency hedging.
