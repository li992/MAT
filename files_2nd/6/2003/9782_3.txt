Highlights Turnover up 6.0%: Operating profit before exceptional charges up 21.1%, largely driven by a turnaround in performance by UK Retail: profit on ordinary activities before tax and exceptional items up 11.5%: Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations up 39.6%: and Dividend per share up 10.5%.

For the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2003, General Merchandise which comprises Clothing, footwear, gifts and Home like-for-like sales increased by 9.0% compared to an actual increase of 9.8%, and Food like-for-like sales increased by 3.7% compared to an actual increase of 5.1%.
Clothing performance during the year was strong, as a result of the focus on the appeal, quality, availability and t of our product.
Womenswear, Menswear and Lingerie all increased market share for the year source: Fashiontrak.
Casualwear performed particularly strongly, with core womenswear ranges, per una and Blue Harbour, all showing strong year-on-year increases.
The fourth quarter was a more difficult trading period, particularly in Greater London.
The performance of Childrenswear has been disappointing.
Action has been taken to improve design and to consolidate ranges to offer more choice.
The initial strong response to the DB07, David Beckham, range has been maintained.
In addition to older boyswear, schoolwear is now showing signs of improvement.

For the full year this delivered a further 1.3 percentage point improvement in the Clothing bought-in margin.
In addition, markdowns as a percentage of sales were lower than last year, leading to a further 0.3 percentage point improvement in the Clothing achieved margin.
In absolute terms markdowns were higher than planned and largely arose within Womenswear during the autumn season, where we drove for high sales growth and improved availability, and in Childrenswear.
Distribution costs, which are included in cost of sales, increased marginally less than the rate of sales growth.
Following a review of the general merchandise logistics operation, we recently announced the closure of our Hayes distribution centre and a reduction in the number of warehousing contractors from four to two.
These changes, which are expected to generate annual savings of 20m, have resulted in an exceptional charge of 36.3m in the year.
The Home business benefited from the introduction of new products across the range, particularly within home accessories and bedding, and the performance of furniture was helped by events around bank holidays.
However, a reduction in allocated store space in the second half affected underlying sales.
In Food, we have had another year of strong sales growth.
We have outperformed the market in the last three quarters of the year, increasing our market share for the year as a whole.
Key to this success has been the high quality of our products, continued innovation including the relaunch of our Indian and Chinese ranges, strong, cohesive marketing and a focus on special occasions.
We continue to focus on extending the reach of our Food offer.
We are making it accessible to more customers, through the Simply Food format and larger neighbourhood Food stores, opening 15 stores in the year.
Progress to date in the Simply Food stores has been encouraging, delivering sales in excess of the average return per square foot for Food, offset by slightly higher costs.
These stores are on target to deliver an operating profit which is in line with the rest of the Food business.
We have also extended the agreement with Compass Group to place Simply Food stores in railway stations.
In total, we plan to have opened 150 Simply Food stores by March 2006.
We have invested further in the in-store environment and have now modernised 256 stores, representing approximately 93% of UK Retail selling space.
There are now 141 Caf Revive coffee shops in stores: these have contributed almost 80m to turnover inc. VAT this year.
Operating costs of 1,863m, excluding exceptional charges, increased by 4.9% over the same period last year: employee costs which, at 975m, represent over half of total operating costs increased by 1.8%.
Included in this is the anticipated cost of performance bonuses for management and store staff this year is 34m: property, repair and renewal costs of 335m have increased by 8.0%, largely as a result of the sale and leaseback transaction entered into last year, which added 15m to rental costs this year: depreciation was 218m, an increase of 4.9%: and other operating costs of 335m increased by 11.9%.
This was largely due to increased expenditure on marketing, rising insurance costs and IT expenditure to upgrade our business systems.
During the year, 7.6m of revenue costs were incurred in connection with the relocation of the corporate head ofce, which is planned to take place next year.
These costs have been charged as exceptional operating costs.
A further 25m to 30m of revenue costs are expected to be incurred next year and will also be charged as exceptional operating costs.
UK Retail capital expenditure for the period was 303m.
Of this, 81m was spent on new space and 96m on store modernisation and refurbishment.
In addition, we are in the second year of a five year programme to upgrade our refrigeration equipment, investing approximately 40m annually.

The performance of Kings Super Markets has been affected by uncertainty surrounding the sale and a one-off charge of 1.4m in connection with the closure of two stores.
Turnover for the Marks & Spencer branded businesses Republic of Ireland, franchises and Hong Kong increased by 7.3% to 391.2m 6.9% at constant exchange rates.
Operating profit for the Marks & Spencer branded businesses increased by 72.0% to 35.6m, an underlying increase of 39% after adding back 5m of abortive sale and restructuring costs in Hong Kong last year.
The Republic of Ireland performed ahead of last year and we have also seen an improvement in the performance and profitability of our franchise business.
In Hong Kong, actions taken last year to decrease footage in selected locations and reduce costs, together with a new pricing strategy which has increased sales, have delivered results.
However, trading in Hong Kong and some franchises in the last month of the year was affected by the outbreak of the SARS virus and the war in Iraq.
2003 2002 Financial Services m m Turnover 329.9 350.8 Operating profit 86.4 84.2 Operating profit from Financial Services increased by 2.2m to 86.4m.
Within this, the operating profit from existing retail activities increased by 20.2m to 97.5m before expenditure of approximately 25m on the credit card and loyalty programme.
The balance of the operating profit is attributable to the captive insurance company which was affected by negative investment returns for the year as a whole due to falls in the underlying markets.

The proportion of retail sales made on the Chargecard fell to approximately 17% and the number of active accounts decreased by 8.2%.
However, with an increase in the average outstanding balance per customer, Chargecard borrowing decreased by only 3.2%.
Together with improved margins, this resulted in Chargecard operating income increasing by 2.0%.
In personal lending, competitive forces were strong throughout the year and, as a result, outstanding balances decreased by 9.4% on reduced new business volumes.
As a consequence, personal lending operating income decreased by 9.1%.
The savings and protection products suffered from uncertain economic conditions and operating income was level with last year.
Within this, bearish stock market conditions reduced Unit Trust operating income by 9.4% to 9.9m even though gross new retail investment was 87.8m an increase of 53.5%.
In contrast the life, pensions and general insurance products delivered an operating income increase of 8.6%.
6 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Financial review The introduction of a revised bad debt methodology resulted in a one-off increase in bad debt charges in the second half of last year.
Declining customer balances and the absence of that one-off charge, together with the implementation of improved collection procedures, have resulted in the bad debt charge for the year being 20.5m lower than last year.
In order to combat falling income levels, a programme of cost reduction was initiated which resulted in a decrease in operating costs for the existing retailing activities of 10.4m.
The reduction in operating costs and bad debt charges more than offset the decline in net income and resulted in operating profit for the existing business increasing by 26%.
This strong increase in profitability nanced the additional investment during the year of approximately 25m in the credit card and loyalty programme.
Credit card and loyalty pilot We began a trial in September 2002 in South Wales to validate the business case and our operational capability to deliver a joint credit and loyalty card for our customers.
The key measures we assessed were the take-up of the new card, average balances, the number of new cardholders, propensity to borrow, card penetration and incremental sales.
On each of these measures, the pilot was successful.
Therefore we are progressing with the necessary commitments for a national roll-out in the second half of the year.
Total revenue costs incurred on the card and loyalty programme during the year amounted to approximately 25m.
These costs covered the development of technological and operational infrastructure as well as the costs of running the pilot.
The revenue cost of rolling out the card and loyalty programme will be approximately 60m in the current financial year.
This covers: the cost of developing further infrastructure associated with becoming a major new credit card provider: the cost of providing customer service capability: and acquisition and card issue costs up to and through the national launch.
The costs of the development of the credit and loyalty card will mean that Financial Services profit will reach a low point in 2003 04 and grow from that base in 2004 05.
Discontinued operations Last year, we closed the Continental European operations and sold Brooks Brothers.
The results of these businesses up until the dates of closure or disposal are reported under discontinued operations.
Interest Net interest expense was 40.5m compared to net income of 17.6m last year.
This arises as a result of the increase in debt following the capital restructuring of the Group at the end of last year, when 1.7bn was returned to shareholders.
Taxation The tax charge for the year of 197.4m, reects an effective tax rate before exceptional charges of 28.6% compared to 29.6% last year.
This rate is less than the UK corporation tax rate of 30%, largely as a result of prior year contributions to European subsidiary closure costs being accepted as tax deductible in the UK.
Earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share was 22.2p last year 15.9p and is calculated to exclude the effect of exceptional items.
Details of the calculation are given in note 9 to the financial statements.
Dividend A final dividend of 6.5p last year 5.8p is proposed, making the total dividend for the year 10.5p last year 9.5p.

Following this redemption, 168,819,801 B shares remain in issue.
The next opportunity for redemption will be September 2003. Financing The Medium Term Note MTN programme was renewed in September 2002 and Marks and Spencer Financial Services p. l. c. was added as an Issuer.
Five new MTNs were issued during the year by Marks and Spencer Financial Services with a sterling equivalent of 75.1m and maturities ranging from one to three years.
The Groups total outstandings within this programme at the end of the financial year were equivalent to 1,754.8m last year 2,062.6m.
Debt raised to fund the Financial Services operation is a mix of short to medium term instruments designed to match, on a portfolio basis, the income stream from its customers.
The balance of debt, raised to introduce a level of gearing into the retail balance sheet, has a range of maturity terms, the first being due for repayment in November 2006, to reduce the repayment risk of the Group.
We currently have committed facilities of 385m available together with uncommitted bank facilities of 455m supporting our 1bn Commercial Paper programme.
Average interest rates on borrowings were lower during the year at 5.8% last year 5.9%.
Interest cover was 17.7 times and xed charge cover was 7.6 times.

The Board delegates certain responsibility to the Treasury Committee, comprising two members of the Board, one non-executive director and the Director of Corporate Finance.
The Treasury Committee is empowered to take decisions, as necessary, within that delegated authority.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups Treasury also enters into derivatives transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and nancing.
It has been, and remains, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, liquidity, counterparty and the financial risks associated with the Financial Services operation.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk in respect of debt on the retail balance sheet is reviewed on a regular basis.
At the balance sheet date interest obligations in respect of the property securitisation and the Eurobond issued in sterling were at xed rates.
The current Group policy for debt raised to finance the operation of Financial Services see part e below, is to maintain the majority of this portion of debt as oating rate and this is achieved with the help of interest rate swaps.
b Foreign currency risk Currency exposure arising from exports from the UK to overseas subsidiaries is managed by using forward currency contracts to hedge between 80% and 100% of sales for periods averaging 10 to 15 months forward.
Imports are primarily contracted in sterling and only economic exposures arise.
The Group is increasing the proportion of imports contracted in local currencies and a policy is in place for the hedging of these exposures, principally using forward currency contracts.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss account translation exposures.
Where appropriate, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
c Liquidity risk The objective is to ensure a mix of funding methods offering exibility and cost effectiveness to match the needs of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are nanced by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, commercial paper and medium term notes and securitised loan notes.
Commercial paper issuance is backed by committed bank facilities totalling 385.0m.
d Counterparty risk The objective is to reduce the risk of loss arising from default by counterparties.
The risk is managed by using a number of banks and allocating each a credit limit according to credit rating criteria.
These limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
Dealing mandates and derivative agreements are agreed with the banks prior to deals being arranged.
e Financial Services Interest rate exposures for Financial Services are managed, as far as practical, by matching the periods of borrowings and their interest basis with that of the customer debt.
Interest rate swaps are used to convert xed income from personal loan customers to short-term variable income to match short-term variable rate borrowings.
The details of derivatives and other financial instruments required by FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, are shown in notes 18, 21 and 23 to the financial statements.
com 9 Pro-forma profit and loss account The sale and leaseback transaction last year, which has increased property rental costs, and the return of capital to shareholders which introduced a level of debt to the retail balance sheet, have had a significant effect on earnings in the current year.
If these transactions had occurred at the beginning of last year, then we estimate that our earnings from continuing operations, but before exceptional items, for last year would have been as follows: As Sale and Return of Pro-forma reported leaseback capital earnings Continuing operations before exceptional items m m m m Operating profit 629.1 14.8 614.3 Interest 17.6 66.6 49.0 profit before tax 646.7 14.8 66.6 565.3 Tax 195.1 4.4 20.0 170.7 profit after tax 451.6 10.4 46.6 394.6 Adjusted earnings per share 15.9p 17.1p Number of shares m 2,841 2,307 Accounting for pensions We continue to account for pension costs under SSAP 24 and our UK pension cost for the year was 136m.
Under FRS 17 this would have been 95m.
The actuary of the Groups UK dened benefit pension scheme carried out a formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2001.
This valuation revealed a shortfall of 134m 94m after deferred tax in the market value of the assets of 3,102m compared to the actuarial liability for pension benets a funding level of 96%.
As a result, the contributions to the scheme were increased to fund this deficit over 12 years.
Last year, the actuary prepared a valuation of the UK scheme as at 30 March 2002 in accordance with FRS 17.
The FRS 17 valuation basis is a more volatile measure reecting market values at a point in time.
This valuation showed a deficit of 400m 280m after deferred tax.
The actuary has updated this FRS 17 valuation as at 29 March 2003.
The results of this update reect the poor performance of the financial markets during the year and show that the deficit has increased to 1.2bn 0.9bn after deferred tax.
On this basis, the profit and loss account charge under FRS 17 in 2003 04 would increase to 142m.
The pension scheme has a positive cash ow which is expected to continue for some time as the Groups contribution to the scheme, together with investment income, is greater than the annual payments to pensioners.
It is therefore expected to be many years before the dened benefit scheme needs to liquidate a material portion of scheme assets.
We recognise the importance of pension provision to our employees and we continue to review the long-term funding strategy for the dened benefit scheme.
As a result of the deterioration in the value of equities, we will bring forward the next formal actuarial valuation planned for March 2004 to allow us to make an earlier informed decision as to contribution level and asset mix going forward.
We recognise this will require increased funding.
Outlook for 2003 04 We anticipate further improvement in the clothing primary margin bought-in margin of approximately 1 percentage point for 2003 04 and a further 1 percentage point in each of the two subsequent years.
Underlying UK retailing operating costs, including logistics, for 2003 04 are planned to be held level on this year.
However, as a result of investment in growth initiatives, total UK retailing operating costs will increase by approximately 3%.
These incremental investment costs cover initiatives such as Simply Food, Home and marketing and system costs in UK Retail associated with the loyalty elements of a national roll-out of the combined credit and loyalty card.
The revenue costs of the head ofce move to Paddington Basin will be approximately 25m to 30m, compared to 7.6m incurred this year.
These costs will be treated as exceptional.
The impact of a national roll-out of the combined credit and loyalty card will be to reduce Financial Services profits by approximately 60m for the financial year 2003 04, compared to the 25m in 2002 03.
This is in line with the guidance given at the time of our Interim Results in November 2002.
The financial year incorporates a 53rd week.
This will add 30m to 40m to full year profit before tax.
Group capital expenditure will be approximately 560m in 2003 04, compared to 311m this year.
This is due to the acquisition of the UK general merchandise warehouses owned by contractors 100m, the head ofce move to Paddington Basin 45m, together with investment in the Simply Food roll-out and the Home business.
Going concern statement After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
