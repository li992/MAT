Financial review Although the foreign currency environment continued to be challenging for European based exporters like Amersham, the company delivered a strong underlying performance in 2003.
Having forecast in July a full year business performance EPS growth within the 8-10% range, the group exceeded this, despite the inevitable uncertainty which arose in the fourth quarter associated with GE's offer for the Company.
This is a testament to the strength and resolve of the whole organisation, albeit particular credit must go to Discovery Systems for progress on restructuring, which is now expected to yield a full year benefit in 2004 of more than 40 million, when compared to 2002.
As in previous years, we continue to assess our business performance on a like for like basis with the impact of exceptional items, goodwill amortisation, foreign exchange and disposed businesses removed.
Results overview Sales during 2003 were 1,652 million, up six per cent at constant exchange rates, excluding the impact of disposed businesses.
Operating profit before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation was 299 million, 12 per cent higher than last year, with a significant benefit from the restructuring of our Discovery Systems business, where the 2003 loss is 46% lower than in 2002.
Interest costs have been reduced this year as a result of lower net debt and falling interest rates in the companys main borrowing currencies.
Profit before tax was 294 million before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, down from 301 million in 2002 at actual rates of exchange but up 14% at constant exchange rates.
Profit before tax including exceptional items and goodwill amortisation was 192 million, down from 264 million in 2002.
Goodwill amortisation was 44 million, increasing from 37 million in 2002.
We have recorded a pre-tax exceptional charge of 58 million, which is analysed in note 3 to the financial statements, whilst in 2002 we recognised as an exceptional item a deferred credit of 9 million.
The groups tax rate, before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, was 31.0 per cent 36.4 per cent after goodwill amortisation, reduced from 31.4 per cent in 2002.
Earnings per share were 29.0p before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, compared with 29.9p last year, representing an increase of 12 per cent at constant exchange rates and a reduction of 3% at actual exchange rates.
Overall, basic earnings per share, after exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, have decreased from 26.1p in 2002 to 16.5p in 2003.
We paid an interim dividend of 2.85p per share and the Board is recommending a dividend of 5.92p per share, bringing the dividend to 8.77p for the year, an increase of twelve per cent.

Treasury policy and liquidity Treasury policy and objectives Our treasury activities are co-ordinated and managed by the group treasury department in accordance with policies approved by the board.
These policies are reviewed regularly and have not changed significantly over the past year.
The department operates under close management supervision and is subject to review by the risk and operational review department.
It does not operate as a profit centre and no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Financial instruments The group uses financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, in the management of currency and interest rate exposures.
Clear procedures have been established, including levels of authority, regarding the type and use of financial instruments to manage these exposures.
The Board has approved these procedures.
The group controls credit risk by entering into transactions involving financial instruments only with authorised counter-parties of strong credit quality.
Counter-party positions are monitored regularly.
Funding Group treasury manages the group requirement for debt funding.
The group finances its operations through a variety of instruments and maturities.
In general, subsidiaries borrowing requirements are funded by loans from group treasury, except where precluded by local regulations.
The principal borrowings during the period were $193 million 110 million of private placement loan notes and drawings under the $750m revolving bank credit facility.
At 31 December 2003, the group had net debt of 147 million and undrawn committed facilities of 362 million.
8 Interest rate management The groups interest charge is exposed to movements in interest rates as well as debt levels.
We maintain a policy of holding between 30 and 70 percent of debt at fixed rates.
The group uses currency and interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposures on debt and cash positions.
The interest rate profile of the group is shown in note 20 to the financial statements.
At 31 December 2003, after taking into account interest rate swaps, 44 per cent of debt was at fixed rates.
The average maturity of this fixed rate debt was 1.3 years.
Currency management The groups manufacturing activities and costs are concentrated in a small number of countries, primarily the US, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Sales income is spread more widely.
Overall we have net income in US dollars, euros and Japanese yen and net costs in sterling, Swedish kronor and Norwegian kroner.
The groups principal financial exposures are to movements in currency exchange rates.
These comprise transaction exposures arising from currency cash flows and translation exposures arising from the conversion of the results of foreign subsidiaries.
Transaction exposures are hedged on a rolling six-month basis, primarily by forward foreign exchange transactions.
In addition, where sterling has deviated significantly from its long-term purchasing power parity rates, strategic hedging is undertaken for periods of up to three years.
Translation exposures on the net monetary assets of foreign subsidiaries are generally hedged by borrowings and deposits with group treasury.
An analysis of net monetary assets by functional currency is shown in note 20 to the financial statements.
Translation exposures on the results of foreign subsidiaries are not hedged.
Equity investments in certain subsidiaries and associated companies are hedged by financial instruments in the currencies of those investments.
When comparing the exchange rates achieved in 2003 compared to 2002, profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was adversely impacted by 39 million.
