Underlying profit is reconciled to profit before tax on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement and is disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups underlying trading results.
Acquisition, disposal and integration costs are excluded from underlying results as they reflect the impact of acquisitions and disposals rather than underlying trading performance.
The 16.8m charge in 2016 relating to acquisition costs reflects the legal and professional costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of ICAP.
Additional costs of 6.6m directly associated with the shares issued to acquire ICAP have been recorded directly in equity.
The 19.3m charge for integration costs related to the acquisition of ICAP includes professional fees and employee costs relating to planning, setting up and running the integration workstreams, costs incurred in the marketing and branding of TP ICAP and some severance costs.
As part of the acquisition of PVM in November 2014, the payment to each individual vendor of their share of up toUS$48m of deferred consideration which is subject to achieving revenue targets in the three years after completion was linked to their continued service with the business, and is therefore amortised through the income statement over the relevant service period.
The amortisation charge recognised in 2016 is 16.3m 2015: 10.5m.
The other acquisition and disposal items include a loss on the disposal of Unified Energy Services and costs relating to the acquisition of MOAB.
The charge for amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition recognised in 2016 is 1.4m 2015: 1.2m.
1.2m of this relates to intangible assets other than goodwill arising on the acquisition of PVM, reflecting the PVM brand and the value of customer relationships, that is being amortised through the income statement over the estimated useful lives of those assets, and 0.2m relating to MOAB.
Amortisation of intangible assets arising on consolidation is excluded from underlying results to present the performance of the Groups acquired businesses consistently with its organically grown businesses where such intangible assets are not recognised.
The 5.2m exceptional charge in 2016 relating to the cost improvement programme is discussed previously.
The 25.7m charge in 2015 relates to the cost improvement action taken in that year.
The 3.6m pension scheme settlement gain reflects the difference between the assets used to settle liabilities relating to certain members of the pension scheme that transferred out during the year.
The exceptional items in 2015 include the net 64.4m credit relating to the major legal actions with BGC.
Exceptional items have been excluded from underlying results as they are non-recurring and do not relate to the underlying performance of the business.
Whilst a charge for the cost improvement programme arose in each of 2016 and 2015, the programme was a discrete programme where the costs were recognised over a period of two years.
com 28 Strategic report Financial review continued Net finance expense The underlying net cash finance charge comprises: 9.3m interest payable on the outstanding Sterling Notes: 2.1m interest payable on the revolving credit facility that was drawn down to refinance the Sterling Notes that matured in July 2016: 1.8m commitment fees for the undrawn revolving credit facility: 1.2m of amortisation of debt issue and arrangement costs: and other net interest income of 1.6m.
The underlying net non-cash finance incomecomprises the deemed interest onthe pension scheme net asset of 3.2m, partly offset by the unwinding of  and provisions.
An analysis of the net finance expense is shown in the table below.
2016 2015 m m Receivable on cash balances 2.1 1.8 Payable on Sterling Notes July 2016 5.1 9.9 Payable on Sterling Notes June 2019 4.2 4.2 Interest payable on bank facilities 2.1 Commitment fees payable on bank facilities 1.8 1.6 Amortisation of debt issue and arrangement costs 1.2 1.8 Other interest 0.5 0.4 Net cash finance expense 12.8 16.1 Net non-cash finance income 2.9 1.9 Underlying net finance expense 9.9 14.2 Acquisition related finance expense 6.6 2.0 The acquisition related finance expense comprises: a 2.7m expense for the amortisation of arrangement costs relating to the 470m bank bridge facility the Company entered into in November 2015 to fund the repayment of the 330m of short term debt acquired with ICAP, and the refinancing of the 141.1m Notes that matured in July 2016.
It also includes a 3.3m facility fee for the undrawn 470m bank bridge facility, that was incurred during the year in advance of the transaction completing.
The delay in the completion of the ICAP acquisition also led to a 0.3m expense relating to the preparatory work undertaken for the issue of the bond originally planned to refinance the Notes, which was subsequently suspended as a result of the timing of the transaction.
In addition we incurred a charge of 0.3m reflecting theunwinding of the discount on deferred consideration relating to the acquisitions ofPVM.
Tax The effective rate of tax on underlying Profit Before Tax PBT is18.2% 2015: 18.7%.
The reduction in the effective rate primarily reflects an increase in US taxable profits that continue to be sheltered by unrecognised tax losses together with provision releases that relate to tax uncertainties that have been resolved.
Excluding the benefit from the release of provisions and prior year adjustments, the effective rate of tax on underlying PBT wouldhave been 19.3% 2015: 20.5%.
The tax charge on exceptional and acquisition related items reflects the net oftax charges and tax relief recognised onthose items at the relevant rate for the jurisdiction in which the charges are borne.
No tax has been recognised on the exceptional charges and credits arising in the US in either 2016 or 2015 due to the tax losses available in that jurisdiction.
The effective rate of tax on underlying Group PBT is expected to increase to around 26% from 2017 onwards.
This is driven by theanticipated increase in the underlying taxable profits arising in the US as a result of the ICAP acquisition.
In recent years the Groups US taxable profits have been relieved by tax losses.
Basic EPS The average number of shares used for the basic EPS calculation of 242.3m reflects the 243.6m shares in issue at the beginning of the year, less the time apportioned element of the 1.7m shares acquired by the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy deferred share awards made to senior management, less the 0.2mshares held throughout the year by theEmployee Benefit Trust, which has waived its rights to dividends.
The 310.3m shares issued to acquire ICAP at the end of December 2016 have a nil weighting when calculating the weighted average number of shares for 2016 because the shares were issued at the end of the year and none of the earnings related to the newly issued shares.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 29 Cash flow The cash flow below reconciles the movement from underlying operating profit to cash flow before debt repayments and analyses principal cash flows during the year.
The reported cash flow is shown on page 94 and further analysis is provided in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital expenditure of 17.5m includes the development of electronic platforms and straight through processing technology, andinvestment in IT and communications infrastructure, and the acquisition of a long-term licence of hybrid trading technology from the CME.
Initial contract payments in 2016 were broadly in line with the amortisation charge.
The other working capital outflow in 2016 primarily reflects the increase in trade receivables resulting from the higher level ofbroking activity towards the end of the year compared with 2015, partially offset by a corresponding increase in bonus accruals compared with the prior year end.
During 2016, the Group made 20.7m of cash payments relating to actions taken under the2015 cost improvement programme, 1.2m relating to the 2014 cost improvement programme, and 0.4m relating to the 2011 12 restructuring programme.
Transaction cash payments relating to the acquisition of ICAP were 11.0m in the year.
The Group also paid 17.0m for integration planning and other integration related actions.
The Group paid 6.2m to purchase its own shares, to satisfy deferred share awards made to senior management during the year.
Interest payments in 2016 reflect the underlying income statement charge for net cash finance expenses excluding the charge for the amortisation of debt issue costs.
com 30 Strategic report Financial review continued Tax payments in 2016 of 16.7m include 13.7m paid in the UK.
Tax payments in theUSA continue to be low, reflecting the utilisation of tax losses.
Tax paid inAsia Pacific has decreased primarily reflecting reduced payments due to overpaid tax in theprior year.
The 3.2m acquisitions and investments cashoutflow in 2016 is  relating to the acquisition of MOAB.

When the acquisition of ICAP completed on 30 December, the Group drewdown the committed 470m bank bridge facility that the Company had entered into in November 2015, to repay the 140m drawn on the RCF, and the outstanding 330m debt obligation acquired with ICAP.
The bank bridge loan was subsequently refinanced on 26 January 2017 following the issue of 500m 5.25% unsecured Sterling Notes that mature in January 2024.
Exchange and hedging The income statements of the Groups non-UK operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates.
The most significant exchange rates for the Group are the USD and the Euro.
The balance sheets of the Groups non-UK operations are translated into Sterling using year end exchange rates.
The major balance sheet translation exposure is to the USD The Groups current policy is not to hedge income statement or balance sheet translation exposure.
Average and year end exchange rates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements are shown below.

The Scheme is closed to new members and future accrual.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 April 2013 was concluded in January 2014.
The actuarial funding surplus of the Scheme at that date was 64.2m and under the agreed schedule of contributions the Group will continue not to make any payments into the Scheme.
The 30 April 2016 triennial actuarial valuation is currently in progress and has not been finalised as at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The assets and liabilities of the Scheme are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with IAS 19.
The fair value of the Schemes assets at the end of the year was 317.0m 2015: 289.8m.
The increase reflects the investment return on the assets of 21% less amounts paidas benefits and transfers.
The value of the Schemes liabilities at the end of 2016, calculated in accordance with IAS 19, was 217.1m 2015: 201.6m.
The valuation of the Schemes liabilities at the end of 2016 reflects the demographic assumptions adopted for the most recent triennial actuarial valuation and a discount rate of 2.5% 2015: 3.7%.
Under IAS 19, the Scheme shows a surplus, before the related deferred tax liability, of 99.9m at 31 December 2016 2015: 88.2m.
The Trustees are currently making arrangements for the transfer of the Schemes assets and liabilities to a third a party who will take on responsibility forproviding the Schemes benefits, and remove the Groups responsibility for supporting theScheme financially, a Buy-out.
Securing such a Buy-out will give long term security to the Group.
It should be noted that to the extent the premium charged by the third party exceeds the value of the Schemes liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19, the completion of the Buy-out will result in a reduction of the Groups net assets.
This reduction, with its associated tax credit, will be reflected as an exceptional settlement expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Regulatory capital The Groups lead regulator is the Financial Conduct Authority FCA.
The Group has a waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy requirements under CRD IV.
The Groups current waiver took effect on 30 December 2016, following the acquisition of ICAP, and will expire on 30 December 2026.
Under the terms of the waiver, each investment firm within the Group must be either a limited activity or alimited licence firm and must comply with its individual regulatory capital resources requirements.
TP ICAP, as the parent company, must continue to maintain capital resources in excess of the sum of the solo notional capital resources requirements foreach relevant firm within the Group, theFinancial Holding Company test.
The terms of the waiver require the Group to eliminate the excess of its consolidated own funds requirements compared with its consolidated own funds Excess Goodwill over the ten year period to 30 December 2026.
The amount of the Excess Goodwill mustnot exceed the amount determined as atthe date the waiver took effect and must bereduced in line with a schedule over the ten years, with the first reduction of 25% required to be achieved by June 2019.
The Group expects to achieve this reduction within its current business plan.
The waiver also sets out conditions with respect to the maintenance offinancial ratios relating to leverage, debt service and debt maturity profile.
The Groups regulatory capital headroom under the Financial Holding Company test calculated in accordance with Pillar 1 was 1,922m 2015: 761m.
Many of the Groups broking entities are regulated on a solo basis, and are obliged to meet the regulatory capital requirements imposed by the local regulator of the jurisdiction in which they operate.
The Group maintains an appropriate excess of financial resources in such entities.
Information disclosure under Pillar 3 isavailable on the Groups website: www.
com Acquisition of ICAP As the acquisition completed at the end of 2016, none of the results of ICAP are included in the results reported for 2016 on which the previousparagraphs provide a commentary.
On page 4 we have included an unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement indicating what the aggregated results would have looked like if the combination had been effective from 1 January 2016.
The unaudited Pro Forma Income Statement is compiled based on TP ICAP plcs 2016 audited financial statements discussed in this Annual Report together with financial data extracted from the books and records of ICAP over the 12 month period to December 2016.
Over the 12 months to 31 December 2016, ICAP had revenues of 795m and an operating profit of 108m giving an operating profit margin of 13.6%.
The Acquisition was achieved through the issue of approximately 310m ordinary shares, valuing the transaction at 1,283m.
Under the terms of the transaction, TP ICAP assumed 330m of intercompany debt owed by the acquired business to its former parent.
This was immediately repaid by drawing down the bank bridge facility, which was subsequently refinanced in January 2017 as described above.
