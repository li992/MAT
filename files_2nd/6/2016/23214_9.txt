Return on capital employed ROCE 2016 2015 Change ROCE 14.6% 22.2% 7.6ppt ROCE for the year was 14.6%, a decline of 7.6 percentage points on the prior year.
The decrease in ROCE was due to the decrease in profit for the year and a 11.5% increase in the average adjusted capital employed excluding lease adjustments, primarily due to the acquisition of twenty aircraft during the year and favourable mark-to-market movements in derivative contracts.
The ROCE calculation excludes borrowings, cash and money market deposits and includes an adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements.
The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor ofseven.
EXCHANGE RATES The proportion of revenue and costs denominated in currencies other than sterling remained broadly consistent year-on-year: Revenue Costs 2016 2015 2016 2015 Sterling 50% 49% 27% 27% Euro 39% 40% 35% 32% US dollar 1% 1% 32% 35% Other principally Swiss franc 10% 10% 6% 6% Average exchange rates 2016 2015 Euro - revenue 1.28 1.29 Euro - costs 1.27 1.35 US dollar $1.58 $1.58 Swiss franc CHF 1.51 CHF 1.48 The year-on-year variance in average Euro exchange rates for revenue and costs was principally due to the timing of revenue and cost cash flows.
On average, revenue cash inflows occur several months before cost cash outflows, resulting in a change in Euro exchange rates impacting revenue later than costs.
The net adverse impact on profit due to the year-on-year changes in exchange rates was mainly driven by the stronger average Euro rate: Favourable adverse Euro Swiss franc US dollar Other Total million million million million million Revenue 8 10 4 2 24 Fuel 3 3 Prior year balance sheet revaluations 3 1 5 7 Costs excluding fuel and prior year balance sheet revaluations 84 13 3 2 102 Total 79 2 7 88 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Revenue 2016 2015 pence per pence per million per seat ASK million per seat ASK Seat revenue 4,587 57.43 5.23 4,616 61.54 5.51 Non-seat revenue 82 1.03 0.09 70 0.94 0.08 Total revenue 4,669 58.46 5.32 4,686 62.48 5.59 www.
com 19 Financial review continued Revenue per seat decreased by 6.4% to 58.46 2015: 62.48.
At constant currency, revenue per seat fell by 6.9% to 58.16.
The decrease is attributable to the terrorist events in Egypt, Paris, Brussels, Turkey and Nice resulting in lower demand and yield, the increasingly competitive capacity environment associated with the lower oil prices and the impact of the UKs vote to leave the European Union leading to a more expensive Euro for British travellers during the summer.
Load factor increased by 0.1 percentage points to 91.6%.
Revenue per ASK decreased by 4.8% or by 5.3% at constant currency, impacted by a 6.4% decrease in revenue per seat, partially offset by a 1.7% decrease in the average sector length, mainly from reduced flying to Egypt.
Airports and ground handling cost per seat increased by 6.1% and by 1.5% at constant currency.
Charges at regulated airports increased as anticipated, primarily in Italy, combined with an increase in airport and ground handling costs at Gatwick.
However, these were partially offset by volume deals, combined with savings from renegotiated airport and ground handling contracts.
Crew cost per seat increased by 0.7% to 6.78 but decreased by 2.2% at constant currency.
This was driven by efficiencies obtained from the up-gauging of our fleet, combined with a 1.7% decrease in average sector length and improved crew scheduling.
This was partially offset by pay increases.
Navigation costs increased by 0.8% per seat to 4.21 but decreased by 4.7% at constant currency driven by a 1.7% decrease in average sector length, annual price decreases primarily in France and Germany and a one-off 8 million settlement with Eurocontrol in the 2015 financial year.
Maintenance costs per seat decreased by 3.0% to 2.97 and decreased by 5.3% at constant currency.
A reduction in the number of leased aircraft resulted in reduced maintenance costs, combined with savings obtained from a new maintenance contract.
Other costs per seat increased by 0.8% to 3.71 per seat, and decreased by 1.9% at constant currency.
This was driven by a reduction in aircraft wet leasing and savings in employee costs, which was largely offset by an increase in disruption costs as a result of the terrorist events in Egypt, Paris, Brussels, Turkey and Nice, combined with Air Traffic Control industrial action and adverse weather conditions, resulting in an increase in EU261 associated costs.
Aircraft dry leasing cost per seat decreased by 14.4% to 1.30 and by 14.3% at constant currency.
Depreciation costs increased by 18.5% on a per seat basis.
The movements are principally driven by the acquisition of 20new aircraft last year and a decrease in the number of leased aircraft in the fleet.
The average leased fleet decreased by 6.4% to 64 and the average owned and finance leased fleet increased by 12.6% to 185.
