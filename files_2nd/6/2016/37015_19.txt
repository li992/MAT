Presentation of information We account for our interests in joint ventures using the equity method as required by IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements.
This means that the income statement and the balance sheet include single lines for the Groups total share of post-tax profit and the net investment in joint ventures respectively.
Management review and monitor the business primarily on a proportionally consolidated basis.
This includes the Groups share of joint ventures on an individual line-by-line basis rather than a post-tax profit or net investment basis.
The gures and commentary presented are consistent with our management approach as we believe this provides a more meaningful analysis of the Groups performance.
The other information section gives reconciliations of the income statement and balance sheet between the two bases.
Alternative performance measures are also used to assess the Groups performance.
The significant measures are summarised as follows: Alternative performance measure used Rationale Like-for-like amounts Like-for-like amounts are presented as they indicate operating performance as distinct from the impact of acquisitions or disposals.
In respect of property, the like-for-like measure relates to property which has been owned throughout both periods without significant capital expenditure in either period, so that income can be compared on a like-for-like basis.
For the purposes of comparison of capital values, this will also include assets owned at the previous reporting period end but not throughout the prior period.
Further analysis is presented in the other information section and in the operating review.
Net asset value NAV NAV diluted, adjusted has been included as it is considered to be a key measure of the Groups performance.
The key difference from EPRA NAV is interest rate swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt.
These are excluded as, diluted, adjusted in our view, this provides a more meaningful measure of the Groups performance.
A reconciliation of NAV diluted, adjusted to EPRA NAV is provided in the other information section and a reconciliation to NAV attributable to owners of intu properties plc is provided in note 17 a as well as on page 48.
Underlying earnings Underlying earnings is used to measure the Groups income performance.
It excludes property and derivative valuation movements, exceptional items and related tax.
We present these gures as they are considered to be a key measure of the Groups performance, an industry standard comparable measure and an indication of the extent to which dividend payments are supported by underlying operations.
