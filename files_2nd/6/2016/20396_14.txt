financial review The impact of continuing cost discipline at our mines, together with strong production, led to net cash more than doubling during 2016.
Introduction Continued cost discipline in combination with strong operational performance and an improved gold price in 2016 is reflected in strong cash generation, with net cash increasing by uS$112.9 million to uS$218.5 million as at 31 December 2016. at the same time, reported earnings increased significantly, but were impacted by an increase in tax provisions of uS$69.9 million recorded in Q1 2016 relating to court rulings regarding prior year tax assessments.
This is reflected in the acacia Groups financial results for the year ended 31 December 2016: Revenue of uS$1,053.5 million was uS$185.4 million higher than 2015 driven by the 13% higher sales volumes.
Cash costs decreased to uS$640 per ounce sold from uS$772 per ounce sold in 2015, driven by the higher production base, higher capitalisation of development costs, lower labour costs and lower energy and fuel costs, partly offset by higher sales related costs and increased contracted services costs.
aISC at uS$958 per ounce sold was 14% lower than in 2015 uS$1,112 andrew wray per ounce sold, mainly due to lower cash costs and the higher CHIEF FINaNCIaL OFFICER production base.
EBITDa increased by 137% to uS$415.4 million, mainly driven by the Our strong performance translated higher sales volumes, a higher gold price and lower corporate administration costs.
into a 21% increase in revenues Higher tax expense of uS$147.1 million compared to the prior year and a doubling of EBITDa over expense of uS$73.0 million, driven by an increase in current corporate tax as a result of North Maras increased profitability uS$54.5 million, the previous year.
adjustments in respect of provisions for uncertain tax positions relating to prior years for North Mara and Tulawaka uS$36.7 million and deferred tax of uS$55.9 million driven by provisions for uncertain tax positions for Bulyanhulu uS$35.0 million and movements in temporary differences uS$20.9 million.
