com | Stock Code HILS Strategic Report 24 Case Study Title Permanent bridge installed in the Himalaya In June 2013, devastating floods and landslides in the Himalaya caused the destruction of the bridge at Sonprayag in Uttarakhand.
A quick, temporary bridge was erected but was washed away on two occasions by floods, most recently in June 2015.
The remote site is extremely important as it is part of the route taken each year by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from all over the world on the trek to the Kedarnath Temple, which is some 3,600 metres above sea level.
Acrow Bridge, a leading bridge engineering and supply company enlisted the help of V&S Galvanizing to galvanize a permanent bridge to be installed at the foot of the Himalaya.
Constructing a long, conventional bridge in-situ would not have been feasible due to the locations challenging topography and length of time to build.
However, an Acrow steel span bridge of any length can be operational in days with minimal construction machinery and using unskilled labour.
The 60m, clear-span bridge was customised with modular components, which included two lanes of traffic and construction was completed in six weeks.

com | Stock Code HILS Strategic Report 27 Case Study Weholite Manholes - making the jump to light speed In November 2016 Asset Weholite started work on a new housing project with one of the biggest developers in East Anglia.
A complex stormwater drainage network made up of 900mm and 1,050mm internal diameter pipes with twelve oversize, and totally bespoke, manholes in 1,800mm and 2,100mm diameters.
Originally, the specification was concrete, but the open minded contractor wanted to explore the new and latest technology that the twenty first century has to offer and supported Assets innovative way of thinking.
The contractors did the maths themselves.
No concrete surround, no rocker pipes and manholes ready to use immediately would mean a massive saving in programme time.
On this project alone, the developer and the contractor achieved a 40% saving on programme time - a fifty day programme became thirty days.
The results spoke for themselves: Structural bases designed for high ground water pressure: Components manufactured using the latest industry technology: Bespoke manholes produced with robotic precision: Fully benched with bright yellow anti-slip HDPE flooring: and Fully integrated design, engineering and automated manufacturing ensures bespoke manholes ready for delivery in quick time.
