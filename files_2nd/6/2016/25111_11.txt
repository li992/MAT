Our policy is to ensure compliance with tobacco taxation and product supply legislation and to engage constructively with revenue Oliver Tant Chief Financial Officer authorities worldwide to help combat illicit trade.
We also engage with revenue authorities and governments more widely on policy issues to voice opposition to aspects of regulation and excessively high tobacco taxation that are likely to increase illicit trade to the detriment of consumers, governments and the Group.
