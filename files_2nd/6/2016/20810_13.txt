Ian McHoul Going concern Chief Financial Officer As at 31 December 2016, the Company had net debt of 25 April 2017 1,021m.
Committed facilities under the principal Debt Facility Arrangement and other smaller facilities were 1,745m of which 300m was undrawn.
The Company has taken steps to reduce its debt including the disposal of non-core assets, cost savings measures and suspending dividend payments until the Company is generating sustainable free cash flow.
Despite the actions taken to date, there remained a risk that the leverage ratio would exceed the maximum leverage ratio under the Debt Facility Arrangement of 3.75:1 in the measurement period ended 30 June 2017 and in subsequent periods.
