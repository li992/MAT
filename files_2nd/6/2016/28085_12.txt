Finance review Despite some seasonal challenges to our Health & Hygiene sales, we have seen excellent performance in our strategic growth drivers of Advanced Nutrition, vet and grooming services.
Together with refinancing benefits, this has contributed to our earnings growth of 11.2%.
Our strong cash flow has enabled us to increase the ordinary dividend to shareholders, to a payout ratio of 50%, whilst also investing for growth through the acquisitions of specialist referral centres.
