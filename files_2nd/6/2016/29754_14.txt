STRATEGIC REPORT Chief Financial Officers review OVERVIEW 2016 has been a successful year for the Group with the momentum 2016 FINANCIAL continuing in the legacy business and the successful acquisition of the PAC business.
The key drivers behind the significant increase in overall performance were: PERFORMANCE The ENA segment saw good growth in its profits as unit margins increased across all of its markets.
ARW performed modestly ahead of expectations supporting the decision toinvest in a further increase in nitrile capacity of 90ktes.
Strong organic growth, the PAC The acquisition of the PAC business has strengthened the Groups production platform and provided access to new markets acquisition and the favourable and products.
This is already being reflected in the six months ofprofit delivered since the acquisition on 30 June 2016.
The plan translation of foreign currency to fully integrate the business is on track to deliver the US$12m synergies identified at acquisition.
earnings all contributed to the The weakness of Sterling, particularly since the Brexit vote, has resulted in a significant positive impact on the Groups reported improved earnings and cash flows.
The translation of the overseas profits at more favourable rates has seen an increase in operating profit of 11.5m when compared to that using prior year currency rates.
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES Following the publication of the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures APMs by the European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA on 5 October 2015, the Group has reviewed its use of APMs.
The conclusion of this review was that whilst the Group was in full compliance with the guidelines, there was scope to improve the explanation on the use of APMs and the clarity of their derivation.
Stephen Bennett Chief Financial Officer The Group has consistently used two significant APMs since its adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS in 2005: Underlying performance, which excludes Special Items from IFRS profit measures.
EBITDA, which excludes Special Items, amortisation and depreciation from IFRS operating profit.
The reasons for the use of these APMs and the reconciliation to theIFRS measures has been expanded in notes 1, 2 and 6 onpages 90 and 101 respectively.
Q&A H ow has PAC traded sinceacquisition?
Q PAC was acquired on 30 June 2016 and earned A 6.4million in its first six months.
Synergies are in linewith expectations with US$2.4m run rate of savings at31December 2016.

Thisgrowth is primarily down to improved unit margins.
Synthomer ARW had good growth in the Dispersions business in APAC and China.
This, together with tight cost control in a more challenging nitrile latex market, delivered a 12.3% increase in the operating profit in the legacy business.
Underlying unallocated corporate costs increased by 0.7m reflecting the full year effect of the investment made in 2015 in the strengthening ofthe management team and the investment in the London Head Office.
The weakness of Sterling, especially after the Brexit vote, caused a substantial increase in the Groups reported profit in Sterling.
Forthe European businesses, the rate used for translating profit has moved from 1:1.3830 to 1:1.2180 with a resulting uplift in the 2016 ENAprofit of 8.0m.
Similarly the strengthening of the Malaysian Ringgit against Sterling from 1:MYR 6.0020 to 1:MYR 5.5620 is the main driver for the3.7m currency uplift in the ARW profit.
SPECIAL ITEMS 2016 2015 m m Restructuring and site closure 5.2 5.4 Profit on sale of South African Business 4.7 Sale of land in Malaysia 33.2 6.5 Net acquisition costs of the PAC business 8.8 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 27.0 23.7 14.5 22.6 The following items of income and expense have been reported as Special Items, in line with the comments above.
The restructuring costs relate to the post acquisition integration of the PAC business.
Further costs to complete the integration areexpected in2017.
The 2015 spend related to the completion of the European cost reduction programme.
Substantial tranches of Malaysian land sales, where contracts had been exchanged in prior years, were completed in 2016 producing asignificant profit.
The transaction costs associated with the purchase of the PAC business were 4.3m.
This has been offset in the amount included in the above table by the gain of 13.1m on the foreign exchange contracts taken out as a hedge against the US dollar purchase consideration.
The amortisation of intangibles has increased during the year, partly due to exchange movements and partly due to the intangibles acquired as part of the PAC transaction.

Overall, both the IFRS and Underlying performance profit before taxation have increased significantly reflecting the improvement in business performance, the acquisition of PAC and the favourable foreign currency translation of overseas earnings, and in the case of IFRS the one off profits related to the Malaysian land sales 33.2m and the disposal of our South African business 4.7m.
TAXATION 2016 2015 Underlying Special Underlying Special performance Items IFRS performance Items IFRS Taxation charge credit m 24.5 9.1 15.4 21.0 11.6 9.4 Effective tax rate % 20.0 62.8 11.3 22.0 50.9 13.0 The IFRS effective tax rate is impacted by the tax credit on the Special Items.
It is therefore helpful to consider its two components separately: The effective tax rate on an Underlying basis, excluding the Special Items, has reduced in the period.
The reduction is due to the reduced tax rates the Group benefits from as a result of our Malaysia pioneer status and the reduced corporate tax rates in the UK being greater than the upward pressure on the tax rate we face from operating in higher tax jurisdictions such as Germany.
As we have previously commented, we expect the rate to move up significantly in the next few years as governments start implementing the BEPS related legislation.
The effective tax rate for the Special Items is negative due to the largest charge to profit, the amortisation of the intangibles, attracting a full deferred tax credit.
The tax charge associated with the profit on sale of land in Malaysia and the sale of the South African business is relatively insignificant.
The impact of the Special Items produces a much reduced IFRS effective tax rate of 11.3%.

This business is now a relatively minor part of the Group and hence the non-controlling interest on the underlying performance is not significant.
The large increase in the Special Item reflects the non-controlling interests share 30% in the land sale referred to in the Special Items section above.
The land was owned by Kind Action Sdn Bhd, a 100% subsidiary of Revertex Malaysia Sdn Bhd.

The growth in underlying and IFRS earnings per share shown in the above table is therefore driven predominantly by the same factors that influence the improved profit before taxation described above.
CASH PERFORMANCE The consolidated cash flow statement shows a 41.1% increase in net cash inflow from operating activities from 96.8m to 136.6m, reflecting the continued strength of the existing businesses.
After other operating, investing and financing flows, this leads to an increase incash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts of 43.9m 2015: decrease 20.8m.
The Groups primary focus is on managing net borrowings, as set out on page 88, rather than on cash.
The following summarises the movement in underlying net borrowings and is in the format used by management: 2016 2015 m m Underlying operating profit before joint ventures 128.2 99.1 Movement in working capital 10.2 9.8 Depreciation and amortisation underlying 29.9 22.1 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 45.6 22.8 Business cash flow 122.7 108.2 Interest paid net 3.3 3.4 Tax paid 17.1 15.4 IAS 19 Interest charge 4.5 4.3 Pension funding in excess of IAS 19 charge 12.4 6.3 Share based payments 1.6 0.6 Non-controlling interest and joint venture cash flows 1.1 0.6 Operating cash flow 85.9 80.0 Cash impact of restructuring 5.5 5.4 Sale of property, plant and equipment 34.4 6.8 Purchase of business 156.7 Sales of business 12.8 Dividends paid 30.3 53.7 Exchange 13.5 7.0 Movement in underlying net borrowings 72.9 34.7 Synthomer plc Annual Report 2016 41 STRATEGIC REPORT Chief Financial Officers review continued The strong cash performance shown in the above table together with the investment in organic growth and the PAC acquisition ishighlighted in the following comments: Working capital control is a key focus of the Groups financial management.
The success of this is demonstrated by achieving a cash inflow in a period of both growth for the existing businesses and rising raw material costs during the course of the year.
The increase in capital expenditure, which is largely being invested in our plants, reflects the cash spend on the previously announced nitrile latex capacity increase in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia 14m, and capital expenditure on PAC sites of 7m.
The cash tax rate based on underlying profit before taxation is 13.9%.
The difference between this and the Underlying effective tax rate in the income statement of 20% is due largely to an increase in the tax creditor in a number of jurisdictions as the rise in profits have not yet been reflected in payments on account.
Going forward, it is likely that the Underlying deferred tax charge will start to reverse at some time in the next few years resulting in a cash tax rate above that in the income statement.
The amount shown as pension funding in excess of IAS19 charge mainly reflects the UK deficit funding of 14.5m.
This represents a full year of contributions.
The 2015 comparative amount was reduced by prepayments made in 2014.
The amount shown for the purchase of the PAC business takes the amount in the IFRS cash flow of 165.8m, increases it by 4.0m cash costs of acquisition and reduces it by the 13.1m gain on the forward contracts taken out to protect the Group from currency movements in the period from exchange to contract completion.
The business sale proceeds of 12.8m is the net cash consideration received on the disposal of South African business.
Substantial amounts of the Groups borrowings are maintained in Euros and US dollars as a natural hedge against the asset base in these two currencies.
With the devaluation of Sterling referred to above, the translation at the year end rates has resulted in an exchange loss and therefore a higher borrowings amount offset by a corresponding increase in the asset base in these currencies.
FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY On 17 March 2016, the Group increased the size of its revolving credit facility from 210m to 370m and at the same time increased the number of banks supporting the facility from three to five.
This increase both provided the necessary funds to complete the acquisition of the PAC business and maintained substantial headroom.
In addition to the facility headroom identified, the Group had cash and cash equivalents at 31 December of 117.4m 2015: 50.9m.
2016 2015 m m Committed facilities 370.0 224.9 Drawn at 31 December 203.9 89.9 Headroom 166.1 135.0 The principal financial covenant in this facility remains net borrowings must be less than 3.5 times EBITDA at 31 December 2016 reducing to 3.0 times EBITDA by 31 December 2017, providing greater headroom in the first 18 months after the acquisition of the PAC business.
2016 2015 Net borrowings m 150.3 77.4 EBITDA m 160.1 125.0 Net borrowings EBITDA 0.9 0.6 The financial strength shown in the above tables both confirms the Groups liquidity and demonstrates the availability of funds for both organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions.
It also provides a strong base to finance a more transformational acquisition.
The viability statement is included on page 33.

The following should be noted: Whilst the UK pension cost has remained static, the charge for the overseas pension schemes has increased.
This is mainly due to the additional employees associated with the acquisition of the PAC business.
The most significant factor in the 47.5m increase in the post retirement obligations is the actuarial loss suffered by the UK scheme.
Thisloss of 47.2m reflects the reduction in the discount rate assumption to be applied under IFRS which reduced from 3.8% to 2.70%.
ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL ACCOUNTING The accounting for the acquisition of the PAC business and for the disposal of the South African business is shown in the notes 31 and 32 respectively.
For the acquisition, the assets and liabilities have been included at fair value with the balance of consideration shown as goodwill.
KPMG LLP were engaged to advise on the fair value of the Property, Plant and Equipment PPE.
Overall their conclusion was that the total fair value of the PPE was in line with the carrying values although there were some differences in asset categories which have been adjusted accordingly.
KPMG LLP also performed a valuation of the intangibles, of which the only one of significant value was the customer relationships.
Accordingly, on acquisition the Group recognised goodwill and acquired intangibles in relation to the PAC business of 53.9m and 22.0m respectively.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT Today we have announced another bolt-on acquisition, Perstorp Belgium, for a total enterprise value of 78m.
This will be funded from the Groups existing financial resources.
Our 2016 Strategic Report from pages 1 to 43 has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on 6 March 2017.
