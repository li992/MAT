Intangible asset amortisation represents the non-cash cost asset amortisation.
IAS 19 revised was introduced in 2011 and was first of amortising intangible items including acquired contracts and software effective for the June 2014 year end.
It amended the methodology for costs.
The charge associated with these previously acquired assets can be recognition of the interest and service costs associated with the present significantly different year on year reflecting the amortisation profile and the value of assets and liabilities for pension schemes.
This includes rail pension timing of when the acquired contracts software developments arose and is schemes where liabilities represent future commitments which are well therefore removed.
In previous periods we have also removed exceptional beyond the period covered by the Groups rail franchises.
The standard items such as one-off restructuring costs and intangible asset impairments requires that the cost of providing pension benefits in the future is when they arise.
The Board believes that these adjusted key performance discounted to a present value using corporate bond yield rates.

Taxation On a statutory basis, net tax for the year was 18.5m 2015: 19.4m, equivalent to an effective rate of 18.5% 2015: 24.7%, below the UK statutory rate for the period of 20% 2015: 20.75%.
Excluding the impact of the deferred tax rate reduction of 3.7m, the tax rate would have been 22.2%, as a result of non-deductible items such as German and Singaporean bid costs.
In the year ended 27 June 2015, the underlying rate, excluding goodwill impairment of 4.9m, was 23.2%.
The statutory rate will reduce to 19% and 17% in 2017 and 2020 respectively.
We expect our effective tax rate to be 2% to 3% above the statutory rate in future years.
