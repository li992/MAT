Treasury is not forgiving: theres no room for mistakes or taking your eye offthe ball.
I have been with OSB since 2012 through a period of significant growth and it has been good to have gone through the journey and understand why OneSavings Bank is different.
I invested in the systems and processes needed to closely manage the Banks treasury assets and risks.
In an uncertain external environment Treasury adds certainty.
We dont take directional views on the book: instead we use a mixture of natural hedging through our fixed retail deposits, swaps and treasury products to manage the Banks position, mitigating the impact of interest rate risk.
We also have to be responsive.
One of the things that I like best is getting involved in product development both for savings and lending to ensure our products deliver for both customers and the Bank.
My role is encouraging the business rather than just managing what I am given.
It helps me make a difference and keeps OSB Treasury at the forefront, ensuring strong, accessible liquidity and predictable cash flows in all market conditions.
