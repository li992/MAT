It travels through the pipeline from the Chinarevskoye field site to the railway loading terminal, where it is first stored and then transported by railcar to final off-takers.
The separation between our stabilised liquid condensate and crude oil occurs during transportation through the same pipeline using a PIG system.
This ensures quality is not compromised as it would be in amulti-purpose pipeline and allows forhigher export prices.
The maximum throughput of our oil pipeline is 3 million tonnes per year.
The rail loading terminal, which receives the crude oil and condensate, has a capacity of 3-4 million tonnes per year.

The Ministry of Oil & Gas signed supplementary agreements relating tothose rights, which became effective from 1 March 2013.
Geology Decades of successful exploration activities have shown that the three fields contain hydrocarbons suitable forcommercial production.
The bulk ofthe hydrocarbons are located in the Bashkirian stage of the Carboniferous, with reservoirs of Permo-Carboniferous age.
Prior to development there will be significant appraisal required to explore existing accumulations and deeper intervals.
Appraisal programme During 2016, we drilled an appraisal well at Rostoshinskoye.
This appraisal well changed the geological model ofthe Rostoshinskoye field and also increased the reserves potential of the Bashkirian section also of the adjacent Darjinskoye field.
The test of this well will be completed in 2017 and the reserves will be re-estimated in the 2017reserves report.
Preparations for re-entering an existing well on the Darjinskoye field are also currently underway.
