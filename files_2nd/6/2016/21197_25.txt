management in the Group, including climate risk.
Climate change is highlighted as an emerging risk in the 2016 Annual Report & Accounts, as it has been in previous years.
It is therefore assessed for its proximity and significance to Aviva via our embedded market and group emerging risk processes.
Emerging risks are regularly reviewed and their potential impact is evaluated to understand if they are significant at an Aviva level over longer time periods than the current business plan.
This is to ensure all risks to both the medium and long term future of Aviva receive appropriate attention.
Board Governance Committee one of this Committees key responsibilities is to oversee Avivas conduct in relation to its  LLP, corporate and societal obligations, including setting the guidance, direction and policies for Avivas customer and corporate Chartered Accountants, London responsibility agenda and advising the Board and management on these matters.
This Committee met six times in 2016 and 8 March 2017 formally considered Avivas strategic approach to climate change during the year.
The Committee continues to ensure the Board 1 The maintenance and integrity of Avivas website is the responsibility of the Directors: the work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no remains informed on the issue.
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the reported Selected Information or Reporting Criteria when presented on Avivas website.
Strategy While Avivas climate change strategy relates to the entire Group, the businesses that form Aviva work to different risk horizons.
For example, general insurance has primarily an 18 month outlook although recognising there are longer term risks compared to the much longer term outlook taken by Avivas life and asset management businesses, as providers of pensions and long term savings.
We recognise that the increased severity and frequency of weather related losses has the potential to turn earnings events into capital events.
Consequently, large catastrophic losses are explicitly considered in economic capital modelling to ensure Aviva and its subsidiaries are resilient to such scenarios.
In July 2015, we published Avivas Strategic Response to Climate Change setting out our approach to acting on climate-related 2 investment risk over the next five years 2015-2020.
This encompasses how we allocate our capital and how we use our influence 3 to support the transition to a lower carbon 2C aligned economy.
We provided an update to this Response in 2016.
We are closely monitoring our exposure to sectors or subsectors particularly exposed to transition risk and analysing at a more granular level the individual company level risk.
We are therefore particularly supportive of the Financial Stability Boards TCFD as we believe this would provide the ideal framework for this type of disclosure.
We remain deeply committed to ensuring environmental, social and governance issues are included in our investment analysis and decision making and continue to drive better integration of carbon and climate risk factors into investment decisions.
The dynamic and interconnected nature of climate risk, in addition to current limitations in some necessary data sets, means understanding and managing climate related risks remains an important focus for our business.
Climate change is part of our asset management House View, which outlines our view of the economic outlook and is updated on a quarterly basis to provide key climate-related physical or policy trends and developments.
We have held a number of briefing sessions with fund managers and analysts to discuss the implications of climate change across asset classes.
We have explicitly incorporated corporate responsibility disclosure and performance into Avivas voting policy since 2001 and we were one of the first asset managers to do so globally.
Risk Management identification, assessment and management The ways in which the insurance sector could be impacted by climate change are diverse, complex and uncertain.
However, for the purposes of our response we have focused on the three risk factors that the Prudential Regulation Authority identified in its 2015 report Physical, Transition, and Liability.
Physical Risk Insurance risks We recognise that the increased severity and frequency of weather-related losses is a driver of results volatility and may impact our ability to write profitable new business over the longer term.
This has driven a focus on explicitly considering the impact of climate weather in financial planning and pricing.
Our exposure is limited by our general insurance business being predominantly in Northern Europe and Canada.
Large catastrophic losses are explicitly considered in economic capital modelling to make sure the Group and its subsidiaries are resilient to such scenarios.
We consider our top three insurance climate-related risks to be: 1 http: www.

We undertake this Risks relating to our business 332 engagement individually and collaboratively, actively supporting shareholder resolutions, and co-filing similar resolutions as appropriate.
We continue to be committed to increasing our investment in low carbon infrastructure and to considering how best we support the financing of the transition to a lower carbon economy.
Liability Risk Aviva has negligible exposure to litigation risks on the insurance side through liability contracts such as professional indemnity for Directors and Officers and Pension Trustee Liability insurances.
However, in certain jurisdictions we are aware of regulatory and legal challenges with respect to corporate climate related impacts and disclosures, which may impact us given our equity and corporate debt exposures.
Direct impact from legal challenges and any associated fines are likely to be limited to specific companies.
Metrics and Targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities Investment We have enhanced our ESG heat map to include proxy climate risk metrics.
This heat map is available to our analysts and fund managers via Bloomberg and updated on a monthly basis.
This includes a composite carbon exposure metric based on the carbonintensity of business activities, the extent of operations in jurisdictions with stringent carbon emissions regulations and the quality of a companys carbon management.
We targeted a 500 million annual investment in low-carbon infrastructure from 2015-2020, and an associated carbon saving target of 100,000 CO tonnes annually.
In 2016 we signed 450 million of new investment into wind, solar, biomass and energy 2 efficiency, and our Infrastructure Income Fund will deliver over 150,000 tonnes of CO e savings annually when the projects are 2 operational.
Aviva holds over 247 million in green bonds.
In July 2015, we identified an initial set of 40 companies with more than 30% of their business by revenue associated with thermal coal mining or coal power generation.
We undertook focused engagement with these companies setting out our expectations on their governance, business strategy, operational efficiency, responsible climate and energy policy advocacy and crucially whether any of those companies have any plans for new investment in coal generating capacity.
Since then we have had meaningful engagement, often with multiple meetings or calls with 80% of the companies concerned.
In 2016, we met with a further 127 companies to discuss sustainability governance, sustainability disclosure and climate change, and environment.
Over the same period, we supported 86.8% of climate change-related shareholder resolutions.
In 2015, we actively supported the Strategic Resilience for 2035 and beyond shareholder resolutions, lead by the Aiming4A Coalition, proposed at the BP, Shell, and Statoil AGMs.
We attended both the BP and Shell AGMs in support of the resolution and to question the Board.
In 2016, we co-filed similar resolutions at the AGMs of Anglo American, Glencore and Rio Tinto.
In September 2015, we signed the Montreal Investment carbon foot-printing pledge.
At the time, we were one of the largest asset managers to support this initiative.
In November 2015, we published the carbon footprint of our four largest equity portfolios collectively totalling 13 billion.
This represented one third of our equity assets and 5% of our total assets under management.
Insurance We build the possibility of extreme weather events into our planning to help us understand the impact and ensure our pricing is adequate.
Whist there may be incremental changes in the level of risk during the planning period these are not considered to be material.
Catastrophic event model results are supplemented by in-house disaster scenarios to quantify cross class accumulation risks such as a major weather event, aggregation of major weather events and a scenario of a long dry summer driving a subsidence event year: these have been considered as Realistic Disaster Scenarios RDSs and have had their potential impact assessed.
To date activity has been limited to stress and scenario testing: for example in 2016 we have examined the impact of an extreme windstorm in Northern Europe.
We continue to invest in analytical solutions such as flood mapping, predictive analytics and risk mitigation techniques that help us better understand risk being transferred to us from our customers and to respond more rapidly when our customers need us.
