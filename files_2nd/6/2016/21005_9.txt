Financial Review Overview These results for 2016 are the first for Ascential plc following its IPO in February.
Immediately prior to the offering, the Group underwent a pre-IPO reorganisation as part of which Ascential plc was incorporated and acquired the Group.
The basis of preparation note on page 128 describes how the pre-IPO reorganisation has been accounted for under the principles of reverse acquisition accounting such that these financial statements are presented as if the Company had always owned the Group.
In 2015 the Group had two reportable trading segments Exhibitions & Festivals and Information Services.
During 2016, and consistent with the evolution of its internal management reporting structures, the Group has reported the Heritage Brands referred to earlier as a separate, third trading segment.
As a result of ongoing discussions, the Board now considers a sale of the segment to be highly probable and has therefore reclassified it as a discontinued operation.
This means that the results of the Heritage Brands for both 2016 and 2015 are included as a single line item within profit after tax on the face of the income statement.
This Financial Review therefore firstly addresses the key trends in continuing operations and then, as a separate section, discontinued operations.
40.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin Exhibitions & Festivals 29.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin Information Services Mandy Gradden Chief Financial Officer 16 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The results for the year are set out in the consolidated profit and loss statement and show, for continuing operations, revenue of 299.6m 2015: 256.6m, an Organic growth of 9.5%, and reported operating profit of 32.1m 2015: 24.3m.
Adjusted EBITDA was 95.9m 2015: 76.6m, an Organic growth of 11.5%.
The Group also delivered strong cash flow in 2016 with free cash flow of 90.9m 2015: 79.9m, a conversion of 85% 2015: 88%.
A core KPI and strategic goal of the Group is Organic revenue growth as this is the most efficient method of growth that measures the underlying health of the business and is a key driver of shareholder value creation.
Organic revenue growth eliminates the distorting impact of acquisitions and disposals and that element of growth which is driven by changes in foreign exchange rates.
It is an alternative performance measure and is discussed in more detail on page 25.
Adjusted EBITDA is also an alternative performance measure discussed in detail on page 24.
It is used in the day-to-day management of the Group in order to aid comparisons with peer group companies, manage banking covenants and provide a reference point for assessing the operational cash generation of the Group.
It eliminates items arising from portfolio investment and divestment decisions, and from changes to capital structure.
Such items arise from events which are non-recurring or intermittent, and while they may generate substantial income statement amounts, do not relate to the ongoing operational performance that underpins long-term value generation.
The Group monitors its operational balance sheet efficiency with reference to operational cash conversion, defined as Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA.
The section on alternative performance measures on page 27 also defines these terms.
Segmental results A summary of the operational performance of the Group across the three segments is given in the table below.

17 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 Financial Review continued Continuing operations Revenue Revenues from continuing operations in 2016 grew to 299.6m 2015: 256.6m, an increase of 43.0m.
However, direct comparability was affected by the disposal of the MBI business in January 2015, the acquisition of RetailNet Group in June 2015, the establishment of WGSNs 49% joint venture with CTIC whereby revenue of the joint venture is no longer consolidated, the acquisition of One Click Retail in August 2016 and movements in exchange rates between the two years.
Adjusting for these factors, Organic growth in revenue from continuing operations was as follows: Year-on-year Organic revenue growth 2016 2015 Exhibitions & Festivals 12.3% 13.1% Information Services 5.4% 3.6% Continuing operations 9.5% 9.0% Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased to 95.9m 2015: 76.6m, an increase of 19.3m on a reported basis and an expansion in Adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.1 percentage points to 32.0%.
The reported growth in Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the same factors described above.
On an Organic basis, Group Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.5%, with Exhibitions & Festivals growing at 17.5% and Information Services growing at 4.7%.
Foreign currency translation impact Following the Groups acquisition of One Click Retail and the growth of Cannes Lions and Money20 20, the Groups reported performance is increasingly sensitive to movements in both the euro and US dollar against pounds sterling.
In 2016, sterling weakened substantially against both the US dollar and euro compared to 2015, as can be seen in the table below: Weighted average rate Closing rate Currency 2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 Change Euro 1.25 1.40 10% 1.17 1.36 14% US dollar 1.30 1.53 14% 1.23 1.48 17% When comparing 2016 and 2015, changes in currency exchange rates had a favourable impact of 13.7m on Group revenue and 7.7m on Group Adjusted EBITDA.
On a segmental basis, the favourable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was as follows: Exhibitions & Festivals: 9.9m impact on revenue and 5.7m impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
Information Services: 3.8m impact on revenue and 2.0m impact on Adjusted EBITDA.
In 2016, on a continuing basis, the Group: received approximately 29% of its revenue, incurred 9% of its costs and generated 70% of its Adjusted EBITDA in euros: and received approximately 22% of its revenue, incurred 14% of its costs and generated 37% of its Adjusted EBITDA in US dollars.
The Groups external borrowings are denominated 50% in euros with the balance split between US dollars and pounds sterling.
Following the Groups recent US acquisitions and planned disposal of the Heritage Brands, in 2017 the Group will review the denomination of the currency of its external borrowings.
Amortisation and impairment Amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations was 28.8m in 2016 2015: 26.6m with the increase of 2.2m due to the acquisition of One Click Retail as well as the impact of the strength of the US dollar against sterling in respect of the Groups US intangibles.
The Group undertakes a periodic review of the carrying value of its intangible assets and as a result of this review there was no impairment recognised in the current or prior year relating to intangible assets acquired through business combinations.
18 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Share-based payments The charge for share-based payments of 1.4m for Continuing operations 2015: 0.5m incorporates the Share Incentive Plan, the SAYE and the Performance Share Plan as well as a small charge for the pre-IPO Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Further details are set out in Note 10.
Exceptional items The following table sets out the exceptional items incurred by the Group that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.
As further explained on page 95, the Group considers that separately identifying such items improves comparability of the financial results.
Exceptional items m 2016 2015 IPO expenditure 3.6 1.7 Deferred consideration Acquisition-related contingent employment costs One Click Retail 5.3 Acquisition-related contingent employment costs Money20 20 4.4 5.5 Adjustment to deferred consideration on prior year acquisitions Money20 20 6.2 Adjustment to deferred consideration on prior year acquisitions other 0.6 Expenses related to acquisition and disposal activities 1.6 0.9 Acquisition integration costs 0.1 0.9 Expenses of previous holding company structure 0.1 0.1 Professional fees on capital restructuring 0.3 Exceptional items relating to continuing operations 20.7 9.4 The acquisition-related contingent employment costs relate to primarily deferred consideration on the acquisition of Money20 20 and of One Click Retail which, absent the link to continued employment, would have been treated as consideration.
Under the sale and purchase agreements, approximately half the deferred consideration is contingent on both i the results of the business in the post-acquisition period and ii the continued employment of the founders.
In accordance with IFRS, this element of the deferred consideration is treated as an expense recognised over the contractual service periods.
In 2016 this expense amounted to 9.7m 2015: 5.5m and further exceptional expense is expected in 2017-2019 in respect of these two acquisitions.
In addition, an adjustment to deferred consideration of $7.8m arose in respect of the initial recognition of the deferred consideration as capital as a result of the excellent performance of Money20 20 Europe in 2016, which was significantly better than original expectations.
Net finance costs The Groups net finance expense net finance cost less net finance income for the year was 33.8m 2015: 72.7m with the substantial reduction driven by the reduction in external leverage and borrowing costs and the repayment of shareholder debt on IPO.
The non-recurring costs of the shareholder debt that existed prior to the IPO of 5.3m 2015: 43.9m and the write-off of unamortised loan arrangement fees that occurred on refinancing of 10.7m 2015: 4.3m have been treated as adjusting items.
The adjusted net finance expense after eliminating these non-recurring items was as follows: Adjusted net finance expense m 2016 2015 Interest payable on external debt 10.1 28.3 Interest receivable 0.1 0.1 Amortisation of loan arrangement fees 1.4 2.4 Other finance charges 2.9 2.3 Foreign exchange and derivatives loss gain 3.5 8.4 17.8 24.5 The interest expense on the Groups borrowings was 10.1m 2015: 28.3m with the reduction driven by the repayment of debt as well as the reduced rate of interest payable following the Groups IPO in mid-February 2016.
19 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 Financial Review continued Taxation The Groups tax charge on profit from continuing operations was a credit of 13.4m 2015: 11.3m and was made up of a current tax charge of 4.1m 2015: 0.3m and a deferred tax credit of 17.5m 2015: 11.6m.
This comprised: an adjusted tax charge of 10.9m up from 4.6m in the prior year, being an effective tax rate of 17% 2015: 13% : and a tax credit of 24.3m 2015: 15.9m on loss on adjusting items of 66.9m 2015: 79.9m, primarily relating to the credit on the unwind of the deferred tax liability relating to acquired intangibles.
The effective tax rate of 17% on adjusted profit before tax benefited from 8.3m 2015: 5.8m of further recognition of US tax losses as a deferred asset following a later than expected change of control restriction and an increase in the value of the US group at the point of that change of control.
Absent this further loss recognition, the effective tax rate on Adjusted profit before tax would have been 29%.
Cash tax paid was a small cash outflow of 3.5m 2015: 1.2m as the Group continued to benefit by 8.7m 2015: 1.7m from the utilisation of historic tax losses in the UK and US which are expected to benefit the Groups cash flow over the medium term.
The Group has a total deferred tax asset of 54.9m 2015: 40.2m relating to UK and US losses, accelerated capital allowances and US acquired intangibles and deferred consideration and this is expected to convert into cash savings over the next 15 years.
Its deferred tax liability amounted to 30.3m 2015: 40.7m and related to acquired intangibles.
As described in detail on page 66, the recognition of deferred tax assets on US losses requires considerable judgements to be made including overall future trading performance of the US group, assessment of future earn-outs payable and valuation of the US group at the point of change of control.
In total, a net deferred tax asset of 17.4m 2015: 11.5m has been recognised in respect of US taxes.
It is notable that each 1% change in the US Federal Tax Rate by the US tax authorities would impact the balance sheet and tax charge by 0.7m.
Discontinued operations Revenue from discontinued operations in 2016 was 57.9m 2015: 62.5m, a reduction of 4.6m or 10.2% on an Organic basis.
The key driver of the reduction was the performance of the MEED brand where, despite a strong performance from its high value digital subscriptions product MEED Projects, revenue fell by 1.9m mainly attributable to the conferences line of revenue.
In addition, print advertising revenue in the UK brands fell by 3.1m.
Adjusted EBITDA was 11.6m, down by 2.7m from the 14.3m in the prior year as the business was only able to partially mitigate the 4.6m revenue drop.
In discontinued operations, the Group also incurred 1.9m of exceptional costs in preparing the Heritage Brands for sale including vendor diligence, legal fees, separation costs and write-off of leasehold improvements.
In the prior year, the Group had incurred exceptional costs of 1.7m as a result of the creation of the Plexus operating company from the combination of EMAP, MEED, 4C Group and Planet Retail.
The Adjusted tax charge attributable to discontinued operations was 1.8m 2015: 2.1m, being an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.4% 2015: 16.7%.
Capital structure and the IPO refinancing On 12 February 2016, in order to achieve an opening leverage ratio of c. 2.5x, the Group refinanced its borrowing facilities and entered into new post-IPO term loan facilities of 66m, 171m and $96m as well as a revolving credit facility of 95m.
Together with the net proceeds of the IPO of 183m, the Group used the new term loan facilities to repay all amounts under the Groups existing senior facilities and to cancel certain related hedging arrangements.
The facilities mature in February 2021, have an initial rate of interest of 2.25% over LIBOR and are subject to a net leverage ratio covenant of 4.5x, which is measured at December 2016 and then semi-annually thereafter.
The covenant ratio falls to 4.0x in December 2017.
Arrangement fees of 5.3m were incurred and will be amortised over the term of the facility.
The Groups strong operating cash flow was partially deployed on the acquisition of One Click Retail, and after accounting for adverse foreign exchange and derivative movements of 32.6m during the year, the Groups leverage ratio reduced to 2.1x at 31 December 2016 from 2.5x immediately following the IPO and 4.2x at the end of the prior year.
The Groups leverage target is 1.5-2.0x to allow a healthy mix of dividends and cash for investment in bolt-on acquisitions.
20 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Acquisitions and disposals As part of the management of its focused portfolio of products, Ascential regularly assesses opportunities to acquire high-growth products operating in sectors with the potential for scale that may benefit from Ascentials know-how and infrastructure.
The Group actively managed its portfolio of product brands in 2016 and 2017 to date.
One Click Retail In August 2016, the Group acquired 100% of US-based e-commerce analytics provider Oneclickretail.
com LLC One Click Retail for initial cash consideration of $44m plus future earn outs expected to total $85m.
The future earn outs are based on multiples of Adjusted EBITDA of the business for the four years 2016 to 2019 payable in cash or, for certain elements, shares at Ascentials option.
A portion of the earn-out payments is also subject to founders remaining in employment with the company.
The total aggregate consideration, including initial consideration and earn out payments, is capped at $225m in the event that stretching profit targets are reached, and will be paid over the period to February 2020.
The Group incurred 0.9m of professional fees on the acquisition which it recorded as an exceptional cost, and the business contributed 3.1m of revenue and 2.2m of Adjusted EBITDA to the Groups 2016 results.
Heritage Brands As part of its growth strategy to focus its resources and investment on its largest brands and those with the highest growth potential, after the year end, in January 2017, the Group announced that it had separated 13 Heritage Brands into a separate operating entity that is held for sale.
Consistent with the evolution of its internal management reporting structure during 2016, the Group has reported the Heritage Brands as a separate segment.
The Heritage Brands generated revenue of 57.9m in 2016 2015: 62.5m and 11.6m of Adjusted EBITDA 2015: 14.3m.
Also in January 2017, the Group announced the sale of the first of the Heritage Brands, Health Services Journal to Wilmington plc for a consideration of 19m, payable in cash subject to normal working capital adjustments at completion.
In 2016, HSJ generated revenue of 10m and EBITDA of 2.8m.
MediaLink In February 2017 the Group announced that, subject to customary regulatory approvals, it had agreed to acquire 100% of US-based media advisory and business services provider MediaLink for an initial cash consideration of $69m plus future earnouts expected to total between $42m and $62m payable in cash or, for certain elements, shares at Ascentials option.
A portion of the earn-out payments is subject to founders remaining in employment with the company.
MediaLink is growing rapidly and delivered unaudited revenue of $54m and Adjusted PBT of $14m in 2016, with year-on-year growth of 29% and 24% respectively.
21 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 Financial Review continued Cash flow The Groups cash flow statement and net debt position can be summarised as follows: m 2016 2015 Adjusted EBITDA 107.5 90.9 Working capital movements 1.1 Adjusted cash generated from operations 107.5 92.0 Capital expenditure 13.1 10.9 Tax paid 3.5 1.2 Free cash flow 90.9 79.9 % free cash flow conversion 85% 88% Exceptional costs paid 11.6 12.1 Loan to joint venture 4.5 0.1 Acquisition consideration paid 39.4 19.6 Disposal proceeds received 0.2 10.6 Cash flow before financing activities 35.6 58.7 Net interest paid 20.8 37.9 Dividends paid 6.0 Proceeds of issue of shares net of expenses 188.5 0.2 Debt repayments drawdown 189.4 0.9 Net cash flow 7.9 21.9 Opening cash balance 44.4 21.7 FX movements 9.6 0.8 Closing cash balance 61.9 44.4 Borrowings 290.3 436.1 Capitalised arrangement fees 4.3 10.5 Derivative financial instruments 0.4 1.1 Net debt 223.7 382.3 The Group generated Adjusted operating cash flow of 107.5m 2015: 92.0m, an increase of 17%, due to the strong operational performance of the business.
A major feature of the Groups cash flow in 2016 was the IPO, which generated proceeds of 200.0m or 188.5m net of expenses, which was used to reduce the Groups indebtedness.
Capex was slightly ahead of 2015 at 13.1m 2015: 10.9m reflecting a fit out of the Groups Paddington offices to accommodate the entire Exhibitions & Festivals business following the combination of the i2i and Lions operating companies under a single leadership.
The Group therefore generated free cash flow of 90.9m 2015: 79.9m, an increase of 14%, which was used to fund interest payments, acquisition costs and exceptional items with the balance reducing net indebtedness.
Earnings per share Earnings per share has been presented on both a statutory and Proforma basis.
The Proforma basis is based on the 400.0m shares in issue upon IPO as opposed to those in issue at part way through the IPO restructuring and is therefore more relevant to ongoing shareholders of the Group.
Adjusted diluted Proforma EPS of 15.5p per share is 48% ahead of the 10.5p per share recorded for 2015 and total diluted Proforma EPS of 3.9p per share is substantially ahead of the prior year loss per share of 6.3p.
22 Ascential plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Capital reduction Ascential plc was incorporated in January 2016 and acquired the Groups business operations in February 2016.
As part of the IPO restructuring, the Company completed a reduction of its share capital, whereby: i the entire amount standing to the credit of the Companys share premium account was cancelled: ii 876m deferred shares which were issued by way of a bonus issue for the purpose of capitalising the Companys capital reserve were cancelled: and iii the nominal value of each issued ordinary share in the capital of the Company was reduced from 0.10 to 0.01 each the Capital Reduction.
Following the Capital Reduction, as at 8 June 2016, the issued share capital of the Company consisted of 400,542,500 ordinary shares of 0.01 each.
The distributable reserves created by the Capital Reduction amount to 476.2m.
Dividends Ascential plc was incorporated in January 2016 and, as indicated at the time of the IPO, the Board targets a dividend payout ratio of 30% of Adjusted profit after tax.
Consequently, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.2p per share to holders on the register on 19 May 2017 which, together with the Companys maiden interim dividend of 1.5p paid in November 2016, makes a total dividend for the 2016 financial year of 4.7p.
