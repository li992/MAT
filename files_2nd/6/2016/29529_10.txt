While this early progress is encouraging, further significant improvement in our financial performance is required.
The timing and extent of any financial benefit that might arise should the macro environment improve in 2017 remains uncertain.

We remain confident in the opportunities inour markets as well as the ability of our people and our strategy to capture them.
