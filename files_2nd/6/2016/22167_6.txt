Chief Financial Officers Review We believe that there is significant potential for further returns of surplus cash to shareholders Darren Bryant Chief Financial Officer The FY16' accounting period refers to the year ended 31 January 2016 and the comparative period FY15' refers to the year ended 31 January 2015.
Revenue Total Group revenue during the year grew by 8.0% to 381.6m FY15: 353.3m, a similar growth rate to the prior year, with both of the Groups businesses contributing to this increase: FY16 FY15 m m Increase Card Factory 363.4 337.8 7.6% Getting Personal 18.2 15.5 17.5% Group 381.6 353.3 8.0% Strong growth in like-for-like LFL' sales was delivered across all retail channels: FY16 FY15 Card Factory stores 2.8% 1.8% Card Factory online 497.7% 84.0% Card Factory combined 3.0% 1.8% Getting Personal 17.5% 23.1% Total online combined 22.8% 23.5% Single cards, Christmas boxed cards and non-card products all contributed to the LFL sales growth in Card Factory stores, with a particularly strong performance in non-card as a number of new ranges were introduced into store.
As a consequence, there was a continuation of the marginal mix shift to non-card, the full year mix being 56.4% single cards FY15: 57.9%, 41.3% non-card FY15: 39.9% and 2.3% Christmas boxed cards FY15: 2.2%.
We expect this trend to continue as we further improve our non-card offering.
Revenue from the new, reinvigorated Card Factory transactional website grew by approximately 500% from less than 0.2m in FY15 to 1m in FY16.
Getting Personal revenue growth was particularly strong in the first half, as a number of prior year strategic initiatives continued to bear fruit.
As expected, revenue growth in the second half, whilst still strong and double digit, was lower than the first half given the much tougher comparatives in that period.
A total of 50 net new stores were added during the year FY15: 51.

The small increase in this cost ratio, as also seen in the first half of the year, principally reflects foreign exchange movements, the ongoing shift in sales mix to lower margin Card Factory non-card product and the strong LFL performance at Getting Personal, offset in part by improvements in underlying product margins.
As highlighted previously and discussed in more detail below, foreign exchange margin pressure remains an area of concern for FY17 given the recent significant depreciation of Sterling versus the US Dollar.
Store wages: includes wages and salaries including bonuses for store based staff, together with national insurance, pension contributions, overtime, holiday and sick pay.
This cost increased as new stores opened but remained broadly flat as a ratio of revenue.
As highlighted in the interim results, the new National Living Wage NLW' will place pressure on this cost ratio in FY17 and beyond.
We estimate that, in each year over the next five years, the implementation of NLW will increase store wages by approximately 2.5m per annum based on the current store estate, over and above the cost increase we were anticipating from the National Minimum Wage.
We have identified initiatives to mitigate approximately 1m of the FY17 increase and we are targeting a similar level of mitigation in future years.
Subject to LFL sales growth, we therefore anticipate a small annual increase in this cost ratio over the medium term.
Store property costs: consists principally of store rents net of rental incentives, business rates and service charges.
This cost has also increased in absolute terms as new stores have been opened but has reduced slightly as a ratio of revenue.
A number of the Groups existing stores remain on leases taken out before the recession when the property market was stronger and the Companys covenant was weaker.
The improvement in this cost ratio reflects changes to these factors for both new stores and breaks and expiries on existing leases as well as the impact of positive LFL sales.
We believe that there remains an opportunity for further savings as these older leases come up for renewal over the coming years.
Other direct expenses: includes store opening costs, store utility costs, waste disposal, store maintenance, point of sale costs and marketing costs.
This cost category is largely variable in respect of existing stores and increases with new store openings.
The ratio of other direct expenses to revenue has improved marginally to 4.3% from 4.4% as a result of economies of scale and various business efficiency initiatives.
Operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation include items such as head office remuneration, costs relating to regional and area managers, design studio costs and insurance together with other central overheads and administration costs.
The Group has continued to invest in central infrastructure and people, in recent years, to support the ongoing planned growth: we expect this trend to continue.

Given the best-in-class margins generated by our unique vertically integrated model, compared to At the date of this announcement, cover is in place for our principal competitors we believe that the impact on 68% of the anticipated FY17 US Dollar cash requirement our overall margins will be relatively low.

As anticipation of the special dividend paid to shareholders Sterling currently remains significantly below levels in November, we amended and extended our existing achieved historically, we expect foreign exchange 200m debt facility.

The new facility also includes an additional 100m accordion.
As part of this refinancing process, the margin payable under the new facility has reduced by between 0.25% and 0.75%, depending on the leverage within the Group.

The Board anticipates that, in the coming year, total capital expenditure will amount to approximately 12m Net financing expense in line with previous guidance.

set out in note 3 of the financial statements on page 90.
Tax The tax charge for the year was 20.7% of profit before tax, compared with 22.3% in the prior year.
This reflects the reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax from 21.3% to 20.2% and the treatment of certain non-recurring IPO costs in FY15.
For the year ended 31 January 2016, the Board is recommending an increase in the final ordinary dividend of 33.3% to 6.0p per share FY15: 4.5p, giving a total ordinary dividend for the year of 8.5p per share, an increase of 25.0% FY15: 6.8p and dividend cover of 2.25 times underlying earnings per share.
The final dividend will, subject to shareholders approval at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 24 May 2016, be paid on 10 June to shareholders on the register on 6 May.
As previously announced, over the medium term the Board expects to maintain leverage broadly in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 times net debt to underlying historic LTM EBITDA.
Whilst this leverage ratio will typically vary during the financial year, the Boards current intention is to maintain average leverage around the mid point of this range.
To the extent there is surplus cash within the business, the Board expects to return this to shareholders.
The Board will consider the most appropriate method of returning such surplus cash from time to time, taking into account, amongst other things, views of shareholders and the liquidity of the shares.
In line with this strategy, a special dividend of 15.0 pence per share, equating to a return of 51.1m, was paid to shareholders in November.
We believe that there is significant potential for further returns of surplus cash to shareholders in line with our stated policy.
