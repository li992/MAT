of disposals, delivering strong returns We have witnessed a similarly strong performance across our ahead of previous book values.
disposals, which continue to offer an appealing yield profile to the high net worth and smaller institutional market.
We have reduced our asset pool by focusing our non-core disposal programme on the sale of smaller lot size properties.
This has resulted in a net reduction of c. 25% from 302 properties at the end of 2015 to 223 at the end of 2016, with a further three properties exchanged but not completed at year-end.
By capitalising on the strong market demand for our smaller lot sizes, our net investment activity continues to transform the portfolio as we position ourselves to acquire larger assets in strong locations with asset management upside.
Our c. 100 assets with individual asset values in excess of 5 million are the main engine of the portfolio contributing c. 90% of portfolio value and annualised topped-up NOI, and it is where 99% of capital expenditure was invested.
These assets are driving topped-up NOI growth, with value enhancing asset management initiatives across our major assets providing the largest improvement to NOI going forward.
42 Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financials Additional information We have successfully executed on our Asset Via Loan AVL strategy and took direct title of Pioneer Point 294 PRS units in February 2016.
This, combined with the disposal of the underlying collateral of the Avon loan portfolio in January 2016, has resulted in loans now comprising 2.3% of the portfolio, primarily comprising the Park Inn portfolio and the Herberton PRS scheme in Dublin from the Elliot portfolio.
Investments We announced last year that we expected to be neutral between our capital investments and disposal activity.
We strategically acquired significantly less in 2016 compared to the two preceding years where acquisitions were 1,402.5 million and 1,135.5 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively.
Our 2016 purchases amounted to 184.4 million across seven assets, and we invested 106.7 million in capital expenditure across our development and refurbishment programme, as well as a further 100 million on a share buyback programme.

This has concluded our previously announced 200 million non-core disposal programme six months ahead of our June 2017 target.
These sales across 1.6 million sq ft crystallised a yield spread of 180bps between yield on cost and exit yield on sale, at a premium to prior book value of 4.8%, delivering a return on cost of 31.8% over a 21 month hold period.
These disposals delivered a material 104 million of total profit income and capital gain, with just under one-quarter coming from our smaller assets of 5 million and under.
The majority of disposals originated from the UK with some selective sales in Ireland and Spain.
Notable Euro disposals in the year included The Times Building, Dublin 2 and three high street retail units on Henry Street, College Green and Fleet Street, in Dublin, the sale of our residential units at Santisima Trinidad 5 ST5, Madrid along with the Dr Fleming Dia grocery store in Madrid and our Pontevedra Carrefour assets, where we took advantage of strong market conditions to crystallise significant profits.

Third party valuations RICS Red Book have been undertaken by CBRE on direct property assets other than the Italian office portfolio which has been valued by Colliers : loan portfolios have been valued by Duff & Phelps in each case at 31 December 2016.
Portfolio Management Very strong commercial leasing activity continued in the second half of the year, contributing the majority of income growth, with a further 65 lease transactions completed, adding 3.2 million of incremental annualised income.
This brings total commercial lease transactions completed for 2016 to 140 deals across 1.1 million sq ft, contracting on 18.3 million of rent and delivering incremental annualised income of 4.0 million.
Not only are we doing more deals but we are also completing deals on better terms: 11.4% ahead of previous passing rent and 3.1% ahead of valuers ERVs.
Our like-for-like ERVs across the portfolio have increased by 3.7% in the year, primarily driven by Irish and Italian offices and Irish PRS.
Like-for-like annualised NOI was up 3.4% in the year, primarily driven by Baggot Plaza and Block K coming on stream in Dublin.
This was partially offset by UK office and industrial where lease wins in the year were offset by lease rollovers and where tenants exercised break options and we undertook refurbishment work ahead of re-letting.
Strong levels of occupational demand were evident across our portfolio, and in particular for the UK with 941,000 sq ft of leasing activity, securing an additional 3.3 million of incremental annualised income.
It is reassuring that these were delivered 12.3% ahead of the previous passing rent, demonstrating that this portfolio remains under-rented and at a 3.6% premium to valuers ERVs.
Aberdeen offices remain our most challenging market, due to weak occupational demand owing to the oil price slump.
We expect vacancy to rise in this sub-market as some leases have expiries over the next 18 months.
The oil price has begun to stabilise at $56 per barrel, up from $30 per barrel 12 months prior.
We have selectively deployed capital across targeted refurbishment projects at our two Aberdeen office assets, which we expect to translate into improved take-up when the market improves.

Overall, occupancy was down, driven by the continued transition of Pioneer Point from short term lets to Assured Shorthold Tenancies ASTs.
Our Irish PRS assets remain under-rented and we witnessed strong ERV growth per unit of 19.2% over the year, driven by Vantage, as we continued to let existing units at attractive levels and Block K where our leasing efforts have exceeded all targets.
We achieved practical completion of the 166-unit Block K development in the second half of the year and began our formal leasing in October 2016.
At year end, we had already let 120 of 166 units 72%, which is well ahead of business plan.
