STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 INMARSAT PLC 49 GROUP BALANCE SHEET The table below shows the condensed consolidated Group Balance Sheet: At 31 December At 31 December $ in millions 2016 2015 Non-current assets 3,832.1 3,712.3 Current assets 1,011.2 533.8 Total assets 4,843.3 4,246.1 Current liabilities 748.9 719.6 Non-current liabilities 2,854.1 2,276.6 Total liabilities 3,603.0 2,996.2 Net assets 1,240.3 1,249.9 The increase in the Groups non-current assets of $119.8m is largely due to our ongoing investment in new technology and infrastructure, including Global Xpress, the S-band programme and the I-6 constellation, less depreciation of existing assets in service.
Over $300m was invested in these three programmes during the year.
The net increase in current assets of $477.4m is primarily due to an increase of $479.7m in cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits following the refinancing in September 2016, which will be used to address the upcoming maturity of other existing facilities and to provide investment capital for the business.
This was partially offset by a $17.8m decrease in trade and other receivables to $306.9m 2015: $324.7m due to timing of receipt of payments from Ligado.
The increase in current liabilities of $29.3m to $748.9m 2015: $719.6m is largely due to the following three items.
The current tax liability increased by $5.8m, representing a current tax charge in excess of payments made in the year.
Trade and other payables increased by $43.4m to $508.3m 2015: $464.9m mainly due to the timing of settlement of trade payables at the end of the year.
Offsetting these increases was a $25.6m reduction in current borrowings due to the repayment of the EIB facility in October 2016 which reduced current borrowings by $44.1m and an increase in the current portion of the Ex-Im Facilities by $18.9m as the 2014 Facility has now become repayable in semi-annual instalments.
The increase in non-current liabilities of $577.5m is due to the refinancing that occurred during the year.
The issuance of the new Convertible Bond and Senior Notes and redemption of the old Convertible Bond due 2017 caused a net increase in non-current borrowings of $414.3m to $2,448.0m 2015: $2,033.7m.
As discussed above, the new Convertible Bond due 2023 is a net share-settled instrument and upon issuance is bifurcated between the cash debt component which is recognised in borrowings and a derivative liability component.
The derivative liability represents the value of the conversion rights associated with the instrument and is accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
The closing fair value of the instrument at 31 December 2016 was $153.5m 2015: $nil.
