Rental income Gross rental income has increased by11% to 51.9m FY15: 46.7m, driven by 3.6% average rental growth on our PRS portfolio and the acquisition of tenanted rental homes that deliver immediate income.
Net rental income has increased by 15% 5.0m to 37.4m FY15: 32.4m further benefiting from improvements made in operational efficiencies.

Over the year, sales on vacancy achievedaverage prices 8.6% over theSeptember 2015 vacant possession value, illustrating theresilience of our valuations and liquidity of our assets.
Residential sales on vacancy generated revenue of 110.0m which was 11% ahead of 2015 FY15: 99.5m with profit marginally lower at 52.2m FY15: 53.2m.
The predominant driver of the revenue growth related to the Chelsea Houses portfolio, although this reduced the overall margin to 47.4% FY15: 53.5%.
We expect margins from this portfolio to improve over time from reversionary gains, refurbishment and further asset management activities.
36 Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 m Strategic report Development sales activity delivered 11.8m of profit primarily driven by the final phase of Macaulay Walk, a residential developmentforsale scheme in Clapham, London 5.8m and the disposal of non-core development land at KennelFarm, Basingstoke 5.8m.
In addition, we recorded revenue of 24.1m on our PRS development for The Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea RBKC.
Due to the early stage of the development no profit has yetbeen recognised.
Operating expenses The overhead cost for this year was 31.8m for continuing operations FY15: 32.4m.
We are on track to achieve our FY17 overhead cost target of 27.5m, which is 24% 8.6m lower than the reported FY15 overhead of 36.1m before restatement for discontinued operations.
This has been achieved through restructuring savings, corporate overhead reductions and lower costs following the disposal of non-core businesses.
Other expenses relate to pre-contract transaction costs.
Through improved acquisition targeting and effective cost management, our other expenses have reduced to 1.1m FY15: 3.2m.
Fee income is associated with the recovery of overheads.
Overall operating expenses net of fee income which is associated with the overhead cost totalled 27.0m as set outin the table below FY15: 30.6m.

The reduction in net debt was drivenbythe non-core disposals andsupplemented by resilient cash generation from sales of vacant regulated tenancies: this more than offset 162m of new investment predominantly in PRS assets.
Cost of debt benefited from the non-core disposals and refinancing activities.
Our strengthened balance sheet provides capacity for our planned PRS investment.
As funds are deployed our optimal target range for LTV is 40-45%.

Average cost of debt over the year was 4.4%, a 90bps improvement, while cost of debt at the period end was 3.9%.
Subsequent to the year end, we have refinanced a 100m loan which is expected to reduce the average cost of debt by a further c. 20bps in 2017 3.7% proforma.
With our incremental cost of debt less than 2%, we have the potential to prudently utilise leverage to deliver strong earnings accretion as we invest.

We are committed to maintaining this status.
Discontinued operations The disposal of our non-core Equity Release and German businesses were accretive to EPRA NNNAV, adding 23m, 6p per share.
These delivered a discontinued profit before tax of 62.0m: 48.3m from the Equity Release disposal, 8.3m from the sale of the German operations and 5.4m from pre-disposal trading.
Dividend The Board revised and implemented anew dividend policy in the year, whichissupported by strong underlying cash generation to enhance distribution returns to shareholders during Graingers strategic transition, with payment aligned to the groups strategy of growing rentalincome.
The policy is to distribute the equivalent to 50% of annual net rental income.
Around one-third of the payment will bemade through the interim dividend based on half year results, with the balance paid through the final dividend.
As the shape of the business evolves to amore balanced total return model, we are committed to delivering progressive and sustainable dividend returns.
The dividend payment for the year will be 18.7m, 50% of the 37.4m net rental income reported.

These future liabilities are presented in current terms not discounted and neither EPRA NNNAV or EPRA NAV include the future benefit of the reversionary surplus, which as at 30 September 2016 was valued at 327m, or 78p per share.
EPRA NNNAV increased by 9% 24p per share to 287p FY15: 263p, supported by a strong trading performance, valuation growth, accretive strategic disposals and reduced deferred and contingent tax liabilities associated with lower corporation tax rates.
This growth was achieved despite the negative impact from movements in bond markets which resulted in an adverse movement of 16m 4p per share from the mark to market of fixed rate debt.
EPRA NAV increased by 7% to 341p, reflecting a strong trading and valuation performance, before the adjustment for discontinued operations and the recoupon of legacy swaps.
3% growth 11p per share to 330p FY15: 319p is reported after these adjustments.
The Equity Release disposal was accretive to EPRA NNNAV but dilutive to EPRA NAV by 15m 4p per share.

Grainger plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 41 Strategic report Financial review continued Strategy financial targets to 2020 The three strands of the 2020 strategy are to: 1 grow rents and increase distributions to shareholders : 2 simplify and focus: and 3 build on our heritage as the UKs leading listed residential landlord.
The four financial benchmarks used tomonitor progress against our strategyare: 1 Invest over 850m into PRS assets by2020 389m secured, 347m in planning or legal process.
2 More than half of our portfolio comprising PRS assets 27% of PRS assets FY15: 23%.
We expect to see an acceleration towards 2020 as assets being constructed are completed andlet.
3 Net rental income to exceed profit from sales FY16 net rental income was the equivalent to 52% of profit from sales FY15: 44%.
Sales profit will benefit from development activity over the next two to three years as we work through current schemes and projects.
Netrental income growth should accelerate towards the end of the strategy period as assets being constructed are completed and letout.
4 Reducing reliance on sales cost coverage FY16 income covered 74% of costs FY15: 53%.
This benchmark was designed toreflect the transition to an increasingly income focused model with reduced reliance on capital growth and profit from sales.
Substantial progress has been made in FY16.
Reduced finance costs and lower overheads have been the key drivers.
Rental growth and tightly controlled overheads and finance costs are expected to deliver further benefits.
Conclusion This years results demonstrate that theCompany is performing strongly in conjunction with delivering against its strategic objectives as setoutin January.
It has been a year of significant changeand progress, with 389m of investment secured, the disposal of two major non-core businesses, an improved capital structure, materially reduced finance costs and restructured operations which will deliver further efficiencies in FY17.
Alongside these changes, the Company has delivered a 69% increase in adjusted earnings to 53.1m and a total return return on shareholder equity of 10.6%.
The actions we are taking to make Grainger a more balanced total return business with an increased focus on income returns will support further strategic progress in the coming years.
Our 2016 Strategic report, from pages 1 to 42, has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on 1 December 2016.
