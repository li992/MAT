FINANCIAL REVIEW MARKET SUMMARY Precious metals 2016 was a volatile year for the precious metals market, yet gold and silver prices recovered some of their 2015 losses.
Importantly, for the first time in years, global gold and silver output decreased year-on-year: believed by many to mark the start of a multi-year downtrend, driven by depletion of quality reserves worldwide and decreased investment in new capacity.
Following three consecutive years of annual price declines, gold became one of the best performing assets in 2016, rising 8% and amassing significant inflows through physical-backed gold ETFs, driven by unpredictable macroeconomic events, most notably Brexit and the outcome of the US elections.
Gold demand grew 2% year-on-year to reach a multi-year high of 4,308 tonnes, largely driven by ETFs.
However, physical demand for gold reached a seven-year low, due to a significant decrease in jewellery demand, notably in India curbed by the demonetisation of large banknotes and high gold prices, and a sharp decline in official sector purchases on the back of US Federal Reserve pressures.
As a result, gold ended the year at US$ 1,159 oz versus US$ 1,062 oz in 2015, recording a year-high of US$ 1,366 oz in the third quarter.
The average price increased by 8% year-on-year from US$ 1,160 oz to US$ 1,250 oz.
During 2016, silver price dynamics largely followed gold, apart from the second half of the year where gold fell more sharply.
Silver finished the year strongly, averaging US$ 17.1 oz up 9% year-on-year and recording a year-high of US$ 20.7 oz in August, post Brexit.
However, with the US rate hike in December, silver closed at US$ 16.2 oz.
The average gold silver price ratio in 2016 was 73:1 versus 74:1 in 2015.
Foreign exchange The Groups revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, while the majority of the Groups costs are denominated in Russian Roubles.
As a result, changes in exchange rates affect its financial results and performance.
2016 was a better year for Russian economy with a modest recovery of oil price and strengthening of the Russian Rouble in the second half of 2016.
However, this trend could have a negative impact on the sector, through cost increases in US Dollar terms.
Following the oil price dynamics, from 1 January to 31 December 2016 the Russian Rouble appreciated against the US Dollar by 17% from 72.9 RUB USD to 60.7 RUB USD, while the average rate weakened by 10% year-on-year from 60.9 RUB USD in 2015 to 67.1 RUB USD in 2016.
However, following oil prices exceeding US$ 50 per barrel the Rouble started strengthening in the second half of 2016: average rate for 2H 2016 was 63.9 RUB USD, up 1% year-on-year, and 9% half-on-half.
The lower average Russian Rouble exchange rate in 2016 compared to 2015 had a positive effect on the dollar value of the Groups Rouble-denominated operating costs and Adjusted EBITDA.
At the same time, the moderate strengthening of the spot Russian Rouble exchange rate during 2H 2016 had a positive impact on the Groups net earnings due to the retranslation of US Dollar debt.
The economics of Kazakh operations were supported by the devaluation of the Kazakh Tenge.
While the tenge exchange rate remained almost unchanged during 2016 compared to 1 January 2016, the average rate was 54% weaker year-on-year, from 222 KZT USD in 2015 to 342 KZT USD in 2016, following a major devaluation in August 2015.
The Armenian Dram was the most stable currency in the region, with an average exchange rate of 480 AMD USD in 2016.

Gold sales volumes increased by 2%, while silver sales volumes decreased by 2% year-on-year, both broadly following the production dynamics.
The average realised price of gold was US$ 1,216 oz in 2016, up 8% from US$ 1,127 oz in 2015, and slightly below the average market price of US$ 1,250 oz.
The average realised silver price was US$ 16.3 oz, up 11% year-on-year, and 5% below the average market price of US$ 17.1 oz due to larger share of sales recorded in the first half of the year when market prices were lower.
The share of gold sales as a percentage of total revenue was 68% and remained flat compared to 2015.

Dukat experienced gold equivalent production decline of 6%, while a physical sales volumes increased by 2% year-on-year as a result of the concentrate fide-stockpiling.
At Varvara, sales partially lagged production mainly due to increased inventories of concentrate as of year-end.

Compared to 2015, the cost of services and the cost of consumables and spare parts increased by 8% and 6%, respectively, driven mainly by Russian domestic inflation.
Polymetal International plc 15 The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2016 was US$ 147 million, a 15% increase, mainly stemming from the annual salary increase tracking Russian CPI inflation and additional labour costs at the new Kapan, Komar and Svetloye operations.
Mining tax decreased by 15% year-on-year to US$ 82 million while production volumes remained flat, mainly driven by Omolon and Dukat obtaining tax relief as members of the regional free economic zone starting from 1 January 2016 paying 60% of standard mining tax rates.
Depreciation and depletion was US$ 162 million, up 5% year-on-year.
In 2016 a net metal inventory increase of US$ 51 million was recorded excluding write-downs to net realisable value, mainly represented by Varvara ore stockpiled at Komar and concentrate produced but not yet sold, and ore stockpiles at Omolon heap leach ore at Birkachan.
In the second half of the year, the Company successfully progressed with scheduled stockpile reductions, with total gold equivalent sales exceeding production by 32 Koz.
fide-stockpiling was mainly driven by concentrate shipments from Mayskoye.

Exploration expenses written off during the period decreased by 58% to US$ 10 million.
Cash-based exploration expenses in 2016 were US$ 11 million 2015: US$ 13 million.
Mining taxes, VAT, penalties and accrued interest have been accrued in respect of various disputes with the Russian and Armenian tax authorities.
In 2016, following favourable court decisions, the Group reimbursed previously paid mining tax at Magadan Silver in the amount of US$ 14 million and released several smaller provisions relating to mining tax in other Russian entities of the Group.
The provisions for investment in Special economic zones is attributable to Omolon and Dukat operations which are entitled to the decreased statutory income tax rate of 18% and decreased mining taxes paying 60% of standard rate.
In return, they are obliged to invest 50% of their tax savings towards the Special economic zone Development Programme.

The planned grade decline at some mature operations combined with domestic inflation in Russia had a moderate negative impact on cost levels.
This was largely offset by a robust operating performance at Voro, Varvara and Omolon supported by Russian Rouble and Tenge depreciation year-on-year.
The table below summarises major factors that have affected the Groups TCC dynamics year-on-year: Reconciliation of TCC and AISC movements TCC, US$ oz Change, % AISC, US$ oz Change, % Cost per gold equivalent ounce 2015 538 733 Change in average grade processed by mine 39 7% 39 5% Domiestic inflation 25 5% 35 5% Mining tax change - Au&Ag price 8 1% 8 1% USD rate change 35 -7% 49 -7% Change in sales structure 6 -1% 6 -1% Other 1 0% 16 2% Cost per gold equivalent ounce 2016 570 6% 776 6% Total cash cost by mine: Dukats total cash cost per silver equivalent ounce remained flat year-on-year at US$ 6.4 oz.
This stable performance was achieved on the back of continuing improvement in throughput at the Omsukchan concentrator, mitigating the effect of normalisation of the grade profile at the Dukat underground mine.
Voro continues to be our lowest cost operation at US$ 322 GE, with cash costs decreasing by a further 4% compared to 2015.
Processing at the CIP plant delivered record throughput, offsetting the impact of the planned decline in gold production at the heap leach facility, which has higher cash cost levels.
At Okhotsk, TCC was US$ 612 GE oz, a 7% increase year-on-year reflecting the scheduled decline in average gold and silver grade processed.
This performance includes Svetloye which in 2017, will contribute to lower cash cost for the hub as the operation ramps up to full capacity.
At Varvara, TCC was US$ 780 GE oz, declining by 5% year-on-year.
The decrease mainly stemmed from improved grades and recovery levels at the leaching circuit on the back of processing ore railed from Komarovskoye, supported by Tenge devaluation against the US Dollar.
1 Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory to net realisable value and certain other adjustments and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets.
Gold equivalent sales volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the relevant period.
Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as Total cash costs divided by total gold equivalent unit ounces sold.
2 Dukats total cash cost per gold equivalent was US$ 494 GE oz 2015: US$ 496 GE oz and was included in the Group TCC calculation.
Polymetal International plc 17 At Omolon, TCC amounted to US$ 503 GE oz, a 10% decrease year-on-year, driven by the devaluation of the Russian Rouble and lower mining tax rates.
At Albazino Amursk, TCC was US$ 529 GE oz, up 15% compared to 2015.
The cost increase was driven by ore from the new underground mine at the Olga zone having higher initial costs and lower grade profile.
Total cash costs at Mayskoye were US$ 1,011 GE oz, a 34% increase year-on-year, driven by a decline of the average grade processed and the introduction of a new mining method sublevel open stoping with backfill.
The costs are expected to normalise over the course of 2017 as the underground operation ramps up, and the production profile is supported by the crown pillar open pit project.
Kapans total cash costs were US$ 900 GE.
The historically low underground mining productivity and consequent low utilisation of the processing plant as the key drivers of high cost levels, represent significant potential for operational and financial turnaround already visible in half-on-half year dynamics, which was the strategic rationale behind the acquisition.

Total cash cost by mine: At Dukat, Voro, Albazino and Mayskoye, the appreciation of the Russian Rouble during 2H 2016 outweighed the negligible effect of other operating factors that resulted in increased total cash costs half-on-half.
At Okhotsk, TCC was US$ 606 GE oz and decreased by 3% half-on-half, following the seasonal switch to processing of the higher grade ore shipped from Avlayakan in the second half of the year.
Varvara experienced positive input of processing high-grade ore railed from Komarovskoye, resulting in TCC of US$ 726 GE oz, 20% decrease half-on-half.
At Omolon, cash costs decreased by 27% compared to 1H 2016 to US$ 444 GE oz switch to processing highgrade ore from Tsokol underground.
The improvement measures and modifications to operating practices at Kapan resulted in TCC decreasing by 27% to US$ 865 GE oz half-on-half.

The increase was mainly driven by an 8% growth in the average realised gold price and an 11% growth in the average realised silver price, which was partially offset by a 6% increase in TCC.
Adjusted EBITDA increased, or remained almost unchanged across all operating mines, except for Mayskoye where implementation of the new mining method had a temporary negative effect on cost profile.
OTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS In 2016, Polymetal recorded a net foreign exchange gain of US$ 65 million compared to a loss of US$ 133 million in 2015.
These unrealised non-cash forex gains and losses in both periods represent the revaluation of the US Dollar denominated borrowings of Russian operating companies, the functional currency of which is the Russian Rouble.
The Groups average gross debt during 2016 was US$ 1,364 million, mostly denominated in US Dollars, while the RUB USD exchange rate decreased from 72.9 RUB USD as at 31 December 2015 to 60.7 RUB USD as at 31 December 2016.
1 Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure of the Company's operating performance and cash generation capacity excluding impact of financing, depreciation and tax and a key industry benchmark allowing to perform peer comparison.
Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the impact of certain accounting adjustments mainly non-cash items that can mask underlying changes in core operating performance.
2 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA a non-IFRS measure as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, write-downs and reversals of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, bad debt allowance, gains and losses on acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, income tax expense and other tax exposures accrued within other operating expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.
The figures presented above have been rounded and accordingly may not sum to the total shown.
Polymetal International plc 20 The Company does not use any hedging instruments for managing foreign exchange risk, other than a natural hedge arising from the fact that the majority of the Groups revenue is denominated, or calculated, in US Dollars.
Though income statement volatility may arise in the financial reporting, Polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy.
Income tax expense for 2016 was US$ 169 million compared to US$ 55 million in 2015.
The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in net income, combined with the effect of non-deductible exchange gains and losses incurred in 2015 due to the differences in local and functional currencies.
No such exchange gains and losses were incurred in 2016 due to reduced exchange rate fluctuations.
For details refer to Note 13 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.
NET EARNINGS, EARNINGS PER SHARE AND DIVIDENDS The Group recorded a net income of US$ 395 million in 2016 versus US$ 221 million in 2015.
The underlying net earnings excluding after-tax impact of write-down of metal inventory to net realisable value, foreign exchange gains losses and change in fair value of contingent consideration liability were US$ 382 million, compared to US$ 291 million in 2015.
