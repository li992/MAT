Financial review FINANCIAL REVIEW Situl Jobanputra, Chief Financial Officer Capco maintains a robust and disciplined FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS EPRA NAV of 340 pence per share, a 5.9% decrease financial position with low leverage of 23 per Total return of -5.5% cent and available liquidity of 556 million.

Group share During 2016 political and economic uncertainties have had a negative impact on the property sector, in particular London residential property, which is reflected in the fall in valuations.
EPRA net asset value per share fell by 5.9 per cent during the year, decreasing from 361 pence at 31 December 2015 to 340 pence.
This 21pence decrease together with the 1.5 pence dividend paid during the year represents a total return of -5.5 per cent.
At Covent Garden rental growth achieved during the year was the main driver of the increase in value of the estate by 6.0 per cent 6.4 per cent like-for-like.
The market value of Earls Court Properties, which comprises the Groups interests at Earls Court, has decreased by 20.4 per cent, reflecting the valuers assessment of the weakened sentiment in the central London residential market.
Basis of preparation In line with the requirements of IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, the Group is required to present its joint ventures under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements.
Under the equity method, the Groups interest in joint ventures is disclosed as a single line item in both the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement rather than proportionally consolidating the Groups share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Internally, the Board focuses on and reviews information and reports prepared on a Group share basis, which includes the Groups share of joint ventures but excludes the non-controlling interest share of our subsidiaries.
Therefore, to align with the way the Group is managed, this financial review presents the financial position, performance and cash flow analysis on a Group share basis.
In previous years the Board focused on and reviewed information on a proportionally consolidated basis therefore the comparative summary income statement and summary cash flow statements have been re-presented.

The Group presents EPRA net asset value in addition to the net assets attributable to owners of the Parent.
The EPRA alternative performance measures are widely used by public real estate companies in Europe and therefore assist with comparability.

Non-controlling interest represents Tf Ls 37 per cent share of ECPL.
IFRS includes amounts receivable from joint ventures which eliminate on a Group share basis.
Adjusted, diluted number of shares in issue at 31 December 2016 was 847.6 million 31 December 2015: 847.7 million.
com 41 Financial review continued Investment, development and trading property The revaluation deficit on the Groups property portfolio was 170.4 million for the year, representing a 4.4 per cent decrease in value on a like-for-like basis compared with the IPD Capital Return for the equivalent period of a 2.8 per cent loss.
Revaluation gains at Covent Garden of 129.4 million were not sufficient to offset revaluation loss at Earls Court of 292.7 million.
On an IFRS basis, which includes ECPL at 100 per cent and Lillie Square at 50 per cent, revaluation loss and sale of investment property was 235.0 million.
Total property return for the year was a deficit of 2.3 per cent.
The IPD Total Return index recorded a 2.6 per cent gain for the corresponding period.
The 2016 valuations incorporate the increased SDLT levels that were enacted earlier this year which had an impact of 32.4 million 0.9 per cent of property value.
Trading property is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value, therefore valuation surpluses on trading property are not recorded.
Any unrecognised surplus is however reflected within the EPRA net asset value measure.
At 31 December 2016, the unrecognised surplus on trading property was 48.1 million 31 December 2015: 99.9 million.
This arises primarily on trading property at Lillie Square.
Debt and gearing During the year the Group increased its share of available facilities by 425 million, with five new agreements.
In January, the Group replaced the 665 million Covent Garden debt facility with a 705 million five year Covent Garden debt facility which increased available facilities by 40 million.
640 million of the facility matures in 2021 with the remaining 65 million maturing in 2020 with an option to extend to 2021.
There is a further option to extend the facility to 2022.
In March, a 150 million 95 million Group share 10 year secured credit agreement was signed by Earls Court Partnership Limited to fund  costs on land interests at Earls Court.
In June, the Group entered into an agreement to extend the existing construction facility which funds the Lillie Square development by 30 million 15 million Group share for a one year period.
In September, the Group signed an agreement with five institutional investors for a private placement of 175 million 10 and 12 year senior unsecured notes which enhance the unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden.
Closing occurred in November and proceeds were used to repay bank debt.
In December, a 100 million four year secured credit agreement was signed by Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited.
The Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2016 were 556.3 million 31 December 2015: 412.1 million.
A reconciliation between IFRS and Group share is shown below: 2016 2015 Joint Group Joint Group 1 2 1 2 IFRS ventures NCI share IFRS ventures NCI share m m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 30.9 37.4 3.5 64.8 66.9 34.4 10.3 91.0 Undrawn committed facilities 532.7 2.4 43.6 491.5 300.0 21.1 321.1 Cash and undrawn committed facilities 563.6 39.8 47.1 556.3 366.9 55.5 10.3 412.1 1.
Net debt increased by 268.4 million to 847.3 million, principally as a result of further investment in and the acquisition of property.
As set out in the summary adjusted balance sheet net debt on an IFRS basis was 815.4 million.
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan to value LTV.
LTV is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by the carrying value of the Groups property portfolio.
The Group focuses most on an LTV measure that includes the notional share of joint venture interests but excludes the share of the non-controlling interest.
The LTV of 23.4 per cent remains comfortably within the Groups limit of no more than 40 per cent.
2016 2015 Loan to value 23.4% 16.4% Interest cover 173% 124% Weighted average debt maturity 5.9 years 4.1 years Weighted average cost of debt 2.7% 3.3% Gross debt with interest rate protection 86% 91% The Groups policy is to substantially eliminate the medium and long-term risk arising from interest rate volatility.
The Groups banking facilities are arranged on a floating rate basis but are generally swapped to fixed rate or capped using derivative contracts.
At 31 December 2016 the proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection was 86 per cent 31 December 2015: 91 per cent.
42 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants and has substantial levels of headroom against its covenants across all its debt facilities.
Details of the covenants are included on page 143.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had capital commitments of 156.6 million compared to 206.5 million at 31 December 2015, of which Covent Garden represents 74.2 million, Earls Court Properties 64.2 million including the 45.0 million of CLSA instalments and Lillie Square 18.2 million.
The pipeline has been significantly fide-risked, for example at Floral Court where approximately 60 per cent of the commercial space has been pre-let to Petersham Nurseries, and through over 300 million 150 million Group share of pre-sales at Lillie Square.
On a pro forma basis, not taking into account any property valuation movements or any receipts, expenditure on capital commitments would increase the LTV from 23.4 per cent to 27.7 per cent.
Conditional Land Sale Agreement CLSA In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, which it entered into with the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham LBHF, for the purchase of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates the Estates.
The overall consideration payable is expected to be 105 million cash plus the planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA remains unrecognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as its main underlying asset the land relating to the Estates does not currently meet the recognition criteria under IFRS required for investment and development property.
Annual payments of 15 million commenced in December 2015 and will run through to December 2019.
Where amounts are paid prior to the transfer of property, they will be carried on the Groups balance sheet as prepayments against future land draw down.
Of the 60 million paid to date, 15 million relates to the acquisition of two properties and 45 million is held as a prepayment.
The remaining future payments totalling 45 million are disclosed as a capital commitment.
A transfer from prepayment to investment and development property will occur once the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the Group.
Once this occurs, in line with the Groups accounting policy, the land will become subject to bi-annual valuation with any changesreflected in the Groups reported net asset measure.
CASH FLOW A summary of the Groups cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2016 is presented below: Summary cash flow 1 2016 Re-presented 2015 Joint Group Joint Group 2 3 2 3 IFRS ventures NCI share IFRS ventures NCI share m m m m m m m m Operating cash flows after interest and tax 29.5 1.4 2.5 30.6 2.3 4.3 16.0 22.6 Purchase and development of property, plant and equipment 216.1 41.4 16.8 240.7 250.2 32.7 12.8 270.1 Transactions with joint venture partners and non-controlling interests 12.3 6.4 3.9 2.0 16.7 4.2 12.5 Net sales proceeds from property and investments 19.4 1.3 20.7 17.7 1.6 16.1 Deferred consideration on purchase of subsidiary 7.1 7.1 Net cash flow before financing 238.5 32.3 18.2 252.6 258.6 34.4 3.2 296.2 Issue of shares 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Financing 209.9 31.6 11.4 230.1 238.3 36.9 275.2 Dividends paid 7.5 7.5 7.7 7.7 4 Net cash flow 36.0 0.7 6.8 29.9 27.9 2.5 3.2 28.6 1.
The 31 December 2015 summary cash flow has been prepared on a Group share basis.
In the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015 the summary cash flow was presented on a proportionate consolidation basis.
Net cash flow is based on unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and therefore does not include the movement in Lillie Square deposits on a Group share basis of 3.7 million 2015: 14.9 million.
com 43 Financial review continued Operating cash outflows of 30.6 million, of which 15.0 million relates to the CLSA annual payment, have increased from 22.6 million for the year to 31 December 2015 as a result of changes to net working capital requirements.
During the year, 164.0 million was invested at Covent Garden for the purchase of two properties and subsequent expenditure for the development of property predominantly at Floral Court.
At Earls Court 75.0 million was spent on subsequent expenditure for the construction of Lillie Square Phase 1 and the demolition of the Earls Court Exhibition Centres.
Net sales proceeds from property and investments comprise the disposal of three residential units at The Beecham, Covent Garden and five residential units at Lillie Square, net of sales and marketing fees.
Marketing fees include costs for units that have not yet completed.
Net borrowings drawn during the year were 239.7 million.
Refinancing activities and purchase of derivatives resulted in a cash outflow of 9.6 million.
Dividends paid of 7.5 million reflect the final dividend payment made in respect of the 2015 financial year and the 2016 interim dividend paid in September.
This was lower than the previous year due to a higher take up of the scrip dividend alternative, 41 per cent versus 38per cent in 2015.

In the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015 the summary income statement was presented on a proportionate consolidation basis.
Lillie Square and Solum Developments.
Income Net rental income has increased by 6.6 million 7.8 per cent like-for-like during the year as a result of strong performances at Covent Garden and Olympia London.
Loss gain on revaluation and sale of investment and development property The loss on revaluation and saleof the Groups investment and development property was 124.8 million.
Covent Garden recorded a gain on revaluation of 126.1 million as a result of rental growth.
The loss on revaluation at Earls Court of 247.2 million reflects the valuers assessment of the weakened sentiment and correctionsin the central London residential market with the major contributors being market  result of the EU Referendum and the increase in SDLT.
Administration expenses Administration expenses have decreased by 2.0 million due to a reduction in performance related employment costs, which have been partly offset by an increase in establishment costs.
It is expected that there will be further reduction in administration expenses as efficiency initiatives are pursued.
Net finance costs Net finance costs have decreased by 3.0 per cent to 19.5 million, with a lower weighted average cost of debt offsetting an increased level of net debt.
Taxation The total tax creditis made up of both underlying tax and non-underlying tax and for the year is 10.9 million.
This credit predominantly arises from the loss on revaluation of the Groups investment and development property at Earls Court.
Tax on underlying profits of the Group was 2.4 million, which reflects a rate in line with the current rate of UK corporation tax being 20 per cent.
Following the enactment of Finance No.
2 Act 2015 and Finance Act 2016 the corporation tax rate will reduce to 19 per cent from April 2017 and 17 per cent from April 2020. www.

Please refer to the Glossary for further detail on the definition of each measure.
A reconciliation between IFRS and the above performance measures can be found in note 13 to the accounts.
Taxation continued Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on a theoretical disposal of all investment property held by the Group, was nil 31 December 2015: 17.6 million.
A disposal of the Groups trading property at market value would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 9.6 million 20 per cent of 48.1 million.
The provisions of IAS 12 provide for the recognition of a deferred tax asset where it is probable there will be future taxable profit against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
As a result of the application of this provision, the Group has not recognised the deferred tax asset on decreases to the carrying value of investment property and certain losses carried forward.
The Groups tax policy, which has been approved by the Board and has been disclosed to HM Revenue & Customs, is aligned with the business strategy.
The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by structuring operations in a tax efficient manner, with external advice as appropriate, which complies with all relevant tax law and regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as a responsible taxpayer.
As a Group, we are committed to acting in an open and transparent manner.
Consistent with the Groups policy of complying with relevant tax obligations and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the Group maintains a constructive and open working relationship with HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment may be uncertain.
Dividends The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be paid on 31 May 2017 to shareholders on the register at 21 April 2017.
Subject to SARB approval, a scrip dividend alternative will be offered.
Together with the interim dividend paid in September this brings the total dividend for the year to 1.5 pence per share.
Going concern At 31 December 2016 the Groups cash and undrawn committed facilities were 556.3 million and its capital commitments were 156.6 million.
With weighted average debt maturity of nearly six years, LTV of 23.4 per cent and sufficient headroom against all financial covenants, there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to meet both ongoing and future commitments over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors have prepared the 2016 Annual Report & Accounts on a going concern basis.
