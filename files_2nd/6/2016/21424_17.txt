The group achieved a combined ratio in line with its long term target of 90% but slightly higher than the 87% seen in 2015.
Profits on short tail classes were lower than in 2015 reflecting the reduced margins available following several years of price competition in these areas.
Overall, reserve releases were at similar levels to 2015 but with a greater contribution from specialty lines where the prior year releases increased by 77% on 2015.
The very strong investment return of 2.0% 2015: 1.3% compensated for the reduced underwriting contribution.
Premiums Gross premiums written have increased by 6% in 2016 to $2,195.6m.
Rates on renewal business on average decreased by 2% across the portfolio.
We have continued to adjust our underwriting appetite in areas where competition is most intense.
Our portfolio by business division has remained broadly unchanged from 2015.
We continue to operate a diversified portfolio by type of business and geographical location, and have grown our business across three of the six divisions during 2016.
The charts above highlight how we achieve diversification by product mix, geography and type of business.
Reinsurance purchased Reinsurance is purchased for a number of reasons: to mitigate the impact of catastrophes such as hurricanes: to enable the group to put down large, lead lines on the risks we underwrite: and to manage capital to lower levels.
The amount the group spent on reinsurance in 2016 was $341.6m 2015: $367.8m.
The reduced purchases in 2016 were driven by a reduction in our life, accident and health divisions reinsurance purchase as a result of the non renewal of one large inward risk and a reduction in our specialty lines division due to business mix and amendments to some of our larger quota shares.

A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit.
Consistent delivery of operating performance across the market cycle is clearly a key objective for an insurer.
Beazleys combined ratio has increased in 2016 to 89% 2015: 87%, but it still maintains our five year historic average below 90%.
Claims Claims have developed favourably during 2016, with overall claim notifications once again below normalised levels.
In particular, there has been only moderate exposure to natural catastrophes throughout the year.
Reserve releases Beazley has a consistent reserving philosophy, with initial reserves being set to include risk margins that may be released over time as and when any uncertainty reduces.
Historically these margins have given rise to held reserves within the range 5-10% above our actuarial estimates, which themselves include some margin for uncertainty.
The margin held above the actuarial estimate was 6.6% at the end of 2016 2015: 8.2%.
This margin has remained stable over time and is a lead indicator for the sustainability of reserve releases.
However, it is important to recognise that claims reserve uncertainty is significant for Beazley and a positive lead indicator will not always equate to future releases.
Reserve monitoring is performed at a quarterly peer review, which involves a challenge process contrasting the claims reserves of underwriters and claim managers, who make detailed claim-by-claim assessments, and the actuarial team, who provide statistical analysis.
This process allows early identification of areas where claims reserves may need adjustment.
Our specialty lines division increased their reserve releases as the post recession portfolio from 2012 onwards matures: a trend which we expect to see continuing.
This counter-balanced lower releases on short tail classes where the mechanical effect that reduced margins have on reserve releases is now visible.
Please refer to the financial statements for information on reserve releases and loss development tables.
com Strategic report Governance Financial statements Acquisition costs and administrative expenses Business acquisition costs and administrative expenses increased during 2016 to $720.3m from $663.8m in 2015.
The breakdown of these costs is shown below: 2016 2015 $m $m Brokerage costs 390.0 362.8 Other acquisition costs 82.5 85.8 Total acquisition costs 472.5 448.6 Administrative expenses 247.8 215.2 Total acquisition costs and administrative expenses 720.3 663.8 Brokerage costs are the premium commissions paid to insurance intermediaries for providing business.
As a percentage of net earned premium they have increased slightly to 22% in the current year 2015: 21%.
Brokerage costs are deferred and expensed over the life of the associated premiums in accordance with the groups accounting policy.
Other acquisition costs comprise costs that have been identified as being directly related to underwriting activity e. g. underwriters salaries and Lloyds box rental.
These costs are also deferred in line with premium earning patterns.
The group expense ratio has increased 2% over the last three years to 41%.
Average brokerage rates have increased 1% and the other half of the increase is in our own internal expenses.
On the internal aspects, we continue to invest in developing Beazley and to experience expense ratio pressure in areas of the portfolio where the top line is shrinking due to market conditions.
Our careful expense management, together with sterling weakness, have enabled us to to contain the increase in expense ratio driven by internal costs to only 1%.
Foreign exchange The majority of Beazleys business is transacted in US dollar, which is the currency we have reported in since 2010 and the currency in which we hold the companys net assets.
Changes in the US dollar exchange rate with sterling, the Canadian dollar and the euro do have an impact as we receive premiums in those currencies and the majority of our staff still receive their salary in sterling.
Beazleys FX loss taken through the statement of profit or loss in 2016 was $9.5m 2015: loss of $9.7m.
The main component of this loss, generated by IFRSs treatment of the unearned premium reserve as a non-monetary item, is purely timing with FX profits and losses which unwind in the subsequent period.
com Annual report 2016 Beazley 41 Financial review continued Comparison of returns major asset classes $m Group performance continued 50 40 61.3 30 20 31.8 30.2 27.4 10 0 Capital growth portfolio Core portfolio 2016 2015 Investment performance Financial markets experienced another volatile year in 2016.
Weak energy prices and concerns about fragile global growth led to significant declines in equity markets and wider credit spreads, particularly for high yield issuers, in January and February.
Subsequently, these asset classes recovered their earlier losses and continued to improve throughout the year as easy global monetary policy, recovering energy prices and, latterly, hopes of a Trumpian boost to economic growth, all helped investors regain confidence.
Global equities returned 9.0%, in local currency terms, in 2016.
High yield bonds also performed strongly as average credit spreads declined by more than 250 basis points over the year.
Returns on sovereign debt exposures have traced a very different path, with significant declines in yields in the first half amid pessimism about global growth, assisted by the result of the UKs EU referendum in June, leading to strong returns in the first part of the year.
Subsequently, yields began to rise as the US approached full employment and US interest rates were expected to increase.
This trend was quickly extended following the US election, as investors discounted higher growth and inflation in anticipation of President Trumps policies, causing the five-year US Treasury note yield to rise by more than 50 basis points in one week.
As a result, US sovereign yields ended the year higher than they began, generating low, but positive, returns at most maturities.
Our fixed income portfolios, which constitute the majority of our investments, returned 1.5% overall in 2016, with returns on sovereign debt exposures augmented by the higher yields from our corporate credit investments and, in particular, strong returns from our high yield fixed income exposures.
Our decision to reduce the duration of our fixed income investments immediately following the US election result has also helped performance.
Our capital growth portfolios incorporate around 12% of our investments and utilise more volatile asset classes, aiming to generate additional returns in the longer term.
In 2016 the capital growth portfolio returned 5.6%.
Our overall investment return for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 2.0%, or $93.1m 2015: $57.6m: 1.3%.
We believe this to be a good outcome in a volatile period for investments.
At 31 December 2016, the weighted average duration of our fixed income investments was unusually low, at 1.2 years 2015: 1.8 years.
Looking ahead to 2017, the investment outlook is once again uncertain.
Recent increases in bond yields provide some hope that available returns may improve, but further market volatility is likely and we are prepared to take action to reduce the volatility of our investment returns, if appropriate.

The chart above shows the increase in our group funds since 2012.
Tax Beazley is liable to corporation tax in a number of jurisdictions, notably the UK and Ireland.
Our effective tax rate is thus a composite tax rate driven by the Irish and UK tax rates.
Our effective tax rate for the year was 14.4% 2015: 12.3%.
The increase compared to 2015 was due to a number of favourable prior year tax adjustments in 2015 that did not recur in the current year.
In 2016, it was announced that the UK corporation tax rate will be reduced to 17% by 2020.
This reduction in the UK tax rate will reduce the groups future current tax charge.
The application of the diverted profits tax passed by the government early in 2015 remains uncertain.
We have considered the implication of this and retain the view that this tax should not apply to Beazley see note 9. www.
