Adjusted EBITDA increased by 58% to 77.1 million compared to the same period last year.
The increase was partly a result of the inclusion of twelve months of trading in the Comparison Services division and five months of trading from Property Software Group, which we acquired in April 2016.
The Comparison Services division performed ahead of expectations with record switching levels across every vertical and the Property Services division performed in line with expectations, with continued growth in the number of UK Agency partners over the Period.
Statutory profit for the year and statutory basic EPS also increased significantly by 44% to 36.7 million and 44% to 8.9 pence, respectively.
When reviewing performance the Directors use a number of adjusted measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted basic EPS, as they believe these give a more relevant indicator of the Groups underlying performance.
These measures are reconciled in the Summary Income Statement below.
During the Period, the Group secured a 50 million extension to its revolving credit facility, which was used to help fund the acquisition of Property Software Group.
As at 30 September 2016, the Group had net debt of 146.3 million and substantial headroom against its covenants.
The Group maintains a target dividend pay-out ratio of 35-45% of profits excluding share-based payments and exceptional items and the Directors have proposed a final dividend of 3.7 pence per share.
This, together with the interim dividend of 1.5 pence per share, brings the total dividend to 5.2 pence per share forthe Period.
