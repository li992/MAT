The reported profit before tax fell by 63.7% to 34.9 million 2015: 96.1 million, impacted by the move from a net credit of 16.0 million in 2015 to a charge of 41.9 million in 2016 for the one-off items detailed above.
Taxation The Groups headline tax charge was 21.4 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28% of headline profit before tax, unchanged from the prior year.
The reported tax charge is 13.0 million, which includes a tax credit of 8.4 million relating to the tax effect of the restructuring charge The effective tax rate on reported profit before tax was 37%.
Looking forward to 2017 we do not envisage any significant change in our headline effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate was higher than the cash tax rate of 26% of headline profit before tax.
We expect the cash tax rate and the effective tax rate to converge as prior year tax losses are utilised.
The Groups tax strategy continues to seek to ensure that key tax risks are appropriately mitigated, that appropriate taxes are paid in each jurisdiction where the Group operates, and that the Groups reputation as a responsible taxpayer is safeguarded.
We are committed to having a positive relationship with tax authorities and to dealing with our tax affairs in a straightforward, open and honest manner.

The main capital expenditure project in 2016 was the development of the Global Planning Tool.
We also incurred costs on the development of the new website during the first half.
This project was halted during the first half of 2016 and resource was reallocated to concentrate on developing our existing website.

There was a cash outflow related to the restructuring activities of 16.0 million during the year, which largely relates to labour restructuring charges.
We expect that the restructuring cash outflow in 2017 will be largely offset by the anticipated cash proceeds from the disposal of our Singapore warehouse, which is currently held for sale on the balance sheet.

All these schemes are closed to new entrants and in Germany and Ireland the pension schemes are closed to accrual for future service.
Under IAS 19R, the combined gross deficit of the Groups retirement obligations was 43.3m, of which the defined benefit schemes accounted for 38.5 million at 31 March 2016 UK deficit: 30.4 million: overseas schemes deficit: 8.1 million.
The UK deficit under IAS 19R has decreased from 47.2 million at 31 March 2015.
This is principally due to the discount rate increasing by 0.3% p. a. although this has been partially offset by the investment return on the schemes assets being lower than assumed.
Dividend The Group has a strong balance sheet and the Board recognises The Group is also exposed to foreign currency transactional risk because most operating companies have some level of payables the importance of dividends to shareholders and therefore in currencies other than their functional currency.
Some operating proposes to maintain the final dividend of 6.75p per share.
companies also have receivables in currencies other than their This will be paid on 26 July 2016 to shareholders on the register functional currency.
Group Treasury maintains three to six month on 17 June 2016.
As a result, the total proposed dividend for the hedging against freely tradable currencies to smooth the impact financial year will remain at 11.75p per share, resulting in headline of fluctuations in currency.
The Groups largest exposures relate to earnings dividend cover of 1.1x.
We remain committed to improving dividend cover over time by driving improved results and stronger cash flow.
Foreign exchange risk The Group does not hedge translation exposure on the income statements of overseas subsidiaries.
Based on the 2016 mix of non-pound sterling denominated revenue and adjusted operating profit, a one cent movement in euro would impact profits by 0.6 million and a one cent movement in US dollars would impact profits by 0.2 million.
