In porcine, Asia revenue growth of 22%, primarily in Russia and China, was offset by the planned continued reduction in up-front sales in Europe.
Lower porcine by-product sales were the result of lower pig prices and there was a 4% decline in global bovine revenue, due to the poor dairy market conditions.

Profits in Genus Asia, excluding JVs, almost doubled with 98% growth, helped by Asia Porcine growing by more than 200%.
PICChina performed very strongly, buoyed by exceptional market conditions and reduced production costs resulting from the shift from owned farms to more contracted production.
The Russia, Vietnam and franchise porcine businesses also achieved strong double-digit growth, with Russia helped by the country reopening its borders to pig imports.
Asia Bovine grew 8%, helped by improvements in our Australia and Russia businesses following restructuring in the prior year.
Genus PIC had a strong year, with profits up 9%.
Volume growth of 2% continues to be affected by the shift to royalty contracts, with volumes recognised later in the sales cycle.

The cost of higher average borrowings in the year, following recent acquisitions and the investment in GSS technology, was offset by interest savings fromthe lower financing rates achieved in the new facility agreement and the maturing of fixed interest rate swaps.
Exceptional Items There was a 36.3m net exceptional credit in 2016 2015: 5.1m expense, including an exceptional credit of 43.9m, from changing theindex used for pension and deferred pension increases in the Milk Pension Fund from RPI to CPI, and a 0.3m settlement gain related to the Milk Pension Fund.
Exceptional costs were 6.9m for ongoing legal fees and damages in Genus ABSs case against ST, 0.2m for acquisition and integration related expenses, primarily St Jacobs and IVB, and other items of 0.8m including restructuring costs.
Statutory Profit Before Tax The table below sets out a reconciliation between adjusted profit before tax and statutory profit before tax: 2016 2015 m m Adjusted profit before tax 49.7 46.6 Operating profit attributable to non-controlling interest 1.4 0.6 Net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets in joint ventures and associates 1.9 1.0 Tax on joint ventures and associates 1.4 0.7 Adjusting items: Net IAS 41 valuation movement on biological assets 17.1 24.9 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 6.1 6.1 Share-based payment expense 3.8 1.4 Exceptional items 36.3 5.1 Statutory profit before tax 60.9 57.8 Our statutory profit before tax was 60.9m 2015: 57.8m.

These items, which tend to be volatile and mostly non-cash, are less representative of the Groups underlying performance andhave been excluded from adjusted results.
Taxation The effective rate of tax for the year, based on adjusted profit before tax, was 25.8% 2015: 26.0%.
The effective rate remains higher than the UK corporate tax rate.
This is due to the mix of overseas profits, particularly the proportion of profits generated in the US and Latin America, where the statutory tax rates are typically between 30 and 39%, and the impact of withholding taxes on the repatriation of funds to the UK.
The tax rate on statutory profits was 19.7% 2015: 31.1%.
In addition to the factors mentioned above, there was a favourable impact on the statutory tax rate in the year, due to the reversal of deferred tax at US rates on the reduction in the IAS 41 biological assets valuation, while the exceptional pension credit carried deferred tax at 18%.
