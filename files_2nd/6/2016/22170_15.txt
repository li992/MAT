This wide range of expertise enables the Group to provide bespoke, integrated solutions for buildings and infrastructure, from project finance through design and construction to life-time asset management, together with business support services that add value for our customers and the communities in which we operate.
The Group has operations in the UK, Canada and the Middle East and North Africa as set out on page 4.
Taking into account market conditions in our key geographies, overall, the Group performed well in 2016, led by an improved performance in support services, which accounted for over two thirds of the Groups total underlying operating profit.
Revenue Total revenue increased by 14 per cent to 5,214.2 million 2015: 4,586.9million, which was primarily organic growth, with increased contributions from each of our four business segments.
The contribution to total revenue from Joint Ventures increased by 29 per cent to 819.3million 2015: 636.2 million, reflecting growth in Public Private Partnership projects and support services contracts in the defence sector.
Underlying operating profit Underlying operating profit increased by four per cent to 253.9 million 2015: 244.4 million and included operating profit from Joint Ventures of 54.3 million 2015: 36.0 million.
The Groups total underlying operating margin reduced to 4.9 per cent 2015: 5.3 per cent, primarily because the increase in our support services margin was more than offset by the expected reductions in margin for Public Private Partnership projects and Middle East construction services.

The risk of political instability in Canada is judged to be minimal, as Canada has a stable parliamentary democracy.
In the Middle East, we have deliberately based our activities in countries with a history of social stability and we have been unaffected by the unrest seen on occasions during the last few years in the Middle East.
While the potential for political unrest andconflict in the Middle East and North Africa to recur or to spread to countries so far unaffected remains a possibility, we believe our policy of focusing on countries with a history of stability, together with our rigorous corporate governance and financial management policies and processes, provides adequate mitigation against these risks.
Furthermore, our strategy in the Middle East and North Africa of focusing on a small number of financially robust customers has enabled our businesses in the region tomaintain satisfactory operating cash flows and remain financially independent.
