The increase in net debt was principally driven by 40 million short-term timing differences arising from unsettled matched principal trades which reversed subsequently within a few days.
The remainder was a result of a combination of factors including 17 million of further investments in new businesses in the PTRI division and a 29 million payment in relation to one-off Transaction-related costs and payout in relation to last years global broking restructuring programme.
Regulatory capital Strategic report approval ICAP operates its business under an investment firm waiver, The strategic report was approved by the board and signed which currently runs until December 2017.
The waiver modifies on its behalf by: the basis on which regulatory capital is assessed and, at 31 March 2016, ICAP had 0.8 billion 2014 15: 0.7 billion Stuart Bridges of headroom on this basis.
The effect of the waiver is to exclude Group Finance Director goodwill and other intangibles from the assessment and, in doing 16 May 2016 so, allows the Group to undertake acquisitions using debt rather than equity finance.
In the event that the waiver was not renewed, applying a consolidated approach would increase the regulatory capital requirement by approximately 0.5 billion which, in line with recent precedent, would most likely be met through retained profit over time.
Following the disposal of IGBB, it is expected that the retained Group will not be subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements.
ICAP operates 43 regulated subsidiaries globally.
Each is locally capitalised and regulated.
Together these entities hold 494 million of cash including restricted funds of which 348 million 2014 15: 357 million is held by the Global Broking business.
Electronic Markets and PTRI hold 126 million 2014 15: 55 million and 20 million 2014 15: 18 million respectively.
