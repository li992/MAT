ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 BUSINESS MARKETPLACE GROUP GROUP RESOURCES & MODEL & STRATEGY PERFORMANCE RISKS RELATIONSHIPS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW The financial statements include the credit funds and CLOs required to be consolidated under IFRS 10, the increase in deferred consideration relating to the purchase of ICG Longbow, and the impact of the EBT settlement.
Internally reported information excludes these items as the Board does not believe that these items assist shareholders in assessing the delivery of the Groups strategy through its financial performance.
A reconciliation between the internally reported management information and the financial statements is shown below with more detail in note 7 on page 136.

This was recognised in the prior year giving a net increase in profit after tax of 20.3m.
In the current year, there was a net release of over-accrued costs in relation to this claim of 2.3m, resulting in an increase in profit after tax of 2.3m.
The deferred consideration in relation to the purchase of the remaining 49% of our real estate business, ICG Longbow, during the prior year was determined with reference to the performance of the business as at 31 March 2016.
The outstanding success of this business has resulted in a 17.8m increase, to 41.7m, in the amount that will be paid as deferred consideration.
The increase has been recognised through the income statement in the current year as a one off cost.
The information in this review is presented on an internally reported basis and excludes the impact of these adjustments.
OVERVIEW The Groups profit before tax, when excluding the impact of the fair value charge on derivatives, was below last year at 175.6m 2015: 184.1m.
This is driven by lower IC profits as borrowing costs have increased as a result of re-gearing.
We continue to make strong operational progress in developing our fund management franchise, with higher management fee income from new and existing strategies contributing to record FMC profits in the year.

Throughout this review all BEFORE TAX numbers are presented on an adjusted basis.
The effective tax rate for the period was 11% 2015: 15%.
The Groups effective tax rate is lower than the current 20% rate of UK corporation tax.
This reflects the mix of the Groups balance sheet with investment returns weighted towards non UK sourced dividend income 158.8 and capital gains rather than interest income.
As dividend income is exempt from UK corporation tax it has the impact of reducing the Groups effective tax rate.
M Based on the adjusted profit above, the Group generated an ROE of 12.9% 2015: 11.0%, an increase on prior year reflecting lower shareholders funds following the 300m special dividend paid during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share for the period were 48.1p ASSETS UNDER 2015: 42.0p.
MANAGEMENT The Group had net current assets of 229.8m 2015: 419.4m at the end of the year.
The decrease in net current assets is principally driven by lower cash due to the special dividend paid in July 2015.
21.6 The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 15.8p per share 2015: 15.1p, taking the full year ordinary dividend to 23.0p per share 2015: 22.0p.
In addition the Board has M recommended a 200m special dividend.
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AUM as at 31 March 2016 increased to 21,582m 2015: 18,012m, driven by strong fundraising across our European funds, the raising of two US CLOs and the acquisition of the management contract of Graphite Enterprise Trust.

FEE INCOME In addition, 1,568m relates to strategies developed in the last two years.
The new strategies have introduced new long term revenue streams to the business.
Furthermore, given that a strategy will typically reach profitable maturity on its third fund, the fee stream growth from our new strategies will become more visible into the medium term.
We also increased AUM by 108.9 661m with the acquisition of the management contract of the listed private equity investment trust, Graphite Enterprise Trust since renamed ICG Enterprise Trust.
M Fee earning AUM increases as new funds are raised that charge fees on committed capital and as funds that charge fees on invested capital are invested.
This can be seen in the fee earning AUM bridge below: Total Mezzanine Credit Real estate Secondaries third party fee funds funds funds funds earning AUM m m m m m At 1 April 2015 4,925 5,447 1,766 139 12,277 Additions 1,625 2,511 1,014 572 5,722 Realisations 858 953 30 1,841 FX and other 32 137 229 3 401 At 31 March 2016 5,660 6,868 2,521 708 15,757 PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANY FEE INCOME Third party fee income increased 14% in the year to 108.9m 2015: 95.8m, and total fee income increased by 11% in the year to 127.3m 2015: 114.5m, driven by the investment of our credit and real estate funds and the successful fund raise of ICG Europe Fund VI.
This was partially offset by a reduction in performance fees from 26.6m to 14.0m.
Excluding performance fees, third party income increased 37% to 94.9m 2015: 69.2m in the year.
Details of movements are shown below: 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 Change m m % Mezzanine funds 57.8 61.8 6 % Credit funds 29.9 22.9 31% Real estate funds 19.1 10.7 79% Secondaries funds 2.1 0.4 425% Total third party funds 108.9 95.8 14% IC management fee 18.4 18.7 2 % Total fee income 127.3 114.5 11% 22 23 STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT REPORT STATEMENTS Mezzanine third party fees include 9.7m 2015: 26.6m of performance fees earned FUND MANAGEMENT as the realisation of assets from older vintages helped trigger the performance hurdles, COMPANY PROFIT primarily in respect of Recovery Fund 2008.
The prior year included 21.6m recognised on European Mezzanine Fund 2006 resulting from the sale of the funds remaining assets to a new secondary fund.
Although an integral part of the fee income profile and profitability stream of the Group, the quantum of performance fees in any particular year is unpredictable.
61.2 Excluding performance fees, mezzanine third party fees increased by 37% from 35.2m to 48.1m, principally due to the raising of ICG Europe Fund VI which charges fees on committed M capital and is 500m larger than its predecessor fund.
This is partially offset by reduced income on ICG Europe Fund V which now charges fees on invested capital from the end of its investment period in May 2015. Credit funds third party fee income increased 31% with fees from new funds partially offset by the decrease in fees on older credit funds that are in their realisation phase.
The increase in fees is principally due to the investment of our Senior Debt Partners strategy plus the combination of the annualisation of fees earned on US CLOs raised in the prior year and two new CLOs raised in the current year.
Fees for our Real Estate and Senior Debt Partners funds are typically charged on an invested basis, although this has little impact for the CLOs which are invested quickly.
The 79% increase in Real Estate third party fee income reflects the investment of money raised for ICG Longbow Fund III and IV and senior debt mandates.
Secondaries third party fees increased by 1.7m in the year due to a full year of fees on the Diamond Castle fund and two months of fees from the ICG Enterprise Trust management contract.
Secondaries fees are expected to grow in FY17 following the first close of our Strategic Secondaries Fund which charges fees on committed capital.
The weighted average fee rate, excluding performance fees, across our fee earning AUM is 0.88% 2015: 0.91% as our senior debt funds, which charge lower fees, are invested.
DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend receipts of 19.3m 2015: 13.2m are higher than prior year due to the increased number and improved performance of CLOs.
OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses of the FMC were 85.0m 2015: 75.3m, including salaries and incentive scheme costs.
Salaries were 30.4m 2015: 27.4m as average FMC headcount increased from 190 to 215.
This increase is directly related to investing in the growth areas of the business namely Secondaries, Real Estate and our operations infrastructure.
Incentive scheme costs have increased to 24.5m 2015: 19.0m reflecting higher awards made in May 2015, which are being expensed to the income statement over their vesting period.
Other administrative costs of 30.1m 2015: 28.9m were 4% above prior year.
The FMC operating margin was 41.9%, up from 40.8% in the prior year.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 BUSINESS MARKETPLACE GROUP GROUP RESOURCES & MODEL & STRATEGY PERFORMANCE RISKS RELATIONSHIPS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED INVESTMENT COMPANY BALANCE SHEET INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BALANCE SHEET INVESTMENTS The balance sheet investment portfolio increased 6% in the period to 1,798.0m at 31 March 2016, as the realisation of older assets was more than offset by new investments and fair value gains.
The impact of this is illustrated in the investment portfolio bridge below: 1,798 m M At 1 April 2015 1,691 New and follow on investments 247 Net transfer from funds for syndication 56 Accrued interest income 75 Realisations 471 Impairments 39 Fair value gains 146 FX and other 93 At 31 March 2016 1,798 Realisations comprise the return of 312.0m of principal, the crystallisation of 83.3m of rolled up interest and 76.1m of realised capital gains.
In the period 180.1m was invested alongside our mezzanine funds for new and follow on investments.
In addition, 67.1m was invested across our CLOs and credit funds.
The investment in our credit funds is lower risk as the funds are principally investing in senior debt assets.
The Sterling value of the portfolio decreased by 102.0m due to foreign exchange movements.
The portfolio is 49% Euro denominated and 26% US dollar denominated.
Sterling denominated assets account only for 14% of the portfolio.
The Group minimises foreign exchange impact of non Sterling assets through non Sterling liabilities and derivative transactions.
The analysis of the portfolio by instrument is outlined below: As at As at 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 m % of total m % of total Senior mezzanine and senior debt 386 21% 433 26% Junior mezzanine 182 10% 169 10% Interest bearing equity 115 6% 164 10% Non interest bearing equity 531 30% 414 24% Co-investment portfolio 1,214 67% 1,180 70% Investment in secondaries funds 104 6% 14 1% Investment in credit funds 225 13% 274 16% Investment in CLOs 131 7% 134 8% Investment in real estate funds 124 7% 89 5% Total balance sheet portfolio 1,798 100% 1,691 100% 24 25 STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT REPORT STATEMENTS In addition to the balance sheet portfolio, there were 182.6m 2015: 243.9m of current TOTAL CASH GENERATED assets being held on the balance sheet at 31 March 2016 that will be transferred to third party FROM OPERATING funds once their fundraising is complete.
The use of the balance sheet in this way enables ACTIVITIES our investment teams to continue to source attractive deals whilst a fund is being raised, and in turn facilitates fundraising as potential investors can see the types of assets they will be investing in.
This is illustrated by the year end balance which includes 66.7m of assets held for syndication into Asia Pacific Fund III and 37.6m of assets being warehousing for 185.6 future CLOs.
M NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income of 80.1m 2015: 118.8m comprised interest income of 126.0m 2015: 158.6m, less interest expense of 45.9m 2015: 39.8m.
Interest income was below the prior period due to a decrease in the average IC portfolio and a reduction in the proportion of interest bearing assets from 46% to 37%.
Cash interest income represented 30% 2015: 30% of the total.
The Group has increased its borrowings to re-gear the balance sheet, resulting in an increase in interest expense.
DIVIDEND INCOME Dividend income of 16.4m 2015: 3.4m was higher than the prior year due to a distribution received from the investment in Diamond Castle of 12.8m by the secondaries team.
OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses of the IC amounted to 57.9m 2015: 49.9m, of which incentive scheme costs of 39.7m 2015: 30.5m were the largest component.
The increase in incentive scheme costs is in part due to a higher national insurance cost in the current year reflecting the share price at the date of vesting and higher headcount increasing the cash bonus accrual.
Other staff and administrative costs were 18.2m compared to 19.4m last year, a 1.2m decrease.
Of these costs, 3.0m 2015: 5.2m related to the cost of business development, including the establishment of Alternative Credit and Australian Senior Loans teams.
Excluding business development, costs increased 1.0m due to the cost of expanding our risk and compliance function with the addition of a Chief Risk Officer CRO and internal audit capability.
The management fee on IC investments managed by the FMC reduced to 18.4m 2015: 18.7m as a result of the reduction in the average size of the loan book.
CAPITAL GAINS Net realised capital gains in the year were 75.2m 2015: 46.7m, of which 51.2m 2015: 21.9m had previously been recognised as unrealised gains in the P&L with the remaining 24.0m 2015: 24.8m recognised in the current year.
Fair valuing the equity and warrants gave rise to a further 144.4m 2015: 84.7m of unrealised gains in the current year reflecting the improved performance of our portfolio companies during the year.
Of this, 104.6m 2015: 86.8m is recognised in the income statement, including 42.8m on our largest asset Parkeon which was realised in April 2016, and 39.8m 2015: 2.1 m as a movement in reserves.
IMPAIRMENTS Net impairments for the year were 39.4m compared with 37.6m in the prior year.
Gross impairments amounted to 42.8m 2015: 53.5m and recoveries were 3.4m 2015: 15.9m in the year.
ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 BUSINESS MARKETPLACE GROUP GROUP RESOURCES & MODEL & STRATEGY PERFORMANCE RISKS RELATIONSHIPS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED GROUP CASH FLOW, DEBT AND CAPITAL POSITION The Group has continued to actively manage its sources of financing, extending debt facilities and lowering pricing where possible.
During the year 845m was raised, of which 270m was in US private placements, 421m extending facilities with existing relationship banks and 154m in bank facilities with three new relationship banks.
The balance sheet remains strong, with 781.3m of available cash and debt facilities at 31 March 2016.
The movement in the Groups unutilised cash and debt facilities during the period is detailed below: m Headroom at 31 March 2015 758.4 Increase in drawn bank facilities 173.2 Increase in private placements 269.7 Secured floating rate notes matured 33.9 Private placements repaid 97.8 Movement in cash 140.4 Movement in drawn debt 158.9 Other including FX 11.0 Headroom at 31 March 2016 781.3 Total drawn debt at 31 March 2016 was 866m compared to 707m at 31 March 2015, with unencumbered cash of 112m compared to 253m at 31 March 2015.
CASH FLOW Operating cash inflow for the year was 185.6m 2015: 150.1m, reflecting that our operating model is highly cash generative.
The increase in the cash inflows is a result of a reduction in cash outflows relating to assets held for syndication partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, as analysed below: 31 March 2016 31 March 2015 m m Cash in from realisations 394.3 505.6 Cash in from dividends 45.7 35.1 Cash in from fees 86.3 94.4 Cash in from cash interest 124.3 124.8 Total cash receipts 650.6 759.9 Cash interest paid 47.0 33.8 Cash paid to purchase loans and investments 247.1 359.8 Cash movement in assets held in warehouse or for syndication 35.8 126.4 Operating expenses paid 135.1 89.8 Total cash paid 465.0 609.8 Total cash generated from operating activities 185.6 150.1 Interest paid was 39% higher, in line with higher average borrowings, but a lower average cost of debt.
26 27 STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT REPORT STATEMENTS CAPITAL POSITION SPECIAL DIVIDEND Shareholders funds decreased by 15% to 1,241.2m 2015: 1,456.4m in the year, principally due to the 300m of special dividend paid during the year.
Total debt to shareholders funds gearing as at 31 March 2016 increased to 0.70x from 0.49x.
Adjusted return on equity of 200 12.9% is up 1.9% from 31 March 2015.
ICGs strong balance sheet positions the Group to generate and realise shareholder value M through co-investing into our existing and new funds and investing in new opportunities, whilst maintaining the appropriate level of regulatory capital.
The Board believes that a gearing range of 0.8x-1.2x remains appropriate and therefore is recommending that a further 200m of capital is returned to shareholders by means of a special dividend, with an associated share consolidation.
On a pro-forma basis, assuming the proposed special dividend had been paid at the beginning of the financial year, gearing would have been 0.93x at 31 March 2016 and return on equity over 16%.
