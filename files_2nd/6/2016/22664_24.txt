Revenue comprises sales of the Groups products net of rebates and discounts.
The discussion below mentions revenue and certain costs and expenses on a constant exchange rate basis.
Constant currency information is calculated by applying the applicable prior period average exchange rates to the Groups actual performance in the respective period.
Revenue and costs and expenses on a constant exchange rate basis are non-IFRS financial measures and should not be viewed as a replacement of IFRS results.
Such measures are presented because the Group believes they enable it to focus on the actual performance related changes in the results of operations from year to year without the effects of changes in exchange rates.
Revenue On a reported basis, revenue increased 2.3%, to $1,688.3 million in 2016 from $1,650.4 million in 2015.
On a constant exchange rate basis, revenue increased 4.0% in 2016.
The primary exchange rate movement that impacted revenue was the movement of the British Pound sterling compared to the US dollar.

On a constant exchange rate basis, adjusted operating profit increased $31.2 million, or 7.1% in 2016.
Other costs and net expenses income Finance costs Finance costs consist of interest costs, standby fees, and any loss related to debt extinguishment.
Finance costs decreased $32.2 million, or 10.6%, to $271.4 million in 2016 from $303.6 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the following: i a decrease in interest expense on long-term borrowings of $24.2 million, ii a decrease in the non-cash amortisation of debt discounts and deferred financing fees of $9.5 million, and iii a decrease in the loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.9 million.
These decreases were partially offset by the write off of deferred financing fees of $7.3 million, in the aggregate, related to the Groups revolving credit facility financing in October 2016 and the commitment letter entered into in connection with the financing of the Groups credit facilities refer to Note 17 Long-term Borrowings for further information.
The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by the early redemption of i the Payment-in-Kind notes PIK Notes due 15 January 2019, ii the 7.375% senior secured notes due 2017 the Secured Notes in June 2015 and iii the 10.5% senior notes due 2018 and the 10.875% senior notes due 2018 collectively, the Senior Notes, partially offset by borrowings related to the new US dollar and euro term loan A facility under the Groups Credit Agreement as a result of the October 2016 financing.
Adjusted finance costs decreased $33.6 million to $242.2 million in 2016 from $275.8 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the following: i a decrease in interest expense on long-term borrowings of $24.2 million and ii a decrease in the non-cash amortisation of debt discounts and deferred financing fees of $9.5 million.
The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by the early redemption of i the PIK Notes in October 2016 ii the Secured Notes in June 2015 and iii the Senior Notes in October 2016.

Other expense, net Other expense, net primarily consists of net gains and losses resulting from i the re-measurement or settlement of transactions that are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of a transacting subsidiary and ii derivative financial instruments.
Other expense decreased $28.7 million to $8.4 million in 2016 from $37.1 million in 2015, primarily driven by a foreign exchange net gain related to i intercompany transactions, including loans transacted in non-functional currencies and ii foreign currency impact on re-measurement of the Groups long-term borrowings denominated in non-functional currency.
These gains were partially offset by i reclassification of foreign exchange accumulated losses of $36.4 million from other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss as a result of restructuring of certain foreign subsidiaries as part of the IPO process and ii a loss of $17.8 million related to the settlement of a foreign currency forward exchange contract.
Refer to Note 9 Other Expense, Net for further information.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 ConvaTec Group Plc89 Financial review continued Income tax expense benefit Income tax increased by $93.9 million to $77.0 million for the year ended 31 December 2016, compared to a tax benefit of $16.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The increase is mainly driven by deferred tax expense, from a benefit of $55.8 million in 2015 to expense of $37.2 million in 2016.
This change was mainly driven by a change related to unremitted earnings, due to a change in tax law in Dominican Republic.
In addition, in 2016 the Group had a $10.8 million prior period impact on deferred tax related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the United States.
After adjusting for certain financial measures which the Group believes are useful supplemental indicators of future operating performance see reconciliation to adjusted earnings for the years ended 2016 and 2015, the adjusted tax rate on continuing operations was 22.3% and 22.7% for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Groups pro forma effective tax rate was 14.2% and 12.0% for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015.
Net loss As a result of all of the above, net loss increased $109.4 million to a net loss of $202.8 million in 2016, compared to a net loss of $93.4 million in 2015.
Adjusted net income increased $54.4 million, or 43.7%, to $178.8 million in 2016 from $124.4 million in 2015.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted net income was 10.6% and 7.5% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit due to revenue growth, strong gross margin expansion and solid cost control combined with decreased finance costs as described above.

Cash conversion The Group believes that cash conversion is a useful supplemental metric that provides a measure of efficiency by which the Group is able to turn profit from operations into cash flow to service the requirements of debt and equity investors, as well as paying for the Groups tax obligations, re-investing in the business for growth and enhancing dividend capacity.
Cash conversion is computed as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA less change in working capital and capital expenditure to Adjusted EBITDA.

Long-lived assets comprise property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill.
Long-lived assets Long-lived assets decreased $292.7 million, or 9.8%, to $2,707.2 million at 31 December 2016, from $2,999.9 million at 31 December 2015, primarily due to i the depreciation of property, plant, and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets of $181.8 million, in the aggregate, ii a decrease from foreign currency exchange of $192.0 million, and iii impairment and write-off charges on property, plant, and equipment of $11.1 million, partially offset by iv additions of property, plant, and equipment of $91.0 million.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased $8.9 million, or 3.3%, to $264.1 million at 31 December 2016, from $273.0 million at 31 December 2015, primarily due to i purchases of property, plant, and equipment and capitalised software of $66.5 million, and ii the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of $24.6 million.
These decreases were partially offset by i cash generated from operating activities of $74.9 million and ii cash generated from financing activities of $4.5 million driven by the financing transaction in October 2016 refer to Note 17 - Long-term Borrowings for further information.
Long-term borrowings Long-term borrowings decreased $1,722.9 million, or 49.2%, to $1,775.6 million at 31 December 2016, from $3,498.5 million at 31 December 2015, primarily due to the net IPO proceeds that allowed the Group to redeem the PIK Notes and the Senior Notes in October 2016.
The decrease was partially offset by i incremental borrowings under the Groups credit facilities as a result of the October 2016 financing and ii an increase in finance leases in 2016.
Refer to Note 17 - Long-term Borrowings for further information.
As a result of the above the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.0x as of 31 December 2016 down from 6.9x as of 31 December 2015.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 ConvaTec Group Plc93 Financial review continued Liquidity and capital resources Overview At 31 December 2016, the Groups cash and cash equivalents were $264.1 million.
Additionally, at 31 December 2016, the Group had $198.7 million of availability under the revolving credit facility.
Restricted cash was $5.1 million at 31 December 2016 refer to Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
The Groups primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations.
Historically, the non-elective nature of the Groups product offerings has resulted in significant recurring cash inflows.
In 2016, the Group generated $74.9 million of cash from operating activities.
Significant cash uses in 2016 included i interest payments of $270.6 million, ii capital expenditures of $66.5 million, iii income tax payments of $39.0 million, and iv payments related to cash-settled AEP and MIP awards of $30.2 million.
The Groups business may not continue to generate cash flow at current levels and, if it is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its debt, the Group may be required to reduce costs and expenses, sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of existing debt or obtain additional financing.
The Group may not be able to complete these initiatives on a timely basis, on satisfactory terms, or at all.
The Groups ability to make scheduled principal payments or to pay interest on or to refinance its indebtedness depends on the Groups future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the healthcare industry and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond the Groups control.
The Group believes that the business has characteristics of strong cash flow generation.
The Groups strengths include the recurring, non-discretionary nature of its products, its diverse product offering and geographic footprint, and the strong market position of the Groups leading brands.
