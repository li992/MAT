The board, through its various sub-committees, has performed a robust assessment of these principal risks.
For additional information pertaining to the management and monitoring of these principal risks, see the references provided.
Regular reporting of these risks is made to senior management, the executives and the board at the group risk and capital committee GRCC and board risk and capital committee BRCC.
The groups board approved risk appetite framework is provided on page 49.
The board recognises even with sound appetite and judgement that extreme events can happen that are completely outside of the boards control.
It is however, necessary to assess these events and their impact and how they may be mitigated by changing the risk appetite framework if necessary.
It is policy to regularly carry out multiple stress testing scenarios which in theory test extreme, but plausible events and from that assess and plan what can be done to mitigate the potential outcome.

Investec has a limited appetite for unsecured debt, thus thecredit risk mitigation technique most commonly used is the taking of collateral, with a strong preference for tangibleassets.
Portfolio reviews including stress testing analyses are undertaken on all material businesses, where the portfolios are analysed to assess any migration in portfolio quality, highlight any vulnerabilities, identify portfolio concentrations and make appropriate recommendations, such as a reduction in risk appetite limits or specific exposures.

This was partially offset by strong book growth and an increase in margin earned on early redemption of loans, reflecting higher activity levels.
Net fee and commission income Net fee and commission income decreased by 2.9% to 709.8 million 2015: 731.1 million largely as a result of lower corporate fees earned following a strong prior year.
The deal pipeline has, however, remained sound.
This was partially offset by a sound performance from the private banking business and the asset management and wealth and investment businesses.
Investment income Investment income increased substantially to a profit of 62.1 million 2015: loss of 2.2 million as a result of higher earnings from the debt securities portfolio and improved results from the Hong Kong portfolio.

Total operating costs decreased by 3.6% to 863.6 million 2015: 895.6 million reflecting: a reduction in costs arising from the sale of certain businesses: partially offset by an increase in headcount and business infrastructure expenses across divisions to support increased activity and growth initiatives: and an increase in variable remuneration given increased profitability in certain businesses.

The impairment of goodwill in the prior year largely relates to the restructure of the Australian businesses.
AMORTISATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES Amortisation of acquired intangibles of 14.5 million largely relates to the Wealth & Investment business and mainly comprises amortisation of amounts attributable to client relationships.
NET LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES As part of the sale of Kensington as discussed on page 29 a final net settlement amount was paid after the 31 March 2015 year end.
As a result of this payment, a further loss before tax of 4.8 million was recognised during the 2016 financial year.
NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests mainly comprises: 10.3 million profit attributable to non-controlling interests in the Asset Management business A reduction of 2.5 million relating to Euro-denominated preferred securities issued by a subsidiary of Investec plc which were reflected on the balance sheet as part of non-controlling interests.
The transaction was hedged and a forex transaction loss arising on the hedge is reflected in operating profit before goodwill with the equal and opposite impact reflected in earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.
These securities were redeemed on 24 June 2015.
Statutory balance sheet analysis Since 31 March 2015: Total shareholders equity including non-controlling interests decreased by 9.3% to 1.9 billion largely as a result of the redemption of the preferred securities as referred to above Total assets increased by 2.7% to18.8 billion largely as a result of strong loan book growth.
