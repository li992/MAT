This was driven by a rise in net management fees to 330.2m 2015: 300.8m, as organic mutual fund flows and changeable but generally rising markets resulted in average assets increasing by 10%.

The increase in that proportion in the year was a result of lower levels of performance fees in 2016.
The Groups net management fee margin for the year was 87 basis points 2015: 88 basis points, with the continued expansion in lower margin fixed income products exercising downward pressure on the margin, which was partially offset by the full-year impact of the 2015 introduction of an aggregate operating fee within the SICAVs.
These factors moved in line with management expectations and within our stated guidance.
We continue to expect net management fee margins to decline by 1-2 basis points a year from 2017, due to the continued expansion of both our international presence and the fixed income component of our AUM.
Given the uncertainties inherent in these factors, the rate and gradient of decline remains uncertain.
