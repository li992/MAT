STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW During the 2016 financial year Wizz Air carried 20 million passengers, a 21.2 per cent.
increase versus the previous year, and contributed to the grand milestone of reaching 100 million passengers since the start of Wizz Airs operations.
Revenues grew to 1,429.1 million, representing a 16.4 per cent.
Increase compared to the previous year.
These growth rates compare to the balanced capacity growth measured in terms of available seat kilometres ASK of 19.1 per cent.
Given strong volume growth and declining industry wide input costs through the year, the unit revenue performance of the business was creditable.
Revenue per ASK decreased by 2.2 per cent.
the 2016 financial year was characterised by a strong drop in fuel prices complemented by a healthy fuel hedging position resulting in a fuel unit cost per ASK decline of 15.0 per cent.
partly offset by the stronger US Dollar.
Non-fuel unit costs, remained neutral and therefore the overall operating unit cost has decreased by 5.4 per cent.
Underlying profit after tax increased by 53.2 per cent.
This equates to a 3.8 percentage point rise in the underlying after tax profit margin from 11.9 per cent to 15.7 per cent.
The profit for the year was 192.9 million and included a 31.0 million net loss from unrealised FX losses and exceptional items.
These comprised unrealised foreign exchange losses of 14.7 million and a loss from the change in the time value of hedge positions of 25.0 million, offset by 8.7 million of exceptional realised FX gain on the conversion of USD 75.6 million of deposits behind collaterals into EUR.
The income tax expense for the year was again 8.5 million 2015: 8.5 million giving an effective tax rate for the Group of 4.2 per cent.
The main components of this charge are local business tax and innovation tax paid in Hungary and corporate income tax paid in Switzerland.

The proforma underlying earnings per share EPS is a fully diluted measure defined by the Company.
Its calculation differs from the IFRS diluted EPS measure in the following ways: E For earnings the underlying profit for the year is used, as opposed to the statutory IFRS profit for the year.
E For the fully diluted number of shares, all convertible debt is taken into account for its dilution impact as at the year end, resulting in 126.8 million 2015: 126.5 million shares used as the denominator.
By contrast, the IFRS diluted EPS measure includes only those convertible debts that could be converted without restriction and takes a weighted average position for the year.
Return on capital employed and capital structure ROCE for the 2016 financial year was 22.4 per cent.
an improvement of 0.9 percentage points versus the previous year driven by a proportionate growth of earnings before interest and tax EBIT, shareholders equity, net cash position, and capitalised leases.
The Companys leverage, defined as net debt adjusted to include capitalised operating lease obligations divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft rentals EBITDAR, fell to a ratio of 1.4 from 1.6 at the end of the 2016 financial year.
Liquidity, defined as cash and equivalents as a percentage of the last twelve months revenue, rose from 37 per cent at the end of the 2015 financial year to 45 per cent a year later.
These improvements in the Companys leverage and liquidity ratios reflect the combined effect of improved profitability and the IPO proceeds.

Financial performance Revenue The following table sets out an overview of Wizz Airs revenue items for 2016 and 2015 and the percentage change in those items: 2016 2015 Total Percentage of Total Percentage of Percentage million total revenue million total revenue change Passenger ticket revenue 894.9 62.6% 793.8 64.7% 12.7% Ancillary revenue 534.2 37.4% 433.5 35.3% 23.2% Total revenue 1,429.1 100% 1,227.3 100% 16.4% In 2016 ASKs rose by 19.1 per cent.
which combined with relatively stable RASK of 2.2 per cent.
resulted in a 16.4 per cent increase in total revenue.
Passenger ticket revenue increased by 12.7 per cent.
to 894.9 million and ancillary or non-ticket revenue increased by 23.2 per cent.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 18 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Financial performance continued Revenue continued Average revenue per passenger decreased slightly from 74.5 in 2015 to 71.5 in 2016, a decrease of 3.9 per cent.
Average passenger ticket revenue per passenger declined from 48.2 in 2015 to 44.8 -7.0 per cent.
while average ancillary revenue per passenger increased from 26.3 in 2015 to 26.7 in 2016, an increase of 1.7 per cent.
This slight decrease in average revenue per passenger was due to: E a significant increase in average passenger ticket revenue per passenger in 2016 compared to 2015, which was the result of the increasing maturity of Wizz Airs route network and higher passenger demand in 2016 than in 2015 as evidenced by a 1.5 percentage point increase in load factor to 88.2%: and E the combined impact of the modification of certain products priority boarding now allows a second piece of carry-on luggage, and there are now two weight categories within checked-in luggage, the introduction of new services allocated seating, and Plus Fare, and the adaptation of customers to some of the longer standing products such as payable carry-on luggage.
Operating expenses Total operating expenses increased by 12.6 per cent.
CASK declined by 5.4 per cent.
This reduction in CASK was principally driven by a reduction in the average fuel price and a favourable development of airport mix.
CASK excluding fuel expenses remained flat at 2.27 Euro cents in 2016 driven by the combined effect of further improvement of major cost items airport, handling, en-route charges set off by increasing aircraft rentals and a larger budget allocated to distribution and marketing.
The following table sets out Wizz Airs operating expenses for 2016 and 2015 and the percentage changes in those items: 2016 2015 Percentage of Percentage of total total Total operating Total operating Percentage million expenses million expenses change Staff costs 101.4 8.5% 83.4 7.9% 21.6% Fuel costs 401.5 33.6% 396.6 37.4% 1.2% Distribution and marketing 23.5 2.0% 18.8 1.8% 25.0% 77.5 Maintenance, materials and repairs 6.5% 62.0 5.8% 25.0% Aircraft rentals 176.2 14.8% 137.1 12.9% 28.5% Airport, handling and en-route charges 343.1 28.7% 297.7 28.1% 15.3% Depreciation and amortisation 28.8 2.4% 33.9 3.2% 14.9 % 41.7 Other expenses 3.5% 30.5 2.9% 36.7% Total operating expenses 1,193.6 100% 1,060.0 100% 12.6% Staff costs increased by 21.6 per cent.

growth in ASKs, and a 9.0 per cent.
appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro after hedging moving from average 1.32 rate in 2015 to 1.20 in 2016, it has been offset by a 0.5 per cent.
reduction in fuel consumption per block hour and a 24.9 per cent.
decline in the fuel price after hedging.
The average fuel price including hedging impact and into-plane premium paid by Wizz Air in 2016 was US$740 per tonne, a decline of 24.9 per cent.
from the previous years figure of US$986 per tonne.
Distribution and marketing costs rose 25.0 per cent.
This increase was largely due to distribution costs which grow in line with revenue growth.
In addition, Company increased discretionary marketing activity year which included a comprehensive re-branding exercise.
Maintenance, materials and repair costs increased by 25.0 per cent.
This cost increase was the result of the increase in the average fleet size and the implementation of the amended engine maintenance contract that resulted in a one-off cost of 3.0 million.
Aircraft rental costs grew 28.5 per cent.
This increase was largely due to fleet growth equivalent aircraft expanded by 19.1 per cent.
and increasing average lease rate due to A321 aircraft joining the fleet, and the appreciation of the US Dollar to the Euro average 9 per cent year on year including hedge impact.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 19 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Financial performance continued Operating expenses continued Airport, handling and en-route charges increased by 15.3 per cent.
This category comprised 193.9 million of airport and handling fees and 149.3 million of en-route and navigation charges in 2016 and 170.5 million of airport and handling fees and 127.2 million of en-route and navigation charges in 2015.
The cost increase was primarily due to an 18.8 per cent.
increase in the number of flights, and a 21.2 per cent.
Depreciation and amortisation charges fell by 14.9 per cent.
This was driven by the implementation of a new engine maintenance contract which takes into account the greater reliability and therefore the longer on-wing times of the airlines engines.
The fall in depreciation is temporary and will catch up once the respective engines become out of condition again.
See Note 13 to the financial statements for more details.
Other expenses increased by 34.7 per cent.
This increase was primarily a result of an increase in non-salary related overhead and crew costs and flight cancellation costs, which were partially offset by lower insurance premiums due to better terms achieved on the renewal of the insurance policy.
A further 1.7 million increase was caused by bringing the tour operator business unit in-house, because third party input costs to the packages for the time being these only apply to hotels are now recognised on a gross basis under other expenses.
Operating profit As a result of the foregoing factors, Wizz Air made an operating profit of 235.5 million in 2016, a 40.8 per cent.
increase from the operating profit of 167.3 million made in 2015 which included 2.8 million of exceptional items.
Operating profit increased by 38.4 per cent when compared to the 170.1 million profit in 2015 excluding exceptional items.
This equates to a 2.6 percentage point improvement in the underlying operating profit margin from 13.9 per cent to 16.5 per cent.
Net financing income and expense Wizz Airs net financing costs resulted in a cost of 34.1 million in 2016 after a net gain of 24.4 million in 2015.
This significant change was driven primarily by three special items, as shown in the table below: million 2016 2015 Change Net FX-related impacts including exceptional item in 2016 3.1 16.2 19.2 Change in time value of hedges exceptional 25.0 - 25.0 Closure of Wizz Air Ukraine one-off, exceptional - 14.6 14.6 All other financial income & expenses recurring 6.0 6.3 0.3 Net financing income and expense 34.1 24.4 58.5 See also Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements.
Net FX-related impacts are expected to be limited in the future because by the end of 2016 the historically high net US Dollar monetary asset position of the Group was substantially eliminated.
Changes in hedge time value will stop impacting earnings as soon as the EU endorses IFRS 9 and thus the Group can adopt it instead of the currently applied IAS 39 endorsement is now expected by the end of the 2016 calendar year.
Taxation Wizz Air recorded an income tax expense of 8.5 million in 2016, in line with an almost identical figure in 2015.
The effective tax rate for the Group was 4.2 per cent.
The reduction in the effective tax rate reflects the impacts of Hungarian local taxes the tax base of which is different from the corporate tax base.
Profit for the period As a result of the foregoing factors, Wizz Air generated an IFRS profit for 2016 of 192.9 million, a 5.3 per cent.
increase from the profit of 183.2 million in 2015.
Other comprehensive income and expense In 2016 the Group had other comprehensive income of 33.2 million compared to the 51.7 million expense in 2015.
This change was driven primarily by the significant movements in the balance of the cash flow hedging reserve in equity in the two years.
In 2015 there was a 43.0 million increase in the reserve caused by the sharp fall in fuel prices during the year combined with a substantial volume of zero cost collar hedge instruments open at 31 March 2015.
In 2016 there was a 33.2 million decrease in the reserve because, although fuel prices continued to drop, at 31 March 2016 the Groups open instruments were fuel caps, which do not result in a liability for the Group even if the market rates for jet fuel are below the hedged rates.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 20 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Cash flows and financial position Summary statement of cash flows The following table sets out selected cash flow data and the Companys cash and cash equivalents for 2016 and 2015: million 2016 2015 Change Net cash generated by operating activities 288.9 174.0 114.9 Net cash used in investing activities 90.6 49.8 40.8 Net cash used in from financing activities 1.7 139.3 141.0 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 0.5 0.5 1.0 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 645.6 448.6 197.0 Cash flow from operating activities The vast majority of Wizz Airs cash inflows from operating activities are derived from passenger ticket sales.
Net cash flows from operating activities are also materially affected by movements in working capital items.
While the difference in profit before tax was only 9.7 million between 2016 and 2015, the improvement in operating cash flows 114.9 million was much more significant.
This can be explained by two main adjusting factors between book profit and cash flows: E Financial income and expenses: In 2015 there were two significant non-cash items within financial income: unrealised FX gain of 27.8 million and 14.5 million from the recycling of the balance of the cumulated translation adjustment account from equity to the income statement.
In contrast, in 2016 there were three significant non-cash items within financial expense: unrealised FX loss of 14.7 million, 25.0 million loss from the change in the time value of hedges, and recognition of 5.3 million fuel-cap related fees paid in 2015.
These factors together explain the 87.3 million difference between the two years.
Most of these factors explain similarly the significant year on year improvement in underlying profits, when compared to the relatively little improvement in IFRS profits.
See also Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements.
E Changes in working capital: 25.9 million was paid for fuel caps in 2015 while there was nil cash spending in 2016.
The other significant contributor was trade and other payables: while the balance grew in both years, as it is normal in a fast growing business, in 2016 it contributed by 29.6 million more to the operating cash flows than in 2015.
Cash flow from investing activities Net cash used in investing activities increased by 40.8 million from a net cash outflow of 49.8 million in 2015 to net cash outflow of 90.6 million in 2016.
The main contributor was advances paid for aircraft, net of refunds of advances, for which 29.4 million more was invested in 2016 than in 2015.
Cash flow from financing activities Net cash from financing activities decreased by 141.0 million to a 1.7 million outflow in 2015 from a 139.3 million inflow in 2015.
This was mainly due to the net proceeds of 149.1 million received during 2015 from the issue of new shares, most of them being the primary proceeds from the Companys IPO.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 21 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Summary statement of balance sheet The following table sets out summary statements of financial position of the Group for 2016 and 2015: million 2016 2015 Change ASSETS Property, plant and equipment 353.6 247.1 106.5 Restricted cash 101.6 73.6 28.0 Derivative financial instruments 1.7 60.7 59.0 Trade and other receivables 197.7 167.9 29.8 Cash and cash equivalents 645.6 448.6 197.0 Other assets 31.7 22.6 9.1 Total assets 1,331.8 1,020.5 311.3 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Equity Equity 688.8 459.9 228.9 Liabilities Trade and other payables 177.3 123.9 53.4 Convertible debt and other borrowings 33.6 31.5 2.1 Deferred income 321.6 262.9 58.7 Derivative financial instruments 17.6 81.7 64.1 Provisions 84.9 52.4 32.5 Other liabilities 8.1 8.2 0.1 Total liabilities 643.1 560.6 82.5 Total equity and liabilities 1,331.8 1,020.5 311.3 Including both current and non-current asset and liability balances, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment increased by 106.5 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015 see Note 13 to the financial statements.
This was driven by investments in all the important fixed asset categories, as follows: i aircraft maintenance assets including advances for these assets increased by 43.5 million, mainly due to more engines being out of condition as they approach end of useful life as at the end of 2016 than a year before: ii advances paid for aircraft PDPs increased by 35.8 million due to a combination of the deposit in relation to the purchase agreement for110 A321neo aircraft deal, the fact that A321 PDPs are higher than those for A320s, and also the fact that the deposits open at 31 March 2016 were placed during a stronger US Dollar environment than those open at 31 March 2015 iii investment into aircraft parts in the amount of 13.3 million, most of this related to the delivery of a spare engine.
Restricted cash current and non-current increased by 28.0 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015.
This was driven by the growth in the amount of lease-related letters of credit, particularly as security in relation to future maintenance obligations.
Derivative financial assets current and non-current decreased by 59.0 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015 see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
The decrease was driven by two factors: i USD EUR FX collars: there was a significant receivable on these instruments at 31 March 2015 due to the heavy appreciation of the USD during the 2015 financial year, however the FX rate stabilised in the twelve months to 31 March 2016 and the older instruments that were contracted at a weaker USD had been settled by then: and ii fuel caps: the 31 March 2015 balance included 22.6 million in relation to the fair value of fuel caps while by 31 March 2016 the fair value reduced to close to nil, due mainly to the reduction in time value.
Trade and other receivables current and non-current increased by 29.8 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015 see Note 18 to the financial statements.
This increase of 18 per cent was broadly in line with the growth of the business and its revenue.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by 197.0 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015.
This change is explained in detail in the cash flow analysis above.
Trade and other payables increased by 53.4 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015.
This increase was at a higher rate than the overall growth of the business, driven primarily by a temporary peak in vendor payables in March 2016.
This in turn was caused by the stabilisation that was required after changes made in a key system used for the control of the Groups vendor invoices.
Deferred income current and non-current increased by 58.7 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015 see Note 26 to the financial statements.
This was driven by the increase in unflown revenues 36.2 million, itself primarily due to the increase of offered seat capacity at the end of the year, and by the concessions received by aircraft and component manufacturers in relation to the twelve new aircraft delivered during the year.
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2016 22 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Summary statement of balance sheet continued Derivative financial liabilities current and non-current decreased by 64.1 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015 see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements.
This is because at 31 March 2016 the majority of the open fuel hedge instruments were caps for which the Group does not have a liability when market rates are below the capped rate, while at 31 March 2015 the majority of open fuel hedge instruments were collars for which the Group had significant liability due to the market rates for jet fuel at the time being significantly below the floor rates of the collars.
Provisions current and non-current increased by 32.5 million as at 31 March 2016 compared to 31 March 2015 see Note 29 to the financial statements.
The increase relates primarily to new provisions made for future heavy maintenance events, particularly engine LLP replacements.
