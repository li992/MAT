SUMMARY The increase in revenue during the year has been driven by continuing organic growth in the number of services we provide, partially offset by lower energy prices and lower average household energy usage compared with the previous year.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits of 4.2% reflects the underlying increase in the average number of services being supplied during the year, improving gross margins from our telephony services, offset by lower energy prices, and higher payroll and occupancy costs following our move into larger offices last spring.
Within our Customer Acquisition operating segment, the combination of lower growth and a reduction in promotional activity, partially offset by additional costs relating to Project Daffodil the provision of free LED light bulbs to multi-service Members resulted in reduced losses of 14.6m 2015: 15.5m.
Distribution expenses reduced slightly to 21.4m 2015: 21.9m, reflecting lower promotional costs associated with gathering new Members offset by an increase in commissions paid to Partners.
Administrative expenses increased during the year by 5.8m to 52.4m 2015: 46.5m mainly as a result of higher staff costs and higher occupancy costs associated with moving into larger offices.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 7.0% to 56.7p 2015: 53.0p.
In accordance with previous guidance and our strong cash position, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of 24p 2015: 21p per share, making a total dividend of 46p 2015: 40p per share for the year.
MARGINS Our overall gross margin for the year was 16.6% 2015: 15.9% reflecting an improving gross margin on our telephony services where higher fixed monthly charges have more than offset the continuing downward trend in landline call spend, higher mobile penetration, and a change in revenue mix where energy which has a lower margin than telephony represented a smaller share of overall revenues.
Over the medium term, we expect our gross profit margins to remain within the previously stated range of 15% to 17%, subject to the impact from any new services which may be introduced and energy price movements.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 21 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT We have continued to achieve steady growth in the number of services we are supplying, with an increase of over 88,000 services during the course of the year.
This takes the total number of services provided within our Discount Club to almost 2.2 million an increase of 4.2% compared with the previous year.
We continue to focus on making it easier for Partners to gather new Members by simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our prices more competitive, and improving the quality of service and support we provide to our membership base.
As a result, all our core services have continued to see organic growth in a challenging competitive environment.
Revenues increased overall, notwithstanding both lower average energy consumption and lower retail gas prices compared with the previous year: m 2016 2015 Electricity 313.7 304.7 Gas 273.9 278.4 Landline and Broadband 102.1 93.7 Mobile 24.4 20.3 Other 13.8 15.5 TOTAL 727.9 712.6 CUSTOMER ACQUISITION Our Customer Acquisition operating segment loss reduced during the year to 14.6m 2015: 15.5m, mainly reflecting a reduction in the number of new Members signing up during the year as a result of the lower level of promotional activity: this was partially offset by additional costs relating to Project Daffodil, our free LED replacement light bulb service.
Following a successful regional trial, Daffodil was rolled out on a nationwide basis during the second half of the year, with installations gathering pace from January 2016 onwards.
The full costs associated with providing this service to each Member are being expensed in the month in which the light bulbs are fitted, notwithstanding that this benefit is only available to multi-service Members who have the longest expected customer lifetimes.
The overall cost of providing this service is expected to increase during the current financial year, as it will include a full 12 months of installation activity, compared with just three months for last year.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Distribution expenses include both the share of our revenues that we pay as commission to Partners, and other direct costs associated with gathering new Members included as part of the Customer Acquisition Segment result for the year.
These reduced slightly to 21.4 m 2015: 21.9m, as the increase in residual commission we pay to Partners was more than offset by reduced promotional costs associated with gathering new Members.
22 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year fell to 1.2% of revenues 2015: 1.5%, falling in absolute terms to 8.4m 2015: 10.7m.
The number of prepayment meters we installed during the year, many of which were provided at the Members own request, fell to 6,775 2015: 8,642, reflecting our slower rate of growth.
This reflects our efforts over the last few years to attract and retain high quality multi-service owner-occupiers.
At the end of the year we had an installed base of 71,026 2015: 68,066 prepayment meters, representing approximately 7.2% of the energy services we supply: this remains significantly below the average level of prepayment meters within the industry of around 16% source: CMA.
DELINQUENT MEMBERS Delinquency the proportion of Members who have at least two energy bills outstanding has been on a steady downward trajectory over the last few years, and we are pleased that this trend has continued over the last 12 months, albeit at a lower rate.
The average number of employees increased from 787 to 908.
This reflects our commitment to continue delivering the best possible experience to our Members increasing numbers of which are taking multiple services from us, the additional services we are now supporting such as Daffodil and smart meters and a significant ongoing investment in strengthening our management team.
Personnel expenses excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive schemes increased by 15.4% during the year to 30.8m 2015: 26.7m.
Overall, administrative expenses increased during the year by 5.8m to 52.4m 2015: 46.5m mainly as a result of higher staff costs, higher occupancy costs associated with moving into our new offices, costs associated with the launch of Project Daffodil, industry and internal costs related to the introduction of smart meters, partly offset by a lower bad debt charge.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 23 2012 1.46% 2013 1.23% 2014 1.15% 2015 1.10% 2016 1.09% FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED OPUS Our share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited Opus, in which we maintain a 20% stake, fell during the year to 5.6m 2015: 6.0m in line with expectations, following the impact of the removal of the exemption from Climate Change Levy CCL for business customers supplied with European power last summer.
Opus continues to grow its market share in the supply of gas alongside electricity into the small business and corporate sector, building on its profitable and highly cash generative business model.
We received a dividend of approximately 5.1m from Opus in April 2016.
Our shareholding in Opus is valued on our balance sheet at 11.6m in line with standard accounting policy, notwithstanding the likelihood that its market value is substantially in excess of this figure.
CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL Our cash balances at the year-end increased to 35.3m 2015: 16.5m following a strongly cash generative year.
Our overall working capital position benefitted from a year on year cash inflow of 7.5m, largely due to lower average energy consumption and payment timing differences related to our energy purchasing arrangements, which are expected to reverse in due course.
Under the terms of our energy supply arrangements, Npower remains responsible for funding the working capital requirements associated with providing energy to Members who have chosen to pay on a Budget Plan.
In December we took advantage of the favourable banking environment for corporate borrowers with strong credit profiles, to re-finance and extend our existing facilities.
We now have a fully revolving five year credit facility of 150m on improved terms.
With a Net Debt EBITDA ratio of only c. 1.0x we now have significant flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities for enhancing shareholder value and increasing our current rate of growth.
BORROWINGS Our balance sheet at the year-end shows a net debt position of 56.3m 2015: 74.0m including the deferred consideration of 21.5m payable to Npower in December 2016: this means we have significant headroom within our new borrowing facilities.
DIVIDEND The final dividend of 24p per share 2015: 21p will be paid on 29 July 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 July 2016 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting which will be held on 22 July 2016.
This makes a total dividend payable for the year of 46p 2015: 40p, an increase of 15% compared with the previous year.
24 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements We believe our strong underlying cash flow, rising adjusted earnings and strong credit profile will enable us to refinance our remaining borrowings as they fall due, whilst maintaining a progressive dividend policy.
We remain comfortable with previous guidance that further growth in adjusted earnings from the level we achieved this year should be reflected in a corresponding rise in the level of distributions to shareholders.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of 2.5m 2015: credits of 1.0m.
These relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments IFRS 2 and arose principally as a result of the increase in the Companys share price over the year.
As a result of the relative size of share incentive scheme charges credits as a proportion of our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits and earnings so that the underlying performance of the business can be clearly identified.
Our current adjusted earnings per share have also therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
The tax charge for the year is 8.9m 2015: 9.8m.
The effective tax rate for the year was 21.9% 2015: 23.2%.
