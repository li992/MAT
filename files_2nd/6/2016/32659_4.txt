In 2016, the full year comprised 53 weeks.
Total revenue increased by 3.7%, mainly due to the impact of the 53rd week.
Total adjusted EBITDA for the year was 121.0m, a decrease of 5.5% on the prior year and adjusted operating profit decreased by 11.0% to 79.2m.
Adjusted Group operating margin for the year was 11.1%, a decrease of 190 basis points on the prior year.
Within this, our administration cost base decreased as a percentage of turnover by 80 basis points, reflecting cost saving initiatives implemented in many of our central support functions during the latter half of 2016.
Interest costs were a little lower this year, partly due to a lower level of average net debt during the year and partly due to the annualisation of improved terms under the new financing arrangements, which were completed in June 2015.
This was partially offset by an increase in non-cash interest as a result of increased onerous lease interest charges.
