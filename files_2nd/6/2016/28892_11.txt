Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Financial review Reported results Reported results are prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Reported Group revenue reduced to 9,251million 201415 9,328 million.
Operating costs before transformation costs increased to 8,766 million 201415 8,717 million.
Group operating profit before transformation costs reduced to 485 million 201415 611 million and operating profit after transformation costs decreased to 294 million 201415 466million.
The reduction was mainly driven by the yearonyear increase in the IAS 19 pension service charge, which is treated as a specific item.
The total charge for other operating specific items reduced to 156 million 201415 248 million mainly due to lower legacy costs.
Asaresult, Group operating profit after operating specific items was 138 million 201415 218 million.
Profit before tax reduced to 267million 201415400million as the prior year benefited from the profit on disposal of the Paddington site.
Earnings per share for continuing operations reduced from 32.5 pence to 21.5 pence.
Presentation of results The remaining commentary in this financial review, unless otherwise indicated, focuses on the adjusted results continuing operations.
Theadjusted basis reflects the cash cost of providing pensions, which Management believes is a more meaningful basis upon which to analyse business performance.
Movements in revenue, costs, profits and margins are on an underlying basis.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by Management and reported to the Board.
Again, this assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group.
The analysis of underlying movements in adjusted results is set out at the end of this section.

The increase in operating profit from the Other segment relates largely to improved trading performance in Romec Limited.
Group operating profit after transformation costs declined by two per cent as a result of higher transformation costs.
Operating profit margin after transformation costs decreased by 10 basis points on an underlying basis to 6.0 per cent.
Specific items Operating specific items in the period related mainly to the pension charge to cash difference of 257 million 201415 129 million and the Employee Free Shares charge of 158 million 201415 169 million.
The difference between the pension charge and cash cost represents the difference between the income statement pension charge rate of 29.8 per cent and the actual cash payments into the schemes.
Yearonyear, theincrease in the difference has been driven by a decrease in AA corporate bond yields, which increases the income statement charge but not the cash payments.
The IAS 19 pension service charge rate for 201617 is 28.8 per cent which means that the pension charge to cash difference is expected to reduce to around 230 million.
The charge for the Employee Free Shares will reduce over time reflecting the phasing of the charge over the vesting period.
For 201617 the Employee Free Shares charge is expected to be around 110million, taking into account the further oneper cent of Free Shares to be allocated in due course and an estimate of the level and mix of leavers.
Nonoperating specific items include a profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of 29 million 201415 133 million mainly arising from the sale of the Croydon Delivery Office.
The net pension interest credit was 113 million 201415 75 million.
This is higher than the prior year due to the increase in the accounting surplus at 29 March 2015 and the impact of the change in pension accounting policy see Note 1 to the financial statements.
For 201617 the pension interest credit is expected to be around 120 million due to the increase in the accounting surplus at 27 March 2016.
Profit on disposal of discontinued operations of 31 million 201415 nil relates to the sale of DPD SL, a subsidiary ofGLS Germany.

The reduction was mainly due to improved terms on our borrowing facilities and leases and lower outstanding balances of gross debt following the amendment of the syndicated bank facilities in the prioryear.
The blended interest rate on gross debt including finance leases for 201617 is expected to be approximately three per cent.

The UK effective tax rate of 20 per cent is broadly in line with the UK Corporation Tax rate.
GLS effective tax rate of 29 per cent 201415 31 per cent has reduced mainly due to changes in tax rules in certain territories, particularly Italy.
Earnings per share EPS Basic adjusted EPS for continuing operations was 41.3 pence compared with 42.8 pence in the prior year, reflecting the increase in transformation costs.

Trading working capital movements were an outflow of 26 million largely as a result of the change in international sales mix, a trend which is expected to continue.
Inyear trading cash flow was an inflow of 254 million, 61 million lower than the prior year mainly driven by an increase in investment.

Growth capital expenditure increased by 85 million with the principal investments being in relation to parcel IT systems, parcels automation, the purchase of new PDAs and investment in GLS.
Replacement capital expenditure decreased by 44million.
The main investment in the period related to IT, in particular IT transformation, with reduced spend on vehicles.
Transformation spend increased by 5million to 233million, mainly as a result of increased spend in relation to project costs largely due to the cost avoidance programme.
Total spend in relation to voluntary redundancy was in line with the prior year.
Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment excluding London property portfolio, mainly relating to the sale of the Croydon Delivery Office, were 38million, giving a total net investment of 656million.
This was slightly higher than expected due to timing of certain projects.
Tax payments of 40 million largely relate to amounts paid in Europe.
In the UK, we continue to be able to offset the majority of taxable profits with capital allowances and brought forward losses.
This is now expected to normalise in 201819, mainly due to relief available from additional Employee Free Shares allocations.

Going forward, the Company is liable to pay National Insurance contributions on any Free Shares that are sold by employees prior to the end of each of the Share Incentive Plans five year terms.
The amounts and timing of any such cash payments are uncertain but will be treated as operating specific items.
As previously reported, on 31 March 2015 GLS Germany sold its entire holding in its subsidiary DPD SL resulting in proceeds from sale of discontinued operations of 41 million.
Acquisition of business interests cash flows of 18 million relate to amounts paid in respect of investments made in the year, mainly NetDespatchLtd, Mallzee Ltd, Intersoft Systems & Programming Limited and acquisitions in GLS, including deferred consideration paid in relation to acquisitions made in prior periods.
Cash flows relating to the London property portfolio of 23 million largely relate to remediation work, reprovisioning costs and professional fees at the Nine Elms and Mount Pleasant sites.

The IAS19 accounting position and key assumptions for the valuation are provided in Note10.
28 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information The process for the triennial valuation of the Royal Mail Pension Plan RMPP at 31 March 2015 has commenced and the outcome will be announced in due course.
The Royal Mail Senior Executives Pension Plan RMSEPP triennial valuation at 31 March 2015 has been completed, based on the assumptions agreed as part of the Funding Agreement made between the Company and the Trustee in 2013.
If the assumptions used for the 2012 triennial valuation of the RMPP and the 2015 triennial valuation of the RMSEPP are rolled forward to 31 March 2016, the combined actuarial surplus would be 1,777million, compared with 1,525 million at 30 September 2015 and 1,793 million at 31 March 2015.
It is this basis that the Pension Trustee and the Company use to assess the ongoing funding needs of these schemes.
To support the Companys commitment that, subject to certain conditions, the RMPP will remain open to defined benefit accrual until at least March 2018, the Trustee has hedged a large proportion of the interest and inflation exposure on this expected future service benefit accrual.
The Trustee increased this hedging further during 201516, and on an actuarial basis the amount of the surplus at March 2016 relating to the liabilities hedged in advance of those accrued to the same date, was approximately 550 million.
This element of the surplus will unwind over time.
Under the 2012 triennial valuation of the RMPP, the Company agreed to pay ongoing cash contributions of 17.1 per cent of pensionable pay until 2018.
At that time, this amounted to around 400 million per annum.
This was made possible by the creation of an actuarial surplus of 1.6 billion as a result of the Pensions Reform in 2013.
Without this surplus, the Company contributions required would have been around 700million per annum, or 30per cent of pensionable pay.
Accordingly, the surplus was expected to decline over time.
Although market conditions for defined benefit schemes have been very volatile over the past 12 months, the funding position of the RMPP at the end of the 201516 financial year is broadly in line with that at the end of 201415, largely due to increases in the market value of gilts and derivative assets held to hedge interest rate and inflation risks.
We continue to expect that the RMPP actuarial surplus will reduce over time, although the pace of this reduction will only be confirmed once the 2015 triennial valuation process has been concluded.
As part of the March 2012 actuarial valuation, the Company agreed to pay additional contributions of up to 50million a year from April 2016 onwards if the Trustee considers these necessary to maintain the Plans projected funding position in March 2019.
Until the Trustee has carried out its assessment of liabilities at 31 March 2016, we will not know if any payment will become due for 201617.
Dividends The final dividend of 14.3 pence per share in respect of the 201415 financial year was paid on 31 July 2015, following shareholder approval.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 15.1pence per ordinary share, payable on 29 July 2016 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 1 July 2016, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 21 July 2016.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 22.1pence, an increase of five per cent.
As previously stated, given the seasonality of the Group's business, the Board would expect to pay an interim dividend each year equal to approximately onethird of the prior year's total dividend and to set the final dividend for each year in light of the full year performance of the Group.
Property We continue to adopt a flexible approach in relation to our large London development sites at Nine Elms and Mount Pleasant and continue to explore options to realise value from them.
Proceeds from the sale of the Paddington site will be reinvested into these larger sites to enable development.
Financial risks and related hedging The Group is exposed to commodity and currency price risk.
The Group operates hedging policies which are described in the Notes to the financial statements.
The forecast diesel and jet commodity exposures in UKPIL are set out below together with the sensitivity of 201617 operating profit to changes in commodity prices and fuel duty.

Without hedging the cost reduction would have been 31 million based upon closing fuel prices at 27March2016.
Dueto the policy of hedging in advance, the current oil prices will result in anticipated lower effective diesel commodity cost in the future.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015-16 | 29 Royal Mail plc | Financial review The UKPIL and Other business units functional currency is Sterling, while GLS functional currency is the Euro.
Therefore the translational exposure to the Groups operating profit relates to GLS profits.
In 201516, the average exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro was 1 1.37 representing an eight per cent strengthening in Sterling compared with 1 1.27 in 201415, which resulted in a 8 million reduction in GLS reported operating profits.
The Group manages its interest rate risk through a combination of fixed rates loans and leasing, floating rate loans facilities and floating rate financial investments.
At 27 March 2016, all of the gross debt of 612 million was at fixed rate to maturity.
Counterparty risk is managed by limiting aggregate exposure to any individual counterparty based on their financial strength.
Events after the reporting year Romec Limited Romec acquisition of 49 per cent shareholding On 31 March 2016, Royal Mail Group Limited RMG, the main operating subsidiary of Royal Mail plc, acquired the 49 per cent of shares in Romec that it did not already own, from ENGIE formerly Cofely Workplace Limited, making RMG the sole shareholder of Romec.
The financial terms of the acquisition are not considered by Management to be material in the context of the Group as a whole.
Settlement of French Competition Authority fine Following the results of an investigation by the French Competition Authority Autorit fide la Concurrence in respect of alleged breaches of antitrust laws by one of its subsidiaries, GLS France, a settlement amount of 55 million was paid by the Group on 15 April 2016.
This amount is fully provided for in the Group financial statements at 27 March 2016 and at 29March 2015.
Auditor Following the audit tender process explained on page 50 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 201415, the proposal to appoint KPMGLLP as external auditor was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
