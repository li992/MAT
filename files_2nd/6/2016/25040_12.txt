The remaining 39.0 million relates to title transfer funds where the client agrees, under a Title Transfer Collateral Arrangement TTCA, that full ownership of such monies is unconditionally transferred to the Group and customer deposits with our banking operation in Switzerland.
Although the levels of client money can vary depending on the overall mix of financial products being traded by clients, the long-term increase in the level of client money placed by clients with the Group is considereda positive indicator of future client propensity to trade.
