as reduced customer demand to Turkey was partly offset by higher sales to Spain and further expansion of our long haul programme.
Within our package offering, we were able to offer a higher proportion of holidays to our own-brand hotels and benefited from a change in destination mix which contributed to an increased average selling price.
These factors helped achieve an underlying gross margin increase of 190 basis points to 29.1%.
Underlying EBIT for FY16 of 152 million is 33 million 28% higher than last year, representing a 150 basis point improvement in EBIT margin from 4.9% to 6.4%.
This improved performance was underpinned by further enhancements to the functionality of our OneWeb platform, which was first launched during FY14.

Load factors fell to 89.2% from 91.6% last year whilst yields fell to 95 per seat from 105 per seat last year.
In response to these challenging market conditions, we have implemented several initiatives to improve Condors performance, including reducing our exposure in the German short and medium haul sector, further expanding our successful long haul offering in Summer, and building more flexibility into flight plans.
These actions will be underpinned by a closer co-operation with our German tour operator, to take advantage of economies of scale.
