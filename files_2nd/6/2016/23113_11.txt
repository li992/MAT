com 30 Strategic Report Financial review continued PENSIONS The Groups principal funded defined benefit pension scheme is in the UK and is closed to future accrual.
The Group also operates various local post-retirement and other employee benefit arrangements for overseas operations, as well as a small UK unfunded scheme.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised 2011, requires the Group to make assumptions including, but not limited to, rates of inflation, discount rates and current and future life expectancies.
The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the accounting values of the relevant assets and liabilities, which in turn could result in a change to the cost of such liabilities as recognised in the income statement over time.
The assumptions involved are subject to periodic review.
The aggregate gross assets of the schemes at 30 April 2016 were 957 million and the gross liabilities at 30 April 2016 were 1,145 million, resulting in the recognition of a gross balance sheet deficit of 188 million 30 April 2015: 200 million.
The net deficit was 145 million 30 April 2015: 152 million taking into account deferred tax assets of 43 million 30 April 2015: 48 million.
A triennial valuation of the main UK scheme was carried out at 30 April 2013 at which point the Group agreed to maintain cash contributions at 16 million per annum.
Cash contributions into the Group pension schemes were 17 million in 2015 16 2014 15: 17million, principally comprising 16 million in respect of the agreed contributions to the pension scheme deficit for the future financing of the pension scheme and are included in cash generated from operations.
A reduction in the gross balance sheet deficit of 12 million is principally attributable to a decrease in the inflation rate reducing pension liabilities.
The next funding calculation is being carried out as at 30 April 2016 and is expected to complete in early 2017.
