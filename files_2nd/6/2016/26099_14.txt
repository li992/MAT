Finance review Fraser Kennedy Head of Finance, Kennedy Wilson Europe The strong double-digit growth across Overview The 2016 financial results reflect continued positive profits and all income metrics in 2016 reflects the earnings growth.
NOI grew to 160.3 million, an increase of successful execution of our operational 23% on the prior year primarily owing to the benefit of acquisitions along with successful leasing levels: partly offset by strategy since IPO.
This resulted in increased adjusted earnings of 55.2 pence per share, a 15.2% increase on 2015.
Increased earnings have been reflected in dividend levels paid in the year which amounted to 48.0 pence per share, 2015: 35.0 pence per share, a 37% year on year increase and meeting the target we set last year.
The dividend cover from adjusted earnings was 1.1 times during 2016.
The first interim dividend of 2017 declared by the Board of 12.0 pence per share will continue to provide a sustainable and attractive dividend yield for our investors.
The total accounting return for the year was 7.6% which was the combination of NAV per share growth primarily driven by the accretive share buyback programme, solid retained earnings as well as a small element of foreign exchange gain plus dividends paid, which contributed 4.1% to the total return.
In June 2016, our investment grade credit rating was reaffirmed by S&P and we have continued to actively manage our debt profile to increase the mix of unsecured debt.
This was achieved through a successful 200 million tap of our 2022 300 million notes which were issued in June 2015 and a 150 million tap of our 2025 400 million notes issued in November 2015.
Financial key performance indicators KPIs 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Total accounting return % 7.6 18.0 Adjusted NAV per share p 1,215.9 1,174.5 Adjusted earnings per share p 55.2 47.9 Dividends paid p 48.0 35.0 LTV % 42.8 39.7 Weighted average cost of debt % 3.0 2.9 50 Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financials Additional information Secured debt principal totalling 230.0 million was repaid in the year and, as a consequence, unsecured debt represents 57% of all debt drawn at year end.
This positive financing activity has resulted in our average term to maturity increasing to 6.1 years 2015: 5.9 years.
Our weighted average cost of debt is a competitive 3.0% which also enjoys a high level of certainty given 92% of borrowings are fixed rate or hedged by way of interest rate caps.
In September 2016, we announced a share buyback programme of 100 million which completed on 28 November.
This added 1.2% to the NAV per share return in the year and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to proactive balance sheet management.
Net operating income Net operating income consists of net rental income, the hotel earnings and loan portfolio interest income.
The chief drivers of the notable net operating income growth in the year are the full period impact of acquisitions completed in 2015 and part period impact of those acquisitions completed in the year, along with a successful level of leasing activity.
This was partly offset by increased disposals for 2016, in excess of our targets.
Administrative expenses Total administrative expenses excluding hotel operations, which are included in NOI are 11.6 million 2015: 10.9 million.
A significant proportion of the expenses are fixed in nature which means that as the Group has become more fully invested the administrative expenses as a percentage of NOI have dropped to 7.2% from 8.4% in 2015.
The cost to portfolio value ratio of 40bps is in line with the expectation at the half-year.
Investment Management fees Investment Manager fees The Investment Manager receives a management fee at an annual rate of 1.0% of the Groups EPRA NAV, payable quarterly.
The fee is settled 50% in cash and 50% in shares, in line with the investment management agreement.
Where the prevailing share price is at a discount to IFRS NAV, an amount equivalent to the fee is applied insofar as possible towards market purchases of existing shares.
The total management fee for 2016 is 16.3 million 2015: 15.2 million.
The management fee in respect of the fourth quarter is 3.9 million, where the 50% share component is expected to be settled through market purchases of existing shares.
Performance fee The 2016 performance fee threshold was not met and a performance fee charge has not been recognised in the income statement.
To be eligible for a performance fee in 2017 the minimum total return required is 10% of the 31 December 2016 EPRA NAV of 1,217.4 pence per share.
Financing costs Net finance costs increased to 57.1 million during 2016 2015: 36.2 million.
This increase reflects the normal level of leverage for the Group, as the balance sheet has matured beyond the initial investment phases post IPO in 2014 and 2015.
Included within finance costs are amortisation of capitalised loan arrangement fees together with commitment fees in respect of the revolving credit facility.
Fair value of uncrystallised foreign exchange movements of 1.8 million are also included in the charge.
We repaid 230.0 million of secured debt in the year and debt close out costs on early repayment of secured borrowings amounted to only 0.2 million in the year.
Increasing our fixed rate unsecured notes has resulted in 71% of borrowings being fixed, with 92% of borrowings fixed when including hedges by way of interest rate caps.
Tax The Group tax charge for the year was 7.3 million 2015: 7.6 million representing an effective rate of tax of 9.0% on adjusted earnings before taxation 2015: 10.5%.
The charge is reduced from 2015 primarily due to a number of successful capital allowance reviews completed in 2016 in respect of the UK investment property portfolio.
A deferred taxation charge has been recognised in respect of fair value gains in the Spanish portfolio where the Group is subject to corporate income tax.
51 Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Finance review continued Adjusted earnings To indicate the extent to which the dividends paid to shareholders are underpinned by earnings, we report adjusted earnings.
The only adjustment to the standard EPRA earnings definition is to add back of any performance fee expense, as this is considered capital in nature.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, there is no performance fee expense.
Adjusted earnings per share were 55.2 pence in 2016 2015: 47.9 pence per share.

For 2017, the Company will pay its first interim dividend of 12.0 pence per share on 31 March 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 10 March 2017.
Share buyback Part of our rigorous capital management is considering not just the appropriate debt mix, cost and leverage but also equity management, particularly when in the Boards opinion there is a disconnect between the prevailing KWE share price and the underlying business fundamentals.
The successful completion of the 100 million share buyback programme in November 2016 saw 9,800,531 shares bought at an average price of 1,020 pence per share, and cancelled.
This constituted 7.2% of issued share capital.
The buyback crystallised for investors the benefit of a 17.7% discount to preceding September 2016 adjusted NAV of 1,240 pence per share.
The buyback was accretive to both NAV per share and earnings per share: the NAV per share movement in 2016 was enhanced by 1.2% and we expect the benefit to earnings per share growth, on an annualised pro forma basis, to be 7.8%.

Notably, the small negative valuation movement was only 8.6 million or -0.3%, reflecting strong performance of our Euro assets 69.0 million offsetting falls in the UK -77.6 million, illustrating the benefits of our geographically diversified portfolio.

The 3.5% Adjusted NAV per share growth reflects retained earnings, including gains on sale from disposals, which reflected a 4.8% premium over preceding valuation, and the benefit of the share buyback.
Foreign exchange also contributed but comparing to the portfolio level gain it is clear that our hedging policy worked well during the year to significantly reduce the impact of substantial Euro strengthening.
At year end, 87% of Euro assets were hedged, 66% through local currency borrowing and 21% through derivative instruments.

The major sources of cash during the year were: Proceeds from predominantly unsecured financing activity of 391.6 million Proceeds on disposal of assets, which generated cash of 371.6 million KWE maintains a 225.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility.
At 31 December 2016, the full 225.0 million facility was available to be drawn.
The Groups interest rate hedging policy is to eliminate substantially the risk associated with interest rate volatility, through a combination of fixed rate borrowings and, in respect of floating rate debt, the use of interest rate caps.

These new notes were issued at a yield of 3.039%.
On 10 June 2016 Standard & Poors affirmed its BBB long-term corporate credit ratings for KWE and its listed Euro and Sterling bonds.
The stable outlook reflected the benefit of our diverse portfolio of real estate assets supporting stable cash flows and ample interest cover, as well as relatively low debt maturities in the coming years, coupled with a high level of available liquidity sources.
We successfully issued a 200 million tap on 19 September 2016 at an issue yield of 3.572%.
This increased the aggregate principal amount of our 2022 300 million notes which were issued in June 2015 to 500 million.
135.8 million of bond proceeds were voluntarily used to repay certain secured borrowings.
A further 94.2 million debt was repaid from the disposal of secured assets.
At 31 December 2016, LTV stood at 42.8%, well within our long-term target range of 40%-45%.
The fixed charge cover the ratio of adjusted earnings before finance costs to finance costs for the year was a comfortable 2.4 times.
Throughout 2016 and as at 31 December 2016, the Group reported compliance with its debt covenants.
