52 STRATEGIC REPORT Finance review In a year dominated by unexpected political events and increased uncertainty, Derwent London has reported further recurring earnings growth, a step change in the proposed final dividend and a small increase in net asset value backed up by a very strong financial position.
After several years where large valuation uplifts provided substantial net asset value increases for the Group, in 2016 the net asset value attributable to equity shareholders marginally increased by 10m, with the IFRS net asset value NAV remaining at the same rounded 4.0bn reported a year ago.
The combination of a maturing London office property cycle and the EU referendum vote, among other things, gave rise to an outward yield movement on our portfolio averaging 31bp in 2016.
This was partially offset by the positive impact of continuing rental growth, record letting successes and strong rent review settlements but the portfolio valuation was down as a result in H2 2016.
The fall was lower than we had anticipated in the immediate aftermath of the June EU vote and was more than offset by retained recurring earnings.
We have also been able to demonstrate that our carrying values remain Damian Wisniewski supported by transactional evidence with 208m Finance Director of property investment disposals in H2 2016 at an average price 3.7% above December 2015 book values.
These property sales had another benefit as available undrawn facilities increased by the year end to the extent that our committed development pipeline was fully funded at December 2016.

The main rent increases came from 30.9 lettings and reviews which added 21.1m while 105 rent reductions from lease breaks, expiries and 0.5 voids totalled 5.3m and with 3.9m from 85.7 27.8 2.6 2.4 schemes commencing.
Administrative expenses increased by 3.0% to 70 30.9m in 2016 but the trend is down as the reported figure takes account of a bonus underprovision in 2015 of 0.9m.

As in 0 previous years, no overheads or property costs were capitalised.
In more uncertain market conditions, investor appetite for London offices has held up more strongly than most expected and we were able to book a profit of 2015 148.3 3.7 2.3 8.9 30.0 34.8 1.0 0.9 2.0 78.7 7.5m on disposal proceeds of 210.6m in 2016, most of which came after the EU referendum vote.
In addition, there was a 1.9m trading profit on the Gross property income sale of apartments during the year.
Total finance costs reduced from 35.2m in 2015 to m 27.8m in 2016 after capitalising 13.0m of interest, 180 4.7m of which related to phase 1 of The White Chapel Building up to the date of practical completion in October 2016.
Because it was acquired as a vacant 9.3 property in December 2015, interest was capitalised on the purchase price as well as the subsequent 3.9 development costs.
The rent already contracted 5.7 160 from the building is 7.0m so, post practical 5.3 156.0 completion when the capitalisation of interest 6.1 3.1 0.3 152.0 ceased, the net impact upon future earnings is expected to be positive.
5.1 Following the sale of the Grafton Hotel property in December 2016, we decided to break 10m of 140 interest rate swaps and to reduce the rate payable under a further 135m of swaps.
With 2.4m paid to defer a 70m forward start swap by a further 12 months, total swap breakage costs were therefore 9.0m in 2016.
After allowing for the revaluation deficit on our 120 property portfolio, the overall result was an IFRS profit for the year of 53.6m, down substantially from the 777.2m reported for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Adjusting for profits on disposal, fair value movements and other items which are non-recurring in nature, EPRA earnings increased by 8.9% from 78.7m in 2015 to 85.7m for the year 2015138.4 4.0 7.0 15.1 3.0 3.3 4.5 2.6 2.3 152.0 ended 31 December 2016.
