Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information Content Section at start: Page Title at start: Ensuring that the majority of the incentive pay comes in the form of a long-term incentive plan subject to stretching performance targets measured over multi-year performance periods, with the performance period for subsequent awards overlapping the previous award, together with an additional two year holding period.
This ensures that there is no particular incentive to maximise performance over a particular period: Incorporating withholding and recovery provisions into the Companys bonus and long-term incentive plans: and Requiring the Executive Directors to build and maintain a substantial shareholding in the Company.
Remuneration Policy across the Group The Policy is designed with regard to the remuneration policy for employees across the Group as a whole and the Committee aims, where appropriate, for there to be a consistent approach applied.
For instance, the suite of benefits in kind is generally consistent other than in relation to quantum and all employees participate in annual bonus plans.
All employees, including the Executive Directors, are offered the opportunity to participate in the Groups SAYE Share Option Plan and Share Incentive Plan.
Senior managers participate in the long-term incentive plan.
The Policy is more weighted towards variable pay than for other employees to make a greater part of their pay conditional on the successful delivery of business strategy, and in line with shareholder interests.
In addition, more of senior level remuneration is deferred than is the case for the workforce as a whole.
Employees were not consulted in respect of the Policy, but the Committee does consider the remuneration arrangements for the broader employee population when determining the Policy.
Remuneration Scenarios for Executive Directors The chart below shows how the proportion of each Executive Directors remuneration package varies at different levels of performance in accordance with the Policy to be implemented in 2017 and using the assumptions set out below.
A significant proportion of remuneration is linked to performance, particularly at maximum performance levels.
Target fixed pay plus 60% vesting of the annual bonus and 50% vesting of PSP awards.
Maximum fixed pay plus 100% vesting of the annual bonus and PSP awards.
Salaries used are those applying on 1 March 2017 and taxable benefits are those reported for the year ending 31 December 2016.
Pension is based on 2017 Policy applied to 1 March 2017 salaries.
Amounts have been rounded to the nearest 1,000.
The assumptions noted for on-target PSP performance in the graph above are provided for illustration purposes only.
Participation in all employee plans, dividends payable on PSP awards over the vesting period or on deferred share bonus awards are not included in the above scenarios and the table assumes no increase to the share price.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 101 000 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Service Contracts and Loss of Office The Companys policy is that service contracts may be terminated with twelve months notice from either the Company or from the Executive Director except in certain exceptional recruitment situations where a longer notice period from the Company may be set provided it reduces to a maximum of twelve months with a specified time limit.
Service contracts do not contain a fixed end date.
Under their service contracts, the Executive Directors are entitled to salary, pension contributions and benefits for their notice period except on termination for events such as gross misconduct where payment will be for sums earned up to the date of termination with no notice period only.
The Company would seek to ensure that any payment is mitigated by use of phased payments and offset against earnings elsewhere in the event that an Executive Director finds alternative employment during their notice period.
There are no contractual provisions in-force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment.
In summary, the position on cessation of employment is as follows: Provision Detailed terms Notice period Twelve months by either party.
Termination payment Base salary plus benefits including pension.
An express obligation on the Executive to mitigate his loss.
Payments can be made on a monthly basis and reduced if an Executive is able to secure alternative employment.
In addition, any statutory amounts would be paid as necessary.
Remuneration entitlements on A pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with the vesting of cessation outstanding share awards in certain circumstances as described below.
Change of control As on termination and with remuneration entitlements as described above.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors, including the health, length of service and performance of the relevant Executive, including the duty to mitigate their own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness or redundancy.
Any unvested awards held under the PSP schemes will lapse at cessation of employment, unless the individual is leaving for certain reasons defined under the plan such as death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, their office or employment being either a company which ceases to be a Group member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group member, or any other reason the Committee so decides.
In these circumstances, unvested awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date unless the Committee decides they should vest at cessation subject to performance conditions being met and normally subject to scaling back in respect of actual service as a proportion of the total vesting period unless the Committee decides that scaling back is inappropriate.
The same approach applies on a change of control.
Any unvested awards held under the Deferred Bonus Scheme will lapse at cessation unless the Committee determines otherwise.
In these circumstances the Committee may determine that unvested awards will vest at the cessation unless the Committee decides they should vest at the normal vesting date.
The Committee may agree to the payment of disbursements such as legal costs and outplacement services if appropriate and depending on the circumstances of the leaving Executive.
The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered in the best interests of the Company.
Non-executive Directors Letters of Appointment The Non-executive Directors including the Chair do not have service contracts or any benefits in kind arrangements and do not participate in any of the Groups pension or incentive arrangements.
The appointment of each Non-executive Director can be terminated by giving three months notice subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.
Any period of service longer than six years is subject to particularly rigorous review by the Nomination Committee of the Board.
The Non-executive Directors letters of appointment do not provide for any payment on termination except for accrued fees and expenses to the date of termination.
The terms and conditions of Executive Directors service contracts and the letters of appointment of the Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM, the details of which can be found on page 116.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION This Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM.
The information on pages 103 to 110 has been audited where indicated.
How the Policy was Applied in 2016 Remuneration payable in respect of performance in 2016 audited The following table sets out each element of remuneration for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2016 or period thereof for appointments or cessations during the year.
Benefits for the Non-executive Directors are for reimbursement of taxable travel expenses grossed up for the tax payable thereon.
ii As explained on page 97, half of the annual bonus is paid in cash, with the other half being used to purchase St. Jamess Place shares which are subject to forfeiture for three years under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Scheme.
iii The value of the long-term incentives is the value of shares for the award where the performance period ends in the year, together with the value of the dividends that would have been received during the three year performance period.
The figures for 2016 have been calculated using the average of the SJP share price in the three month period to 31 December 2016, being 9.585, as the actual vesting date of the PSP award is on 26 March 2017.
The figures for 2015 have been updated from the three month average figures used in last years report being 1,776,526 for David Bellamy and 1,184,411 for Andrew Croft, Ian Gascoigne and David Lamb to take into account the SJP share price on the date of vesting on 21 March 2016, being 9.405.
The LTI vesting figure in monetary value for 2016 is significantly lower than 2015.
This is due to the number of shares in the 2013 award being substantially more approximately 60% than in the 2014 award, because the share price at grant in 2013 was 40% lower than 2014.
For example for the Chief Executive, the grant of 190% of salary on 2013 amounted to 176,178 shares at a share price of 5.16: in 2014 an award of 190% of salary amounted to 109,782 shares at a share price of 8.52. iv Pension contributions, being 20% of base salary for all Directors, were capped by legislation and so a non-pensionable salary supplement was paid to the Executive Directors in full for David Bellamy, Andrew Croft and Ian Gascoigne and for the balance for David Lamb, who had a 20,000 contribution to the money purchase group pension scheme.
v The value of the SAYE options exercised by Ian Gascoigne on 24 March 2016 when the mid-market price of St. Jamess Place shares was 9.10. vi David Lamb was a non-executive director of The Henderson Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc during the year and was paid a fee of 23,000 in 2016 in connection with that role 2015: 21,750.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 103 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Details of Variable Pay Earned in the Year Annual bonus for 2016 performance The performance conditions which applied to the bonus and the resulting payout were as follows: Assessment by the Committee of the Performance of the Executive Directors Payout Payout Weighting % Weighting % Maximum % of % of Measure of salary of maximum Threshold value Actual salary maximum EEV operating profit 75% 50% 586m 642m 673.6m 75% 50% Strategic business plan objectives 75% 50% Assessment by the Committee of the 70% 46.67% performance of the Executive Directors Total payout 145% 96.67% In setting the operating profit target for the year it was assumed that the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes would have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
The actual outcome for the year included a combined positive impact to the operating profit from these two items of 20 million.
The Committee concluded that this positive outcome was as a result of management action during the year and should therefore be included when assessing the bonus payout for the year.
Annual Bonus Strategic Targets Performance Assessment As described in other parts of the Annual Report and Accounts, the Company delivered strong performance in 2016 for our clients, shareholders and other stakeholders.
The Committee considered these three groups when setting the strategic targets for 2016, together with other objectives set out in the 2016 business plan.
In serving our clients well, developing our employees and the Partnership for the future and striving to improve the effectiveness of our organisation, we will be best placed to meet our long-term business objectives, and create additional value for our shareholders.
We also focus on the importance of safe and sustainable growth through prudent management of risk and the highest standards of regulatory compliance.
The Committee assessed how well the Executive team had performed in relation to the objectives set at the start of the year.
The Committee did not place fixed weightings on the factors assessed, but made a judgement based on the Committees view of the relative importance and impact of those factors over the course of the year.
For some factors the Committee put in place quantitative metrics, and for others qualitative judgements were made, depending on the nature of the strategic objective.
The Committee took into account the following: Objectives and performance Clients The Annual Wealth Account Survey results for 2016 7 were very strong with results as at the date of this Annual Report of 97% of clients saying they would recommend SJP to friends or contacts and 56% of those surveyed confirming they have done so already: Clients continued to benefit from above average performance across the majority of funds and portfolios over a range of time periods.
Across all ten year periods, the equity fund managers outperformed their benchmark, on average, 77% of the time.
Over the three and five year periods, the equivalent average outperformance rate was 72% and 84% respectively.
For the range of eight Growth and Income portfolios available to clients, outperformance compared to the relevant Asset Risk Consultants ARC Private Client Index peer group occurred in 84% of all three year periods on average: The number of advice-related complaints remained very low: The Group won a number of industry awards, further details of which are set out on page 54, many of which were voted on by clients: and The above factors, together with strong service levels, generally contributed to excellent retention of funds under management, with 95% of existing funds being retained excluding regular income withdrawals see page 29 for further details.

73 students graduated from the Academy, 42 as Partners and 31 as Advisers: Completing the acquisition of Rowan Dartington and continuing its integration into the Group: Launch of the Retirement Account and certain intergenerational products: Opening a new location at Canary Wharf and a new office in Cirencester: Very satisfactory results from the 2016 Employee Survey: High levels of retention for both employees and members of the Partnership, assisted by additional training and development opportunities for the senior management team, the Partnership and the workforce generally: and Continuing to maintain and reinforce the Groups distinctive culture.
Risk management Continuing positive engagement with the Groups regulators responding effectively to key regulatory initiatives including the Financial Advice Market Review and Solvency II: and Completing various objectives designed to continue to enhance and strengthen the monitoring and mitigation of key regulatory risks impacting the Group.
Other objectives Supporting more Partners to achieve Chartered status: Continuing development of the Groups range of funds, the range of fund managers available to clients and the effective operation of the Investment Committee: and The ongoing success of the Groups CSR objectives, including raising more than 7.5 million for the Foundation and expanding the volunteering opportunities available to employees.
Taking all the above strategic objectives into account, the Committee awarded a bonus of 70% of salary 93.3% of the maximum under the team performance element of the annual bonus scheme, recognising that a high proportion of the strategic objectives were graded as outstanding or above stretch and that nearly all of the major business plan objectives had been satisfactorily completed.
Notes i The Committee has the discretion to scale back the annual bonus payable in respect of the strategic measures if it considers it inappropriate in the context of the overall financial results of the Group.
The Committee reviewed the Groups performance and agreed that no scale-back was appropriate.
ii The Committee retains the discretion to amend each element of the bonus, up or down, within the overall cap of 150% of salary, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared to competitor organisations or, for instance, an exceptional positive or negative event which impacts the Group.
The Committee reviewed the Groups performance as well as competitors and the external market at the end of the performance period and agreed that no adjustment was required.
iii Half of the bonus is paid in cash, with the remainder being invested in the Companys shares and deferred for three years, under the Groups deferred bonus plan.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 105 Content Section at start: Page Title at start: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Long-Term Incentive Awards Vesting of Performance Share Plan PSP awards audited On 31 December 2016, the awards made on 26 March 2014 under the PSP reached the end of their three year performance period.
These will vest on 26 March 2017, being the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The performance conditions which applied to the 2014 PSP awards, and the actual performance achieved against these conditions, are set out in the table below: Average annual adjusted EPS growth Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the unwind of the excluding the unwind of the discount TSR relative to the FTSE 51 150 discount rate in excess of RPI rate in excess of RPI % of one % of one % of one third of third of third of award award award Performance level hurdle Performance required vesting Performance required vesting Performance required vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Stretch or above Upper Quartile or above 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% Actual Achieved 18 out of 88 companies 100% 19.5% 100 % 17.4% 100% Above Upper Quartile FTSE 51-150 Index excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas and mining sectors.
Accordingly, the total percentage of the 2014 PSP awards vesting was 100%, which resulted in the following awards vesting to the Executive Directors: Total Value of number of Percentage Number shares shares of awards of shares vesting 1 Director granted vesting vesting 000 David Bellamy 109,782 100% 109,782 1,052 Andrew Croft 73,165 100% 73,165 701 Ian Gascoigne 73,165 100% 73,165 701 David Lamb 73,165 100% 73,165 701 Note 1: The deemed share price used to calculate the value of shares vesting was 9.585 being the three month average to 31 December 2016 as the awards will not actually vest until 26 March 2017.
Note 2: Up to 3,054 shares can be exercised by each Executive Director via a linked award under an approved share option scheme, with an exercise price of 8.515.
If such linked award is exercised, a number of shares equivalent to the gain achieved upon such exercise will be lapsed from the number of PSP shares noted, and the overall value shares vesting is therefore unchanged from the number set out above.

The face value of the award figure is calculated by multiplying the number of shares awarded by the average share price figure of 9.3875.
PSP awards are structured as nil cost options and there is therefore no exercise price payable on exercise.
Dividend equivalents accrue to the Executive Directors between the date of grant and exercise of the award up to a maximum of five years from date of grant, but are released only to the extent that awards vest.
Further details of the performance conditions which apply to the awards are set out in Notes 1 and 2 on page 113.

Total Remuneration for the Chief Executive The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the Chief Executive over the last eight financial years.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and long-term incentive awards which vested based on performance in those years and ending in that year for PSP scheme awards.
Of this, 117,441 is due to increases in the SJP share price over the vesting period, being an increase of 13%.
The value of long-term incentive awards for 2016 has been calculated using the average of the Companys share price in the three month period to 31 December 2016, being 9.585, as the actual vesting date of the PSP award is on 26 March 2017.
The 2015 figure for total remuneration has been updated by substituting the three month average figure used to calculate the value of long-term incentive awards in last years report by a revised figure based on the SJP share price on the date of vesting on 21 March 2016, being 9.405.

Committee Membership and Attendance at the Committee Meetings The membership and terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed annually and the terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
The members of the Committee are Simon Jeffreys, Baroness Wheatcroft and Roger Yates.
There have been six Committee meetings during the year and all the members as well as the Chair of the Board attended each of the meetings details of attendance at those meetings can be found on page 75.
Advisers to the Committee The Committee appointed independent remuneration consultants New Bridge Street NBS to advise on remuneration matters generally and this appointment is reviewed annually by the Committee.
NBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct, which requires its advice to be impartial and NBS has confirmed to the Committee its compliance with the Code.
The total fees paid to NBS for the advice provided to the Committee during the year were 94,688 excluding VAT.
Fees are charged on a time spent basis.
NBS has not provided any other services to the Company during the year.
However, certain subsidiaries of Aon plc, the parent company of NBS, have provided some investment advisory services to the Company during 2016 for which the fees were 50,000 excluding VAT.
The Committee has been advised of the basis on which NBS is organised and managed as part of the wider Aon organisation and the basis on which its staff are remunerated and is satisfied that the additional services provided by other Aon group companies did not in any way compromise the independence of advice provided by NBS to the Committee.
The Committee also seeks internal support from the CEO, CFO, Chair of the Board, Chair of Risk Committee, Chief Risk Officer and the Company Secretary.
No Director is present at any part of a meeting of the Committee when their individual remuneration or contractual terms are being discussed.
Engagement with Shareholders The Committee is updated on the latest views of major shareholders and their representative bodies through meetings with investors and their representative bodies and from various written communications received, including published guidelines.
The Chair of the Committee is happy to meet with shareholders on request to discuss any concerns regarding remuneration issues, should they arise.
How the Policy will be Applied for 2017 2017 salary review The base salaries of the Executive Directors are being increased in 2017.
The current salaries as at 1 March 2016 and from 1 March 2017 are as follows: Salary from Salary from Increase from Director 1 March 2016 1 March 2017 1 March 2017 David Bellamy 505,000 520,000 3% Andrew Croft 365,000 376,000 3% Ian Gascoigne 365,000 376,000 3% David Lamb 365,000 376,000 3% Annual bonus for 2017 The Executive Directors maximum bonus opportunity for 2017 will be the same as for 2016 being 150% of salary.
Half of the annual bonus will be determined by EEV operating profit and half by key strategic targets.
50% of the annual bonus earned for performance in 2017 will be paid in cash and the remaining 50% will be deferred in SJP shares for a three year period and subject to continued service.
The EEV operating profit target set by the Committee is based on a sliding scale to progressively reward incremental performance.
The EEV result is calculated based on best estimate assumptions and any deviation or changes from these assumptions are reported as an experience variance or an operating assumption change.
In setting the operating profit target for the year it is assumed the combined operating experience variance and operating assumption changes will have a neutral impact on the outcome for the year.
In setting the 2017 EEV Operating Profit target, the Committee 112 St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Registered No.
03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information Content Section at start: Page Title at start: maintained the new business and expense growth objectives at the same level as in previous years.
However, it was recognised that, in comparison to the 2016 operating profit target, the 2017 contribution to operating profit from the unwind of the discount rate will be impacted negatively, by the lower discount rate, following the 0.7% reduction in the UK ten-year government gilt yield.
The Board considers that the performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and is not disclosing them at this time.
The performance metrics and performance against them will be disclosed in the 2017 Remuneration Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
The team element of the 2017 annual bonus will be assessed by reference to key strategic targets based around the 2017 business plan, including elements relating to clients, shareholders and other key stakeholders.
Specific objectives include: the delivery of excellent service to the Groups clients as measured by surveys and other client feedback: continuing to enhance the range of investment funds and maintaining strong investment performance: the successful recruitment and retention of high quality Partners and Advisers: successfully implementing the next phase of the administration system and transferring certain existing assets onto that system: successfully controlling and mitigating the material risks that could impact the Group: and maintaining the Groups good relations with its shareholders and regulators.
Performance Share Plan awards for 2017 The Executive Directors will each receive a PSP award in 2017 of 200% of salary.
Awards will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition for one-third of the award and earnings per share growth targets for two-thirds of the award as follows:.
Average annual adjusted EPS Average annual adjusted EPS growth including the unwind of growth excluding the unwind of TSR relative to the FTSE 51 to 150 the discount rate in excess of RPI the discount rate in excess of RPI Note 1 Note 2 Note 2 Performance % of one third of Performance % of one third of Performance % of one third of Performance level hurdle required award vesting required award vesting required award vesting Below threshold Below Median 0% Below 5% 0% Below 5% 0% Threshold Median 25% At least 5% 25% At least 5% 25% Stretch or above Upper Quartile or above 100% 16% or above 100% 16% or above 100% Note 1: F TSE 51 to 150, excluding investment trusts and companies in the FTSE oil, gas producers and mining sectors.
Straight line vesting occurs in between threshold and maximum vesting.
Note 2: The first EPS performance condition is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The effect of the adjustment to the consolidated after tax figures will be to strip out the post-tax EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change in the final year of the performance period as these factors are not within the control of management and can produce wide variations to reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
However, this measure of EPS is still impacted by stock market movements in the prior year due to the impact of any such movements on the unwind of the discount rate in the current year.
The second EPS performance condition is calculated in a similar way to the first EPS condition, save that a further adjustment is made to strip out the impact of the unwind of the discount rate.
This adjustment eliminates any direct impact of stock market volatility and changes in the economic assumptions throughout the whole three-year period of the performance condition.
