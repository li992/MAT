Growing revenue In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2015 volume rate Out-patient Other 2016 Growth Underlying revenue 879.0 14.7 19.8 11.1 1.8 926.4 5.4% Disposals 5.8 Total revenue 884.8 926.4 4.7% Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 increased by 41.6 million, or 4.7%, to 926.4 million 2015: 884.8 million.
Underlying growth, excluding revenue of nil 2015: 5.8 million relating to Spire St Saviours Hospital which was closed in September 2015, was 5.4%.
Of the underlying revenue growth of 5.4%: an increase of 2.3% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.7% increase in revenue in the year, with admissions growth in both NHS and Self-pay activity compensating for a small volume decline in PMI business: the Group reported a 3.5% increase in the rate for in-patient and daycase admissions average revenue per case equivalent to an increase to total revenue of 2.3%.
This was the result of growth in average revenue per case across all payor groups, most particularly in NHS and Self-pay activity in the year: and out-patient activities increased with the volume of admissions and this accounted for a further 1.3% growth in underlying revenue in the year.
28 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION PMI In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2015 volume rate Out-patient 2016 Growth Underlying PMI revenue 433.2 5.4 0.4 1.1 429.3 0.9% Disposals 1.6 Total PMI revenue 434.8 429.3 1.3% PMI revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 decreased by 5.5 million to 429.3 million 2015: 434.8 million.
Underlying revenue, excluding revenue relating to Spire St Saviours Hospital, declined by 0.9%.
Of the underlying decline in PMI revenue of 0.9%: a decrease of 1.9% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 1.2% reduction in PMI revenue in the year: overall, the proportion of lower yielding PMI daycase admissions remained comparable to that in 2015 having increased significantly between 2014 and 2015.
Case mix complexity in in-patient admissions was slightly inferior to that in 2015 but was offset by an increase in rate on daycase admissions.
Overall these offsetting effects resulted in a net positive rate increase of 0.3% over 2015 which contributed to growth of 0.1% in underlying PMI revenue: and notwithstanding the decline in in-patient and daycase admissions activity, out-patient revenue grew in the year and contributed growth of 0.2% in underlying PMI revenue.
The Group continues to invest in the expansion of its diagnostic capability and outpatient capacity.
NHS In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2015 volume rate Out-patient 2016 Growth Underlying NHS revenue 258.6 12.2 14.8 7.8 293.4 13.5% Disposals 3.4 Total NHS revenue 262.0 293.4 12.0% NHS revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 increased by 31.4 million, or 12.0%, to 293.4 million 2015: 262.0 million.
Underlying growth, excluding revenue relating to Spire St Saviours Hospital, was 13.5%.
Of the underlying growth in NHS revenue of 13.5%: an increase of 5.4% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 4.7% increase in NHS revenue in the year: against the backdrop of a weighted increase to NHS tariff for the Group of 0.6% for the financial year, the average revenue per case for NHS admissions increased by 7.0% over 2015.
This was the result of a further concentration of case mix to higher yielding procedures notably in orthopaedics which supplemented the loss of lower yielding NHS local contract revenue.
Growth in in-patient and daycase rate contributed 5.7% to underlying NHS revenue growth in the year: and outpatient revenue increased both as a consequence of the increase in NHS admissions and the bias in growth towards NHS e-Referrals relative to NHS local contract work.
Most NHS local contract work does not include an out-patient element as the focus is often on access to Spire Healthcare surgical capacity.
Growth in out-patients revenue contributed 3.1% to underlying NHS revenue growth in the year.
The underlying revenue growth in NHS revenue is split as follows: NHS e-Referral previously NHS Choose and Book revenue grew by 16.9% in the year ended 31 December 2016: NHS local revenue grew by 1.5% in the same period.
Management had expected NHS local contract revenue to stabilise in 2016 following the decline experienced in 2015: and NHS e-Referrals revenue account for 79.8% of underlying NHS revenue in the year ended 31 December 2016, up from 77.4% in the prior year.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2016 29 STRATEGIC REPORT: GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW Self-pay In-patient In-patient daycase daycase million 2015 volume rate Out-patient 2016 Growth Underlying Self-pay revenue 155.7 7.9 4.6 2.2 170.4 9.4% Disposals 0.5 Total Self-pay revenue 156.2 170.4 9.1% Self-pay revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 increased by 14.2 million, or 9.1%, to 170.4 million 2015: 156.2 million.
Underlying growth, excluding revenue relating to Spire St Saviours Hospital, was 9.4%.
Of the underlying growth in Self-pay revenue of 9.4%: an increase of 7.4% in the volume of in-patient and daycase admissions accounted for a 5.0% increase in Self-pay revenue in the year: the average revenue per case for Self-pay in-patient and daycase admissions grew by 4.6% over the prior year, contributing 3.0% to the increase in Self-pay revenue in the year.
Price increases in 2016 were largely inflationary, with the balance of the increase in average rate per case arising from improved case mix complexity: and outpatient activities in 2016 grew in line with admissions while price increases were tempered in an attempt to drive demand.
Overall the increase in Self-pay outpatient revenue drove 1.4% of the 9.4% increase in underlying Self-pay revenue for the year.
Other revenue Other revenue, which includes fees paid to the Group by consultants e. g. for the use of Group facilities and services and third-party revenue e. g. pathology services to third-parties, increased by 1.5 million, or 4.7%, in the year, to 33.3 million 2015: 31.8 million.
Cost of sales and gross profit Cost of sales increased in the year by 25.9 million, or 5.6%, to 485.9 million 2015: 460.0 million.
Underlying cost of sales excluding Spire St Saviours Hospital increased in the year by 29.9 million, or 6.6%.
Underlying gross margin for the year of 2016 was 47.6%, compared with 48.1% in 2015.
On an underlying basis, and as a percentage of relevant revenue: Year ended 31 December 2016 2015 Clinical staff 18.9% 18.9% Direct costs 22.3% 21.6% Medical fees 11.3% 11.4% Cost of sales 52.5% 51.9% Trading losses for the year at Spire St Anthonys Hospital had a significant impact on overall cost of sales for the underlying Group.
Excluding Spire St Anthonys Hospital from the analysis provides the following comparison on an adjusted underlying basis and as a percentage of relevant revenue: Year ended 31 December 2016 2015 Clinical staff 18.3% 18.3% Direct costs 22.1% 21.7% Medical fees 11.4% 11.6% Cost of sales 51.8% 51.6% Overall the Group has substantially mitigated the impact on gross margin arising from the increase in the proportion of revenue derived from the NHS which has increased to 31.7% of total revenue in 2016 from 29.6% in 2015.
Despite supply-side constraints of nursing resource, clinical staff costs as a percentage of revenue were in line with the prior year.
Management is focused on continuous improvement of recruitment, training and development process in the business as well as rostering and productivity improvements designed to limit use of agency staff.
The impact on direct costs arising from the improvements in case mix complexity in 2016, which has driven growth in average revenue per case in both NHS and Self-pay revenue, has been largely offset by supply chain cost management initiatives.
30 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Other operating costs Other operating costs for the year ended 31 December 2016 increased by 17.4 million, or 5.3%, to 347.5 million 2015: 330.1 million.
Excluding exceptional items, other operating costs for the year increased by 17.9 million, or 5.7%, to 332.3 million.
Underlying other operating costs excluding Spire St Saviours Hospital increased in the year by 18.8 million, or 5.7%, to 347.5 million 2015: 328.7 million.
Excluding exceptional items, underlying other operating costs for the year increased by 19.3 million, or 6.2%, to 332.3 million.
Depreciation Excluding depreciation relating to Spire St Saviours Hospital, the underlying depreciation charge for the year increased by 3.6 million, or 7.5%, to 51.9 million 2015: 48.3 million.
Rent Rent of land and buildings for the year decreased by 0.2 million, or 0.3%, to 62.7 million 2015: 62.9 million.
The decrease is mainly due to low inflationary uplifts in relation to annual rent indexation in line with RPI and the closure of two clinics during the year.
Share-based payments During the year, grants were made to Executive Directors excluding the Executive Chairman and members of the senior leadership team under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the charge to the income statement was 0.4 million 2015: 0.7 million, or 0.6 million inclusive of National Insurance 2015: 0.8 million.
Further details are contained in note 26 on page 126 of the financial statements.
Exceptional items Year ended 31 December million 2016 2015 Business reorganisation 4.8 3.1 Write-off of intangible assets 1.3 Hospital set-up costs 1.0 Hospital reversal of impairment on property, plant and equipment 1.9 5.7 Hospital closure 0.1 6.9 Corporate restructuring 0.5 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment also referred to as the Asset Swap Transaction 8.9 Other 0.5 15.2 15.7 In the year ended 31 December 2016, business reorganisation costs mainly comprised staff restructuring costs and the closure costs relating to an onerous contract.
In the year, the Groups goodwill in relation to the Lifescan business was written-off following a strategic review and the closure of this operation.
Hospital set-up costs refer to pre-opening costs for the new Spire Manchester and Nottingham hospitals.
The reversal of the impairment is the result of the extension of the lives of medical and other equipment following the relocation of the assets from the previous Spire Manchester Hospital to the new hospital facility and other Group hospitals following its closure.
On 31 August 2016, as a result of the development of a new hospital facility in Manchester and the closure of the previous Spire Manchester Hospital previously held under an operating lease, the freehold interest in Spire Wirral Hospital with a net book value of 11.5 million was disposed of, and leased back in a sale and leaseback transaction.
The consideration for the sale was realised in the form of a non-cash asset, being the freehold of the previous Spire Manchester Hospital, which was simultaneously acquired by the Group the Asset Swap Transaction.
The overall loss on these transactions was 7.7 million before sale costs of 1.2 million.
Full details of exceptional items are disclosed in note 8 on page 116.
EBITDA and underlying EBITDA EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2016 increased by 1.9 million, or 1.2%, to 162.0 million 2015: 160.1 million.
Excluding the results of Spire St Saviours Hospital in 2015, underlying EBITDA increased by 1.4%, from 159.8 million to 162.0 million.
Within underlying EBITDA, Spire St Anthonys Hospital contributed an EBITDA profit of 5.0 million in 2015 and an EBITDA loss of 1.2 million in 2016, in part as a result of the significant physical reconfiguration of the site and the establishment of a new six theatre block in September 2016.
After adjusting for the performance of Spire St Anthonys Hospital, the balance of the underlying Group reported growth in EBITDA of 5.4%, from 154.8 million in 2015 to 163.2 million on comparable revenue growth of 5.8%.
Net finance costs Net finance costs decreased by 6.2% to 19.8 million 2015: 21.1 million as a result of increased finance costs capitalised in the year in relation to the Groups development of the new Spire Manchester and Spire Nottingham hospitals.
Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2016 31 STRATEGIC REPORT: GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW Taxation The taxation charge for the year ended 31 December 2016 consisted of a 2.5 million charge for corporation tax and a charge of 17.1 million for deferred tax.
The effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 26.8% before exceptional and other items 13.3%.
The effective tax rate of 13.3% is mainly due to the UK Governments announcement of a further decrease in the future UK corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% from April 2020.
This change has resulted in a deferred tax credit arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax liabilities to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those liabilities are expected to reverse in the future.
The difference in the effective tax rates is mainly due to the Groups review of its deferred tax approach on freehold properties discussed further below.
The taxation charge for the year ended 31 December 2015 consisted of a 7.9 million charge for corporation tax and a charge of 5.7 million for deferred tax.
The effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 was 18.5% before exceptional costs 18.3%.
Year ended 31 December million 2016 2015 Tax on profit before tax 19.6 13.6 Tax on exceptional items 0.6 2.7 Reassessment of property timing differences 8.4 Adjusted tax charge on the profit for the year 11.8 16.3 During the year, the Group considered it to be appropriate to reassess the basis for calculating deferred tax on the property portfolio and has now based the assessment on solely held-in-use basis.
This gives rise to a material tax charge and is excluded from tax on underlying profit.
Profit after taxation The profit after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 53.6 million 2015: 60.0 million.
