22 DIAGEO Annual Report 2016 Group financial review GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW This is a good set of results and reflects better execution across the business.
Our improved performance was driven by the return to growth of each of our six global brands and our US spirits business.
The delivery of volume growth: 19bps of organic margin expansion: increased free cash flow: and the disposal of 1 billion in non-core assets, comes from driving efficiency in every aspect of the business and across every expense item to fuel future growth.
I believe this consistent approach to growth, productivity and cash will drive better value creation.
