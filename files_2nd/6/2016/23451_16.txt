Financial Review Net asset value per share total return was 35% for the year to September 2016 37% before the termination payment.
This follows the 25% NAV total return in the year to September 2015.
These excellent results continue the good long term performance of Electra with total NAV returns over the last ten years of 14% per annum.
Analysis of Movement in Net Asset Value per share The Consolidated Income Statement on page 69 of the Report shows the total return for the year and, together with dividends of 122p per ordinary share paid during the year, explains the movement in NAV per share for the year to 30 September 2016.
Performance from the investment portfolio was particularly strong and contributed 1,856p per share, 47% of the opening NAV per share.
Deducted from this, as shown below, were finance, operating costs and tax, which together totalled 45p per share: the priority profit share paid to Epiris for managing the portfolio amounted to 72p per share: and the charge for incentive schemes amounted to 303p per share see further detail below.
In addition, there is a provision for the estimated cost of the termination payment which will be payable to Epiris at the end of their notice period in May 2017, this amounts to 79p per share.
Dividends of 122p per share were paid in the year.
This resulted in an increase to net assets of 1,235p per share, a total return adding back the dividends paid of 35% for the year.

Currently, there are four pools in relation to the three-year periods commencing 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2015.
The carried interest schemes are described in more detail in Note 21 on pages 96 to 99.
The carried interest provision has increased from 132 million to 243 million in the year to 30 September 2016.
The charge for the year of 122 million, 303p per share, results from the strong investment performance delivered this year and at the year-end is unpaid.
Actual cash paid in respect of carried interest this year was 3 million.
Over 90% of the provision relates to the 2009 and 2012 pools.
The former requires 73 million of further realisations before any carried interest will become payable and the latter 139 million.
At 31 May 2017, when the contract with Epiris terminates, any provision, on post 2006 Pools, which is unpaid at that date and any future uplift to them will be reduced by 20% which will revert back to the Company.
At 30 September 2016 the value of 20% of the carried interest schemes which are affected in this way was 47 million.

This means the actual accrual rate is just over 16% which results in the increase in the provision of 303p per share.
Net Liquid Resources The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 74 analyses the movement in the Groups cash for the year.
Cash on the Balance Sheet has increased by 512 million to 659 million.
Cash inflows were in the main related to sales of investments and investment income, which yielded approximately 900 million in cash, over three times the amount realised in the previous year.
The major constituents of the cash outflows were investments of 218 million, operating and finance costs of approximately 39 million, 73 million for the redemption of the Zero Dividend Preference shares and 49 million for the two dividends paid in the year.
Against this, Electra has the following commitments: payment of the proposed 200 million share buyback: payment of a second interim dividend of 110p per ordinary share 44 million, as declared by the Board: financing of committed and other investments: and payment of the termination payment.
Accordingly, it is expected that free cash, after taking the above into account together with investment disposals previously announced, will be approximately 410 million.
66 Electra Private Equity PLC | Report and Accounts 2016 Gearing At 30 September 2016 Electra was ungeared at the group level.
The 275 million multicurrency bank facility remained undrawn throughout the year and was cancelled on 14 June 2016, resulting in the write off of the deferred arrangement fees of approximately 3 million.
As previously reported, the Company exercised its right to a Mandatory Conversion of all of the outstanding 5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds into new ordinary shares, with the conversion taking place on 29 December 2015.
During the year, 85,369 Bonds in aggregate were converted into 4,215,593 new ordinary shares.
As a result, 73 million of Balance Sheet debt was retired, 10 million of future finance costs saved and a simplification of the Companys Balance Sheet and accounting requirements achieved.
As originally anticipated, the conversion of the Bonds required the transfer of the remaining special reserve to revenue reserves and accordingly, in this year an amount of 8 million was transferred.
Further details are to be found in Note 17 on pages 82 to 83.
The Final Capital Entitlement of the ZDP shareholders was paid in full in August 2016 as required by the terms of the original issue.
The cost of repayment was 73 million in aggregate.
More detail can be found in Note 16 on page 82.
FX At 30 September 2016, the estimated foreign currency exposure, was 263 million and $175 million based on the currency of underlying securities in the investment portfolio.
As such, given the weakness of sterling during the year, Electra has benefitted from its exposure to these long positions.
The Euro and US Dollar have strengthened against Sterling by 14% and 14% respectively during the year, resulting in a 46 million gain in respect of the investment portfolio.
This is shown as part of the net gain of 756 million in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The 12 million Loss on revaluation of foreign currencies shown in the Consolidated Income Statement relates to the revaluation of intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
The 15 million movement in translation reserves in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income arises from translation of opening shareholders capital in relation to certain overseas subsidiaries.
