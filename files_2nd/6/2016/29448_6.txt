FINANCIAL REVIEW The Financial Statements for the Group for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 m 26 April 2015 m Revenue 2,904.3 2,832.6 Underlying EBITDA 381.4 383.2 Underlying Profit Before Tax 275.2 300.3 Reported Profit Before Taxation 361.8 313.4 Pence per share Pence per share Reported EPS 46.8 40.6 Underlying EPS 35.5 38.9 The Directors believe that underlying EBITDA, underlying profit before tax and underlying EPS provide more useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance of the business than the reported numbers and are consistent with how business performance is measured internally.
They are not recognised profit measures under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies.
EBITDA is earnings before investment income, finance income and finance costs, tax, depreciation and amortisation and, therefore, includes the Groups share of profit from associated undertakings and joint ventures.
Underlying EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA before the impact of foreign exchange, any exceptional or other non-trading items and costs relating to the Share Schemes.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE The Group manages the impact of currency movements through the use of forward fixed rate currency purchase and sales contracts.
The Groups strategy is to hold or hedge up to five years of anticipated Euro denominated sales and US Dollar purchases.
Following the outcome of the EU referendum, we are aware of the associated market volatility and in particular material changes to sterling dollar and sterling Euro exchange rates, and the lack of transparency as to how those rates will move in the short to medium term.
These factors are likely to impact US Dollar purchases and therefore profitability for which the Company is currently not hedged for the FY17 period and beyond.
There is also a potential exposure in relation to the Euro forward sales contracts and written option arrangements that the Group is party to although we would highlight that the contracted rates on the forward contracts are favourable to underlying Euro sterling rates experienced during FY16.
As at 24 April 2016 the Group was party to 840m of Euro forward sales contracts that qualify for hedge accounting and 840m of written currency option contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The contracted forward rates for these instruments are shown in the notes to the financial statements.
The forward contracts will be covered by our forecast Euro denominated online sales over the four year period of cover in place.
Sales that we make over and above the covered amount, and existing surplus Euros within the business will mitigate the risk associated with the written currency options.
If sterling depreciates by 10% against the Euro, a fair value loss of 65m would be recognised in the income statement in relation to these option contracts.
The realised exchange loss of 2.3m FY15: 3.7m loss included in administration costs has arisen from: a accepting dollars and Euros at the contracted rate: and b the translation of dollar and Euro denominated assets and liabilities at the period end rate or date of realisation.
The exchange loss of 6.8m FY15: 7.2m gain included in finance costs substantially represents the increase in the mark-to-market liability made under IFRS for the Groups unhedged written option contracts as at 24 April 2016.
A number of the forward contracts outstanding at 24 April 2016 qualify for hedge accounting and the fair value loss on these contracts has been debited to equity through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The sterling exchange rate with the US Dollar was $1.502 at 26 April 2015 and $1.440 at 24 April 2016.
The sterling exchange rate with the Euro was 1.392 at 26 April 2015 and 1.283 at 24 April 2016.
25 Given the potential impact of commodity prices on raw material costs, the Group may hedge certain input costs, including cotton, crude oil and electricity.
FINANCE COSTS 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 m 26 April 2015 m Interest on bank loans and overdrafts 7.5 6.7 Interest on other loans 0.6 0.2 Interest on retirement benefit obligations 0.4 0.6 Fair value adjustment to written currency option contracts 6.8 - 15.3 7.5 The increase in interest payable is a result of the increased use of the Revolving Credit Facility.
The fair value adjustment to written currency option contracts relates to differences between the fair value of the written options that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 m 26 April 2015 m Profit on sale of freehold properties 13.5 10.3 Provision against receivables and other 5.8 - Impairment and accelerated depreciation and amortisation 58.5 13.3 Total Exceptional Items 50.8 3.0 The profit on disposal of freehold property relates to the sale of a freehold property for 44m, realising a profit of 13.5m.
In the prior year, the profit on disposal related to the sale of a warehouse.
The impairment mainly relates to goodwill in our Austrian business, reported within our Sports Retail segment, due to recent trading being below expectations.
Converting the former Eybl megastores is taking longer than expected and the lost revenue in certain categories is also proving harder to replace than expected.
Other impairments relate to certain brands that had been acquired a number of years ago.
The provision against receivables mainly relates to a funding loan made to an associate on acquisition of the initial stake.
FINANCIAL REVIEW Continued TAXATION The effective tax rate on profit before tax in FY16 was 22.9% FY15: 23.0%.
This rate reflects depreciation on non-qualifying assets and overseas earnings being taxed at a higher rate than the UK corporate tax rate.
EARNINGS 52 weeks ended 24 April 2016 26 April 2015 Change % pence per share pence per share Reported EPS Basic 46.8 40.6 15.3 Underlying EPS 35.5 38.9 8.7 Weighted average number of shares actual 592, 573,254 592, 294,371 Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the actual financial period.

CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT Net debt increased by 39.9m from 59.7m at 26 April 2015 to 99.6m at 24 April 2016.
The analysis of debt at 24 April 2016 was as follows: 24 April 2016 m 26 April 2015 m Cash and cash equivalents 233.7 78.3 Borrowings 333.4 138.0 Net debt 99.6 59.7 During the year the Group utilised the accordion option under its 688m Revolving Credit Facility RCF.
As a result, the RCF has been increased from 738m to 788m.
The facility is available until September 2018 and is not secured against any of the Groups fixed assets.
Under the terms of the RCF, the interest rate payable by the Group increases if it is more than one third drawn i. e. more than 263m.
Previously, when the Group has required borrowing in excess of this amount, it had utilised its 250m loan facility MALF with Mike Ashley Mash Holdings Limited.
The rate of interest payable on this facility was c. 50% lower than that payable on the RCF, and did not attract arrangement fees or commitment fees.
Accordingly, although an unusual arrangement for a public company, using this facility in this way was a significant benefit to the Group, over time giving rise to a saving of over 1m.
Further to the Companys announcement on 26 February 2016, the MALF has not been renewed.
The Group continues to operate well within its banking covenants and the Board remains comfortable with the Groups available headroom.
27 CASH FLOW Total movement is as follows: 24 April 2016 m 26 April 2015 m Underlying EBITDA 381.4 383.2 Realised loss profit on forward foreign exchange contracts 2.4 3.7 Taxes paid 69.9 77.7 Underlying free cash flow 309.1 301.8 Invested in:- Movement in inventory 155.4 49.3 Working capital and other 88.0 114.1 Purchase of own shares - - Acquisitions including debt 33.1 3.8 Net proceeds from investments 92.1 4.1 Net capital expenditure 163.1 79.1 Finance costs and other financing activities 1.5 5.9 Decrease Increase in net debt 39.9 152.3 The increase in working capital is partly to support the growth of Sports Retail and the online business and partly due to the timing of payments around year end.
PENSIONS The Group operates a number of closed defined benefit schemes in the Dunlop Slazenger companies and a defined benefit scheme in Sport Eybl Holding GmbH.
The net deficit in these schemes decreased from 14.9m at 26 April 2015 to 13.1m at 24 April 2016.
