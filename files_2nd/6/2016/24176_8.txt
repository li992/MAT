Revenue from Cash Solutions was up 18.8% on 2015 and from Secure Solutions was up 4.1% on 2015.
PBITA of continuing businesses of 454m 2015: 414m was up 9.7%.
This growth reflects the strong performance of the Group in developed markets, improved product mix and the results of our on-going productivity programmes.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2016 G4S plc 33 Chief Financial Officers review continued a Reconciliation of previously reported underlying results to re-presented results from continuing businesses The table below reconciles underlying revenue and PBITA as reported previously to the re-presented prior year revenue and PBITA from continuing businesses.
See basis of preparation on page 32. b.
During 2016 we determined that we would exit a further 10 of our businesses, including G4S Israel, UK Utility Services, US Youth Services and UK Childrens Services.
We have therefore reported the results of these businesses in portfolio businesses in 2016 and have restated the 2015 results accordingly.
c. During 2016, for 14 of the businesses previously reported as portfolio businesses, management focus and changing market conditions have resulted in improved performance and we have formally concluded that we will retain these businesses.
We have therefore reported the results of these businesses in continuing businesses in 2016 and have restated the 2015 results accordingly.
d. Operating cash flow is stated after pension deficit contributions of 44m and is shown at actual 2015 exchange rates.
Interest Net interest payable on net debt from continuing businesses was 92m 2015: 93m.
The pension interest charge was 10m 2015: 12m resulting in a total interest cost of 102m 2015: 105m.
34 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Tax A tax charge of 84m 2015: 74m was incurred on the profits of continuing businesses of 352m 2015: 309m which represents an effective tax rate of 24% 2015: 24%.
The effective tax rate for continuing businesses is a function of a variety of factors, with the most significant being i the geographic mix of its taxable profits and the respective country tax rates, ii the recognition of, and changes in the value of, deferred tax assets, iii permanent differences such as expenses disallowable for tax purposes and iv irrecoverable withholding taxes.
During the year, the Group recognised additional deferred tax assets of 72m of which 40m arose through the tax charge on continuing businesses, relating to previously unrecognised brought forward tax losses.
The timing of recognition of the tax losses as additional deferred tax assets in 2016 is supported by the improved taxable profit profile of the relevant Group companies, which itself is underpinned by the continuing progress of the Groups transformation strategy to generate future sustainable, profitable growth.
At any point in time, the Group is typically subject to tax audits in a number of different countries.
In situations where a difference of opinion arises between the Group and a local tax authority in respect of its tax filings, the Group will debate the contentious areas and, where necessary, resolve them through negotiation or litigation.
The Group relies upon advice and opinions from the Group tax department, local finance teams and external advisors to ensure that appropriate judgments are arrived at in establishing the appropriate accounting provisions in relation to such disputes.
In December 2016, as part of its response to the OECDs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, the UK Government released draft legislation in respect of new rules to: i restrict the deductibility of net interest costs to a percentage of EBITDA and ii restrict the amount of taxable profits available to offset against carried forward tax losses to 50% of the available profits.
Both of these proposals will take effect from 1 April 2017.
Management is monitoring the progress of this draft legislation and assessing its possible impacts on the Group, which may result in a modest increase in the effective tax rate on future profits of continuing businesses.
Non-controlling interests Profit from continuing businesses attributable to non-controlling interests was 22m in 2016, a decrease from 24m for 2015, reflecting a lower level of profitabilityof certain businesses in the Middle East & India region resulting in a decrease in the share of profit accruing to non-controlling partners.
Profit for the year continuing businesses The Group produced profit from continuing businesses attributable to equity holders continuing earnings of 246m 2015: 211m, an increase of 16.6% for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Earnings per share continuing businesses Earnings per share from continuing businesses increased to 15.9p 2015: 13.7p, based on the weighted average of 1,546m 2015: 1,545m shares in issue.

In December2016 the UK Compass asylum seeker contract with the Home Office was extended by two years to August 2019.
Supplementary onerous contract provisions of a net 4m, primarily in respect of the Compass asylum seekers contract, were booked during 2016.
Portfolio operations The Group made further progress with its portfolio management programme and since 2013 has sold or is exiting 60 businesses with annualised revenues of c. 1.5bn and PBITA of 16m, based on the last full year when each of these businesses formed part of the Group.
This programme has greatly improved the Groups strategic focus and has also generated 345m in disposal proceeds in relation to the 29 businesses sold to date.
This includes the sale of 12 businesses this year in Finland, Kazakhstan, Brunei, Uzbekistan, Honduras, Thailand, Costa Rica and the UK, generating proceeds of 82m.
The Group also reached agreement for the sale of G4S Israel for 88m which is expected to complete in the next few months.
Restructuring costs The Group invested 12m 2015: 47m in restructuring programmes during the year, relating to the multi-year strategic productivity programme which is being implemented across the Group.
In addition, the Group incurred non-strategic reorganisation costs of 9m 2015: 10m which are included within PBITA of continuing businesses.

Net specific items Specific items of a net 13m 2015: 73m included a 10m charge due to the revision of estimates relating to legacy acquisitions and labour claims in Latin America, 7m relating to commercial restructuring in Middle East & India, and a net 4m supplementary onerous contract provision primarily in respect of the Compass asylum seekers contract, all offset by an 8m credit mainly relating to the recovery of a legal claim in Europe and of certaindisputed debtor balances in the UK.
Profit on disposal and closure of subsidiaries and goodwill impairment As part of the on-going portfolio programme, the Group realised a net profit on disposal closure of subsidiaries of 7m 2015: 13m relating to the disposal of a number of the Groups operations including the Cash Solutions business in Thailand, the businesses in Finland, Brunei and Kazakhstan and the Utilities Services and ATM engineering businesses in the UK, together with a loss arising on closure of a systems business in Latin America.
The Group recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 9m 2015: 71m in relation to businesses that are to be sold or closed.
Non-controlling interests share of acquisition-related intangibles and other Statutory profit includes the non-controlling interests share of acquisition-related intangible and other charges of 4m 2015: 3m.
Including these items, statutory profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 19m in 2016 2015: 18m.
Profit for the year statutory at actual historical exchange rates The Group reported statutory earnings of 198m 2015: 8m mainly driven by improved operating profit and lower charges for specific items, restructuring and goodwill impairment.
Earnings per share statutory at actual historical exchange rates Statutory earnings per share increased to 12.8p 2015: 0.5p, based on the weighted average of 1,546m 2015: 1,545m shares in issue.

Operating cash flow from continuing businesses increased to 638m 2015: 395m, reflecting higher operating profits and enhanced working capital management.
The Group invested 107m 2015: 104m in net capital expenditure and received proceeds of 82m 2015: 14m from the disposal of businesses.
The Group made no significant acquisitions during the year.
Net cash inflow after investing in the business and proceeds from portfolio rationalisation was 567m 2015: 222m.
The Groups net cash inflow after investing in the business, financing, tax, dividends and pensions was 222m 2015: outflow of 107m.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2016 G4S plc 37 Chief Financial Officers review continued Net debt The Groups net debt as at 31 December 2016 was 1,670m December 2015: 1,782m.
The Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.8x 2015: 3.4x.
The movement in net debt during the year included an increase of 110m 2015: 36m arising from foreign exchange translation differences relating to the Groups debt held in foreign currencies, mainly US dollars and euros, in particular as a result of the exchange rate movements since June 2016.
The Groups business plan and current performance supporta net debt EBITDA of 2.5x or lower by the end of 2017.
Net debt maturity In August 2016 the Groups credit rating was affirmed by Standard & Poors as BBBnegative.
As of 31 December 2016 the Group had liquidity of 1,692m including cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts of 692m and unutilised but committed facilities of 1bn.
In August 2016 the Group put in place a new 600m bank facility to provide additional liquidity but this facility was subsequently cancelled following the successful issue of a new 500m Eurobond in November 2016.
The bond matures in January 2023 and pays an annual coupon of 1.5%.
The next debt maturities are $200m of US Private Placement debt maturing March 2017 and a 600m Eurobond maturing in May 2017.
The Group has good access to capital markets and a diverse range of finance providers.
Borrowings are principally in pounds sterling, US dollars and euros, reflecting the geographies of significant operational assets and earnings.
For fair value carrying amount see note 31. b.
Exchange rates at 31 December 2016 or hedged exchange rates where applicable.
964m of the original 1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility matures in January 2022 with the remainder maturing in January 2021.
As at 31 December 2016 there were no drawings from the facility.
The Groups average cost of gross borrowings in 2016, net of interest hedging, was 3.9% 2015: 4.0%.
Financing and treasury activities The Groups treasury function is responsible for ensuring the availability of cost-effective finance and for managing the Groups financial risk arising from currency and interest rate volatility and counterparty credit.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and it is not permitted to speculate in financial instruments.
The treasury departments policies are set by the board.
Treasury is subject to the controls appropriate to the risks it manages.
These risks are discussed in note 31 on pages 144 to 148.
To assist the efficient management of the Groups interest costs, the Group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an A-rated bank.
During the year the Group applied the new IFRIC interpretation on cash offsetting and as a result now presents cash and overdrafts within the pooling system gross in the statement of financial position.
38 G4S plc Integrated Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Significant exchange rates applicable to the Group The Group derives a significant portion of its revenue and profits in the currencies shown below, together with their respective closing and average rates: As at At 2016 At 2015 31 December average average 2016 rates rates US$ 1.2345 1.3558 1.5282 1.1705 1.2265 1.3795 South Africa Rand 16.9500 19.8742 19.5175 India Rupee 83.8670 91.0371 97.9690 Israel Shekel 4.7483 5.1912 5.9441 Brazil Real 4.0165 4.7252 5.1054 If December 2016 closing rates were applied to the results for the year to 31 December 2016, revenue from continuing businesses would have increased by 6.5% to 7,268m for the year ended 31 December 2015: by 6.6% to 6,842m and PBITA from continuing businesses would have increased by 6.6% to 484m for the year ended 31 December 2015: by 7.5% to 445m.
Dividend In assessing the dividend, the board considers: the future investment requirements of the continuing businesses: net debt to EBITDA: satisfying the Groups pension obligations: the availability of distributable reserves in the parent company: and reward to shareholders.
The directors recommend a final dividend of 5.82p DKK 0.5029 per share 2015: 5.82p per share: DKK 0.5615.
The interim dividend was 3.59p DKK 0.3143 per share and the total dividend, if approved, will be 9.41p DKK 0.8172 per share, consistent with 2015 2015, the interim dividend 3.59p: DKK 0.3793 and the total dividend 9.41p: DKK 0.9408.
The proposed dividend cover is 1.7x 2015: 1.5x on earnings from continuing businesses.
Whilst the boards intention is that dividends will increase broadly in line with those earnings over the medium term, at present dividends are being maintained at the same level year-on-year pending achievement of the Groups leverage reduction targets.
Other information Pensions As at 31 December 2016 the net defined benefit pension obligation in the Consolidated statement of financial position was 437m 2015: 279m or 368m net of tax 2015: 234m of which 341m 2015: 205m related to material funded defined benefit schemes.
The most significant of the Groups pension schemes is in the UK and accounts for over 73% 2015: 68% of the total material scheme obligations.
The scheme has approximately 30,000 members and further details of the make-up of the scheme are given in note 32 on page 150.
Defined benefit obligation UK scheme 2016 2015 m m Scheme assets 2,339 2,029 Obligations 2,659 2,218 Total UK obligations 320 189 The movement in the UK scheme obligation was a result of an increase of 310m in the value of scheme assets principally arising from an increase in underlying asset values, as well as an increase in the scheme obligations of 441m.
The increase in the obligations is mainly a result of the discount rate used for valuation purposes decreasing to 2.5% 2015: 3.8% and of the projected pension inflation rates increasing to 3.3% 2015: 3.1%.
The Group made additional pension contributions of 39m 2015: 44m into the scheme during the year.
Following strong investment performance in the G4S pension scheme at the end of the latest triennial valuation process, the trustees of G4Ss UK pension schemes agreed during the year a reduced annual pension deficit payment of 39m in 2016, with a 3% per annum increase until the next funding valuation due in 2018.
Integrated Report and Accounts 2016 G4S plc 39 Chief Financial Officers review continued Interest-rate risk and interest-rate swaps The Groups investments and borrowings at 31 December 2016 were a mix of fixed rates of interest and floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The private placement notes in March 2007 and July 2008 and the public notes in May 2009, May 2012, December 2012 and November 2017 were all issued at fixed rates, whilst the Groups investments and bank borrowings were all at variable rates of interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The Groups interest risk policy requires Treasury to fix a proportion of its interest exposure on a sliding scale in US dollars, sterling and euro, using the natural mix of fixed and floating interest rates emanating from the bond and bank markets and by utilising interest rate and cross-currency swaps.
Part of the proceeds of the private placement and public notes have been swapped to floating interest rates and accounted for as fair-value hedges, with a net gain at 31 December 2016 of 27m 2015: net gain 40m.
The market value of the pay-fixed receive-variable swaps and the pay-fixed receive-fixed cross-currency swaps outstanding at 31 December 2016, accounted for as cash-flow hedges, was a net assetof 31m 2015: net liability of 36m.
Foreign currency The Group has many overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, denominated in various different currencies.
Treasury policy is to manage significant translation risks in respect of net operating assets and its consolidated net debt EBITDA ratio by holding foreign currency denominated loans, where possible.
On occasion, the Group uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge the residual portion of net assets not hedged by way of loans.
At 31 December 2016, the Groups US dollar and Euro net assets were approximately 80% and 93% respectively, hedged by foreign currency loans.
As at 31 December 2016, net debt held in US dollar and Euro and in those currencies officially pegged to these two currencies, equated broadly to a ratio of 2.2x EBITDA generated from these currencies 2015: 2.5x EBITDA.
Tax policy The Groups policy in relation to tax is as follows: we manage our tax affairs responsibly and transparently: we only undertake tax planning which aligns with our commercial and economic activity: we endeavour to involve fully our tax team in all significant business developments so that we can assess fully any potential tax consequences of our actions in advance: we utilise tax incentives, reliefs and exemptions in line with tax legislation: in international matters, we follow the terms of the relevant Double Tax Treaties and OECD guidelines in dealing with such issues as transfer pricing and establishing tax presence: we actively seek open dialogue with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC and other tax authorities, in pursuit of a professional relationship of constructive compliance, with the aim of achieving early agreement on disputed items and obtaining certainty where possible: we provide all relevant information when requested to do so by HMRC or other tax authorities: if we discover errors in tax returns or correspondence with tax authorities, we disclose and correct them promptly: and we take an active role in contributing to the UK and international tax policy-making process, where relevant, including taking part in formal and informal consultations.
The Group operates in a large number of countries and is typically subject to tax in those jurisdictions.
The Group employs an in-house team of tax professionals who interface with the regional and country business and finance teams to manage the Groups tax risks in a controlled and proactive manner.
The complex international tax environment means that there is always an element of tax risk and uncertainty inherent within the Groups operations.
Group companies are routinely subject to tax audits which can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
As and when appropriate, the Group obtains advice from external professional firms to support its positions.
As a high-profile provider of public services, the Group considers it is important that we increase the publics understanding of tax matters and their trust in larger corporate groups by being transparent about our tax affairs and co-operating with the tax authorities.
By managing responsibly the Groups tax affairs in line with our tax policy, the Group is also adhering fully to the Confederation of British Industrys seven tax principles.
Corporate governance The Groups policies regarding risk management and corporate governance are set out in the Risk management section on pages 50 to 55 and in the Corporate governance report on pages 62 to 77.
