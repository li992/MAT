At 31 December 2016 the balance sheet had net assets of 398.8m, a movement of 116.7m from the closing net asset position of 282.1m as at 31 December 2015.
The increase in net assets is mainly due to the following movements: An increase in goodwill by 68.0m caused by movements in foreign exchange rates.
Total goodwill of 401.2m relates to non-UK cash generating units.
Further details on the provision balance is provided below.
An increase in trade and other current assets and liabilities of 45.4m due in part to the unwinding of the forfeiting facility of 22.3m and other working capital movements, including foreign exchange movements in non-UK businesses.
An increase in Net Debt of 46.4m due to the working capital movements noted above offset by cash generated from operations.
An increase in the assets reflecting the Groups retirement benefit obligations of 17.1m, due to the performance of liability driven investments.
Provisions The total of current and non-current provisions, excluding provisions related to businesses held for sale, has decreased by 60.0m since 31 December 2015.
The movement is due to a decrease in contract provisions of 81.9m offset by an increase in non-contract provisions of 21.9m.
The increase in non-contract provisions is primarily due to the provision for the exceptional defined benefit scheme settlement cost of 10.7m and an 8.7m increase in employee provisions due to the ongoing Strategic Review restructuring programme.
