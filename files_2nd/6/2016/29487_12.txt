CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REPORT DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY POLITICAL EVENTS As already covered in the Chief Executives Report the growth in gross and DURING THE YEAR, OUR BUSINESS net inflows, together with the investment return in our funds, gave rise to a 28% growth in our funds under management to 75.3 billion.
HAS PERFORMED STRONGLY, WITH GROWTH IN ALL THE BUSINESS Shareholders will be aware that our financial model is to attract and retain funds under management on which we will receive an annual management FUNDAMENTALS fee, and consequently this strong growth in funds under management is reflected in our financial results.
At the same time we are investing in the business for the future.
The increase in costs of these initiatives is also reflected in the results, but with an expectation of future returns for the business.
FINANCIAL RESULTS As shareholders will be aware from previous periods, we report our results on both IFRS and EEV bases, as well as providing further detail on the cash emergence from the business.
Detailed explanation and analysis of the results on these measures is provided in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 47.
Overall, the results reflect the underlying strong business performance over the year, but there are a number of particular factors which have also impacted the results: i.
Our required contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS was again at an elevated level, negatively impacting the results by 17.2 million pre-tax 13.7 million post-tax compared with a 20.1 million pre-tax 15.9 million post-tax for the prior year.
During the year we have continued to invest strongly in our Chief Financial future with a current year impact of 34.0 million pre-tax Officer 2015: 17.2 million pre-tax.
We are very pleased with the success of our Academy, and both the Asia operations and our new DFM offering, Rowan Dartington, are developing well.
The continuation of our back office infrastructure investment cost 20.9 million pre-tax for the year compared with 18.1 million for the prior year.
As noted at the half year we have been voluntarily reviewing charges on two small cohorts of business: waiving exit charges at the minimum retirement age where they existed on some older pension contracts written before July 1999 : and reassessing risk charges on a reviewable protection contract.
The combined impact of these actions is a negative one-off 8.2 million pre-tax in the cash and IFRS results, which rises to 13.6 million pre-tax in the EEV result when the reduction in future charges is also fully capitalised.
Also, at the end of the year, we have reassessed the value of the investment contract unit liability to better reflect recent experience and to match the encashment value of client investments.
This reassessment reduces the liability by 267 million, with an offsetting increase in the Deferred Income liability in the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position.
There is no impact on IFRS net assets or profit, nor will there be any impact on the emergence of profit in future years.
This change better reflects our business and we believe it will simplify reporting in future.
Where this change has any presentation impact on each of the reporting metrics, it is commented on in the relevant sections of the Financial Review.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 25 FINANCIAL REVIEW THE FINANCIAL MODEL The Groups strategy is to attract and retain retail Funds under Management FUM on which we receive an annual management fee for as long as the clients remain invested.
This is the principal source of income for the Group out of which we meet the overheads of the business, invest in growing the Partnership and invest in acquiring new FUM.
The level of income is dependent on the level of client funds and the level of asset values.
In addition, since around half of our business does not generate net income in the first six years, the level of income will increase as a result of new business from six years ago becoming cash generative.
This deferral of cash generation means the business always has six years worth of funds in the gestation period.
More information about our fees on Funds under Management can be found in Section 1 on page 30.
Group expenditure is carefully managed with clear targets set for growth in establishment expenses in the year.
Many other expenses increase with business levels and are met from margins in the products.
The Group also invests in ensuring the quality of our proposition for clients and Partners through investment in new client services and existing IT systems.
Finally, we are also looking to the future, with investment in strategic initiatives, including the Academy, Asia, DFM and our back office infrastructure programme.
More information about our expenses can be found in Section 2 on page 32.
A small proportion of Group expenditure is required to support management of existing funds, but the majority of expenditure is investment in growing the Partnership and acquiring new funds.
The resulting new business is expected to generate income for an average of 14 years, and is expected to provide a good return on the investment see page 30.
Given the importance of FUM to profit generation by the business, we provide an analysis of the FUM make up and development in Section 1.
Section 2 covers expenses, which is the other significant driver of profits, with Sections 3-5 reporting on the performance of the business on the IFRS, cash and EEV result bases, and providing commentary on solvency and liquidity.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT In line with statutory reporting requirements, we report profits assessed on an International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS basis.
However, given the long-term nature of the business and the high level of investment in new business generation each year, we believe the IFRS result does not provide an easy guide to the cash likely to emerge in future years, nor does it reflect the total economic value of the business.
Therefore, consistent with last year, we complement IFRS reporting with additional disclosure on various alternative performance measures APMs.
APMs are not defined by the relevant financial reporting framework which for the Group is IFRS, but we use them to provide greater insight to the financial performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group and the way it is managed.
Summary information about the key APMs used in our Financial Review is provided in the following table, and we also provide a complete Glossary of Alternative Performance Measures on page 199, in which we define each APM and explain why it is used and, if applicable, how the measure can be reconciled to the IFRS financial statements.

Due to the retail distribution review RDR regulation change in 2013, there was a step change in the progression of these items in our financial statements, which resulted in significant accounting presentation changes despite the fundamentals of our vertically integrated business remaining unchanged.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information SECTION 1: FUNDS UNDER MANAGEMENT This section starts with analysis of the movement in the funds under management of the Group.
This is followed by information about the income the Group earns from managing these funds, together with the profile of these earnings, and finally a geographical and segmental analysis of the funds under management.
Movement in Funds Under Management During 2016 we have seen gross new funds of 11.35 billion 2015: 9.24 billion, growth of 23% and a net inflow of funds under management of 6.78 billion 2015: 5.78 billion, growth of 17%.
The investment return contributed 8.7 billion 2015: 0.8 billion contribution to funds under management during the year with this contribution reflecting both the higher stock markets but also the positive impact of the deprecation of Sterling on the overseas assets.
Given the strong net inflow, and the positive investment performance, funds under management increased to 75.31 billion 2015: 58.61 billion.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 29 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Fees on Funds Under Management As noted at the start of this Financial Review, our financial model is to attract and retain retail funds under management FUM on which we receive an annual management fee.
The net annual management fee retained by the Group is c. 0.77% post-tax.
However, due to our product structure, investment and pension business does not generate net cash in the first six years.
Consequently, the level of income we are receiving today is not fully representative of the expected earnings from the funds we are managing, and these earnings will increase as a result of the new business from six years ago becoming cash generative.
This deferral of cash generation means there is always six years worth of business in the gestation period.
The table below provides an estimated current value of the funds under management in the gestation period: Year Total Total Billion Billion 2010 2.0 2011 2.4 2.4 2012 2.9 2.7 2013 4.0 3.7 2014 4.4 3.9 2015 5.3 4.5 2016 6.1 Total 25.1 19.2 This 25.1 billion of funds under management in the gestation period represents approximately a third of the total funds under management which, if all the business reached the end of the gestation period, would contribute some 195 million to the annual post-tax cash result.
The Business Case for New Funds Under Management The Group incurs costs associated with attracting new funds.
We believe it is useful to provide details of the economic return we expect will be generated from the new business: in other words, the business case for the investment in attracting new clients and funds under management.
As detailed later in this review on page 41, a net cost of 106.7 million 2015: 84.2 million has been incurred to attract the 11.35 billion of gross new funds 2015: 9.24 billion.
We regard this as an investment in new business which we expect to generate income in the future, significantly exceeding this cost and therefore provide positive returns for shareholders.
The table below provides details of the new business added during the reporting periods and different measures of valuing the investment: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Gross inflows Billion 11.35 9.24 Post-tax investment in new business Million Operating costs 80.2 70.7 Investment costs 26.5 13.5 Total costs 106.7 84.2 Post-tax present value of expected profit from investment Million 427.8 358.9 Cost of new business % of new money invested 1.0% 0.9% New business margin % of new money invested 4.6% 4.8% Cash payback period years 5 5 Internal rate of return net of tax 21.7% 22.1% The investment as a percentage of net inflow of funds under management was 1.6% compared with 1.5% for 2015.

Establishment costs are the running costs of the Groups infrastructure and are relatively fixed in nature in the short term, although they are subject to inflationary increases.
These costs will increase as the infrastructure expands to manage the higher number of existing clients, the growing number of advisers and increasing business volumes.
The growth in the establishment expenses during the year was higher than our targeted growth due to the very strong new business result together with above target growth in new advisers, a primary driver to the infrastructure costs.
We expect the growth in the establishment costs for 2017 to be more in line with our medium term business targets.
Other performance related costs, for both Partners and employees, vary with the level of new business and operating profit performance of the business.
Operational development costs represent business as usual expenditure to support the business, such as the on-going development of our investment proposition and our technology, including focus on cyber security.
We expect costs in 2017 to be at a similar level.
As a growth business we are constantly looking to new opportunities and expect to incur a small level of ongoing expense associated with pursuing other strategic developments.
We will continue to explore opportunities and undertake appropriate initiatives.
The Academy is an important strategic investment for the future and we are continuing to grow our investment in this programme.
Costs have increased in recent years as we have increased the number of students within the programme and launched more regional academies.
Our investment in the Academy will continue in 2017 with expected costs of some 8.0 million.
Our expansion into Asia through operations in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai is intended to provide diversification of our growth model through exporting our successful wealth management proposition to new markets, starting with the UK expat market.
Costs reflect both the ongoing operational costs, but also the development costs associated with growing these businesses to achieve sustainable scale.
We have also seen these costs increase due to the depreciation of Sterling.
Our investment will continue in 2017 and we expect this investment cost to increase by 3-4 million.
Completion of the purchase of Rowan Dartington in March 2016 facilitated a new DFM operation within the SJP proposition.
We expect this business will grow quickly, requiring investment to support these ambitions.
Our back office infrastructure programme is a multi-year initiative to upgrade our administration so it can support our future business goals.
Having achieved the migration of our ISA and Unit Trust proposition to our new Bluedoor system in 2015, the focus in 2016 has been the launch of a new retirement account with the eventual aim being to migrate pension and drawdown business onto the new system.
The costs in 2017 will be at a similar level to 2016.
The costs of operating in a regulated sector include fees charged by the regulators and our contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Our position as a market leading provider of advice, means we make a very substantial contribution to supporting the industry compensation scheme, the FSCS, thereby providing protection for clients of other sector businesses that fail.
In the last couple of years, the levy has been at an elevated level and we remain hopeful that it will return to a more normalised level in future, albeit we now expect a third year of an elevated contribution in the 2017 18 funding year.
The FSCS levy is met by our various regulated companies and is split 16.5 million 2015: 19.8 million via the Distribution business and 0.7 million 2015: 0.3 million via the Life and Unit Trust regulated business.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information Group Expenses The table below provides a reconciliation from the management expenses above to the total Group expenses included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 127: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December Note 2016 2015 Million Million Expenses per table above 368.6 313.6 Payments to Partners 10 599.7 518.5 Investment expenses 10, 11 67.9 143.5 Third party administration 10, 12 74.2 56.6 Acquired IFA operating costs 3.1 3.0 Amortisation and revaluation of DAC and PVIF 63.4 76.0 Share option costs 23.9 15.7 Share option NI 1.9 3.4 Interest expense and bank charges 6.2 6.0 Charitable donations 3.4 3.5 Other 12.8 10.3 856.5 836.5 Total expenses 1,225.1 1,150.1 Notes 10.
These costs are met from corresponding margins and any variation in them from changes in the volumes of new business or the level of the stock markets does not directly impact the profitability of the Group.
As noted in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, in preparation for migration of business to the Bluedoor platform, we restructured our funds so that Investment expenses of all unit trusts are charged directly to the trust rather than some being settled by the manager or life company.
As a result, the Investment expenses for most funds are no longer consolidated in the financial statements, but neither is the equal and offsetting fee, resulting in a neutral profit impact overall and a neutral impact on clients.
Also as noted in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, as a result of the migration of business to a new back office platform, a new administration tariff with our outsourced provider now applies to business transacted.
Consequently, some administration costs which were previously charged to the trusts are now being treated as expenses, with a corresponding offsetting increase in fee income, again resulting in a neutral impact overall.
As a result, the Third Party Administration costs reported in 2016 increased by c. 10% in addition to the growth in business.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 33 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued SECTION 3: INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS As noted at the start of this review, two key measures based on IFRS are Profit before shareholder tax, which removes the impact of policyholder tax, and Underlying profit result, which removes the impact of changes in certain intangibles DAC DIR PVIF.
Of these two, we believe Underlying profit provides the more useful measure, based on IFRS, for assessing operating performance.
As noted in the Chief Financial Officers report, the results reflect the underlying strong business performance, but also a number of other drivers, most notably including the FSCS levy and the continued investment in our business not least our back office infrastructure, the Academy, and recent acquisitions.

A breakdown by segment is provided in the following table: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Million Million Life business 165.8 174.2 Unit Trust and DFM business 92.3 70.7 Funds management business 258.1 244.9 Distribution business 25.9 21.2 Back office infrastructure development 20.9 18.1 Other 47.8 41.9 Underlying profit before shareholder tax 163.5 163.7 34 St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Registered No.
03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information Funds management The profit for the year to 31 December 2016 was 258.1 million 2015: 244.9 million which was 5% higher than the prior year.
Higher income from funds under management was partially offset by higher expenses and some one-off costs from reviewing charges in two small cohorts of legacy business.
The investment in the infrastructure of Rowan Dartington for future growth reduced profit by 5.1 million.
Finally, a reallocation of expenses between Life and Unit Trust business has impacted the respective results of each business.
Distribution business St. Jamess Place is a vertically integrated firm, allowing it to benefit from the synergies of combining funds management with distribution.
Therefore, as well as the income generated on the funds under management, there is a further margin from the distribution activity, which depends principally on the levels of new business, expenses and investment.
The 2016 result has been negatively impacted by a continued, albeit slightly reduced year-on-year, high contribution to the FSCS, which for the year was 16.5 million 2015: 19.8 million.
The Asian business also made a loss in the year of 13.2 million 2015: 7.0 million reflecting the corporate investment in securing this business.
After adjusting for these costs in both years, there was a trading profit of 3.8 million in the current year which was similar to the trading profit of 5.6 million in 2015.
Back office development As noted on page 32 our investment in our back office development project known as Bluedoor during the year was 20.9 million 2015: 18.1 million.
Other Other operations made a negative contribution of 47.8 million 2015: negative contribution of 41.9 million.
The largest contributors to the result were the costs of share options and the impact of strategic investment other than the back office development identified separately above.
The higher share option cost of 23.9 million in the current year 2015: 15.7 million principally reflected a full year expense of the new Partner share scheme which was launched in the second half of 2015.
Additionally, National Insurance associated with share options cost 1.9 million in the year 2015: 3.4 million.
In 2016 investment in RD and Asia have been allocated above, but other strategic development costs, including the Academy, were 15.7 million compared to 10.2 million in 2015 see Section 2 on page32 for more detail on the associated expenses.
Finally, our maturity grant and other contributions to the Foundation totalled 3.7 million in 2016 2015: 3.8 million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 35 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued DAC, DIR and PVIF The net movement in the DAC, DIR and PVIF intangibles has a negative contribution to profit as summarised in the table below.
Additional analysis is included in Note 8 on page 147.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 2016 31 December 2015 Before Before shareholder shareholder tax After tax tax After tax Million Million Million Million Amortisation 4.5 3.4 12.4 9.9 Tax rate change 2.1 5.9 Arising on new business 18.4 15.5 24.8 20.6 Movement in year 22.9 16.8 12.4 4.8 The net impact of amortisation of the accumulated balances of DAC and PVIF assets, and DIR liability has, as expected, reduced again during the period, turning negative compared with the prior year.
The amortisation pattern of DAC and DIR is different, with the DAC balance amortising steadily over 14 years while a substantial proportion of the DIR balance will amortise over six years.
Historically this has resulted in faster deferred income recognition than acquisition expense accrual, and a positive impact overall from amortisation.
However, since the implementation of RDR in 2013 the level of new DAC and DIR has reduced significantly and the large historic balances have been unwinding down towards the new normal.
The faster amortisation of DIR means that its trend towards a new lower rate has been quicker, causing the net amortisation level to reduce and ultimately turn negative, which developing effect can also be seen in Note 8.
Previous guidance stated this reducing trend would continue until the pre RDR DIR balance had unwound over six years, say 2020, at which point the net amortisation level would stabilise before starting to increase back towards a new long-term level as the pre RDR DAC balance unwinds by 14 years, say 2028.
However, the reassessment of 267 million of investment contract liability at the end of 2016 has re-established a significant DIR balance, which will amortise over the next six years.
We therefore expect a change in the overall amortisation in 2017 to a positive 30-35 million before shareholder tax.
The equivalent in 2016 would have been c. 50 million before shareholder tax and c. 40 million after tax, which reflect an increase of c. 55 million before shareholder tax and c. 45 million after tax.
For clarity, there is no change in expected pattern of DAC amortisation.
At the same time, the revised assessment of investment contact liability results in a change in the income deferred from future new business.
If the revised approach was applied to business in 2016 the impact would have been an increase in new DIR of c. 90 million c. 70 million after tax, taking the total negative impact from new business to around 110 million before shareholder tax and c. 90 million after tax.
In future years we would expect this negative contribution to move in line with new business growth albeit reflecting business mix impacts.
Overall, and since our business has been growing, we expect that the negative impact of deferring more income from new business will exceed the positive impact of amortising the historic balances, meaning the DAC DIR PVIF adjustment will be more negative in future.
But of course this will simply offset the equal and opposite positive impact we are expecting in the Cash result see page 41.
Tax rate changes in both years impacted the post-tax movements.
Finally, it is important to note the intangible and deferred nature of these items, meaning that they do not reflect the operating performance of the business.
This is why we believe the Underlying profit measure, which is adjusted from IFRS to remove these impacts, provides a useful measure of operating performance.
36 St. Jamess Place plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Registered No.
03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information Shareholder Tax The actual tax rate in each of the periods may be impacted by significant one-off items and events such as a change in corporation tax rate.
The table below provides a high level analysis of shareholder tax, and a more detailed analysis is included in Note 7.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Million Million Expected shareholder tax 27.2 29.2 Recognition of capital losses 2.2 74.8 Other tax adjustments 2.6 0.6 Corporation tax rate change 1.3 4.5 Actual shareholder tax 28.9 50.7 Expected shareholder tax rate 19.3% 19.3% Actual shareholder tax rate 20.6% 33.5% The expected shareholder tax principally reflects the current UK corporation tax and overseas rates applicable and will vary from year to year depending upon the emergence of profit between the different tax regimes which apply to the St. Jamess Place Group companies.
There has been a small reassessment in the recognition of capital losses adding 2.2 million to profit negative tax impact in the year 2015: 74.8 million negative tax impact, positive profit and the combined impact of a number of other small tax adjustments was 2.6 million negative impact on profit, or increase to tax 2015: 0.6 million negative impact on tax, positive on profit.
The reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020 was enacted in the Finance Act 2016.
The impact of this reduction on the net deferred tax assets and liabilities results in a negative impact of 1.3 million due to the level of deferred tax assets being greater than the level of deferred tax liabilities 2015: 4.5 million positive impact.
The overall impact of these effects was to increase the tax charge on an IFRS basis to 28.9 million 2015: negative impact on tax of 50.7 million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 37 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued IFRS Profit Analysis of the IFRS profit before tax, Profit before shareholder tax and IFRS profit after tax is presented in the table below, which also shows the impact of the tax incurred on behalf of policyholders: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Million Million IFRS profit before tax 486.3 174.1 Policyholder tax 345.7 22.8 Profit before shareholder tax 140.6 151.3 Shareholder tax 28.9 50.7 IFRS profit after tax 111.7 202.0 The Profit before shareholder tax for the year was 140.6 million 31 December 2015: 151.3 million.
The impact of the increasingly negative contribution from the net movement in DAC DIR PVIF intangibles was a major contributor to the lower Profit before shareholder tax result in the current period.
The IFRS profit after tax result similarly reflected the impact of the negative net movement in DAC DIR PVIF in the current period, but the prior period result also benefitted significantly from recognition of 74.8 million of capital losses.
These two factors more than reversed the underlying growth in the business and resulted in a significant reduction in profit between the years.
By contrast the IFRS profit before tax increased significantly to 486.3 million 31 December 2015: 174.1 million.
This significant increase reflects the underlying positive investment performance in client policies, which generates higher policy charges intended to meet the Policyholder tax element of the corporate tax charge as described in the definition of Policyholder tax provided on page 27.
In practice, the very substantial increase in IFRS profit before tax is offset by the equivalent increase in Policyholder tax, and it is the Profit before shareholder tax which provides a better indication of the underlying performance of the business.

Solvency II Net Assets In addition to presenting an IFRS statement of financial position on page 129, we believe it is beneficial to provide a balance sheet reflecting our approach to managing solvency.
Solvency II net assets are based on the IFRS statement of financial position, but with adjustments made to accounting assets and liabilities to reflect the Solvency II regulations.
In addition, provision for insurance liabilities is set equal to the associated unit liabilities.
The following table sets out the adjustments to move from IFRS to Solvency II net assets.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 39 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Liquidity Included in the previous table are holdings in Fixed Interest Securities, Collective Investment Schemes and other cash and cash equivalents.
It is our policy to always hold such assets in high credit quality liquid assets.

As noted previously, future growth in cash flow is driven by new business, but in the short term, growth will reflect the transition as new business from six years ago becomes cash generative.
The key calls on liquidity will be investment to support the business and payment of the Group dividend.
As noted previously, our policy is to increase the dividend in line with the underlying performance of the business.
We believe this will also enable us to continue to invest in the business to support our growth aspirations.
Movement in Solvency II Net Assets The table below details the movement in the Solvency II net assets over the year which, after adjusting for changes in non cash items such as deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangibles, as well as changes in equity such as dividends paid in the year see also page 128 consolidated statement of changes in equity provides the net cash result for the period.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information The closing Solvency II Net Assets reflects an increase of 267 million as a result of unit liability reassessment impacting Adjustment 2 in the table on page 39.
This increase in net assets does not reflect a change in the underlying business and so, when considering solvency, management offsets the positive increase in Solvency II Net Assets by increasing the capital requirement the Management Solvency Buffer by a similar amount see also page 43.
Cash Results As noted above, the change in the Solvency II Net Assets, after adjusting for changes in non cash items such as deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangibles, as well as changes in equity such as dividends paid in the year see also page 128 consolidated statement of changes in equity provides the Cash result for the period.
The Cash result provides an alternative view of the cash generation of the Group during a reporting period.
The Cash result should not be confused with the IFRS consolidated statement of cash flows which is prepared in accordance with IAS 7 and disclosed on page 130.
The following tables below show: an Operating cash result reflecting the regular emergence of cash from the business operations: and an Underlying cash result which additionally reflects the cash impact of our strategic investments.
The reconciliation of the Underlying cash result to the Underlying profit measure is presented on page 34.
There are also some cash items whose emergence is volatile, varying over time, and which are influenced by market movements.
These impacts, together with the short term costs associated with the back office infrastructure project, are shown after the Underlying cash result.
The Cash results are presented after tax and can be analysed as a combination of the cash emerging from the business in-force at the start of the year, less the investment made to acquire new business during the year.
The following tables and commentary provide an indicative analysis of the Cash result into these two elements.
The Cash results are the principal measures the Board considers when determining the dividend payment to shareholders.

Notes All numbers are expressed after tax at the prevailing tax rate for each year.
The net annual management fee is the manufacturing margin the Group retains from funds under management after payment of the associated costs e. g. investment advisory fees and payments to Partners.
Broadly speaking the Group receives an average net annual management fee of 0.77% post-tax of funds under management 2015: 0.77% post-tax.
However, as noted in Section 1 on page 30, due to our product structure, investment and pension business does not generate cash in the first six years known as the gestation period.
This is reflected in an adjustment which is the reduction in fees in gestation period.
The overall result is the net income from funds under management which was some 15% higher than 2015, reflecting higher average funds under management during the year.
The reassessment of the level of the investment contract liability has resulted in an increase in Solvency II Net Assets of 267 million at the year end, but this amount will gradually unwind during the next six years through a higher reduction in fees in the gestation period.
If the approach had been implemented at the start of the year, the impact would have been an increase in the negative amount by some 45 million.
Margin arising from new business: This is the cash impact of new business in the year, reflecting growth in new business, production related expenses and mix of new business.
The revised assessment of investment contact liabilities results in an increase in the level of initial margin recognised in the Cash result through the margin arising from new business.
If this approach had been adopted at the start of 2016 the margin would have been some 70 million higher.
In future years, this additional margin will move in line with new businesses volumes, albeit adjusted for any business mix effects.
Expenses: These reflect the expenses of running the Group and more detail is provided in the table on page 32 in Section 2.
In line with the rest of the table they are presented after allowance for tax.
Shareholder interest: This is the assumed income accruing on the investments and cash held for regulatory purposes together with the interest received on the surplus capital held by the Group.
Tax relief from capital losses: In recent years, a deferred tax asset has been established for historic capital losses which are now regarded as being capable of utilisation over the medium term.
Utilisation during the year of 12.6 million tax value 2015: 12.1 million was slightly ahead of our expected rate of c. 8-10 million benefit in a year.
Miscellaneous: This represents the cash flow of the business not covered in any of the other categories, including ongoing administration expenses and associated policy charges, together with utilisation of the deferred tax asset in respect of prior years unrelieved expenses due to structural timing differences in the life company tax computation.
Strategic investments, including back office infrastructure: These reflect significant investments in developing our business for the future.
Further analysis of the expenses associated with these initiatives is presented in Section 2 on page 32, but all are expected to result in either additional funds Academy, Asia and DFM or expense savings Back office infrastructure in the future.
Advice margin generated in Asia and all fees generated by DFM are reflected in the relevant line.
Variance: This reflects variances in the settlement of tax related liabilities between the policyholders unit linked funds, the shareholder and HMRC.
It also reflects a 6.6 million negative one-off cost of reviewing charges in two small cohorts of legacy business and a number of other small positive and negative one-off items.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information Solvency St. Jamess Place is a simple wealth management group offering mainly investment products.
Our strategy is to attract and administer retail funds under management, from which we receive an annual management fee: we are a fee based business.
Our clients can access their investments on demand but, because we match the encashment value on the unit linked business, movements in equity markets, interest rates, mortality, morbidity, longevity and currency rates have little impact on our ability to meet liabilities although they can impact emergence of profit.
We also have a prudent capital management approach and invest surplus assets in cash, AAA rated money market funds and UK government securities.
The overall effect is assurance that we can meet liabilities, and a resilient solvency position that is dependable even through adverse market conditions.
We manage solvency of our business on the basis of holding assets in excess of the client unit linked liabilities plus a Management Solvency Buffer MSB.
This ensures we are able not only to meet client liabilities at all times, but the prudence of the MSB acts as protection against other risks.
At 2015 year end we assessed the MSB for our life businesses as 150 million, having taken into account a wide range of factors and information, not least the results from stress and scenario testing carried out as part of our annual ORSA Own Risk and Solvency Assessment.
At the 2016 year end, on the same basis, we assessed the MSB for our life businesses as 170 million, increasing slightly as a result of economic conditions.
However, as a result of our reassessing the unit liability in line with the encashment value the Solvency II net assets have increased by 267 million, with no change in our risk profile.
We therefore believe it is appropriate to increase our MSB to 437 million at the year end equal to 170 million plus 267 million.
During H1 2017, we are undertaking an asset liability matching exercise which will reduce our corporate exposure to market risk and result in a reduction in risk capital requirement.
Following this exercise, we will review the MSB and we expect it will reduce.
We will report on the outcome of that review at half year.
We continue to hold capital within the Group in respect of the other regulated but non insurance companies, based on holding excess capital significantly above the regulatory requirement.

It includes a 149.9 million deferred tax asset which is not immediately fungible, although we expect it will be utilised over the next ten years.
The actual rate of utilisation will depend on business growth and external factors, particularly investment market conditions.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 St. Jamess Place plc 43 FINANCIAL REVIEW continued Solvency II Balance Sheet Whilst we focus on Solvency II net assets and the MSB to manage solvency, we provide additional information about the Solvency II free asset position for information.
The presentation starts from the same Solvency II net assets, but includes recognition of an asset in respect of the expected Value of In-force cash flows VIF and a Risk Margin RM reflecting the potential cost to secure the transfer of the business to a third party.
The Solvency II net assets, VIF and RM comprise the Own Funds, which is assessed against a Solvency Capital Requirement SCR, reflecting the capital required to protect against a range of 1 in 200' stresses.
The SCR is calculated on the Standard Formula approach.
No allowance has been made for transitional provisions in the calculation of technical provisions or SCR.
An analysis of the Solvency II position for our Group, split by regulated and non regulated entities at the year end is presented in the table below: Other 2015 31 December 2016 Life Regulated Other Total Total Million Million Million Million Million Solvency II net assets 530.0 145.3 394.7 1,070.0 812.9 Value of in-force VIF 2,707.9 2,707.9 2,306.6 Risk Margin 779.2 779.2 624.0 Own Funds A 2,458.7 145.3 394.7 2,998.7 2,495.5 Solvency capital requirement B 1,991.0 55.5 2,046.5 1,595.8 Solvency II free assets 467.7 89.8 394.7 952.2 899.7 Solvency ratio A B 123% 262% 147% 156% After payment of year and intragroup dividend but before Group final dividend.
The solvency ratio after taking account of the final dividend is 141% at the year end 2015: 151% As noted in our commentary on the Solvency II result last year, the nature of our business is that much of the Own Funds value reflects future profits, but the SCR similarly reflects loss of future profits.
As a result, the solvency ratio is not very sensitive to changes in experience or assumptions, and can move counter intuitively depending on circumstances.
For example, the relative reduction in Solvency ratio from 2015 to 2016, is partly due to changes in economic assumptions, particularly lower interest rates and higher future inflation expectations.
However, it has also been impacted by the positive impact of investment performance on FUM, which has resulted in an increase in SCR by over 25%.
Since Solvency II Net Assets typically cash or fixed interest have not increased in line with markets, the ratio has fallen.
So despite the positive impact on our business of strong investment performance, our solvency ratio has reduced.
More generally, since our business profile has not changed significantly from last year end, the sensitivity analysis presented at that stage remains relevant.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information SECTION 5: EMBEDDED VALUE EV Life business and wealth management business differ from most other businesses, in that the expected shareholder income from the sale of a product emerges over a long period in the future.
We therefore complement the IFRS and cash results by providing additional disclosure on an EV basis, which brings into account the net present value of the expected future cash flows.
We believe that a measure of total economic value of the Groups operating performance is useful to investors.
As in previous reporting, our EV continues to be calculated on a basis determined in accordance with the EEV principles originally issued in May 2004 by the Chief Financial Officers Forum CFO Forum and supplemented in October 2005.
Following the introduction of Solvency II, the CFO Forum published an amended set of principles in April 2016.
The key change implemented in our results for December 2016 is to reflect a reduction in the cost of holding a revised level of solvency capital, moving from assuming 100% of Solvency I capital requirement to reflecting our new approach to capital management for the Group based on holding a Management Solvency Buffer over the unit linked liabilities for our Life businesses.

The unwind of the discount rate for the year was 199.6 million 2015: 172.4 million.
The unwind is calculated by multiplying the opening VIF by the discount rate but adjusting to reflect emergence of profits into cash during the year.
The result in the current year reflects both a slightly higher discount rate than 2015 and the higher start year opening VIF balance.
The discount rate is based on the risk free rate, which is set by reference to the yield on a UK 10 year gilt at the start of the year.
The unwind for the current year is based on a discount rate of 5.2% compared with 5.0% for the prior year.
Had the discount rate been consistent with 2015, the unwind and operating profit would have been 8.0 million lower.
There was a small positive experience variance during the year of 1.4 million.
The strong positive variance of 78.1 million in the prior year principally reflected the value ascribed to significant capital losses within the historic Group companies identified in the year.
As in the prior year, the positive operating assumption change in the year of 18.6 million 2015: 44.1 million reflected improvements in the retention assumptions on pension business Drawdown business in 2016 and adjustment to the maintenance expense assumption.
The addition of Rowan Dartington within the embedded value calculation has contributed 21.0 million.
The investment income for the year was little changed at 7.4 million 2015: 6.1 million.
Distribution business, back office development and other These items have already been commented on in the IFRS section on page 35.
Investment Return Variance The investment return variance reflects the capitalised impact on the future annual management fees resulting from the difference between the actual and assumed investment returns.
Given the size of our funds under management, a small difference can result in a large positive or negative variance.
The rise in global stock markets during the second half of the year, together with the currency impact from the depreciation of Sterling, has significantly contributed to a strong investment return for our funds.
Average growth in our funds of 14% to 18% funds net of charges compares with an assumed investment return of 2.5% net of charges which gives rise to a significant positive investment variance of 537.2 million for the year.
For the prior year there was a negative investment return of 24.4 million, reflecting the slightly lower actual investment return compared with the assumed return.
Economic Assumption Changes The negative variance of 12.4 million arising in the year principally reflects the increase in the implied inflation rate 2015: 0.9 million positive.
EEV Profit before Tax The total profit before tax for the year was 1,198.4 million, compared with 636.7 million, although the significant improvement is principally reflecting the difference in the investment return variance between the two years.
Tax The tax charge at 212.9 million 2015: 116.5 million reflects the underlying result.
A further reduction in the corporation tax rate from 18% to 17% effective 1 April 2020 was enacted in the Finance Act 2016.
The capitalised effect of this change has been included as a reduction in tax of 28.6 million.
Those tax cuts previously announced have already been reflected in the valuation.
EEV Profit after Tax The EEV profit after tax was 1,014.1 million 2015: 568.0 million reflecting the movement in EEV profit before tax, but also the positive impact of the tax rate change.

03183415 Strategic Report St. Jamess Place Foundation Governance Financial Statements Other Information New Business Margin The largest single element of the EEV operating profit analysed in the previous section is the new business contribution.
The level of new business contribution generally moves in line with new business levels.
To demonstrate this link, and aid understanding of the results, we provide additional analysis of the new business margin Margin.
This is calculated as the new business contribution divided by the new money invested, and is expressed as a percentage.
The table below presents the margin before tax from our manufactured business based on gross fund flows: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2016 2015 Investment New business contribution Million 108.3 124.9 New money invested Billion 2.28 2.45 Margin % 4.8 5.1 Pension New business contribution Million 207.9 140.6 New money invested Billion 5.12 3.66 Margin % 4.1 3.8 Unit Trust and DFM business New business contribution Million 204.0 175.2 New money invested Billion 3.95 3.13 Margin % 5.2 5.6 Total business New business contribution Million 520.2 440.7 New money invested Billion 11.35 9.24 Margin % 4.6 4.8 Post-tax margin % 3.8 3.9 The slight fall in the total margin from 4.8% to 4.6% reflects both a positive impact from an increased level of new business together with a negative impact from a change in business mix, with a greater proportion of pension business in the current year.
