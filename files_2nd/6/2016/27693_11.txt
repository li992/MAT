Strategic report Financial statements Governance 31 ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES OSB believes that the use of alternative performance measures APMs for profitability and earnings per share provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements and present a more consistent basis for comparing the Groups performance between financial periods, by adjusting for exceptional non-recurring items.
OSB also believes that it is appropriate to adjust those performance measures to include the coupons on PSBs classified as equity.
APMs also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by the Board.
However, any alternative performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well.

An in-depth understanding of property is key to our lending strategy.
As a Chartered Surveyor I have spent my entire career working in the residential and commercial property markets.
As you would expect, reviewing and analysing third party valuations takes up a large amount of our time and whilst the capital value is of paramount importance we give equal weighting to the marketability of the property from both an occupier and purchaser perspective.
We need to ensure the rental and purchaser demand is sustainable and that the asset will represent good lending security throughout the mortgage term.
This ensures that the Bank has an excellent understanding of the property when assessing a case in support of the underwriters and then on an ongoing basis.
I have strategic responsibility for the Groups property activity including appointing a panel of surveyors, how we undertake valuations for the larger and more complex properties, and valuation audits.
Last year, we audited more than 20% of valuations in-house to make sure they are consistent and aligned with our lending goals.
I also look after the Groups corporate real estate assets so UNDERSTANDING PROPERTY have a hands on role managing and maintaining a number ofproperties.
