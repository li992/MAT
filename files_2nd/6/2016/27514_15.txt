Results of operations for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 The table below sets forth the line items of the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 in US Dollars and as a percentage of revenue.
The loss is mainly driven by low Brent crude oil prices.
Revenue The Groups revenue decreased by 22.5% to US$348.0 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$448.9 million.
This is mainly explained by the decrease in the average Brent crude oil price from US$53.6 bbl during 2015 to US$45.1 bbl during the reporting period.
The pricing for all of the Groups crude oil, condensate and LPG is, directly or indirectly, related to the price of Brent crude oil.
Revenues from sales to the Groups largest three customers amounted to US$109.5 million, US$92.9 million and US$38.1 million respectively FY 2015: US$141.4 million, US$105.0 million and US$86.0 million.

The increase is primarily explained by the change in depreciation referred to below, partially offset by decreases in repair, maintenance andother services, materials and supplies and payroll and related costs.
On a boe basis, cost of sales increased marginally byUS$0.71 or 5.4% to US$13.96 for the reporting period FY 2015: US$13.25 and cost of sales net of depreciation per boe decreased by US$0.74, or 13.2%, to US$4.86 FY 2015: US$5.60.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation increased marginally by 20.8% to US$130.0 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$107.7 million.
Depreciation is calculated with the units of production method.
Increase of depreciation in 2016 incomparison with prior period is a consequence of the ratio change between the volumes produced and the proven developed reserves, aswell as an addition to O&G assets in the amount of US$316.9 million during the reporting period.
Repair, maintenance and other services decreased by 20.6% to US$21.1 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$26.6 million.
These expenses include maintenance expenses related to the gas treatment facility and other facilities of the Group, and engineering and geophysical study expenses.
These costs fluctuate depending on the planned works on certain objects.
Thedecrease in the reporting period is mainly attributable to Tenge devaluation.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 63 Payroll and related taxes decreased by 28.9% to 13.3 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$18.7 million.
This mainly resulted from the Tenge devaluation over the reporting period as majority of payroll costs are denominated in Tenge.
Royalties, which are calculated on the basis of production and market prices for the different products, decreased by 17.1% toUS$11.9 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$14.4 million.
This decrease follows the decline of revenues for sold products.
Other transportation services increased by 124.4% to US$6.8 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$3.0 million.
Such anevolution is explained by the fact that transportation services previously provided within the Group have been outsourced since Q4 2015 and these outsourced costs now include, for example, vehicle rental fare.
This was primarily due to a decrease of payroll and related costs, and professional services, namely legal, and business travel expenses.
The payroll costs decrease was driven by Tenge devaluation and the Groups ongoing staff optimisation programme.

Other Foreign exchange losses amounted to US$0.4 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$21.2 million.
Losses in FY 2015 are explained by the fact that on 20 August 2015 the Tenge was devalued against the US Dollar and other major currencies due toa decision of Kazakhstan to switch to free-float, triggering a 23% slide in the Tenge to a record 257.21 Tenge for 1 US Dollar.
As per 31 December 2015 the exchange rate was 340.6 Tenge for 1 US Dollar.
Since the Group had a net asset position of Tenge-denominated accounts around this date, the devaluation of the Tenge resulted in a significant foreign exchange loss recognised in FY 2015.
As per 31 December 2016 the exchange rate was 333.29 Tenge for 1 US Dollar.
Loss on derivative financial instruments amounted to US$63.2 million in the reporting period and relates to fair value of the hedging contract covering oil sales.
Based on the contract the Group has bought a put, which protects it against any fall in theprice of oil below US$ 49.16 bbl.
Movement in fair value of financial derivative instruments is disclosed in Note 28 of the Consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Other expenses decreased by 94.6% to US$1.7 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$30.6 million.
Other expenses comprise export custom duties, expenses for social gas compensation, accrual under subsoil use agreements and other expenses.
The variation is largely caused by a change in the estimate of amounts due under subsoil use agreements for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons from the Rostoshinskoye, Darjinskoye and  fields.
Income tax expense decreased by 89.6% to US$17.4 million for the reporting period FY 2015: US$166.6 million.
The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by lower deferred tax expenses in the current period.
In FY 2015 US$141.0 million of deferred tax expenses was recorded, mainly due to the Tenge devaluation having an impact on the tax base.
Liquidity and capital resources During the period under review, Nostrums principal sources of funds were cash from operations and amounts raised under the 2012 Notes and the 2014 Notes.
Its liquidity requirements primarily relate to meeting ongoing debt service obligations under the 2012 Notes and the 2014 Notes and to funding capital expenditures and working capital requirements.
