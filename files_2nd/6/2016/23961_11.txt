Adjusted profit attributable to ordinary shareholders was 123.5m 2015: 117.5m, with lower net finance costs and a lower noncontrolling interest charge being partly offset by lower adjusted operating profit and a higher effective tax rate.
Chief Financial Officer Statutory operating profit was 246.3m 2015: 245.8m.
Statutory profit before tax of 113.5m 2015: 105.8m reflects the slightly higher statutory operating profit and lower net finance costs.
The net cash inflow for the year before First Rail end of franchise cash flows was 36.0m 2015: 39.4m, ahead of expectations but slightly lower than the prior year.
This cash inflow, combined with the end of First Rail franchise outflows of 20.8m 2015: 107.9m and movements in debt due to foreign exchange, resulted in a net debt increase of 2.9m 2015:103.5m.

During the year gross capital investment of 413.3m 2015: 425.1m was invested in our business.
Our sustained reinvestment in our non-rail fleets and systems is now largely complete, and going forwardour capital allocation decisions will increasingly focus on themaintenance of our existing asset portfolio and selected growth opportunities with good returns.
In the year ahead we expect capitalinvestment for the Group excluding in First Rail, where such expenditures are typically matched by franchise receipts or other funding to decrease modestly.

However, after adjusting for the changes in First Rail franchise portfolio, lower number of First Student operating days and the change in the basis of estimate for accounting for First Rail pensions, ROCE would have increased by 60 basis points.
