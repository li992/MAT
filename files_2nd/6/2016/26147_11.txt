Our work on sustainability generates value for the business by giving us access to new revenue opportunities, building customer preference, improving supply chain resilience and enhancing efficiency and productivity.
For example, sales of our sustainable home products in 2015 16 reached 2.9 billion, around 28% of total revenues, achieving our 2016 17 milestone ahead of schedule.
This includes reaching 96% responsibly sourced timber and paper in our products, well on track for our target of 100% by 2020.
We have helped customers save 10.8 TWh of energy every year from the energy-saving products and services they have purchased from us since 2011 12.
As part of the development of our unified offer we have expanded our range of energy efficient LED light bulbs and reduced the cost for customers thanks to technological advances and by buying increased volumes from a smaller group of suppliers.
LED is expected to make up 61% of our new unified light bulb range.
