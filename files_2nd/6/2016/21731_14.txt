Going concern In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report and the Groups viability statement made on page 27, the directors have considered the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position.
This includes an overview of the Groups financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a combination of cash resources, committed and uncommitted facilities and overdrafts.
The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities are repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due for renewal as set out below.
There is sufficient headroom in the committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities can be operated as contracted for the foreseeable future.
The committed facilities as at 31 December 2016 were as follows: 230m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 3 July 2019 The December 2016 weighted average life of the committed facilities was 2.5 years.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable potential changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current committed facilities.
The directors have reviewed forecasts and projections for the Groups markets and services, assessing the committed facility and financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Groups ability to access further funding.
The directors also reviewed downside sensitivity analysis over the forecast period, thereby taking into account the uncertainties arising from the current economic environment.
Following this review, the directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
