Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 100 Financial Review The Consolidated Financial Statements of Fresnillo plc are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the EU.
This Financial Review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance understanding of the Groups financial statements.
All comparisons refer to 2016 figures compared to 2015, unless otherwise noted.
The financial information and year-on-year variations are presented in US dollars, except where indicated.
The full financial statements and their accompanying notes can be found on pages 167-215.
Commentary on financial performance The Company achieved strong financial results with growth of 103.7% in gross profit, 88.5% in EBITDA, and 552.6% in attributable profit for the year, excluding the effect of the Silverstream revaluation.
Furthermore, cash generation from our operations more than offset the investment in capex and the payment of dividends, resulting in the Company generating net cash of US$412.5 million for the period, with a cash and short-term investment balance of US$912.0 million as of 31 December 2016.
This strong financial position both reflects and extends our ability to continue generating value for our stakeholders.
Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and gold, lead and zinc hedging.
2 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation less administrative, selling and exploration expenses.
3 The weighted average number of ordinary shares was 736,893,589 for 2016 and 2015.
See note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Groups financial performance is largely determined by the operational performance of our assets and the ability of our management and personnel to achieve our strategic goals.
This year in particular, metal prices and the devaluation of the Mexican peso, which lie beyond our control, have had a favourable effect on our financial results.
These include: Precious metal prices In 2016, the average realised gold price increased 10.7%, to US$1,246.5 per ounce and the average realised silver price increased 10.3% to $17.2 per ounce.
Furthermore, the average realised lead and zinc prices increased 7.0% and 20.0% year on year, to US$85.1 and US$100.5 cents per pound, respectively.
As in previous years, the Company has structured certain hedge positions for lead and zinc to mitigate the risk of metal price volatilities, as set out in the financial statements pages 208-209.
MX$ US$ exchange rate The average spot Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate devalued by 17.7%, from $15.85 per US dollar in 2015 to $18.66 per US dollar in 2016.
This resulted in a favourable effect estimated at US$45.2 million on the Groups production costs, as costs denominated in Mexican pesos approximately two-thirds of total costs were lower when converted to US dollars.
The Mexican peso US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2016 was $20.66 per US dollar, compared to $17.21 per US dollar at the beginning of the year.
The 20.1% devaluation had an adverse effect on: i monetary assets transacted in Mexican pesos: and ii taxes and mining rights as the devaluation resulted in an increase in related deferred tax liabilities.
Cost deflation In 2016, there was a net decrease in the weighted average input cost over the year, of 8.1%.
This deflation reflected, amongst other factors, the favourable effect of the 17.7% average devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar.
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 101 Labour Employees received on average a 5.0% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, and administrative employees at the mines received a 4.5% increase: when converted to US dollars, the weighted average labour deflation was 11.1%.
Energy Electricity The weighted average cost of electricity decreased by 16.6% from US$7.1 cents per kW in 2015 to US$5.9 cents per kW in 2016.
Electricity rates are set by the Comisin Federal fide Electricidad CFE, the national utility, based on their average generating cost, which correlates mainly to fuel oil and coal prices.
In 2016, the decrease in electricity rates by CFE was mainly explained by the positive effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate, and to a lesser extent, the lower average generating cost following a decrease in fuel prices.
Diesel The weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars decreased 15.6% to US$62.6 cents per litre in 2016, compared to US$74.2 cents per litre in 2015.
Diesel prices in 2016 were controlled by Petrleos Mexicanos PEMEX, the national oil company.
Complete price liberalisation of fuels is expected in 2018.
Operating materials Year over year change in unit price % Steel balls for milling 8.9 Lubricants 7.7 Tyres 5.7 Sodium cyanide 16.1 Other reagents 3.7 Explosives 7.7 Steel for drilling 1.2 Weighted average of all operating materials 6.5 For the third consecutive year, unit prices of the majority of key operating materials decreased, resulting in a net weighted average decrease of 6.5%.
This reflects the combined effect of price deflation and the weighting of each component in the total cost of operating materials.
There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the devaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollar-denominated.
Contractors Agreements are signed individually with each contractor company, and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others.
Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of the Companys total production costs.
In 2016, increases granted to contractors, whose agreements were due for review during the period, ranged from 2.2% to 20.0% in Mexican pesos equivalent to -13.2% to 2.0% in dollar terms, resulting in a weighted average decrease of 4.0% in US dollars.
Maintenance Unit prices of spare parts for maintenance decreased 6.0% on average in US dollar terms.
Others Other cost components include freight and insurance premiums, which decreased by an estimated 11.6% and 7.7% respectively on a per unit basis.
The remaining components had an average deflation of 7.0% over 2015.
Treatment and refining charges 4 Treatment and refining charges are reviewed annually using international benchmarks.
Treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 11.5% and 8.7%, respectively, whilst silver refining charges decreased 4.3% year-on-year.
However, this was mostly offset by the increase in volumes of zinc concentrates with high silver contents shipped from Fresnillo and Saucito to Met-Mex.
As a result, treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement decreased by only 1.2% over 2015.
The effects of the above external factors, combined with the Groups internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.
Treatment and refining charges include the cost of treatment and refining as well as the margin charged by the refiner.
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 102 Financial Review continued Revenues Consolidated revenues US$ million 2016 2015 Amount Change US$ million US$ million US$ % 1 Adjusted revenue 2,045.0 1,583.3 461.7 29.2 Gold, lead and zinc hedging 1.6 3.9 2.3 59.0 Treatment and refining charges 141.1 142.8 1.7 1.2 Total revenues 1,905.5 1,444.4 461.1 31.9 1.
Total revenues for the full year of US$1,905.5 million increased by 31.9% over 2015.
This was mainly explained by the 29.2% increase in adjusted revenue as a result of the increase in sales volumes and higher metal prices.
In 2015, we entered into derivative contracts which extended into 2016 to hedge part of our lead and zinc by-product production through collar structures, resulting in a US$1.5 million gain recorded in this years income statement.
The chart below illustrates the total expired hedging structures for 2016: as of 31 December there were no outstanding positions.

The hedging programme was executed for a total volume of 1,559,689 oz of gold with monthly maturities until December 2019, the effects of which are recorded as finance income and a small portion in revenue.
The table below illustrates the expired structures and the outstanding hedged position as of 31 December 2016.

Fresnillo plcs hedging policy for metal prices remained unchanged for the remainder of the portfolio, providing shareholders with full exposure to the gold and silver prices.
The higher volumes sold, mainly due to the reduction of gold inventories in the leaching pads at Herradura, and to a lesser extent, the start-up of San Julin, resulted in a positive impact on revenues of US$292.4 million, which represented 63.3% of the US$461.7 million increase in adjusted revenues.
The remaining 36.7%, or US$169.3 million, was explained by the benefit of higher metal prices.
The contribution of gold to adjusted revenues increased from 52% in 2015 to 55% in 2016, while the contribution of silver decreased from 39% to 35%.
This resulted from the combination of: i the increase in volume of gold sold 36.9% which was higher than that of silver 17.3% : and ii the 10.7% increase in the average price of gold, whilst the average silver price rose 10.3%.
Adjusted revenues is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and gold, lead and zinc hedging.
Herradura was the main contributor to adjusted revenues, reflecting the decrease in gold inventories in the leaching pads which was made possible due to the commissioning of the second Merrill Crowe Plant at the dynamic leaching plant DLP in the last quarter of 2015, eliminating the bottleneck in processing solution coming from the leaching pads and the DLP.
Saucito was the second contributor, although its contribution declined from 30% in 2015 to 26% in 2016, notwithstanding a 12.7% increase in adjusted revenues.
Similarly, Fresnillo contributed a lesser share of adjusted revenues, but remained as the third most important contributor to the Groups adjusted revenues.
Cinega slightly decreased its contribution: whilst phase I of San Julin contributed for the first time.
Adjusted production costs is calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and the effects of exchange rate hedging.
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 105 Cost of sales remained fairly stable at US$1,023.4 million.
The US$12.1 million increase is explained by the following combination of factors: A decrease in adjusted production costsUS$15.6 million : This was mainly driven by: i the favourable effect of the 17.7% devaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate when converting peso-denominated costs to US dollarsUS$45.2 million : ii the efficiencies achieved at Fresnillo, Saucito and Cinega resulting from some optimisation projects and cost reduction initiativesUS$8.6 million : iii lower energy costs, excluding foreign exchange effects, reflecting lower unit prices of electricity and dieselUS$6.4 million : iv lower cost of operating materialsUS$6.0 million : and v lower maintenance costsUS$4.0 million.
These positive effects were partially offset by: i additional production costs related to the start-up of San Julin phase I US$20.4 million : ii additional production costs related to increased ore throughput at Herradura and Saucito US$24.6 million : iii higher contractor costs as a result of a greater number of contractors used to carry out development, mainly at Saucito, and an increase in the unit fees charged by contractors in Mexican pesos US$4.8 million : iv an increase in the unit cost of personnel excluding foreign exchange effects and other items in pesos US$4.8 million.
Mexican peso US dollar hedgingUS$25.8 million : During 2015 the Group entered into a combination of put and call options structured at zero cost collars which extended into 2016.
The volume that expired during 2016 had been put in place to hedge US$198 million of costs denominated in Mexican pesos with average floor and cap exchange rates of $14.91 and $18.26 per US dollar respectively, resulting in a US$2.77 million loss recorded in the income statement: as of 31 December 2016, there were no outstanding positions.
Reversal of inventories write-down, profit sharing and othersUS$15.8 million : The change is principally explained by the reversal of the provision recorded in December 2015 related to the forward price of gold falling below the inventory carrying cost at SoledadDipolos.
This trend was reversed in 2016.
These positive effects were more than offset by increases in: Variation in change in work in progress US$53.9 million.
This was mainly explained by the decrease in inventories at the leaching pads at Herradura.
Depreciation US$15.3 million : The increase was explained by the larger asset base following the completion of San Julin phase I, and the increased depletion factor at Herradura.
Cost per tonne, cash cost per ounce and all-in sustaining cost Cost per tonne, calculated as total production costs less depreciation, profit sharing and exchange rate hedging effects, divided by total tonnage milled or deposited, is a key indicator to measure the effects of mining inflation and cost control performance at each mine and the Group as a whole.
We have included cost per tonne hauled moved as we believe it is a useful indicator to thoroughly analyse cost performance for the open pit mines.
Cost per tonne 2016 2015 Change % Fresnillo US$ tonne milled 43.93 48.20 8.9 Saucito US$ tonne milled 36.75 42.49 13.5 Cinega US$ tonne milled 55.49 62.99 11.9 Herradura US$ tonne deposited 7.72 8.68 11.0 Herradura US$ tonne hauled 2.31 2.66 13.2 Noche Buena US$ tonne deposited 7.48 7.93 5.7 Noche Buena US$ tonne hauled 1.60 1.67 4.2 Explanations regarding changes in cost per tonne by mine were covered in the Review of Operations section, pages 58-67.
Cash cost per ounce, calculated as total cash cost cost of sales plus treatment and refining charges less depreciation less revenues from by-products divided by the silver or gold ounces sold, when compared to the corresponding metal price, is an indicator of the ability of the mine to cover its production costs.
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 106 Financial Review continued Cash cost per ounce 2016 2015 Change % Fresnillo US$ per silver ounce 2.09 5.60 62.6 Saucito US$ per silver ounce 0.39 1.15 133.9 Cinega US$ per gold ounce 217.19 245.49 188.5 Herradura US$ per gold ounce 470.72 472.53 0.4 Noche Buena US$ per gold ounce 765.90 972.74 21.3 The particular variations in cash cost for each mine are explained as follows: Fresnillo: US$2.09 oz 2016 vs. US$5.60 oz 2015, -62.6% The decrease in cash cost per ounce is mainly explained by the higher by-product credits per silver ounce due to the increase in gold, lead and zinc volumes sold at higher pricesUS$2.88 oz : lower cost per tonneUS$0.66 oz see pages 58-59 : increase in ore gradeUS$0.07 oz : and othersUS$0.01 oz.
This was partly offset by higher treatment and refining charges per silver ounce due to: higher zinc and lead ore grades which increased the volume of concentrates, and an increase in the participation of zinc concentrate which has a higher per unit treatment charge US$0.12 oz.
Saucito: -US$0.39 oz 2016 vs. US$1.15 oz 2015, -133.9% The decrease was driven by the higher by-product credits per ounce of silver resulting from increased gold, lead and zinc volumes sold at higher pricesUS$1.21 oz : lower cost per tonneUS$0.63 oz see pages 60-61 : and lower treatment and refining chargesUS$0.23 oz.
These positive effects were partly offset by the expected lower silver grade US$0.52 oz : and others US$0.01 oz.
Cinega: -US$217.19 oz 2016 vs. US$245.49 oz 2015, -188.5% The decrease in cash cost was primarily explained by higher by-product credits per ounce of gold due to the increased volumes of silver, lead and zinc sold at higher pricesUS$457.22 oz : and the decrease in cost per tonneUS$141.54 oz see pages 62-63.
These favourable factors were partly offset by the expected decrease in gold grade US$98.31 oz : higher treatment and refining charges resulting from lower gold ore grade which requires producing more concentrate per ounce of gold, and higher lead and zinc ore grades which increase the volume of concentrates US$33.89 oz : and others US$3.88 oz.
Herradura: US$470.72 oz 2016 vs. US$472.53 oz 2015, -0.4% The decrease in cash cost resulted from the lower cost per tonneUS$47.68 oz see page 64 : higher by-product credits per gold ounce due to the increased volume of silver sold at a higher priceUS$1.09 oz : and lower treatment and refining chargesUS$0.05 oz.
These favourable effects were offset by: i the expected lower gold grade US$30.29 oz : ii an adverse inventory valuation effect, as ounces with a lower cost of production in the current period are mixed with the initial higher cost of inventory affecting cost of sales US$16.47 oz : and others US$0.24 oz.
Noche Buena: US$765.90 oz 2016 vs. US$972.74 oz 2015, -21.3% The decrease in cash cost per ounce was mainly explained by: i the higher gold gradeUS$123.96 oz : ii the lower cost per tonneUS$46.03 oz see page 66 : and iii the othersUS$36.85 oz.
San Julin phase I : commenced operations in August 2016, thus there are no comparable year-on-year figures.
In addition to the traditional cash cost described above, the Group is reporting all-in sustaining costs AISC, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the World Gold Council.
This cost metric is calculated as traditional cash cost plus on-site general, corporate and administrative costs, community costs related to current operations, capitalised stripping and underground mine development, sustaining capital expenditures and remediation expenses.
Management considers all-in sustaining costs a reasonable indicator of the mines ability to generate free cash flow when compared with the corresponding metal price, and a means to monitor not only current production costs, but also sustaining costs as it includes mine development costs incurred to prepare the mine for future production, as well as sustaining capex.

Saucito: Lower, as a result of the decrease in capex in 2016 compared to capex invested in expansion and efficiency projects in 2015: and the lower cash cost as detailed on the previous page.
Cinega: Lower, primarily explained by the lower cash cost as detailed on the previous page.
Herradura: Lower, mainly due to the decrease in capitalised stripping costs: and to a lesser extent, the lower cash cost as detailed on the previous page.
Noche Buena: Lower, driven by the lower cash cost as detailed on the previous page.
Gross profit Gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses, is a key financial indicator of profitability at each business unit and the Fresnillo Group as a whole.
The US$449.0 million increase in gross profit was mainly explained by: i the favourable effect of higher metal prices US$167.5 million : ii the positive impact of increased gold production at Herradura US$128.9 million : iii the start-up of San Julin phase I US$45.8 million : iv the 17.7% devaluation of the Mexican peso US dollar US$45.2 million : v higher ore grade at the Fresnillo mine US$29.0 million : vi higher production at Noche Buena US$23.4 million : vii the reversal of the write down of inventories at Soledad-Dipolos US$10.7 million : viii the positive effect of lower hedging losses and other effects US$24.1 million : and ix efficiencies achieved at some of our mines through optimisation projects and cost reduction initiatives US$8.6 million.
The above factors were partially offset by the lower ore grades at HerraduraUS$18.9 million and the higher depreciationUS$15.3 million.
Herradura became the largest contributor to the Groups consolidated gross profit.
Gross profit at Saucito increased by 35.6% to US$269.4 million, although its share of the Groups consolidated gross profit declined to 31.1% in 2016.
Gross profit at the Fresnillo mine rose to US$158.6 million in 2016, while the mines contribution to the Groups total gross profit slightly increased to 18.3%.
Noche Buena generated a gross profit of US$54.1 million, and contributed 6.2% to the Groups consolidated gross profit.
Cinegas share of the Groups total gross profit increased to 5.6%, whilst San Julin contributed for the first time with 3.0%.
Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 108 Financial Review continued Administrative expenses Administrative expenses decreased 5.8% from US$62.8 million to US$59.1 million due mainly to a decrease in non-recurring engineering and construction services provided by Servicios Industriales Peoles, S. A.
B. fide C. V. lower cost of services provided by third parties, and the positive effect of the devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar in administrative expenses denominated in pesos.

Nonetheless, the resource base was expanded as detailed on pages 71-75.
An additional US$16.7 million was capitalised in association with mining works at Juanicipio and minor equipment acquired at the Centauro Deep, Orisyvo and Guanajuato projects.
As a result, total investment in exploration was US$137.9 million in 2016, a decrease of 8.9% over 2015.
In 2017, total invested in exploration is expected to be approximately US$160 million, of which US$8 million is estimated to be capitalised.

In 2016, EBITDA increased 88.5% mainly due to the higher gross profit, the higher depreciation which is added back and the lower exploration and administrative expenses.
EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenues increased accordingly, from 37.9% in 2015 to 54.2% in 2016.
Other income and expenses Other expenses decreased by 43.4% to US$9.0 million in 2016.
This included disposals of fixed assets, remediation works and costs incurred in the maintenance of closed mines.
This positively compares to the US$15.9 million recorded in the 2015 income statement.
FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 109 Silverstream effects The Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value.
The revaluation of the Silverstream contract generated a US$85.8 million non-cash gain mainly as a result of the increase in resources at the Sabinas mine and the higher forward price of silver, which were partly mitigated by the higher discount rate used.
In addition, a US$47.7 million non-cash gain was generated by: i the unwinding of the discounted values: and ii the difference between payments volume and price actually received and accrued in 2016 and payments estimated in the valuation model as at 31 December 2015.
The total effect recorded in the 2016 income statement was US$133.5 million, which favourably compares to the US$27.7 million registered in 2015.
Since the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$559.6 million, while total non-cash revaluation gains of US$683.8 million have been taken to the income statement.
The Group expects further unrealised gains or losses will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract.
Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the Balance Sheet section below and in notes 14 and 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Finance costs and income Finance costs in 2016 decreased mainly due to the decline in accrued interest payable on the US$800 million principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes, from US$36.0 million to US$29.0 million.
In 2014 we entered into gold derivative contracts to protect the value of the Penmont acquisition see page 102.
As at 31 December 2016, outstanding collar derivative instruments mature over the period of January 2017 to December 2019 and hedge gold production of 1.04 million ounces with a floor price of US$1,100 per ounce and capped weighted average price of US$1,423.76 per ounce.
In 2016, we recognised changes in the time value of the outstanding hedge position, resulting in a US$41.1 million non-cash loss recorded in the income statement.
Foreign exchange A foreign exchange loss of US$18.4 million was recorded in 2016 as a result of the 20.1% devaluation of the spot Mexican peso US Dollar exchange rate at 31 December.
This loss positively compares to the US$36.2 million loss recognised in 2015.
The Group also enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in Euro EUR, Swedish krona SEK and Canadian dollar CAD.
At the end of the year, the total EUR, SEK and CAD outstanding net forward position was EUR 9.35 million, CAD 0.0 and SEK 7.09 million with maturity dates from March through September 2017.
Volumes that expired during 2016 were EUR 2.31 million with a weighted average strike of 1.1250 US Dollar EUR, CAD 3.86 million with a weighted average strike of 1.2629 CAD US Dollar and SEK 14.46 million with a weighted average strike of 8.41 SEK US Dollar, which has generated a result of US$46,627, -US$206,810 andUS$18,970 recorded in the income statement respectively.
Taxation Corporate income tax expense of US$259.9 million increased 101.5% over 2015 which resulted mainly from the increase in profit generated in 2016.
The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 36.2% which was above the statutory corporate tax rate of 30%.
This was mainly explained by the devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, which increased deferred income taxes, generated by higher differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities denominated in US dollars and their tax bases denominated in Mexican pesos.
Furthermore, US$33.4 million related to the special mining rights was registered in the income statement in 2016.
Including the effect of mining rights, the effective tax rate was 40.8%.
Profit for the year Profit for the year increased from US$69.4 million to US$425.0 million, whilst profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group increased to US$427.0 million, up from US$70.5 million in 2015.

In 2015, cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2015 accounted for US$381.4 million and short-term investments amounted to US$118.7 million.
Cash generated by operations before changes in working capital increased by 90.5% to US$1,023.3 million, mainly as a result of the higher profits generated in the year.
Working capital increased US$10.6 million mainly due to an increase in trade and other receivables resulting from the higher volumes sold at higher metal prices US$39.5 million.
This increase in working capital was partly offset by: i a decrease in inventories US$23.7 million : ii a decrease in prepayments and other assets US$0.1 million : and iii an increase in trade and other payables US$5.1 million.
Taxes and employee profit sharing paid increased 150.9% over 2015 to US$114.8 million.
As a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities increased significantly, from US$542.9 million in 2015 to US$898.0 million in 2016.
Other sources of cash were the proceeds of the Silverstream contract of US$47.6 million and capital contributions from minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$7.4 million.
The above funds were mainly used to purchase property, plant and equipment for a total of US$434.1 million, an 8.6% decrease over 2015.
This was below the guidance of US$600 million mainly as a result of the delay in commissioning San Julin phase II.
Capital expenditures for 2016 are further described below: Purchase of property, plant and equipment 2016 US$ million Fresnillo mine 52.8 Mine development and purchase of in-mine equipment which includes a hoist for the deepening of the shaft, raiseboring machines, pumps and other components Saucito mine 102.4 Development, replacement of in-mine equipment and optimisation projects at the beneficiation plant Herradura mine 78.8 Stripping activities, construction of leaching pad, and sustaining capex San Julin 134.1 Completion of San Julin phase I, mine development and in-mine equipment Cinega mine 32.7 Development, replacement of in-mine equipment, purchase of components and expansion of tailings dam Noche Buena 8.6 Construction of leaching pads and mine equipment Juanicipio project 14.6 Exploration expenditure Other 10.1 Total purchase of property, plant and equip.

FRESNILLO TODAY STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fresnillo plc Annual Report 2016 111 Net interest of US$21.1 million was paid, mainly reflecting the interest paid in relation with the issuance of the US$800 million principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes.
The sources and uses of funds described above resulted in an increase in net cash of US$412.5 million net increase in cash and cash equivalents, which combined with the US$500.1 million balance at the beginning of the year and the US$0.6 million unfavourable effect of the exchange rate resulted in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$912.0 million at the end of 2016.
Balance Sheet Fresnillo plc continues to prioritise and maintain a strong, flexible financial position.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased during the year to US$912.0 million as explained above.
Inventories decreased 7.9% to US$276.9 million mainly as a result of the decreased inventories of gold deposited on the leaching pads at Herradura.
Trade and other receivables of US$286.7 million decreased 6.2% as a result of the decrease in income tax recoverable, partly offset by higher metal volumes sold at higher prices which increased receivables.
The change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$384.8 million at the beginning of the year to US$467.5 million as of 31 December 2016 reflects proceeds of US$50.7 million corresponding to 2016 US$44.8 million in cash and US$5.9 million in receivables and the Silverstream revaluation effect in the income statement of US$133.5 million.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,180.2 million at year end, representing a 1.9% increase over 2015.
The US$41.6 million increase was mainly explained by the capitalised development works: construction of San Julin: purchase of additional in-mine equipment: and construction of leaching pads at Herradura.
The Groups total equity was US$2,716.4 million as of 31 December 2016, a 14.4% increase over 2015.
This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2015 profit, less dividends paid during the year, and the net unrealised gains on cash flow hedges.
Dividends Based on the Groups 2016 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of 21.5 US cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 26 May 2017 to shareholders on the register on 28 April 2017.
The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars.
This is in addition to the interim dividend of 8.6 US cents per share totalling US$63.4 million.
