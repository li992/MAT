30 William Hill PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial review Continued strong cash generation The Groups ability to be highly cash generative, with 265.9m of operating cash flow in 2016, allowed us to make key investments to support the development of our technology.
Mark Summerfield Interim Chief Financial Officer 2016 2015 m m % Revenue 1,603.8 1,590.9 1 Cost of sales 382.2 377.9 1 Gross profit 1,221.6 1,213.0 1 1 Adjusted operating profit 261.5 291.4 -10 Profit before interest and tax 225.6 224.3 1 Net finance costs 44.3 39.6 12 Tax 16.8 5.2 Profit after tax 164.5 189.9 -13 EPS 18.9 21.6 -13 3 EPS adjusted 22.3 24.7 -10 1 In 2016 the Group delivered a 1% increase in both revenues and profit before interest and tax.
However, adjusted operating profit fell 10% to 261.5m.
The fall mainly reflects that revenue growth was insufficient to offset cost increases to support growth, including the investment needed to strengthen our Online business after the difficult first half of the year.
There were also adverse effects from higher finance costs in 2016, due to a period of overlap through the refinancing of one of our bonds, and higher tax costs as 2016 did not benefit from the same level of tax credits as the prior year.
Overall this led to a year-on-year fall in profit after tax of 13%, to 164.5m, and a fall in EPS of 13% to 18.9p.
Net operating cash flows remained strong at 265.9m, the 35.0m reduction over the prior year being broadly in line with the reduction 1 in adjusted operating profit.
Together with an increase in cash from financing activities, this allowed us to fund significant investment as well as cash returns to shareholders while remaining within our target net debt to EBITDA ratio of one to two times.
Net debt for covenant 2 purposes rose to 618.1m from 488.2m, increasing the ratio from 1.3x to 1.8x.
