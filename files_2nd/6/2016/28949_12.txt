GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW Trading Profit Strong financial performance 211.0m Available operating cash flow 178.1m am pleased to be able to report Jonathan Hill that the Group has delivered a Group Chief Financial Officer strong financial performance, with a 5.0% growth in Trading EBITDA and a 5.2% growth in Trading I Profit.
Robust cash flows have enabled us to further deleverage to 2.3x from 2.6x at the start of the year.
Based on these results and our future expectations for the business, we have significantly increased our dividend to 7.2p per share for the full year.
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 7.0% to 963.2m 2015: 900.5m, Trading EBITDA grew by 5.0% to 238.8m 2015: 227.4m and Trading Profit by 5.2% to 211.0m 2015: 200.6m.
Profit before interest, tax and IPO costs increased by 2.2%, reflecting several factors: amortisation of acquired intangibles increased by 4.1m as a result of the full year impact of Destinology, acquired part way through 2014, and the acquisition of Bennetts on 1 July 2015: a 4.1m decrease in year-on-year derivative fair value movements taken to profit and loss: offset by a 2.2m reduction in non-trading costs.
The non-trading costs recognised by the Group in the year comprised 4.7m of costs relating to the administration of our legal services provider Parabis Law LLP, 3.8m associated with the write-down of the carrying value of the Bel Jou hotel, 0.7m of restructuring costs and 0.5m of costs incurred with the acquisition of Bennetts.
These were offset by a 2.6m positive settlement of 38 SAGA PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 JANUARY 2016 Strategic Report Trading Profit Income Statement 12m to 12m to Group Income Statement Jan 2016 Growth Jan 2015 Revenue 963.2m 7.0% 900.5m 211.0m Trading EBITDA 238.8m 5.0% 227.4m Available operating cash flow Depreciation & amortisation excluding acquired intangibles 27.8m 26.8m Trading Profit 211.0m 5.2% 200.6m Non-trading costs 0.2m 2.4m 178.1m Amortisation of acquired intangibles 6.3m 2.2m Net fair value gains losses on derivatives 1.2m 2.9m Profit before interest, tax and IPO costs 203.3m 2.2% 198.9m Finance costs 24.0m 23.0m IPO expenses 3.1m 50.0m Exceptional debt costs 12.1m Profit before tax from continuing operations 176.2m 54.8% 113.8m Tax expense 28.1m 2.6% 27.4m Loss after tax for the year from discontinued operations 6.9m 96.9% 220.2m Profit loss after tax 141.2m 205.5% 133.8m Basic earnings per share: Earnings per share from continuing operations 13.3p 54.7% 8.6p Earnings loss per share 12.7p 195.5% 13.3p a legal dispute related to one of the ships and a 7.1m release of the contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Destinology.
While Destinology has delivered solid profits, the results for the year are below those expected at the time of acquisition, due tosignificantly more competition in the Middle East market a major destination for Destinology and slower development of customer growth, with new marketing initiatives yet to fully deliver.
A new Managing Director and strengthened marketing resource are in place to enhance returns from Destinology.
Profit before tax from continuing operations for the year was 176.2m, an increase of 54.8%, due in part to the material one-off IPO and exceptional debt costs incurred in the previous year.
Finance costs Finance costs in the year were 24.0m, which comprised 18.7m of interest costs on debt and borrowings, 3.2m of amortisation of debt issue costs, 1.1m of finance charge associated with pension schemes and a 1.0m charge associated with the unwinding of the discount on the deferred consideration associated with Destinology.
This compares with 23.0m in the previous year, which comprised 20.1m of interest costs on debt and borrowings, 2.4m of amortisation of debt issue costs and 0.5m finance charge associated with pension schemes.
Tax expense The Groups tax expense for the year was 28.1m 2015: 27.4m representing a tax effective rate of 15.9%.
This included a 7.6m benefit from the utilisation under the group relief rules of tax losses from Acromas, which arose when Saga was a part of the Acromas Group.
Excluding the impact of the Acromas tax losses, the underlying tax effective rate was 20.3% 2015: 24.1%.
Earnings per share Group basic earnings per share were 12.7p 2015: loss per share of 13.3p with Group basic earnings per share from continuing operations for the same period of 13.3p 2015: 8.6p.
The earnings performance for the previous year was impacted by the Groups IPO and exceptional debt costs.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 JANUARY 2016 SAGA PLC 39 GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED Dividends The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 5.0p per share, which, combined with the interim dividend of 2.2p per share, will deliver a total dividend for the financial year ending 31 January 2016 of 7.2p per share 2015: 4.1p.
This equates to a payout ratio of 57% compared with the Groups basic earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the one-off benefit of Acromas tax losses 2015: 49.5% pro rata for the period post IPO.
Saga offers a share alternative in the form of a dividend re-investment plan DRIP for those shareholders who wish to elect touse their dividend payments to purchase additional Shares in the Group, rather than receive a cash payment.
The last date for shareholders to elect to participate in the DRIP will be 5 June 2016.
Cash flow and liquidity The Group maintained a strong cash flow performance in the year to 31 January 2016, achieving an available operating cash flow of 178.1m, 74.6% of Trading EBITDA.
This cash flow increased by 15.1m on the previous period, which was driven by a higher payout from increased profits in the travel and AICL restricted businesses.

As at 31 January 2016, net debt was 547.7m, comprising 480.0m of gross debt and 75.0m of drawn revolving credit facility, offset by 7.3m of available cash.
This compared with net debt as at 31 January 2015 of 582.4m, comprising 700.0m of gross debt offset by 117.6m of available cash.
As communicated at the time of the interim results, it is the Group's intention to reduce the debt ratio net debt to Trading EBITDA to between 1.5x and 2.0x in the medium term.
The delivery ofthe new ship is expected in mid-2019 and the intention is to target the lower end of this range before any debt associated with the ship is drawn down, with the Group remaining within this target range after the delivery of the new ship.
Pensions Over the year, the valuation of the Groups pension scheme has improved on an IAS19 basis by 21.6m to a deficit of 18.8m January 2015: deficit 40.4m : 12m to 12m to Saga Scheme Jan 2016 Jan 2015 Fair value of scheme assets 218.6m 212.3m Present value of defined benefit obligation 237.4m 252.7m Defined benefit scheme liability 18.8m 40.4m The improvement has been driven by a 15.3m reduction in the present value of obligations to 237.4m January 2015: 252.7m and a 6.3m increase in the fair value of the scheme assets.
The significant decrease in the present value of future obligations has been driven by an increase in the discount rate applied reflecting an increase in corporate bond yields.
Net assets Since 31 January 2015, total assets and liabilities have reduced by 49.9m and 154.0m respectively, increasing overall net assets by 104.1m.
Total assets have reduced as a result of a decrease in cash and short-term deposits of 92.3m, a reduction in other financial assets predominantly the investment portfolio of 14.9m and the removal of 47.7m of assets held for sale as at 31 January 2015 resulting from the sale of the Allied Healthcare business on 30 November 2015.
Offsetting this is an increase in reinsurance of assets of 43.0m due to large personal injury claims experience caused by a rise in the average cost of Periodical Payment Orders, an increase in trade and other receivables of 24.3m driven by insurance trading, and increased goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets of 31.1m primarily relating to the acquisition of Bennetts.
The reduction in total liabilities reflects a 131.2m reduction in financial liabilities following the repayment of debt during the period, the removal of 47.7m of liabilities held for sale as at 31 January 2015 resulting from the sale of the Allied Healthcare business, and a 21.6m reduction in retirement benefit scheme obligations.
Trade and other payables have increased by 32.9m reflecting accruals for initial costs relating to the build of the new ship, insurance trading and the acquisition of Bennetts.

Travel revenue increased by 11.0% to 423.1m, largely driven by a full year contribution from Destinology, which contributed 32.8m.
The insurance and travel businesses saw increases in Trading Profit of 8.0% and 26.5% respectively.
These were partially offset by an additional 8.9m Trading Loss in emerging businesses and central costs, 5.5m of which reflects the increased central administrative costs as a result of becoming a plc, with part of the balance being theGroups ongoing investment inthenewlylaunched Saga InvestmentServices.
The total Trading Profit of 100.4m is unchanged.
The motor market remained highly competitive, with average premiums continuing to fall at the start of year before increasing from the second quarter of 2015.
Against this backdrop, we have grown both customer numbers and profits by increasing our 42 SAGA PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 JANUARY 2016 Strategic Report competitiveness through capitalising on our underwriting performance and the initial impact of the new motor panel.
Underlying core policy volumes excluding Bennetts were up 3.1% in the year.
Revenue and gross written premiums from core underwritten policies decreased during the year as a whole, reflecting the fact that premiums were falling or only starting to recover when a number of these policies were written.
This was offset by a 10m increase in revenue from Broking and Other due to the inclusion of Bennetts from 1 July 2015 and the initial impact of the motor panel.
Overall, the positive claims experience within the core business has enabled a growth in Trading Profit of 17.8% despite ongoing challenging market conditions.
Motor underwriting The profitability of the core underwritten motor business has improved, as lower net earned premiums are more than offset by improved claims experience, increases in other income streams and lower operating expenses.

Net earned premiums were 2.7% lower due to falling or flat premiums during part of the year and a reduction in underwriting for the AA motor business.
This was partially offset by a 2.4m increase in other income from the introduction of broker arrangement fees and a limited increase in administrative charges.
The Group has not seen the increase in claims frequency that is being reported elsewhere in the market, with frequency being broadly flat across accidental damage, third party damage and personal injury claims.
As previously reported, this is largely a result of the characteristics of the Group's current customer base, with the majority of customers being retired, therefore lessening the impact of recent falls in fuel costs and economic growth.
Claims severity during 2015 has also been broadly stable across accidental damage and small personal injury claims, with the Group not currently experiencing the inflation in personal injury claims costs reported elsewhere.
The Group has continued to maintain strong levels of retention within the Ministry of Justice Portal, in addition to its significant and ongoing focus on effective management of these types of claims.
The Group has seen a marginal increase inthird party damage severity, chiefly driven by increases in at-fault repair costs that have been seen across the market following the Coles v Hetherton judgment.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 JANUARY 2016 SAGA PLC 43 GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS REVIEW CONTINUED The combined operating ratio, at 74.4% has improved by 3.5 percentage points, partially as a result of the 2.0m increase in reserve releases reflecting an improvement of claims experience on large and small personal injury claims.
The pure combined operating ratio improved by 1.9 percentage points as a result of a reduction in operating expenses as a greater share of indirect costs were allocated to the home and other insurance segments during the year to reflect the relative revenues of thebusinesses.
Investment return decreased by 12.8%, which was driven primarily by lower returns on mark-to-market elements of the portfolio as a result of the recent turmoil in global markets.

Despite these market conditions, the efficiency of the home panel has allowed the Group to continue to improve the net rates it receives from its underwriters to grow core policy numbers, increase revenue by 8.7% to 99.8m 2015: 91.8m and Trading Profit by 3.2% to 64.1m 2015: 62.1m.
Operating expenses were up 4.6m as improved revenues relative to motor resulted in a greater proportion of indirect costs being allocated to home.

Favourable claims development experience during the twelve months to 31 January 2016 has resulted in a reduction in the reserves required in respect of prior year claims.
This has been driven by large and small personal injury claims and by other classes and resulted in a materially consistent level of reserve releases totalling 68.0m during the year.
There has been no deterioration in the reserve margin year-on-year.

The Group's total insurance contract liabilities net of reinsurance assets have reduced by 44.4m as at 31 January 2016 from the previous year end, driven by an 18.9m reduction in IBNR claims reserves, 13.9m less reported claims reserves and a 12.2m reduction in unearned premium reserve.
Investment portfolio The majority of the Group's financial assets are held by its underwriting entity and represent premium income received and invested to settle claims and to meet regulatory capital requirements.
The maturity profile of the invested financial assets is aligned with the expected cash outflow profile associated with the settlement of claims in the future.
The amount held in invested funds decreased by 29.2m compared with the previous year, from 654.0m as at 31 January 2015 to 624.8m as at 31 January 2016.
As at 31 January 2016, 92% of the financial assets held by the Group were invested with counterparties with a risk rating of A or above, which is up 10 percentage points on the previous year and reflects the improved credit risk rating of the Groups counterparties.

Gross profit increased by 16.4% to 68.6m 2015: 58.9m, around half of which was due to Destinology, and the number of passengers travelling increased by 9.9%, largely driven by the impact of Destinology.
The Saga Holidays and Titan businesses both delivered increases in revenue and gross profit, driven by a shift in product mix towards higher-value, higher-margin long-haul and third party cruise products.
Saga Cruising delivered revenue of 86.2m, 2.6% above the previous year 2015: 84.0m, driven primarily by improved yields.
Ongoing investment in the ships and the Saga cruise customer experience resulted in a marginal decrease in gross profit of 2.7% to 17.3m 2015: 17.8m.
An overall 12.0% increase in gross profit was partially offset by a 9.0% increase in operating expenses, driven by the full year impact of Destinology.

This was offset against a loss after tax for the period up to this date of 7.9m, resulting in a loss after tax for the year from discontinued operations of 6.9m.
Financial outlook and guidance During the year ending 31 January 2017 insurance profitability is expected to benefit from higher policy numbers, the positive impact of the panel and the ongoing benefits of efficiency improvements.
This will be partially offset by the impact of the recently announced quota share arrangement.
Reserve releases are expected to contribute materially during the year, but at a reduced level from the year ending 31 January2016.
Growth in our tour operating businesses will be largely offset by the impact of the two-month wet dock for Saga Sapphire in the cruise business.
Therefore, profitability for the travel business will be relatively flat year on year.
Subject to market conditions remaining materially consistent, the Group is therefore targeting PBT growth of between 5% and 7% for the year ending 31 January 2017.
At the same time, the Group expects to delever further, benefiting from its strong solvency position in AICL, the initial benefits of the quota share arrangement and our prudent investment strategy.
The additional capital released gradually over the next few years from AICL will provide additional free cash flow and enable an increase in the dividend payout ratio to between 50% and 70% of net earnings, whilst retaining the Groups target debt range of 1.5x to 2.0x Trading EBITDA.
