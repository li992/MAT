GROUP FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 The Group saw a recovering performance in France and an improving Germany provide resilience to the Group result, which was adversely affected by a disappointing UK performance, more so in the first half MAXIMISING of the year as we saw revenue growth in the second half of the year.
The comparison with 2015 is difficult for both statutory and 1 adjusted profit before tax, due to significant one-off items as disclosed in the prior year, but performance of the business SHAREHOLDER excluding these one-off items showed modest improvement in a year of significant underlying change.
The Supply Chain business has had to quickly change focus from Workplace sales to the more complex Networking and Datacenter infrastructure, whilst the German Services business saw a busy period of contract take-on.
VALUE 1 A reconciliation between key adjusted and statutory measures is provided on page 46 of this Group Finance Directors Review.
Further details are provided in note 4 to the Financial Statements, Segment Information.
REVENUE 1 Adjusted revenue for the Group grew by 6.3 per cent to 3,245.4 2 million 2015: 3,054.2 million.
On a constant currency basis, turnover decreased by 0.5 per cent, reflecting the weakness of the pound sterling against all currencies, but primarily against the euro.
Statutory revenue for the Group, including the results of RDC for January 2015, grew 6.1 per cent from 3,057.6 million to 3,245.4 million.
OPERATING PROFIT 1 Adjusted operating profit for the Group decreased 1.0 per cent to 2 86.2 million 2015: 87.1 million.
On a constant currency basis, the decrease was 4.9 per cent.
The UK Segment saw a disappointing 1 decrease of 21.1 per cent in adjusted operating profit.
The German Segment remained a key growth factor for the Group this year, with 1 an increase in adjusted operating profit of 15.4 per cent in constant 2 2 currency and 29.6 per cent in actual currency.
The French Segment 1 returned to profitability, with an adjusted operating profit in constant 2 currency of 3.5 million 2015: 2.2 million loss.
The Groups statutory operating profit of 87.5 million was 2.7 per cent higher than the previous year 2015: 85.2 million.
Tony Conophy Group Finance Director PROFIT BEFORE TAX 1 Adjusted profit before tax decreased by 0.6 per cent from 86.9 2 million to 86.4 million, or 4.3 per cent in constant currency.
It should be noted that the comparative performance in 2015 benefited from a one-off gain of approximately 3 million, which, as we explained in our 2015 Interim Report, was not expected to repeat in future years.
Statutory profit before tax fell 31.3 per cent to 87.1 million 2015: 126.8 million, primarily due to the exceptional gain on disposal of RDC of 42.2 million that occurred in 2015.
The Group saw a recovering performance in France and an improving Germany provide resilience to the Group result, which was adversely affected by a disappointing UK performance, more so in the first half of the year as we saw revenue growth in the second half of the year.

Gross margins in the Supply Chain business exceeded those of both the UK and Germany, demonstrating the effectiveness of Managements French recovery strategy.
Overall gross margin increased from 8.1 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
Administrative expenses increased by 4.5 per cent on a constant 2 2 currency basis and by 17.5 per cent in actual currency.
This increase was driven by non-exceptional restructuring costs alongside increased variable bonus, commission and interressement costs, largely contributing to, or driven by, the increased performance of the business.
As indicated in our 2016 Interim Report, an additional cost of 1.1 million in strategic restructuring has been recorded as an exceptional item in 2016.
1 Overall, the French adjusted operating profit increased from a loss 2 in actual currency of 1.6 million in 2015 to a profit of 2.9 million in 2016, materially improving the overall performance of the Group.
The leases are secured only on the 3 assets that they finance.
Whilst the outstanding balance of customer-specific financing CSF is included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, this balance is offset by contracted future receipts from customers.
Computacenter retains the credit risk on these customers and ensures that credit risk is only taken on customers with a strong credit rating.
The Group does not expect a material increase in the level of CSF facilities, partly, as the Group applies a higher cost of finance to these transactions than customers marginal cost of finance.
NET FINANCE INCOME Net finance income amounted to 0.1 million on a statutory basis in the year 2015: expense of 0.6 million and was impacted by a number of oneoff items, including historical interest charges of 0.3 million relating to routine tax audits completed in Computacenter Germany.
The comparative 2015 finance charges were impacted by the final interest charges relating to the unwind of the discount on the deferred consideration for the purchase of Damax AG of 0.7 million, which was finalised and agreed in June 2015.
1 On an adjusted basis, prior to interest on CSF, net finance income was 0.3 million in 2016 2015: expense of 0.2 million.
TAXATION 1 1 The adjusted tax charge on ordinary activities was 20.6 million 2015: 19.8 million, on an adjusted profit before tax of 86.4 million 2015: 86.9 million.
The Effective Tax Rate ETR was 23.8 per cent 2015: 22.8 per cent.
The 2016 ETR is higher than the previous year, primarily due to increasing cash tax in Germany as the historical tax losses readily available for use expire.
The ETR is lower than Managements expectations, due 1 to a change in the geographic split of adjusted profit before tax, with Frances return to profit being the primary driver.
The statutory tax charge was 23.3 million 2015: 23.7 million on statutory profit before tax of 87.1 million 2015: 126.8 million.
This represents a statutory tax rate of 26.8 per cent 2015: 18.7 per cent.
The exceptional gain on the sale of RDC of 42.2 million recorded in the statutory profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 was not subject to taxation and is the major reason for the movement in the statutory tax rate.
1 The Groups adjusted tax rate continues to benefit from losses utilised on earnings in Germany and also from the reducing corporation tax rate in the UK.
As the German tax losses continue to be utilised, the deferred tax asset, previously recognised as an exceptional tax item, is no longer 1 replenishing.
The utilisation of the asset impacts the statutory tax rate but is considered to be outside of our adjusted tax measure.
In 2016, this impact increased the statutory tax rate by 3.0 per cent.
1 From 2017 onwards the Group expects an increasing adjusted tax rate, as the impact of the German loss utilisation manifests itself through an increasing cash tax payment.
In 2017, the German statutory ETR is expected to increase to circa 28 per cent from circa 26 per cent in 2016, then 1 increase to and settle at circa 32 per cent in 2018, with a direct effect on the Group adjusted ETR.
At 2016 levels of profitability, the increase in 1 German cash tax would raise the Group adjusted ETR from 23.8 per cent in 2016 to circa 28 per cent by 2019, without regard to other factors 1 that could influence the Groups adjusted ETR.
The Group Tax Policy was updated during the year and approved by the Audit Committee and the Board.
The Group makes every effort to pay all the tax attributable to profits earned in each jurisdiction that it operates in.
The Group does not artificially inflate or reduce profits in one jurisdiction to provide a beneficial tax result in another and maintains approved transfer pricing policies and programmes, to meet local compliance requirements, particularly given the implementation of the Group Operating Model.
Virtually all of the statutory tax charge in 2016 was incurred in either the UK or German tax jurisdictions.
Computacenter will recognise provisions and accruals in respect of tax where there is a degree of estimation and uncertainty, including where it relates to transfer pricing, such that a balance cannot fully be determined until accepted by the relevant tax authorities.
There are no material tax risks across the Group.
For 2016, a revised Group Transfer pricing policy was implemented that resulted in a royalty payment charged by Computacenter UK to Computacenter Germany equivalent to one per cent of revenue or 14.2 million.
This royalty charge was driven by the Groups Tax Advisors interpretation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD base erosion and profit shifting requirements and as it is purely tax compliance driven, it is recorded outside of the Segmental results found in note 4 to the Financial Statements, Segment Information.

The most significant item within exceptional items during 2016 was the 3.0 million release of historical fair value adjustments made on the 2009 acquisition of becom Informationssysteme GmbH becom.
This followed the final payment of the contingent consideration to the vendor during 2016.
For further information, refer to note 6 of the Financial Statements.
Due to the materiality and nature of the item, Management decided to classify this one-off gain as exceptional.
As outlined in our 2016 Interim Report, a Line of Business restructure was agreed with Computacenters business in France.
This initiative to reduce the under-utilised resources within our Professional Services arm completed in the second half of 2016, for a cost of 1.0 million.
This restructure has seen Computacenter France exit the direct provision of Group Field Maintenance Services.
This Line of Business had materially decreased over time, leading to significant resourcing overcapacity.
Any residual customer requirement will be sub-contracted to an existing third party provider.
Additionally, as also detailed in the 2016 Interim Report, further provisioning to the existing 2014 Social Plan in France of 0.1 million was also required during the period.
During the third quarter, a Group subsidiary domiciled in Luxembourg, Computacenter PSF SA, was disposed of for a net loss of 0.5 million.
As the principal item in the year to 31 December 2015 was the gain on the disposal of a Group subsidiary, R. D. Trading Limited RDC, of 42.2 million, the current year loss on disposal of a subsidiary has also been classified as exceptional.
EARNINGS PER SHARE 1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased slightly from 53.4 pence in 2015 to 54.0 pence in 2016, due to a lower weighted average number of shares.
The statutory diluted earnings per share decreased from 82.1 pence in 2015 to 52.3 pence in 2016, primarily driven by the impact of the gain on disposal of RDC in 2015.

3 The Group remains highly cash generative and net funds continue to build on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a robust capital base and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
If further funds are not required to be available for investment within the business, either for fixed assets or working capital support, and the distributable reserves are available in the Parent Company, we will aim to return the additional cash to investors through one-off returns of value.
Dividends are paid from the standalone Balance Sheet of the Parent Company, and as at 31 December 2016, the distributable reserves were approximately 262.5 million 2015: 166.7 million.
The Board is pleased to propose a final dividend of 15.0 pence per share.
The interim dividend paid on 14 October 2016 was 7.2 pence per share.
Together with the final dividend, this brings the total ordinary dividend for 2016 to 22.2 pence per share, representing a 3.7 per cent increase on the 2015 total dividend per share of 21.4 pence.
Subject to the approval of shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2017, the proposed dividend will be paid on Friday 9 June 2017.
The dividend record date is set as Friday 12 May 2017, and the shares will be marked ex-dividend on 11 May 2017.
51 GROUP FINANCE DIRECTORS REVIEW CONTINUED CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Details of the Groups capital management policies are included within note 27 to the Financial Statements.
NET FUNDS 3 Net funds increased from 120.8 million at the end of 2015 to 144.5 million as at 31 December 2016.
The Group had no material borrowings.
The Group saw a reduction in its overall cash generation from operations in 2016, with net cash flow from operating activities of 68.2 million 2015: 94.3 million.
Whilst it is encouraging that the year end cash position was strong, it is clear that we have experienced increased cash volatility due to higher product sales, particularly in the fourth quarter, and have agreed longer credit terms with some new product-based customers.
In addition we have seen in the second half of the year an adverse revenue mix changing towards customers with longer credit terms.
Capital expenditure in the year was 22.6 million 2015: 20.6 million, primarily on investments in IT equipment in our business and software tools, to enable us to deliver improved service to our customers, and on the refurbishment of our London office at 100 Blackfriars Road.
Whilst the cash position remains robust, the Group continued to benefit from the extension of an improvement in credit terms with a significant vendor.
This was equivalent to 69.1 million as at 31 December 2016, an increase of 21.3 million from 31 December 2015 47.8 million.
This improvement in credit terms has been in operation since 2009 and whilst the continuation of these terms is not guaranteed and can be withdrawn at any time, the terms are generally available to all material partners of that significant vendor.
The amount of benefit at any one time fluctuates as a direct result of the volume of business with that vendor.
CSF decreased in the year from 5.9 million to 3.9 million.
CSF remains low compared to historical levels, due to a decision to restrict this form of financing in light of the current credit environment and reduced customer demand.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had interest-bearing trade payables of 13.3 million 2015: nil where we have taken advantage of supplier extended payment-term credit facilities within the UK.
This was a short term position taken to provide additional operational payment flexibility and was closed out immediately after balance sheet date.
The interest bearing extended-term payable balances remain classified within trade payables, 3 and are therefore net funds enhancing, at 31 December 2016.
3 3 The Groups net funds position takes account of current asset investments of 30 million 2015: 15 million.
Net funds excluding CSF increased from 126.7 million to 148.4 million by the end of the year.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, and various items that arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into hedging transactions, principally forward exchange contracts or currency swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
As the Group continues to expand its global reach and benefit from lower cost operations in geographies such as South Africa, it has entered into forward exchange contracts to help manage cost increases due to currency movements.
The Groups policy remains that it will not undertake speculative trading in financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate, liquidity and foreign currency risks.
The overall financial instruments strategy is to manage these risks in order to minimise their impact on the financial results of the Group.
The policies for managing each of these risks are set out below.
Further disclosures in line with the requirements of IFRS 7 are included in the Financial Statements.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, other facilities and deposits are at floating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet any foreseeable peak in borrowing requirements.
The 3 Groups positive net funds position was maintained throughout 2016, and at year end was 148.4 million excluding CSF, and 144.5 million including CSF.
Due to strong cash generation over the past three years, the Group is currently in a position where it can finance its requirements from its cash balance, and the Group operates an informal cash pooling arrangement for the majority of Group entities.
During 2015, the Group extended an existing specific committed facility of 40.0 million for a three-year term through to February 2018.
The Group has a Board monitored policy in place to manage its counterparty risk.
This ensures that cash is placed on deposit across a range of reputable banking institutions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, with smaller operations in Belgium, China, Hungary, India, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and the United States of America.
The Group uses an informal cash pooling facility to ensure that its operations outside the UK are adequately funded, where principal receipts and payments are denominated in euros.
For those countries within the Eurozone, the level of non-Euro denominated sales is small and, if material, the Groups policy is to eliminate currency exposure through forward currency contracts.
For the UK, the majority of sales and purchases are denominated in sterling and any material trading exposures are eliminated through forward currency contracts.
52 STRATEGIC REPORT ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 The Group has been increasingly successful in winning international Services contracts, where services are provided in multiple countries.
The Group aims to minimise this exposure by invoicing the customer in the same currency in which the costs are incurred.
For certain contracts, the Groups committed contract costs are not denominated in the same currency as its sales.
In such circumstances, for example where contract costs are denominated in South African rand, the Group eliminates currency exposure for a foreseeable future period on these future cash flows, through forward currency contracts.
In 2016, the Group recognised a gain of 5.3 million 2015: 1.2 million through other comprehensive income in relation to the changes in fair value of related forward currency contracts, where the cash flow hedges relating to firm commitments were assessed to be highly effective.
1 The Group reports its results in pounds sterling.
The weakening of sterling, particularly against the euro, positively impacted 2016 adjusted operating profit by circa 3.5 million.
Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through customer credit limits.
The credit limit is set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer, assessed by using credit rating agencies, and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Groups major customer, disclosed in note 4 to the Financial Statements, consists of entities under the control of the UK Government.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
GOING CONCERN As disclosed in the Directors Report, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Fair balanced and understandable The UK Corporate Governance Code includes a requirement for the Board to consider whether the Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Groups performance, business model and strategy.
Management undertakes a formal process through which it can provide comfort to the Board in making this statement.
