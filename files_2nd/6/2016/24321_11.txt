Basis of presentation The financial information in the Financial Review is on a segmental measurement basis see note 2 and has been prepared on the basis as outlined in note 1 of the financial statements with the exception of the accounting treatment applied to certain associates and joint ventures for which Glencores attributable share of revenues and expenses are presented.
Results are presented pre-significant items unless otherwise stated to provide an enhanced understanding and comparative basis of the underlying financial performance.
Significant items see reconciliation below are items of income and expense which, due to their financial impact and nature or the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are separated for internal reporting and analysis of Glencores results.
Glencore Annual Report 2016 45 Strategic report Financial review Financial results Net income attributable to equity holders increased from a loss of $5 billion in 2015 to a profit of $1.4 billion in 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA was $10,268 million and Adjusted EBIT was $3,930 million, increases of 18% and 81% respectively compared to 2015.
These double digit increases resulted from our continuous focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency initiatives supply chain, contractor management, employee productivity, etc.
with decisive action also taken to reduce supply and associated capex opex, notably within our copper, zinc, coal and oil portfolios.
To a lesser, but still meaningful extent, 2016 also benefited from currency depreciation relative to the US dollar e. g. Kazakhstan 53% lower and South Africa 15% lower, while commodity prices themselves were a relatively minor contributor to the year-on-year progression with a mixed overall net result e. g. net average commodity prices were up for zinc and gold 9% and 8% respectively, offset by reductions in copper and nickel 12% and 19% respectively.
In addition, during 2016, Energy industrial earnings bore an opportunity cost resulting from a corporate risk management decision in Q2 to lock-in economically hedge pricing in respect of a large share of Glencores remaining 2016 future steam coal production.
Cyclical pricing lows were likely reached in a number of key markets in Q1 2016, with large average price increases seen in H2 relative to H1, notably thermal coal GC Newcastle up 55%, coking coal 135%, zinc 33% and nickel 22%.

In percentage terms, albeit from a relatively low 2015 base, nickel and ferroalloys delivered markedly improved contributions, on account of the significantly higher stainless steel production, notably in China.
Energy products Adjusted marketing EBIT was up 17% compared to 2015, with solid contributions from both oil and coal.
Oil declined somewhat from the buoyant comparative prior period, while coal was able to capitalise on market driven supply and quality constraints and concerns, in the aftermath of Chinese policy amendments to curb domestic coal production.
The Agricultural products Adjusted marketing EBIT was down 9% $43 million compared to 2015, in large part due to a lower Viterra Canada contribution.
46 Glencore Annual Report 2016 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Additional information Industrial Adjusted EBITDA increased by 22% to $7,343 million Adjusted EBIT was $1,115 million, compared to negative $292 million in 2015, owing primarily to significant operating cost reductions and productivity efficiencies, comfortably offsetting any near-term volume impact from curtailing output across a number of operations.
The reduction in US dollar costs was also greatly assisted by weaker producer currencies notably, in Kazakhstan, South Africa and Argentina.
The benefits of the H2 rally in seaborne steam coal prices did not fully convert into reported Coal industrial earnings, following the corporate risk decision taken in Q2 2016 to economically hedge a portion of H2 2016 and H1 2017 future coal production.
Reported Coal Industrial Adjusted EBITDA in H1 and H2 2016 was $506 million and $876 million respectively, giving a FY 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1,382 million.
During 2016, the locking-in capping of the effective realised sales price in respect of 44 million tonnes, resulted in an opportunity cost of $980 million being incurred i. e. EBITDA would have been higher in H2 and FY had no such economic hedging been in place.
