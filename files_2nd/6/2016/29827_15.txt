VIABILITY STATEMENT In accordance with provision C. 2.2 of the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Company over a longer period than the 12 months required by the Going Concern provision.
The Board conducted their review for a period of three years.
The Company operates in a market which is prone to cyclicality, tending to follow the UK economic cycle.
It is impacted by Government policy, planning regulation and the mortgage market.
However, the Board considers that the Company has clear visibility over a three-year time horizon.
This period aligns with the average build out time for a development phase with implementable planning permission and all pre-commencement conditions discharged.
This period is also in line with the Groups medium term targets and its operational planning and risk management review periods.
This operational plan, including the Groups income statement, balance sheet, cash ows, KPIs and debt covenants, considers the potential impacts which may arise from the Principal Risks of the business as described on pages 44 to 47.
It includes macro-economic and industry-wide projections as well as matters specic to the Group.
To mitigate the risks inherent in forward-looking projections, the operational plan is subject to sensitivity analysis on a series of realistically possible changes to principal assumptions, as outlined in the Chief Executives statement on page 21.
This sensitivity analysis exed a number of the principal assumptions to model a downside scenario, which reected the potential impact of declining customer confidence and disposable incomes, as may be experienced as a secondary impact to the Group from the UK leaving the EU.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.
