to 25.7 million which was just under 1% of sales.
This decrease is predominantly due to the reduction Disposal of Research Chemicals completed with profit in performance related pay and benefits in 2015 16. on disposal of 130 million.
We expect this to reverse next year and corporate costs will revert back to just over 1% of sales.
ROIC at 17.3% remains well ahead of cost of capital.
Research and Development R&D Special dividend of 150.0 pence paid in February 2016.
Gross expenditure on R&D was 188.0 million, Final dividend of 52.0 pence recommended, resulting which was up 11% compared with 2014 15. in full year dividend up 5% at 71.5 pence.
This represented around 6% of sales, slightly up from previous years.
We have continued to increase our investment in R&D to support growth.
R&D expenditure in Emission Control Technologies ECT and Process Technologies PT accounted for Den Jones around 60% of total spend.

We anticipate that the restructuring programmes we have completed will lead to cost savings of around 34 million per annum from 2016 17 onwards, and around 8 million of savings are included in the fourth quarter of 2015 16.
The charge mainly relates to: restructuring in PT in response to challenging market conditions.
In addition, we have written down some substitute natural gas SNG and upstream oil and gas assets where we expect lower utilisation as a result of reduced growth prospects in these markets: New Businesses, mainly in Fuel Cells where, as previously announced and in view of anticipated market demand, we have completed a review of the business and as a result have impaired it: ECT, primarily as a result of our decision to cease manufacturing activities in Korea in order to optimise our supply chain: Precious Metal Products PMP, where we have completed some restructuring actions in response to the challenging trading conditions: and other charges of approximately 7 million where facilities have been consolidated.

This increase of 8.7 million 214 million in the legacy defined benefit career average was due to an increase in the current service costs caused by section, or 28 million after taking account of the future the low discount rates at 31st March 2015, partly offset by a additional deficit funding contributions from the special 7.1 million past service credit for plan amendments to the purpose vehicle set up in January 2013.

The groups UK pension scheme had a surplus of 100.8 million compared with a deficit of 77.2 million at the start of the year and the deficits in the groups US defined benefit pension schemes decreased by 5.2 million.
The main reasons for the significantly improved positions were the experience gains in the UK caused by updating the underlying data to that from the 1st April 2015 actuarial valuation, the decrease in liabilities caused by the higher discount rates as the yields on high quality corporate bonds increased and the continued deficit funding cash contributions.
