Further explanations of the distinction between the Groups different holdings is provided in note 1 to the accounts on page 137 and also in the Glossary on pages 194 and 195.
COM 43 Financial review continued Profit for the year The Groups profit for the year, attributable to equity shareholders, under IFRS was 317.3 million, 409.5 million lower than 2015.
This was principally due to lower revaluation gains on the Groups shopping centres and retail parks which suffered a net revaluation loss of 13.4 million in 2016 compared with a net gain of 367.5 million in 2015.
Management principally review the Groups profit on an adjusted basis to monitor the Groups underlying earnings as it excludes capital and non-recurring items such as valuation movements, profits or losses on disposal and other one-off exceptional items.
This approach is consistent with other property companies and we follow EPRA guidance to calculate adjusted profit.
A reconciliation of IFRS profit to adjusted profit for the year is shown in table 27.
Analysis of the Groups income statement under IFRS split between underlying Adjusted profit and Capital and other profit is shown in note 2 to the accounts on page 140 and further details of the EPRA adjustments are provided in note 10 on page 148 to the accounts.

The like-for-like portfolio produced 6.5 million higher rental income, acquisitions and disposals added 5.9 million and the Groups developments delivered new income of 5.1 million.
The Groups premium outlet investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets contributed an additional 5.9 million of earnings associated with further sales growth, particularly from Bicester Village.
There was an increase of 3.0 million in administration expenses and finance costs increased marginally by 0.3 million.
The impact of higher debt levels was offset by the benefit of recent refinancing activity, which has reduced the Groups average cost of debt to 3.1%, and 12.1 million of additional interest income at constant exchange rates was received from the Irish loans acquired in October 2015.
The change in the : exchange rate increased earnings by 0.5 million as the sterling value of the Groups overseas net rental income increased by more than the value of the euro-denominated administration and finance costs.
In total, these movements resulted in a 9.4% increase in adjusted profit and a 8.6% uplift in adjusted EPS.

Net rental income from the likefor-like portfolio increased by 2.2% during the year, with the most significant contributions being rent reviews at Union Square, Aberdeen and Bullring, Birmingham and strong trading at Les Terrasses du Port, Marseille.
Like-for-like net rental income growth on the Reported Group properties was 3.4%, whilst for properties held by the Groups proportionally consolidated joint ventures and associates, growth was 0.1%.
Further analysis of net rental income is provided in table 97 of the Additional Disclosures on page 180.
Acquisitions contributed 24.4 million of new income, principally from Grand Central, Birmingham in February 2016 and Dundrum Town Centre, Dublin, associated with the conversion of the majority of the Irish loan portfolio in July 2016.
Disposals reduced income in 2016 by 18.5 million, reflecting the 2015 sales of Drakehouse Retail Park, Sheffield: Bercy 2, Paris and Grand Maine, Angers and the sales in 2016 of Monument Mall, Newcastle: Villebon 2, Paris: Manor Walks, Cramlington and Thurrock Shopping Park, Essex.
Additional income from developments of 5.1 million is principally from those completed in 2015 including Elliotts Field Shopping Park, Rugby, Cyfarthfa Retail Park, Merthyr Tydfil and Jeu fide Paume, Beauvais.

Net administration expenses in 2016 were 46.1 million, an increase of 3.8 million, or 3.0 million at constant exchange rates, compared to 2015.
This increase was associated with additional staff costs due to higher headcount to support our new acquisitions and Irish operations which were partly offset by additional management fee income from Ireland.
COM 45 Financial review continued Cost ratio The EPRA cost ratio for the year ended 31 December 2016 was22.6%, a decrease of 50bp compared to 2015.
The ratio is calculated on a proportionally consolidated basis, excluding premium outlets, in line with EPRA best practice, and reflects total operating costs as a percentage of gross rental income.
The ratio is not necessarily comparable between different real estate companies as business models and expense accounting and classification practices vary.
The cost ratio calculation is included as table 99 of the Additional Disclosures on page 181.
Theratio of property costs fell from 11.3% to 10.7% reflecting lower vacancy costs, whilst theratio of net administration costs to gross rental income was 10bp higher in 2016 at 11.9%, associated with increased headcount to support the recent acquisitions and forthcoming development projects.
Loss on the sale of properties During 2016, we sold eight properties raising proceeds of 635 million, after deducting selling costs.
Compared to their valuation at 31 December 2015, these sales resulted in a loss of 24.0 million, 85% of which related to three retail parks: Thurrock Shopping Park, Essex: Manor Walks, Cramlington: and Westmorland, Cramlington.
The losses were consistent with the impact of the outward yield shift suffered across the rest of the UK retail parks portfolio during 2016 explained in the Valuation change section of this Review on page 48.
Share of results of joint ventures and associates, including investments in premium outlets As explained on page 43, for management reporting purposes we review the Groups premium outlet investments separately from the rest of the Groups other properties.
Due to the nature of the Groups control, VIA Outlets is accounted for as a joint venture and Value Retail is accounted for as an associate.
The operating performance of our premium outlet investments is described on pages 32 and 33 of the Business Review and the aggregated financial contribution to the Group is shown in table 104 of the Additional Disclosures section on page 184.
Share of results of joint ventures, including VIA Outlets The Group has interests in 15 joint ventures and the share of the results of joint ventures under IFRS for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 169.2 million 2015: 246.8 million as analysed in table 31.
Further details are provided in note 12 to the accounts.

The lower gains on these properties are consistent with the year-on-year change in revaluation movements on the Groups wholly-owned property portfolio.
Net rental income from the Groups share of Property joint ventures was 14.1 million higher than in 2015, principally due to the conversion to property ownership of Dundrum Town Centre, Dublin in July 2016 which is held jointly with Allianz.
On an adjusted earnings basis, profit from the Groups joint ventures was 26.5 million higher in 2016.
46 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL REVIEW Share of results of associates, including Value Retail The Group has two associates: Value Retail VR, and a 10% interest in Nicetoile, Nice, where the Group is the asset manager and which is proportionally consolidated for management reporting purposes.
On an IFRS basis, the share of results of associates for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 137.1 million 2015: 160.6 million, of which 135.2 million related to VR and principally related to the property valuation uplift of 120.0 million.
On an adjusted earnings basis the results of associates were 24.9 million 2015: 18.1 million, of which 23.6 million related to VR.
The yearon-year increase resulted from strong trading, particularly at Bicester, Oxford: Kildare, Dublin: and the two Spanish Villages, La Roca and Las Rozas.
See note 13 of the accounts on page 157 for further details on the Groups associates.
Total adjusted earnings contribution from premium outlets In 2016, the Groups two investments in premium outlets contributed 29.8 million to adjusted profit, 6.6 million higher than in 2015 5.9 million at constant exchange rates, of which 6.5 million related to increased earnings at Value Retail.
In addition, the Group has advanced loans to Value Retail, from which the Group received 4.2 million 2015: 5.3 million of interest income in 2016.
Further details of the aggregated profit contribution from our premium outlets investments is provided in table 104 of the Additional Disclosures section on page 184.
Finance costs Net finance costs on a proportionally consolidated basis, as shown in note 2 to the accounts, totalled 96.6 million in 2016, compared with 98.1 million in 2015.
Adjusted finance costs, which exclude items such as debt cancellation costs and the change in the fair value of derivatives which are not included in adjusted earnings, totalled 93.5 million in 2016, an increase of 9.4 million in 2015, or 0.3 million at constant exchange rates.
The calculation of adjusted finance costs in shown in table 110 on page 186.
In 2016, interest received from our Irish loan assets of 17.4 million was largely offset by the additional interest expense associated with the increased level of borrowing to support the acquisitions in Birmingham and Ireland.
During 2016, the Groups weighted average interest rate reduced to 3.1%, compared to 3.8% for 2015.
This reflected refinancing activity which is explained in the Financing and cash flow section of this Financial Review on page 51.
Interest capitalised during the year was 5.1 million 2015: 5.3 million and principally related to the Groups developments in Leeds and Southampton which both opened in the final quarter of 2016.
Tax The Group has tax exempt status in the UK, France and Ireland and is exempt from corporation tax on rental income and gains arising on property sales.
On a proportionally consolidated basis, the tax charge for 2016 remained low at 2.7 million 2015: 1.6 million, the increase being due to restrictions on the use of tax losses across the Group and increased tax in France.
We have published Hammersons Approach to Tax for the year ending 31 December 2017 on the Groups website www.
com which provides further information about the Groups tax strategy.
Dividend The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 13.9pence per share.
Together with the interim dividend of 10.1 pence, the total for 2016 is 24.0 pence, representing an increase of 7.6% compared with the prior year.
The final dividend is payable on 27 April 2017 in the UK and 28 April 2017 for South African investors, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 17 March 2017.
4.9 pence will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the balance of 9.0 pence paid as a normal dividend.
The Company will not be offering a scrip dividend alternative, but for shareholders who wish to receive their dividend in the form of shares, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP will be available.
South African secondary listing To ensure Hammerson is accessing the widest pool of international capital, the Company completed a secondary listing of its shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange JSE in September 2016.
Hammersons register already included a highly diversified global shareholder base, including a number of South African funds, and the listing further extended the depth and variety of investors and improved liquidity for existing shareholders.
The calculation of headline earnings per share as required by the JSE is in note 10C to the accounts on page 149.
COM 47 Financial review continued Net assets During 2016, equity shareholders funds increased by 259 million, or 4.7%, to 5,776 million at 31 December 2016.
Net assets, calculated on an EPRA basis, were 5,865 million and on a per share basis, net assets increased by 29 pence to 7.39.

Adjustments in accordance with EPRA best practice shown in note 10D to the accounts on page 149.
Dividends include the scrip dividend payment of 44.1 million which reduced EPRA NAV per share by 8 pence.
The increase in EPRA net asset value was principally due to the valuation surplus on the Groups premium outlets which totalled 138 million.
Adjusted profit increased NAV by 29 pence, although this was largely offset by dividends, which reduced NAV by 25 pence.
Exchange and other principally includes foreign exchange movements associated with the strengthening of the euro during the year which increased EPRA NAV per share by 14 pence.
Further details of the reconciliation between IFRS and EPRA net assets are in note 10D to the accounts on page 149.

During 2016, the Groups proportionally consolidated portfolio suffered a net decrease in valuation of 13 million.
In the UK, shopping centre values fell by 6 million and retail parks by 118 million.
39 million of this adverse movement was due tothe increase in stamp duty land tax in April 2016 and represents the majority of the adverse Development and other movement for both portfolios.

Equivalent yields increased by an average of 45bp for the UK retail parks portfolio, resulting in a valuation reduction of 120 million.
In France, investor demand for prime assets continues to be strong and yields for our portfolio have reduced by an average of30bp during the year, equivalent to a valuation increase of 114 million.
This increase was partly offset by the rebasing of ERVs at Jeu fide Paume, Beauvais which accounts for the portfolios adverse income change of 27 million.
The centre opened in late 2015 and has suffered from weak trading and letting in2016.
The 14 million Development and other adverse valuation movement includes 6 million reflecting increased transfer taxes in Paris which were introduced at the beginning of the2016.
In Ireland, there was a 3 million valuation gain, representing income growth of 62 million being largely offset by the recognition of 59 million of purchasers costs to secure the properties.
There was also a 8 million gain in relation to the Irish development sites, principally Dublin Central, included within the UK Other and developments portfolio.
The remainder of the 34 million gain in this latter portfolio was principally in relation to the recently completed schemes in Leeds and Southampton.
In addition to the Groups proportionally consolidated portfolio, the premium outlets portfolio produced a revaluation surplus of 138 million, of which Value Retail contributed 120 million and VIA Outlets 18 million.
Investor demand continues to strengthen for the sector and the valuation performance was driven by income growth, which accounted for two-thirds of the surplus, the remainder principally being due to inward yield shift.
Further valuation and yield analysis is included in tables 100 and 101 in the Additional Disclosures section on page 182.
Capital expenditure Capital expenditure totalled 1,533 million in 2016, although included the conversion to property assets of the Irish loans which were acquired in October 2015 for 690 million and further details are in note 12D to the accounts.
Acquisitions also included the purchase of Grand Central, Birmingham for 350 million.
Development expenditure totalled 138 million, principally on the completion of the developments in Leeds and Southampton.
Other capital expenditure of 55 million included refurbishment and asset management initiatives including the reconfiguration of Place des Halles, the new Apple store at Les Terrasses du Port and a number of smaller scale UK retail park projects.

As the annual IPD indices have yet to be published, the benchmark returns shown above have been estimated and are calculated on a weighted 75:25 UK:France basis.
COM 49 Financial review continued Property returns Table 36 compares the financial returns generated in 2016 with benchmark IPD indices.
The Groups benchmark is the IPD All Retail Universe total return weighted 75:25 between the UK and French indices.
The All Retail Universe indices include returns from all types of retail property.
As the annual IPD benchmarks for both countries are not available until after this Annual Report has been published, the benchmarks have been estimated and are subject to revision.
The UK IPD data is based on the Quarterly All Retail Universe to December 2016.
As there is less data available for France, for the purposes of calculating the Group IPD benchmarks, we have assumed that the French benchmark is equal to the returns generated by our French portfolio of 8.3%.
The Groups total return was 5.7%, 230 basis points higher than the estimated benchmark.
The Groups outperformance was driven by the property portfolio held by our premium outlet investments which produced a total return of 15.1%.
The total return for the UK investment portfolio was 1.9%, which was 20 basis points higher than the UK benchmark.
The Ireland investment portfolio, which was included from the date of property acquisition in July, generated a total return of 2.3% and reflects the impact of recognising the acquisition-related costs, such as stamp duty and advisor fees.
In 2016, the Reported Group portfolio generated a total return of 3.8%, whilst properties held by our joint ventures and associates generated a total return of 7.5%.
Both portfolios exceeded the estimated Group benchmark, the performance of the latter portfolio being boosted by the strong return from premium outlets.
An analysis of the capital and total returns by business segment is included in table 100 on page 182.
Shareholder returns For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Groups return on shareholders equity was 7.8%, which compares to the Groups estimated cost of equity of 7.6%.
The income element of the return on equity tends to be relatively low given the prime nature of the property portfolio.
The capital element of the return was driven by the portfolios valuation performance during the year.
Hammersons total shareholder return for 2016 was -0.7%, which represents an outperformance of the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index by 780 basis points as the wider index has suffered larger share price reductions than the Company.
Over the last five years, the Groups average annual total shareholder return has been 13.8%, compared to 14.9% for the FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK index.
Investment in joint ventures and associates, including investments in premium outlets Investment in joint ventures, including VIA Outlets At 31 December 2016, the Groups investment in joint ventures totalled 3,737 million compared with 3,214 million at the beginning of the year, an increase of 523 million.
Keychanges during 2016 were the part disposals by the Group of 50% stakes in Grand Central, Birmingham and Westquay Watermark, Southampton and the conversion to property of Dundrum Town Centre.
We also made an additional investment in VIA Outlets associated with its acquisition of three outlet centres in the second half of 2016.
The movement in investments in joint ventures during 2016 is shown in table 37 and further analysis is provided in note 12D of the accounts.

The increase was principally due to foreign exchange translation gains of 60 million, the acquisition of additional sponsor interests in VR for 41 million and revaluation gains on VRs property portfolio which totalled 120 million.
Two-thirds of the revaluation gains related to income growth with the balance being due toyield compression and development profits.
Further analysis is provided in note 13 to the accounts on page 158.
50 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL REVIEW Total investment in premium outlets At 31 December 2016, the Groups total investment in premium outlets, representing our share of VR and VIA, calculated on a consistent basis with EPRA NAVand including the Groups loans to VR, totalled 1,309 million 2015: 1,003 million.
The increased investment in the year was due to a combined valuation surplus of 138 million, additional investment of 112 million and foreign exchange gains of 76 million.
These were partly offset by VR repaying 55 million of loans to the Group.
Further details of the Groups aggregated investment in the sector are provided in table 105 of the Additional Disclosures on page 184. Financing and cash flow Our financing strategy is to generally borrow on an unsecured basis on the strength of the Groups covenant to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged tomaintain short-term liquidity and toensure an appropriate maturity profile.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with which we maintain strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The Board approves financing guidelines against which it monitors the Groups financial structure.
These guidelines, together with the relevant metrics, are summarised in table 38 which illustrates the Groups robust financial position.

EBITDA includes the interest received from the Irish loan assets.
See table 107 on page 185 for supporting calculation.
Net debt position On a proportionally consolidated basis, net debt at 31 December 2016 was 3,413 million.
This comprised borrowings of 3,543 million and cash and deposits of 130 million and a supporting calculation is included in table 108 on page 186.
During the year, net debt increased by 445 million and the movement is analysed in table 39.

COM 51 Financial review continued We have continued to reduce the Groups average cost of debt with new issuance at low rates of interest whilst ensuring a solid funding platform.
The weighted average cost of debt for 2016 was 3.1%, a reduction of 70 basis points compared with 2015.
Key financing transactions during 2016 included: a seven-year 500 million bond was issued in March at a coupon of 1.75%, the Groups lowest ever bond coupon a 420 million unsecured revolving credit facility was signed in April with a syndicate of eight banks for a maturity of five years and may be extended by a further two years.
The facility has an initial margin of 90 basis points and replaced a 150 million revolving credit facility due to mature in April 2017 which featured an initial margin of 150 basis points a 400 million private placement signed in November with funding received in January 2017.
This consists of senior notes denominated in euro, sterling and US dollar and have aweighted average coupon of 1.7% and maturities of seven, nine, 11 and 14 years.
During the year we have benefited from low floating rates on the 1.5 billion facility used to fund the acquisitions in Ireland and Birmingham.
The financing activity noted above will enable the Group to cancel the remaining commitments on this facility in early 2017.
At 31 December 2016, liquidity, comprising cash and undrawn committed facilities, was 592 million, compared with 931 million at the end of 2015.
Exposure to exchange translation differences on euro-denominated assets is managed through a combination of euro borrowings and derivatives.
At 31 December 2016, the value of euro-denominated liabilities as a proportion of the value of euro-denominated assets was 79%, compared with 90% at the beginning of the year.
Interest on euro debt also acts as a hedge against exchange differences arising on net income from our overseas businesses.
The strengthening of the euro against sterling during 2016 has resulted in modest gains to net asset value and earnings.
The Groups unsecured bank facilities and the private placement senior notes contain financial covenants that the Groups gearing, defined as the ratio of net debt to shareholders equity, should not exceed 150% and that interest cover, defined as net rental income divided by net interest payable, should not be less than 1.25 times.
The same gearing covenant applies to three of the Companys unsecured bonds, whilst the remaining bonds contain a covenant that gearing should not exceed 175%.
These figures are on a proportionally consolidated basis and the bonds have no covenant for interest cover.
Hammersons financial ratios are comfortably within these covenants.
Fitch and Moodys rate Hammersons unsecured credit as A and Baa1 respectively.
Moodys changed its outlook from stable to negative in June 2016 following the UKs EU referendum decision, stating that the heightened economic uncertainty could dampen prospects for the UK real estate sector.
This was consistent with Moodys change in outlook for the UK sovereign rating from stable to negative.
Loan to value LTV New calculation methodology The calculation of the Groups LTV has been amended to include the Groups share of net assets from our premium outlet investments in VR and VIA Outlets within the value denominator.
These assets were previously excluded from the calculation.
The Group has been acquiring interests in these investments over recent years and at 31 December 2016 our combined interest was 1.2 billion.
The omission of these investments has become more significant and the change in methodology provides better comparability with our peer group.
The amendment is consistent with our gearing calculation and the proportionally consolidated basis of the Groups financial information as explained on page 43.
Under the new methodology, the Groups LTV ratio at 31 December 2016 was 36% 2015: 34%, compared to 41% at 31 December 2016 2015: 38% under the previous methodology.
The supporting calculations for both bases are in table 109 of the Additional Disclosures on page 186.
At 31 December 2016 the Groups share of net debt in VR and VIA Outlets was 468 million.
On a proforma basis, proportionally consolidating this with the Groups share of the VR and VIA Outlets property valuations, would increase the Groups gearing from 59% to 67%, whilst the LTV would be 39%.
