STRATEGIC REPORT GLOBAL SUPPORT CONTINUED GROUP FUNCTIONS IN 2016 A number of the Group functions, notably legal, finance, tax, corporate development, investor relations and communications, were closely involved in delivering the addition of Penton Information Services during 2016.
This also drew on the capabilities of the new Group treasury team formed at the end of 2015.
The team focuses on optimising the use of Informas balance sheet and improving the management of the Groups foreign exchange and cash positions.
As part of the acquisition, Group treasury engaged with international investors to successfully finance the debt portion of the Penton consideration.
The Group functions within Global Support are also responsible for internal initiatives that engage all colleagues across the company.
During 2016, this included the Inside Informa initiative detailed in the Our Talented People section on page 34.
The central travel and venues team implemented a Group-wide travel management system designed to track and reduce the cost of business travel and improve the support available to colleagues when travelling for Informa, a mitigating action for one of the Groups principalrisks.
2017 PRIORITIES Global Supports role and objectives remain unchanged for 2017: to provide effective and agile support to the Group as it pursues its growth ambitions.
Specific projects underway for 2017 include the delivery of an upgraded enterprise resource platform, designed to provide efficient and effective shared finance services at scale as we continue to grow and seek further operational fitness see page 55 for more details.
The Group risk and compliance team is introducing an updated code of conduct and set of core global policies early in the year, accompanied by new training and Group-wide communications.
These documents reflect our compliance with new regulations, covering our obligations and expectations as an increasingly international Group working with many different stakeholders.
The project management office that has been focused on overseeing the GAP investment programme is being re-purposed as this programme moves into the final phase of its delivery.
Itsexpertise is being combined with the project management specialists sitting throughout Global Support intoasingle change delivery office, which will centralise the management andsupport of major initiatives and act as a centre of excellence, innovation and best practice.
The formation of this office is also designed to help mitigate the principal risk of ineffective change management, identified by the Board in 2016.

com STRATEGIC FINANCIAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS INVESTING IN A MODERN FINANCE CAPABILITY TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH LOUISE GULLIFORD Global Process Owner, Global Support Global Supports objectives remain to provide effective and agile support to the Group as it pursues its In Global Support, there is a constant drive to ensure that the com mon systems and processes growth ambitions provided across the Group from finance to HR and technology are efficient, scalable and optimised to support Informa as it grows.
One of the Divisions recent initiatives, and an example of ongoing investment in our capabilities, is the launch of an upgraded Group-wide enterprise resource platform ERP to consolidate, standardise and upgrade our financial operations globally.
Louise Gulliford, a member of the project and a global process owner for the purchase-to-pay process explained: A lot of our financial processing tools and processes were established when the Group was more distributed, and worked well.
But as Informa grows, especially as new businesses come into the Group, we have an opportunity to be more efficient, consistent and global in the way our financial operations work.
Global Support is introducing a new ERP to underpin finance activities carried out in the three regional shared service centres, including credit control, accounts payable and accounting, and the activities handled in each Division and within Group Finance, including consolidation and management reporting.
It will standardise and modernise the way financial operations are run in each location and Division, creating efficiencies and allowing us to take on new businesses and activities quicker and more effectively in the future.
The system will also provide more consistent and timely financial insight and data to management teams.
Louise continued, It was exciting to join the project team for this initiative.
Ive worked in Informas European shared service centre for nearly 15 years and progressed through many roles, which gives you an ideal view on how the Groups finance processes work, where a new system and process could upgrade how things currently run, and where we will need to target training and support.

Over the last three years, as part of the Growth Acceleration Plan, we have been focused on making the most of these opportunities.
Aparticular focus has been on financial discipline and maximising our cash generation to give the Group stability and the flexibility to fund ongoing operations, pay a growing dividend and consistently reinvest for growth.
In 2016, Informa reported another consistent financial performance, producing a third consecutive year of growth in revenue, adjusted profit, earnings, free cash flow and dividends.
This was combined with further progress in implementing the 2014-2017 Growth Acceleration Plan.
As part of this, we continued to expand and scale internationally, most notably through the addition of Penton Information Services in November, for 1.2bn.
Reported and organic revenue growth improved to 11.0% and1.6% respectively, reflecting good underlying operational progress, combined with favourable currency movements and strong returns from acquisitions.
This translated into 13.8% growth in adjusted operating profit and 6.6% adjusted EPS growth.
Reported operating profit and EPS were 198.8m and 23.6p, principally reflecting adjusted operating profit, acquisition related items, amortisation andimpairment.
In 2016, our operating cash conversion remained strong at 95%, ensuring further growth in free cash flow to 305.7m.
We added a number of businesses to the Group in 2016, culminating in the addition of Penton.
In line with our balanced approach to financing through GAP, we used a mixture of debt and equity to fund this acquisition, raising 715m through a fully subscribed rights issue.

com INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED INCOME STATEMENT Our strategy of growth and scale led to a strong increase in Group revenue in 2016, up 11.0% to 1,345.7m, including a 1.6% increase on an organic basis.
This converted to adjusted operating profit of 416.1m, some 13.8% higher than the prior year and unchanged on an organic basis.
This reflects that it was the peak year of investment for GAP, with both higher operating expenditure and increased depreciation from capital expenditure impacting the cost base.

MEASUREMENTS AND ADJUSTMENTS In addition to the statutory results, adjusted results are prepared for adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per shareas the Board consider these to be the most appropriate way to measure the Groups underlying performance in a way that iscomparable to the prior year.
This is in line with similar adjusted measures used by our peer companies and therefore facilitates comparisons.
Adjusted results exclude the adjusting items outlined in the next section.
Organic measures of revenue and adjusted operating profit refer to measures of growth where reported amounts are adjusted toremove material acquisitions and disposals and to eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
However, organic measures are not currently adjusted to exclude the effect of events phasing, such as for biennial or triennial events.
Growth in 2016 can be analysed as follows: Acquisitions 2015 Organic and Currency Reported 2016 m growth disposals growth growth m Revenue 1,212.2 1.6% 1.2% 8.2% 11.0% 1,345.7 Adjusted operating profit 365.6 0.0% 3.4% 10.4% 13.8% 416.1 ADJUSTING ITEMS The adjusting items below have been excluded from adjusted results.
The total charge against operating profit for adjusting items was 217.3m in 2016 2015: 129.1m with the major element comprising amortisation of acquired intangible assets and impairment ofgoodwill and intangibles.

com INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED The Groups proactive and targeted acquisition programme led to an increase in intangible asset amortisation arising from acquired intangibles to 116.7m.
This comprised 49.5m for amortisation of book lists and journal titles, 17.9m for database content and 49.3m related to exhibitions and conferences.
Intangible asset amortisation arising from software assets and product development isnot treated as an adjusting item and so is included within the calculation of adjusted operating profit.
Our strategy to increase operational focus and manage ourportfolio more proactively, combined with some trading weakness in individual markets, led to an impairment of goodwill and intangibles of 67.7m.
This mainly relates to the domestic conference businesses in the Knowledge & Networking Division, some of which have since been put under review, including Germany and Australia, as well as a small impairment in some historically acquired businesses in Brazil in the Global Exhibitions Division.
Acquisition and integration costs are the one-off costs associated with acquiring and integrating individual acquisitions.
In 2016, this included 28.6m related to the Penton acquisition.
The implementation of GAP led to further restructuring and reorganisation costs through 2016, totalling 7.2m.
This mainly relates tothe consolidation of our books operations into a singleglobal business within Academic Publishing and the ongoing rationalisation programme in the Knowledge & Networking Division.
At the half year stage, we wrote down the loan note related to the sale of our Corporate Training businesses in 2013, reflecting the underperformance of the business post-sale and, hence, low likelihood of repayment.
This has been reflected in the full year results too, with a full impairment recognised of 39.9m.
This is balanced by a 4.0m gain due to the part-recovery of a different loan note relating to Robbins Gioia, which was sold separately to the other training businesses.
Following these results, both Performance Improvement and Robbins Gioia present positions where there is no further exposure to the Group.
There were also 3.9m of lossesin aggregate from a number of other small business disposals.
In line with our GAP approach to funding, on announcement of the Penton acquisition, we entered into a forward foreign exchange contract to hedge our exposure to US Dollar and Sterling fluctuations on the 701.5m proceeds of the Rights Issue, which would part-fund the US Dollar denominated consideration.
Over the course of the period between announcement and completion of thedeal, Sterling weakened significantly and this led to a gain on the hedge of 58.9m.

This includes delivering returns in excess of the Groups weighted average cost of capital and being accretive to earnings in the first full year of ownership.
For some selective acquisitions, the Group will take a longer-term view on these metrics, to allow time for full integration of the acquired business, coupled with additional investment to maximise long-term returns.
