21 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Travis Perkins plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Strategic Report Market outlook Technical guidance for 2017 The outlook for the Groups end markets remains mixed although The Group is providing the following technical guidance for 2017: the long term requirement for more homes in the UK remains unchanged as does the structural underinvestment in the repair Effective tax rate of around 20% and maintenance of existing dwellings, commercial and industrial The Groups interest charge will be similar to 2016 buildings and infrastructure.
Capital expenditure of around 170m 190m, excluding The depreciation of sterling, particularly against the US dollar investment in freehold property and Euro, is driving cost price inflation pressures.
The Group is employing numerous strategies to deal with cost price inflation, Property profits of around 20m including switching to UK sourced products where possible, Progressive dividend policy, underpinned by strong increasing sourcing direct from manufacturers and improving cash generation efficiency, as well as passing genuine cost inflation through to customers where it cannot be avoided.
Given all UK based building material distributors are likely to be in a similar position: the Group is well placed to deal with these effects.
The Group anticipates that pressure on consumer discretionary spending from rising inflation could impact secondary housing transactions in the second half of 2017.
Fewer housing transactions will have a direct impact on merchant sales volume and it is generally accepted that this impacts merchant volumes with a 6-9 month lag.
Any significant reduction in consumer confidence is likely to have a more pronounced impact on big-ticket purchases such as kitchens and bathrooms which make up around 10% of the Groups sales.
The Group anticipates that potential volume reductions in 2017 will be broadly offset by price inflation.
The Groups Contracts businesses are more sensitive to the rate of new commercial, industrial and infrastructure construction.
Uncertainty in this sector is both to the upside and downside and no clear pattern has yet emerged as to which projects might be accelerated or deferred or the extent to which the Government will support infrastructure investment.
Given the mixed outlook for the Groups end markets, the Group has adopted a cautious stance until end market demand becomes clearer.
Despite current uncertainty, significant investment opportunities remain to achieve strong incremental returns on capital and the Group will maintain its discipline in allocating capital to those businesses where significant structural competitive advantage can be built.
The Group believes that these investments will underpin continued outperformance in its end markets, increase market share and improve profitability and returns in the future.

During the year, following a change to tax legislation in 2015, the Group paid 42m to HMRC in respect of these unresolved disputes and offset an unrelated 10m payment on account against HMRCs payment demand.
Furthermore, the Group has retained in its balance sheet a 19m provision for unpaid tax on an unresolved dispute, which will only become payable if the dispute is resolved in HMRCs favour.
The Group is determined to pursue the cases, but given the lack of agreement with HMRC at this stage in the interpretation of key areas, coupled with the current tax litigation environment and HMRCs policy for pursuing such a route the Group has continued to recognise a provision for the disputed amounts.
The Group has not recognised any potential upside in its income statement for the amounts paid over, which it hopes will be repaid in future.
This is considered appropriate given the uncertainty involved in this process and meets the requirements of IAS 12.46 for recognition of a provision.
