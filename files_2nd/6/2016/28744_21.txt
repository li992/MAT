Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 93 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Financial Review Funding Outlook for 2017 At 31 December 2016 the Group had net debt of 1,238.7m.
The Group We are pleased with our performance in 2016.
Our organic growth has over 72m of centrally held funds and 204m of available undrawn of 3.0% is at its highest level for ten years with Pest Control growing committed facilities.
The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at the year end ahead of the global market and Hygiene showing ongoing performance was 2.5x.
The Companys credit rating was reaffirmed at BBB with a momentum.
In addition, we have exceeded our financial targets, Stable outlook.
We are committed to maintaining a BBB rating and, growing Ongoing Revenues by 12.6%, Ongoing Operating Profit by 11.5%and delivering 156.4m in Free Cash Flow.
based on our expectations for the coming year and our strong cash flow projections for 2017, we are confident in doing so.
Conditions in France remain difficult and we face continued challenges The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing in reversing margin declines and further improving service productivity.
the accounts on the basis that the Groups strong liquidity position Elsewhere, prospects in the majority of our markets are good and we and ability to reduce capital expenditure or expenditure on bolt-on are confident of making further operational and financial progress in the acquisitions are sufficient to meet the Groups forecast funding needs, coming year.
In addition, our M&A pipeline looks particularly strong and including those modelled in a downside case.
we anticipate ongoing successful execution of M&A in 2017.
Further details on the assessment of the viability and liquidity of the Group is provided in the viability statement on page 34. Dividend The Group adopts a progressive dividend policy with dividend Jeremy Townsend payments related to the level of Free Cash Flow available.
The Group Chief Financial Officer and aims to pay dividends twice a year and the level of each dividend is Chief Information Officer decided by the Board.
When determining the level of dividend each 22 February 2017 year, the Board considers the following: cash generation in the year and forecast future cash generation: cash availability at the point of dividend distribution: and cash required to invest in capital expenditure and acquisitions.
Dividend growth is set to run ahead of profit growth in the short term atconstant exchange rates, and consequently the level of dividend cover will reduce over time.
Dividend cover is currently at 3.2x 2015:2.7x using adjusted measures.
Free Cash Flow cover is currently at 2.8x 2015:3.0x.
This policy should ensure we can deliver stable, secure dividend growth for many years to come.
Following an encouraging performance in 2016, and in anticipation of further progress in 2017, the Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 2016 of 2.38p per share, payable to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 7 April 2017, to be paid on 17 May 2017.
This equates to a full year dividend of 3.37p per share, an increase of 15.0% compared to 2015.
Geopolitical events There have been a number of significant global political events in 2016, including Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States.
In July 2016 we noted our position as a global business with c. 90% of revenues derived from outside the UK and with minimal cross-border trading.
The global economic environment continues to be uncertain with high levels of volatility in exchange and commodity markets and with international trading arrangements potentially subject to significant change.
We continue to monitor the potential implications of geopolitical change on our trading and financing environment.
Weremain of the view that the defensive nature of our core categories, combined with the geographic location and spread of our operations, place us in a relatively strong position to mitigate such risks going forward and to take advantage of any potential opportunities that the changes may bring.
