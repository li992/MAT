Strategic report Financial review I am delighted to Chief Financial report a strong set of results Officers review for 2016, which continues the trend we have been building over the last couple of years.
Scott Egan Group Financial Officer We are firmly on track to deliver on all our stated objectives, both operational and strategic, and are now in a position to set our sights higher on achieving our best-in-class ambitions.
2016 saw further excellent progress on our transformation programme and turnaround.
Related to this, there continues to be a significant number of accounting adjustments impacting the financial statements as we divest of businesses and invest heavily in the future performance of the organisation.
For these reasons we refer across our Annual Report and Accounts to a number of underlying performance measures which we believe are a clearer way of fully understanding the performance and progress of RSA at this point.
We expect the number and quantum of accounting adjustments to reduce in 2017, which will in itself be the last year where material reorganisation costs sit outside of RSAs underwriting result.
For further information on these measures Underwriting Underlying please refer to pages 190 to 191.
