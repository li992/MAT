FinAnCiAl reVieW Overall, the financial performance of the continuing Group during the year has been robust despite price deflation which has reduced revenues by 5.8% to 422.3 million.
Product group profit margins have increased to 15.6% despite the delayed margin benefit of milk input cost deflation due to the average one years cheese maturation time.
However, the very difficult conditions in the liquid milk market persisted throughout 2015 and our discontinued Dairies business made pre-exceptional operating losses of 33.3 million in the nine months before its sale.
Underlying cash generation from the retained business was strong and this will continue in the future.
However, overall net debt increased by 30 million in the year due to significant losses in the Dairies business, pre-completion separation and transactional costs as well as the demineralised whey and GOS investment at Davidstow.
However, these costs will not be incurred in future.
