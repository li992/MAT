An initial mineral resource estimate for the PGM pittable reserves followed by underground operations.
Viksha project in Karelia comprised 9.5 Moz of PE, making During the year, Polymetal performed an extensive Viksha one of the largest open-pittable PGM resources in the exploration campaign at Nezhda and is now much more world.
The depth of the open-pit is 150 m below surface confident about proceeding with Stage 2 of the development, with an average thickness of 7 m. In 2017, we will proceed which will lead to commercial production within four years.
A feasibility study for an ore reserve estimate is planned for Q3 2019.
Diamond drilling totalling 39 km was carried out at ore Zone 1 of the Nezhda property in 2016.
141 ore intercepts Prospecting drilling activities at the Kuolisma property, have been traced in the southeast part of ore Zone 1 with a new ore licence area, totalled 9 km, as a result of which an average thickness of 5.3 m, and average grades from platinum and palladium mineralisation zones were identified.
At the northwestern part of ore zone 1, 121 ore intercepts have been identified with an average thickness of 20.9 m, and grades from 1.1 g t to 18.7 g t for gold and 1.4 to 49.6 g t for silver.
Metallurgical testing was performed, generating positive results, both in terms of low concentrate yield and attractive recovery levels into flotation and gravitation concentrates.
In 2017, further exploration of ore Zone 1 and adjacent areas is planned to expand open-pittable resources.
We also plan to perform Viksha Nezhda geomechanical and mining method studies.

We have begun an ongoing review of the risk and H&S procedures at all our operations.
While we have introduced major changes to the risk management systems and seen an improvement in the underground safety record, sadly there were four fatalities at our sites during 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.
