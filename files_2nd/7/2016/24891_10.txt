Costs Operations The Companys all-in sustaining cost was reduced by 13% in 2016 to Production $11.2 per silver equivalent ounce driven by Inmaculadas very competitive $8.7 per silver equivalent ounce $644 per gold equivalent The overall production target for 2017 is 37.0 million silver equivalent ounce.
A full year of production at Inmaculada, better than expected ounces, which consists of 17 million ounces from Inmaculada, grades and operational initiatives contributed to the reduction.

This represents an 18% improvement on 2015 2015: 6.8 million ounces with tonnage and grades strong throughout the year as well as better than expected silver recoveries.
Costs In 2016, all-in sustaining costs fell by 4% to $13.7 per silver equivalent ounce 2015: $14.3 per ounce substantially below the original 2016 forecast of $14.5 due to better than expected tonnage and grades resulting from the success of the Companys brownfield exploration programme.

This result reflected a transitional year before the introduction of commercial production from the new Pablo vein in 2017.
During the fourth quarter, there was a reduction in the mines output due to a road blockade by members of a local community which halted production from early November 2016.
The dispute was subsequently resolved with production re-commencing on 25 January 2017.
Costs All-in sustaining costs at Pallancata were $16.3 per silver equivalent ounce 2015: $15.7 per ounce.
The moderate increase versus 2015 was due to capital invested in developing the access and infrastructure for Pablo as well as the effects of stoppage causing a significant fall in tonnage affecting unit costs.
This was partially offset by increased grades and operational efficiencies.
Costs are expected to fall substantially in 2017 when the Pablo vein begins production.
20 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report San Jose Argentina The San Jose silver gold mine is located in Argentina, in the province of Santa Cruz, 1,750 kilometres south-southwest of Buenos Aires.
San Jose commenced production in 2007 and is a joint venture with McEwen Mining Inc. Hochschild holds a controlling interest of 51% in the mine and is the mine operator.

This was in line with the 2015 result 13.9 million ounces with a moderate increase in tonnage offsetting slightly lower grades.
Costs At San Jose, all-in sustaining costs were reduced by 18% to $11.5 per silver equivalent ounce 2015: $14.1 per ounce mainly driven by the significant fiscal changes in Argentina in the first half of the year.
These included the elimination of export taxes and the restoration of the Patagonian port rebate see below.
In November 2015, the Argentinian government restored the right to receive a rebate from goods exported through Patagonian ports previously cancelled in 2009 and was applicable to Hochschild at a rate of approximately 9% of the FOB value of its exports.
However, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the benefit was once again cancelled.
com 21 Operating review continued In addition, the Group chose to eliminate resources with a low Reserves and resources probability of conversion into reserves at Arcata, San Jose and the Total reserves and resources for core operations remained strong, existing Pallancata veins.
The reduction was mostly from inferred reducing slightly to 183 million and 476 million silver equivalent resources with low grades and resources located far from existing mine ounces respectively driven by: infrastructure.
At Pallancata, the adjustment affects mineral from bridges and pillars in the original Pallancata vein where extraction The reduction in the silver price assumption used for cutting both would impact the stability of the mine structure.
Resources at reserves and resources from $20.0 per ounce as at 31 December 2015 Inmaculada and at the Pablo vein have not been affected.
to $16.5 per ounce as at 31 December 2016 while maintaining the gold price assumption at $1,200 per ounce.
The resulting impact in reserves The decrease was partially offset by the addition of resources from the and resources has been a small decrease, as previously anticipated in Pablo vein at Pallancata which is now over 40 million ounces with silver the sensitivity table published in the 2015 Preliminary equivalent grade improving significantly to 529 silver equivalent grams Results statement.
These adjustments do not affect the Groups mine plans, future production or cost guidance.
The Group believes that it will improve conversion ratios from resources into reserves and ensure a high quality resource base.
