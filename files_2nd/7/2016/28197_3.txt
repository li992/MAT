OPERATING REVIEW Strong operating track record In 2016, Polymetal maintained its track record of robust operational delivery.
Annual gold equivalent production was essentially flat compared to the previous year at 1.27 Moz, meeting our increased production guidance for the fifth consecutive year.
While there was some planned grade decline at mature operations, this was more than compensated for by a solid performance at Amursk POX, the successful commencement of Svetloye heap-leach operations that will ensure sustained production levels at the Okhotsk hub in the next year, and contribution from newly acquired Komar Varvara and Kapan, both of which are on track to strengthen our production profile, lower the costs and provide substantial incremental cash flows.
Gold production was 890 Koz, a 3% year-on-year increase, mainly driven by increased throughput and improved recoveries at the Amursk POX plant.
Meanwhile, silver production decreased by 9% to 29.2 Moz, due to the normalisation of grade profile at Dukat underground mine and planned silver production decline at Omolon due to shift in the Omolon hubs ore feedstock mix providing ores with higher gold and lower silver grades.
1.5 Kt of copper were produced at our Varvara and Kapan mines.
Gold sales were 880 Koz, up 2% year-on-year, while silver sales were down 2% year-on-year at 30.7 Moz, generally in line with production dynamics and volume.

2 Based on 1:80 Ag Au, 5:1 Cu Au and 2:1 Zn Au conversion ratios.
3 Based on actual realised prices Polymetal International plc 9 Underground development increased by a further 26% to more than 92 km 2015: 73.1 km.
This included the contribution of mining activity at newly acquired Kapan, increased volumes at Mayskoye where the new mining method sublevel open stoping with backfill continues to make good progress, and continued underground development at an active pace at Birkachan and Tsokol Omolon hub and Albazino.
Birkachan open pit operations were completed, with personnel transferred to Olcha.
Underground development at Olcha is ramping up.
At Mayskoye, drill-and-blast activities were started at the open pit the newly launched crown pillar project following the completion of the overburden removal.
Ore mined increased by 6% year-on-year to 13.4 Mt 2015: 12.7 Mt, mainly as a result of accelerated mining at Svetloye, increased volumes at Oroch to match processing capacity of Kubaka plant and commencement of openpit mining at Olcha.
Processing Ore processed increased by 6% to 11.4 Mt 2015: 10.8 Mt.
The increase was mainly driven by the launch of the Svetloye heap leach at Okhotsk operations one year ahead of original schedule.
As expected, the average gold equivalent grade in ore processed decreased slightly from 4.2 g t to 4.0 g t, with the decline mostly coming from mature operations: normalisation of the grade profile at the Dukat underground mine that produced exceptionally high grades in 2015, as well as a planned grade decline at the maturing Goltsovoye mine: lower silver average grade due to shift in feedstock mix at the Omolons Kubaka plant: scheduled slight decline in average grades at Okhotsk: and higher levels of dilution that led to grade declines in ore processed at Mayskoye.
However the ramp-up of our new mines in particular Svetloye and Kapan in the second half of the year, as well as a marked improvement in mine-to-model grade reconciliations at Tsokol Omolon pushed the grade up to 4.4 g t in the fourth quarter.
Production and sales dynamics For the fifth consecutive year we have met our production guidance, achieving 1.27 Moz of gold equivalent production in 2016.
Albazino Amursk, Okhotsk, Varvara and Kapan were the key contributors to this robust performance.
At Mayskoye, the grade-driven gold production decline in 2016 is expected to be reversed next year with the launch of the crown pillar project providing increased production volumes from the open pit.
Scheduled average silver grade declines led to modest production decreases at Dukat and Omolon by 6% and 10%, respectively.
In 2016, gold production at Voro decreased by 9% driven by the planned downsizing of the heap leach operation, causing a 36% decrease in gold production at the circuit.
Metal sales in 2016 were 1,301 Koz of gold equivalent, almost flat compared to 2015.
Sales volumes slightly exceeded production for the full year.
While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals, we continue to sell concentrates from Dukat gold silver, Varvara gold copper, Kapan gold copper and gold zinc and Mayskoye refractory gold to offtakers in Kazakhstan, Japan, Bulgaria, Belgium and China.
Offtake allows us to maximise our margins and achieve an optimal combination of transportation costs and treatment charges recoveries, being one of our core competencies.
This will be leveraged further in our approach to the development of the Kyzyl project.

We have a robust evaluation system to select highquality assets for further development.
Both extending mine life through brownfield exploration and new discoveries from greenfield exploration contribute to the Companys long-term growth prospects.
Our exploration activities are Polymetal International plc 10 focused on five regions in Russia Khabarovsk, Magadan, Karelia, Yakutia and Urals as well as on Kazakhstan and Armenia.
9 new licences were obtained over the course of 2016, bringing the total number to 86, covering a total area of more 2 than 7,800 km.
47 licences currently involve active exploration activities.
Our key exploration objectives in 2016 included: brownfield exploration aimed at extending the life-of-mine at existing operations: Dukat, Omolon, Voro, Albazino and Okhotsk hub: an extensive exploration campaign at Nezhda JV to obtain significant additional comfort on the geology and metallurgy of the deposit: detailed in-fill and step-out exploration drilling at the flanks of the newly acquired Komar Varvara hub : licence renewal and a maiden JORC mineral resource estimate for the Viksha project: pursuing new greenfield exploration targets through the acquisition of new licences in key regions, including Karelia for PGMs and Urals: Exploration drilling volumes increased by 40% year-on-year to 324 km, as Polymetal expanded its scope of exploration to include newly acquired assets and joint ventures.
The total capital expenditure on exploration was US$ 45 million and remained almost flat compared to 2015.
As a result of our exploration efforts, resource-to-reserve conversions were achieved during the year, along with meaningful maiden reserve-and-resource estimates completed for several projects, including: an initial mineral resource estimate for the PGM Viksha project in Karelia, which comprises 9.5 Moz of palladium equivalent PdEq, making it one of the largest open-pittable PGM resources in the world: an initial underground mineral resources estimate at Lichkvaz of 0.6 Moz of gold equivalent: an initial reserve and resource estimate at Komar of 873 Koz of gold and 517 Koz of gold, respectively.
In 2017, Polymetal will continue to invest in exploration with the goal to expand the pace and scope of drilling, as well as prospect evaluation.
The key objectives are as follows: To achieve resource-to-reserve conversions and resource upgrades at our brownfield projects with particular focus on shorter life-of-mine assets.
At Omolon the focus will be on Irbychan and Yolochka: at Voro on Saum and Tamunier: at Okhotsk on Levoberezhny, Gyrbykan, and Maimakan-Kundumi: at Dukat on Primorskoye: To initiate a comprehensive exploration campaign at the deeper levels of Dukat with a goal to extend the scope of resource estimates at least 300 meters below current underground workings: To produce an initial JORC reserve and resource estimate at Nezhda JVs Zone 1 and continue drilling on smaller, potentially mineralised zones: To complete at least 25 km of diamond drilling at the Prognoz silver deposit: To publish a JORC-compliant reserve estimate and a combined LOM plan for Kapan and Lichkvaz: To complete a step-out drilling campaign at Komar and update the reserve and resource estimates for the deposit: To continue step-out and deep-level drilling at Kyzyl.
Reserves and resources In 2016, ore reserves decreased by 5% to 19.8 Moz of GE mainly due to mining depletion and a downgrade at Varvara which were partially offset by reserve additions from the new acquisition at Komar, Dolinnoye and an upgrade at Svetloye.
As a result, gold reserves remained almost unchanged at 17.6 Moz: while silver reserves decreased by 21% to 163 Moz: and copper reserves decreased by 23% to 65.4 thousand tonnes.
In the course of 2016, Polymetal significantly strengthened the resource base of its operating mines and successfully advanced our long-term growth strategy.
Mineral resources additional to ore reserves increased by 29% to 16.5 Moz of GE, mainly driven by the acquisitions of Kapan and Komar and initial mineral resources estimates at Levoberezhny and Lichkvaz.
Mineral Resources inclusive of Ore Reserves at gold equivalent grew by 5% to 36.4 Moz.
Polymetal International plc 11 The average grade in ore reserves decreased by 8% to 3.8 g t GE mainly due to additions from Komar.
The average grade for mineral resources decreased by 11% to 4.2 g t GE, mainly as a result of additions from Kapan.

Management will firmly concentrate its efforts on the next milestone at Kyzyl where mining volumes are expected to nearly double in 2017, and external infrastructure access road, electricity, water is now mostly in place with the focus shifting towards site infrastructure.
Key construction activities in 2017 will include completion and commission accommodation camps, boiler stations, utility facilities sewage treatment plants and pumping stations, external power supply facilities.
In 4Q 2017, we plan to complete tailings construction and start ore mining activities.
We are confident in our development approach, with low capital intensity and degree of operational risk during the construction and ramp-up period.
We will also focus on our new projects that will drive growth beyond launch of Kyzyl.
This includes project development at Nezhda, exploration drilling at Prognoz the largest undeveloped silver deposit in Russia, advancing the POX debottlenecking project planned to reach full expanded capacity in the second half of 2018, and continued operational turnaround at Kapan mine in Armenia.
The Company reconfirms its production guidance for 2017 and 2018 of 1.40 Moz and 1.55 Moz of gold equivalent, respectively.
Traditionally, production in both years will be skewed towards the H2.
The increase in production in 2017 will be driven by Varvara Komar, Okhotsk Svetloye, molon, and Kapan.
This should offset the grade declines at Dukat and Voro.
Employee health and safety remains an absolute priority for Polymetal as it strives to eliminate future accidents at all of its operations.
In 2017, we will introduce a Critical Risks Management system which will complement existing safety measures and will help us reduce the risk of injuries in our business.
