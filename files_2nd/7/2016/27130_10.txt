24 STRATEGIC REPORT REVIEW OF OPERATIONS GROUP PERFORMANCE A SOLID SET OF RESULTS IN CHALLENGING Group revenue and operating profit MARKET CONDITIONS.
Group revenue was 989.2 million 2015: 911.8 million, an increase of 8.5% on a reported basis compared with 2015.
The increase was as a result of the decline in the value of sterling against other currencies, with much of the Groups business being denominated in non-sterling currencies.
At constant currency revenue declined by 1.5%.
Group headline operating profit was 116.9 million 2015: 106.0 million.
Headline operating profit margin was 11.8%, compared to 11.6% for 2015.
Operating profit improved to 107.3 million 2015: 82.9 million and profit before tax improved to 87.9 million 2015: 59.0 million.
Both of these benefited from year-on-year movements in exchange rates and specific adjusting items 2016: 1.7 million, 2015: 16.0 million charge.
