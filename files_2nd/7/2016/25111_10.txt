OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS OPERATING REVIEW We drive the performance of our brands and markets to deliver quality growth.
Our markets prioritise either Growth or Returns, depending on their strategic role, and our portfolio focus is on maximising opportunities for our Growth and Specialist Brands.
BRAND PERFORMANCES We delivered excellent performances from our Growth and Specialist Brands.
These are the most important assets in our portfolio and together they account for 60.1 per cent of our tobacco net revenue, up 320 basis points on last year, reflecting the improving quality of growth that we are consistently delivering.
The rest of our portfolio consists of Portfolio Brands, which are local and regional brands that fulfil a variety of roles.
Some add to our revenue momentum, while others will create more value by being migrated into Growth Brands.
Total Group tobacco volumes were 276.5 billion stick equivalents 2015: 285.1 billion, which includes an incremental 12.1 billion from our USA acquisition.
Volumes were down 3.0 per cent, reflecting declines in Iraq and Syria and lower organic volumes, which offset the benefit of the contribution from ITG Brands.

USA Gold was replaced by Winston as a Growth Brand, and instead became a Portfolio Brand, and Kool and blu joined our Specialist Brands.
With the exception of market share, prior year comparatives have not been adjusted for this reclassification.
R See Performance Measures table on page 2.
Our Growth Brands are: Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes, JPS, West, Fine, News, Winston, Bastos, Lambert & Butler and Parker & Simpson.
These are quality brands with broad consumer appeal that are generating an increasing amount of our volume and revenue.
Growth Brands outperformed the market in the year, with volumes growing 4.3 per cent, against a backdrop of market volume declines in our geographic footprint of 0.9 per cent.
We also grew Growth Brands net revenue by 10.1 per cent.
Excluding Iraq and Syria, underlying Growth Brand volumes increased by 7.8 per cent and underlying net revenue increased by 11.2 per cent.
We improved the share of Growth Brands from 7.2 per cent to 7.7 per cent.
As part of our drive to prioritise Growth Brands and improve the quality of our growth we deliberately ceded some share in lower value Portfolio Brands, contributing to a 60 basis point decline in the Group share to 13.9 per cent.
Growth Brands now account for 54.7 per cent of total Group tobacco volumes, an increase of 380 basis points, and 45.6 per cent of overall tobacco net revenue, a decrease of 20 basis points.
Brand Chassis Highlights JPF JPS, Parker & Share growth in the chassis was driven by JPS and Parker & Simpson with the continued strength of JPS in Australia and Simpson and Fine Players in the UK, as well as the ongoing success of brand migrations in a number of markets including Russia where we migrated Balkan Star.
In Germany we took action to strengthen our share with the launch of larger JPS pack formats.
West West, L&B, In Germany we migrated Route 66 into West and continued to grow West share in Saudi Arabia and Japan.
Successful News and Bastos brand migrations in France have supported the growth of News and in the UK another good performance from Lambert & Butler was helped by growth in crushball.
Winston The success of our new retailer contracts and promotional support is underpinning Winstons good results and consistent share growth.
A rejuvenated pack design and new consumer marketing is further enhancing brand equity.
Davidoff We delivered further share growth in Greece and maintained Davidoffs share position in Taiwans premium segment with the launch of Davidoff Absolute.
We also introduced Fresh Box formats in key Middle East markets, such as Saudi Arabia.
Gauloises A successful brand campaign supported good results in Germany.
An excellent performance in Algeria, supported by the launch of Gauloises LAutre, consolidated the brands market leading position.
These positive performances more than offset the impact of Iraq and Syria.

We achieved great results with our Specialist Brands, reflected in very strong net revenue growth, enhanced by contributions from blu, Kool and Backwoods.
There was also good growth from Skruf in Scandinavia and premium cigars in the USA.
This more than offset the impact of Iraq and Syria, which held back Gitanes.
Specialist Brands now represent a greater proportion of the business at 14.5 per cent of net revenue.
MARKET PERFORMANCES We divide our footprint into Growth Markets, the USA Market and Returns Markets.
We manage these markets based on their strategic roles, with Growth Markets and the USA Market prioritising long-term share and profit growth.
In Returns Markets the focus is on sustainable profit delivery and effective management of our strong share positions.

We continued to build good momentum in Growth Markets, increasing net revenue by 4.3 per cent and adjusted operating profit by 2.2 per cent.
This growth reflected an enhanced contribution from blu, the benefit of intellectual property royalties from Fontem Ventures and rising profits in key markets, offsetting increased investment in blu, transaction currency costs and the impact of Iraq and Syria.
Our overall market share decline was mainly driven by Maxims price disadvantage in Russia in the first half.
We addressed this and delivered a stronger second half performance, stabilising our share in the process.
Excluding Iraq and Syria, underlying net revenue was up 8.0 per cent and adjusted operating profit was up 8.7 per cent.
We increased the proportion of net revenue generated by Growth Brands by 20 basis points.
Country Performance Russia Strong pricing during the year offset share declines and supported revenue growth.
Our Growth Brands achieved excellent results with growth from West and the successful launch of Parker & Simpson.
Saudi Arabia Our share was up as we delivered consistent growth in West, with recent excise changes benefiting the lower price segment of the market.
The recent launch of the Fresh Box format supported the performance of Davidoff.
Italy We increased our share in Italy, driven by a continued strong performance with JPS.
Greece We delivered further share growth in Davidoff to maintain the brands positive momentum.
Sweden and Norway We delivered good share and revenue growth in both Sweden and Norway, against a backdrop of positive pricing and a growing snus market.
Turkey We improved profitability after restructuring our operations and continued to progress a focused growth strategy with Davidoff and West in key cities.
Recent positive pricing has supported revenue growth.
Japan We grew revenue and the share of West as we continued to invest in expanding our retailer coverage.
Taiwan We generated further profit growth, driven by the success of Davidoff equity activations and positive pricing, although our overall market share was down as the premium segment declined.
Iraq and Syria Continued instability in the region held back trading particularly in Gauloises and Gitanes in the first half.

The incremental contribution of the acquisition to the USA performance in the current financial year was tobacco net revenue of 682 million and volumes of 12.1 billion.
Our total USA volumes for the year were 24.9 billion stick equivalents.
Adjusted operating profit more than doubled with the benefit of the acquisition.
Adjusted operating margins improved 270 basis points to 55.7 per cent, despite increased brand investment.
The percentage of tobacco net revenue generated by Growth Brands increased to 18.6 per cent, as we reshaped our portfolio following the acquisition.
From 1 October 2015, we reclassified our Growth and Specialist Brands, replacing USA Gold with Winston in Growth Brands and adding Kool to our Specialist Brands.
USA Gold is now a Portfolio Brand.
Around 165,000 stores, representing around 90 per cent of USA cigarette volumes, have signed up to our new retailer agreements.
These agreements support our new promotional arrangements, which have already delivered steady improvements in the market shares of Winston and Kool, almost offsetting the declines from our Portfolio Brands.
Towards the end of the year we also launched a new pack design for Winston, coupled with a new advertising campaign, to further build brand equity.
Growth Brand volume benefited from the replacement of USA Gold with Winston, as did the percentage of net revenue generated by Growth Brands.
In addition, the action we have taken to improve our mass market cigar business, which includes the Dutch Masters and Backwoods brands, continued to strengthen our results.

Our priority in our Returns Markets is to maximise profit while managing our share.
We grew net revenue per thousand stick equivalents by 2.9 per cent and further improved the quality of our portfolio with Growth Brands now generating 54.6 per cent of tobacco net revenue, an increase of 370 basis points.
Against a backdrop of flat industry volumes, our market share declined by 90 basis points to 26.1 per cent.
Net revenue was also down.
Results were impacted by share declines in Returns North, particularly Ukraine, the UK and Germany, offsetting the share growth we delivered in Returns South, particularly in Algeria.
Adjusted operating profit was down 4.3 per cent, impacted by the conclusion of the distribution contract for Philip Morris International in the UK and Morocco, adverse transaction exchange and the cost of complying with EUTPD legislation.
Excluding these impacts, adjusted operating profit for Returns Markets overall grew 0.9 per cent, with Returns North flat and Returns South up 3.1 per cent.

We made good progress in improving our quality of growth in Returns Markets North, increasing net revenue per thousand stick equivalents by 6.1 per cent.
Growth Brands delivered 57.2 per cent of tobacco net revenue, up from 53.6 per cent.
We made a strategic decision to lower investment in Ukraine and Azerbaijan, where economic conditions and competitor discounting resulted in reduced profit opportunities.
Overall profitability in Returns North was affected by the same factors outlined in the Returns Markets overview.
Country Performance UK Our overall share declined, although we continued to invest to defend our position.
Our fine cut tobacco share increased during the year, led by good growth from Gold Leaf, and we also grew sales of Rizla.
In cigarette we generated positive momentum with JPS, Players and Lambert & Butler crushball variants, although investment to grow our share in the sub-economy segment impacted revenue and profit.
Germany Growth in revenue and profit was supported by stable market size and the continued positive performance from Gauloises.
Our success with large format variants is stabilising the share of JPS and West benefited from the migration of Route 66, which we completed in the year.
Our overall share was down but strengthened in the second half, due to the actions we took.
Benelux Brand migrations supported the good performance of JPS in fine cut tobacco, although the market size and our overall share declined following significant excise increases.
Australia We delivered another excellent performance from JPS, resulting in further strong share, revenue and profit growth.
Ukraine Investment was moderated in response to significant competitor discounting and currency devaluation that eroded market profitability.
Our share improved in the second half as pricing conditions normalised.

Strong results in Algeria more than offset the impact of the weak operating environment in Morocco.
We also saw improved market size trends in markets such as Spain and France, where the actions we have taken to strengthen performance continued to gain traction.
We improved our market share by 10 basis points, primarily due to the strong gains we made in Algeria, and we improved our market share trends in Morocco in the second half, driven by the launch of Fox.
We made good progress in further building the contribution from our Growth Brands, with these brands now generating 50.0 per cent of our tobacco net revenue, up from 46.0 per cent last year.
Profitability was affected by the same factors outlined in the Returns Markets overview.
Country Performance Spain We continued to focus on customer engagement initiatives to strengthen our ties with retailers, while maintaining good growth momentum with West.
The ongoing migration of Ducados to JPS is also enhancing the quality of our portfolio.
France News continues to grow share following the success of the Fortuna migration and the launch of several new variants in fine cut tobacco.
The next phase of portfolio simplification is generating strong initial results.
Algeria We delivered an excellent performance, generating significant share and profit growth, driven by Gauloises, which we have established as the market-leading brand.
Morocco Our recently launched value brand Fox reached 10 per cent share, helping to address volume declines in Marquise.
