Bio-oxidation Biox batch test work has confirmed the technology is capable of delivering an 89% overall recovery for the NZ refractory ore.
These key changes have resulted in the critical mass of the combined Massawa-Sofia project moving away from the high cost refractory ore to one that is dominated by the relatively easy leaching ores of Sofia and the Massawa CZ.
The updated geological model of the Massawa CZ has clearly defined two styles of mineralisation consisting of a thin high grade Phase 2, with a significant coarse gold component, surrounded by a lower grade Phase 1 mineralisation.
Metallurgical testwork has now identified the transition boundary between the refractory ore of North Zone 2 NZ2 and the CZ.
