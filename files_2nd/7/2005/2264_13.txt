40 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review Introduction The Groups results are prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and comply with UK Companies Act requirements.
While the UK GAAP reporting basis provides the core information for users of this report and accounts to understand the financial performance of the Group, management believes that users will be assisted in understanding the performance relative to previous periods by presenting the results in an alternative manner.
This presentation isolates the impact of currency movements from year to year and eliminates the impact of exceptional or non-recurring items.
This is consistent with the basis used by management to measure performance of the business and is a component of variable compensation plans.
The elements of this alternative presentation are described in more detail below.
Impact of currency movements The Group has operations in some 50 countries around the world and the majority of its profit is generated outside the UK.
Results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange against sterling for the year.
Changes in such rates from year to year can significantly affect the Groups results when these are presented in pounds sterling.
In some cases, such changes may make it difficult to understand underlying business performance trends without providing additional information.
For example, the average value of the US dollar to pounds sterling changed by three per cent in 2005 compared with 2004.
It is important to highlight such currency movements to users of financial information to help them understand business and regional performance.
Consequently, management has for many years monitored business performance on a constant currency basis.
This basis eliminates the impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into sterling by retranslating the results of the comparative year at the rates of exchange used in the current year.
This is the basis for all internal management reporting throughout the year.
In this operating review, the comparison of financial performance between years may in places be referred to as on this constant currency basis.
Comments on all segmental performance are on a constant currency basis.
The impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into sterling is shown in the table below.
This enables users of the information to have a better understanding of underlying business performance.
Examples of such items in 2005 include the profit on disposal of the Afrox hospitals business in Africa and costs of restructuring in BOC Edwards.
Included in 2004 were the loss on disposal of the packaged gas business in the US, costs relating to the subsequent restructuring of the remaining US business and charges relating to the integration process in Japan that began in 2003 following the merger of the industrial and medical gases businesses there of BOC and Air Liquide to form Japan Air Gases.
Operating review 41 Exceptional items include those items classified as both operating and non-operating under UK GAAP.
The review of results excluding exceptional items is part of the normal internal management reporting process.
The growth in operating profit excluding exceptional items is also one of the measures used in the variable element of the senior management compensation scheme.
Further information regarding the exceptional items is given in the financial review on page 55.
An analysis of all operating and non-operating exceptional items is given in note 2 b to the financial statements on page 97.
In this review, the adjustments to eliminate exceptional items have been made to operating profit both Group and by segment, profit before tax and earnings per share.
Exceptional items are commented on in the Group results section as well as in the individual business segments to which they relate.
A reconciliation of these adjusted items to the equivalent UK GAAP measure is shown in the profit and loss account on page 86.
When any results or measures used in this review have been adjusted to exclude exceptional items, they are referred to as adjusted.
Within the individual business segments of the operating review, operating exceptional items are commented on separately.
Comments on other aspects of financial trends and performance are based on adjusted operating profit.
This provides more meaningful comment on underlying business performance.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to operating profit is given in the table below.

Adjusted return on capital employed removes exceptional items from the measure of operating profit used in the calculation.
Adjusted return on capital employed is used by management for reasons similar to those described above.
A reconciliation of these two measures is shown below.
2005 2004 2003 Average Average Average Operating capital Operating capital Operating capital profit employed ROCE profit employed ROCE profit employed ROCE million million % million million % million million % Adjusted ROCE 564.2 3,478.3 16.2 576.9 3,752.4 15.4 505.6 4,010.5 12.6 Operating exceptional items 20.7 17.4 67.0 ROCE 543.5 3,478.3 15.6 559.5 3,752.4 14.9 438.6 4,010.5 10.9 1.
ROCE is operating profit as a percentage of the average capital employed excluding net pension liabilities.
The Group commentary in this review also comments on free cash flow.
Free cash flow is a measure often referred to by BOC management and other users of financial information to highlight the cash flow available from underlying ongoing business operations before acquisition and disposal activity.
Whether or not this remains positive over time is an indicator that dividends to shareholders are being paid out of cash generated by existing Group businesses.
As such it is a useful additional measure of financial performance.
A reconciliation of this measure to the nearest equivalent UK GAAP measure, net cash flow, is shown below.
2005 2004 2003 million million million Free cash flow 18.6 257.9 141.8 Exceptional cash items 16.9 11.9 28.3 1 Acquisitions and disposals 59.2 92.5 118.3 Other items within capital expenditure and financial investment: Purchases of intangible fixed assets 0.6 0.2 1.2 Net sales purchases of current asset investments 4.7 0.9 16.6 Purchases of trade and other investments 3.4 3.8 3.3 Sales of trade and other investments 30.0 5.6 5.3 Net cash inflow before use of liquid resources and financing 91.6 339.2 12.6 1.
Acquisitions and disposals in 2005 is shown after an adjustment of 69.6 million relating to the disposal of the Afrox hospitals business.
This comprises 54.2 million for the minority interest element of the special dividend paid to the shareholders of African Oxygen Limited following receipt of the proceeds of disposal and 15.4 million for the tax paid on the special dividend.
42 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review comparing 2005 with 2004 Turnover, including share of joint Group ventures and associates Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was 4,605.0 million in 2005, similar to the million 4,599.3 million reported in 2004.
Operating profit was 543.5 million, down three per cent compared with 5,000 559.5 million in 2004.
After crediting operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling 87.9 million and charging net interest and other financing items of 58.5 million, profit before tax was 593.6 million, up 44 per cent 4,000 compared with 412.3 million in 2004.
Earnings per share were 74.1p, up 39 per cent compared with 53.5p in 3,000 2004.
Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was 564.2 million, adjusted profit before tax was 505.7 million and adjusted earnings per share were 67.5p, a record level for BOC.
2,000 Comparisons with 2004 are affected by exchange rate movements.
For the currencies that principally 1,000 affect the Groups results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse.
If the results of a year ago had been translated at the 0 03 04 05 rates applied to this year, turnover would have been increased by 3.8 million.
There would have been an increase in operating profit of 4.9 million and an increase in adjusted operating profit of 4.5 million.
Adjusted profit Profit before tax before tax would have been 5.2 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.5p higher.
The table set out below summarises results reported both under UK GAAP and as adjusted.
Results for million 2004 are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.
A reconciliation of turnover, operating profit and adjusted operating profit for 2004 at 2004 and at 2005 rates of exchange is shown on page 40.
A reconciliation of adjusted results with UK GAAP results is shown on page 41 and in the profit and loss account on page 86.
Exceptional items in 2005 amounted to a profit of 87.9 million.
This comprised 84.9 million profit on the disposal of a majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited, 13.2 million profit relating to the disposal in 2004 of the US packaged gas business, 10.5 million profit on the disposal of the majority of a shareholding in the US beverage dispense company, NuCo2 Inc, partly offset by a charge of 20.7 for restructuring in BOC Edwards.
Exceptional items in 2004 amounted to a charge of 92.0 million.
This comprised a loss of 79.5 million on disposal of the US packaged gas business, a charge of 14.8 million for restructuring the remaining business in the US following the disposal, a charge of 2.6 million relating to the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan, and a profit of 4.9 million on the disposal of fixed assets.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2005 was 16.2 per cent.
Return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2005 was 15.6 per cent.
Free cash flow as defined on page 41 was 18.6 million in 2005.
Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including exceptional cash items, was 91.6 million in 2005.
A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 41.
A first interim dividend for 2005 of 15.9p per share was paid in February 2005 and a second interim dividend of 25.3p per share was paid in August 2005.
In aggregate this was a 3 per cent increase over the annual dividend of the previous year.
A first interim dividend for 2006 of 16.3p per share has been declared for payment in February 2006.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries including interest capitalised was 397.3 million in 2005, compared with 256.1 million in 2004.
This was covered by cash inflow from operating activities.
Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was 285.9 million in 2005, of which the BOC share was 144.0 million.
Equivalent expenditure in 2004 was 109.0 million, of which the BOC share was 49.2 million.
The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of 57.1 million in 2005 and proceeds from disposals were 224.1 million.
Equivalent items in 2004 were 50.9 million and 98.3 million respectively.
A reconciliation of results for 2004 at 2004 and at 2005 rates of exchange is shown on page 40.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit with operating profit is shown on page 41.
All comments below are on a constant currency basis.
Operating review comparing 2005 with 2004 43 The principal business factors driving increased turnover in 2005 were increased selling prices to recover higher power and energy costs, increased turnover within the Linde BOC Process Plants business in the US and strong demand for gases in the steel sector for most of the year.
The recovery of higher power and energy costs is estimated to have added approximately one per cent to turnover in 2005.
Turnover also rose because of an increase in BOCs ownership of the business supplying nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery in Mexico and as a result of changes to the terms of a supply scheme contract in the US.
These two factors added approximately five per cent to turnover in 2005 compared with 2004.
New plants had a relatively smaller impact on turnover during 2005.
Those contributing additional sales included a hydrogen plant supplying Citgo in the US and a new air separation unit supplying the Sinopec and BASF joint venture petrochemical plant in Nanjing, China.
New plants added less than one per cent to turnover in 2005 compared with 2004.
Operating profit increased less rapidly than turnover principally because of the factors that raised turnover without a corresponding impact on profit.
These included increased prices to recover higher input costs and the changed contract.
During 2005, BOC continued to be successful in winning new on-site supply contracts with major customers in the oil and petrochemical industries and in Asia with steel customers.
Three new plants are under construction for the supply of hydrogen to US refiners for the production of cleaner-burning fuels and to improve the processing of heavier crude feedstocks.
When these plants are fully commissioned they are expected to approximately double BOCs worldwide hydrogen capacity.
At the same time, new air separation capacity is being added to satisfy growing demand from steel and petrochemical customers in Asia.
A new plant is being built for a petrochemical customer at Map Ta Phut in Thailand and several large-scale plants are under construction in China for both steel and chemical customers.
One of the largest projects currently under way is the addition of a fifth production module to the complex supplying nitrogen for the re-pressurisation of oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
This facility is already the largest nitrogen plant in the world and has already proved its worth in boosting oil production.
The new module will increase nitrogen production by approximately 25 per cent.
Much of this new capacity is scheduled to be commissioned in late 2006 and during 2007.
There were no operating exceptional items in 2005.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.
Europe Economic conditions were mixed during 2005 with some difficult trends in the UK and Ireland partly offset by industrial growth in Poland.
The adverse impact of lower merchant volumes in some sectors was to a large extent offset by further savings from improved operating efficiency.
In the UK, industrial gases demand from the steel and chemical sectors was strong in 2005, leading to better tonnage volumes.
However, demand for liquefied gases declined as a result of generally sluggish activity in some manufacturing sectors exacerbated by sharp increases in energy costs.
These also impacted BOCs merchant gases business.
Higher power costs were generally recovered in selling prices but increased prices led some customers to reduce their consumption of industrial gases, while a few ceased production in the UK.
There has been another significant increase in UK power prices for 2006 and further selling price increases are being implemented with customers.
BOCs business in Poland continued to benefit from general economic growth and strong demand in the steel industry.
Sales volumes were lower in Ireland as some traditional industries declined while economic growth was concentrated in the service sectors.
Cryostars business as a manufacturer of cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors continued to grow in 2005.
These devices are used for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas LNG tankers.
The Americas Buoyant conditions in the steel industry led to strong demand for tonnage gases in the US during the first half of 2005.
Some slowdown became apparent during the second half and this, together with isolated plant outages, reduced tonnage volumes in the second half and for the year as a whole.
Higher power costs were progressively recovered by increased selling prices in the merchant market for liquefied atmospheric gases and demand remained firm.
Carbon dioxide sales benefited from strong demand for enhanced oil recovery rather than for food and beverage applications.
During 2005, BOC invested in new carbon dioxide capacity to satisfy demand for oil recovery in Texas and made a number of smaller investments to optimise the US supply chain network and reduce delivery costs.
In Latin America, the contribution from the joint venture supplying nitrogen to Pemex for re-pressurising its Cantarell oilfield was increased in 2005 as a result of BOCs acquisition of Duke Energys 30 per cent interest.
This transaction was completed in September 2004 and increased BOCs overall stake to 65 per cent.
Construction of a fifth production module that will increase output by approximately 25 per cent is now under way and on schedule.
Meanwhile some improvement in the efficiency of existing production units is expected from a routine maintenance schedule that is currently in progress.
Africa Sales volumes increased in 2005 as a result of continuing firm demand for tonnage gases in the South African steel sector and increasing consumption of liquid nitrogen by food manufacturers.
Higher selling prices also contributed to increased turnover.
New long-term supply contracts were signed with customers in the metals and automotive components industries.
During 2006, investments will be made to fulfil these contracts and to satisfy growing demand for liquefied gases in the merchant market.
44 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review comparing 2005 with 2004 Asia Pacific Sales growth in north Asia was supported by production from new and recently commissioned plants in China.
There was also growing demand for liquefied gases in the merchant markets not only in China but also in Korea and in Taiwan, where available capacity was fully utilised.
Further investment by Chinas leading steel and chemicals producers continued strongly in 2005 leading to opportunities for long-term supply schemes.
A new 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation unit was commissioned by BOCs joint venture with Sinopec in Nanjing during the year and began to supply Sinopecs new joint venture with BASF when that began operation in 2005.
Two new air separation plants were also commissioned in south China to supply steel customers during 2005.
Two 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation units are under construction to supply gases for expanded production at the Taiyuan Iron & Steel Corporation TISCO, which is already the largest stainless steel producer in China and one of the biggest in the world.
Construction of a further two similarly large air separation units to supply the Maanshan Iron & Steel Company Ma Steel began before the end of 2005.
In Japan, demand for industrial gases from the steel, chemical and glass industries remained strong in 2005.
During the year, BOCs Japan Air Gases joint venture brought on stream a new 2,100 tonnes-a-day plant serving a major steel customer.
BOCs most important PGS businesses in south and south east Asia are in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and India.
The major market sectors for PGS across the region are steel, petrochemicals and the food industry.
The Thai economy continued to expand in 2005 and BOCs business there benefited from growth of the chemical industry.
Despite a continuation of US anti-dumping measures that held back prawn exports, there was some recovery in the food-freezing sector leading to increased sales of carbon dioxide and liquefied nitrogen.
MIG Production Co. Ltd MIGP, a joint venture between BOCs Thai subsidiary Thai Industrial Gases PCL and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company Ltd has been awarded a long-term contract to supply 800 tonnes a day of oxygen to a new mono ethylene glycol project operated by TOC Glycol Co. Ltd. TOCGC in Map Ta Phut, Thailand.
MIGP is investing US$50 million to build an air separation unit on an adjacent site to TOCGCs new mono ethylene glycol plant.
Scheduled to come on-stream in 2006, the facility will produce 1,300 tonnes of oxygen a day, making it the largest air separation unit in Thailand.
The excess capacity from the new facility will serve the parent companies tonnage and merchant markets.
Business in Malaysia was supported by buoyant conditions in the steel sector for most of the year despite some softening of demand in the final quarter.
Demand from the Malaysian chemical industry also improved in 2005. Business trends in Singapore were positive in 2005, led by expanding activity in the chemicals and electronics sectors.
Strong demand for industrial gases by the steel, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and glass sectors coupled with positive selling price trends led to accelerated growth in India.
BOCs subsidiary, BOC India Ltd, has been awarded the contract for supplying the gases requirements for an expansion programme being undertaken by Jindal Vijaynagar Steel Limited at Bellary in Southern India.
BOC India Ltd has signed a fifteen-year agreement to supply 1,400 tonnes a day of oxygen and nitrogen and is building a new 855 tonnes-a-day air separation unit at Bellary, which is due to be commissioned in 2006.
Management sees this latest investment of up to US$40 million as a major move in developing its strategy in southern India.
Elsewhere in the region, business developed well in Pakistan but growth in the Philippines was constrained by product availability.
Production of oxygen at BOCs plant at Gresik in Indonesia was limited during 2005 by the availability of natural gas to generate power.
Use of diesel fuel as an alternative led to less efficient operation.
In Australia economic growth continued in 2005 but at a slower rate than in 2004 and there was relatively little new plant investment.
World commodity prices remained firm leading to sustained demand from the mineral processing and steel industries for tonnage gases.
Higher energy and labour costs in 2005 were generally recovered by increased selling prices.
During 2005, BOC renewed its long-term contract to supply a leading titanium dioxide pigment manufacturer.
The Government of Western Australias environmentally friendly fuel cell bus project, which began in 2004 with three hydrogen-fuelled buses operating in the city of Perth, was commercialised in 2005.
BOCs hydrogen purification plant and re-fuelling facility supports BP in this project.
Water services Further business was secured during 2005 with industrial rather than municipal customers, in accordance with BOCs strategic objectives for this business.
Much of the new business continued to be with food manufacturers but there was also increasing interest for water services in the chemicals and refining sectors.
Industrial and Special Products ISP Change 1 on 2004 2005 Change constant million on 2004 currency Turnover 1,721.7 3% 4% Europe 467.0 4% 3% Americas 322.3 24% 23% Africa 272.3 18% 19% Asia Pacific 660.1 3% 4% Operating profit 289.4 14% 13% 2 Adjusted operating profit 289.4 7% 6% 1.
Operating review comparing 2005 with 2004 45 Turnover was lower in 2005 as a result of the disposal of BOCs packaged gas business in the US in July 2004 and the disposal of part of the Unique Gas business in Thailand in December 2004.
These disposals accounted for a ten per cent decrease in turnover for 2005 compared with 2004.
The effect of disposals on turnover was partly offset by growth in Europe, Africa and the south Pacific region.
The elimination of overhead costs following the US packaged gas disposal helped towards an increase in operating profit.
This together with new business won was reflected in a 15 million increase in north American adjusted operating profit in 2005.
Other factors supporting profitability were the extension of best commercial practice and best operating practice business efficiency programmes to more parts of the world.
Further progress was made with the refurbishment of retail stores - particularly in South Africa and Australia - during 2005 and this led to increased sales.
Retail outlets also supported the growth of BOCs safety products business.
At the same time further comprehensive safety product contracts were won with major customers.
New user-friendly product packages, including lightweight cylinders for emergency services, continued to drive sales growth of medical gases.
Turnover of medical gases for BOCs major subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates excluding Japan increased by seven per cent in 2005.
There was also good growth in the special products and services business, which includes scientific gases, refrigerant gases and other packaged chemicals.
Special gases turnover increased by 11 per cent in 2005 on the same basis.
Higher petroleum prices in 2005 presented a challenge to margins in the liquefied petroleum gas businesses in Australia and South Africa but most of the cost increases were recovered in higher selling prices.
Demand for helium remained strong worldwide, driven by increasing use of medical imaging.
New helium capacity is expected to come into production in Qatar in 2006.
This will make more product available to BOC but at a higher price than existing supplies.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003, as well as for the restructuring of the ISP business in the US following the disposal of the packaged gas business.
Europe Increased turnover reflected growing sales of medical and special products in the UK and generally favourable business trends in Poland.
The UK industrial market remained flat, but BOCs business was expanded by increased sales of welding products.
Increased energy costs were recovered by increased selling prices.
Growth in the medical gases business was once again driven by the introduction of new lightweight cylinder packages and by winning hospital facilities management contracts.
Increased turnover of special products was based largely on growing sales of gas mixtures for scientific applications and additional helium business.
New capacity is being added to satisfy additional requirements for Siemens Magnet Technology formerly Oxford Magnet Technology the leading MRI scanner manufacturer.
BOC already manages Siemens helium requirements during manufacturing and will now provide on-site services for Siemens magnets in hospitals.
Additional sales also resulted from the acquisition of Calors aerosol propellants and hydrocarbon refrigerants business in the UK.
Growth of BOCs Sureflow hospitality gas and cellar services business was curtailed by lower sales of draught beer in the UK during 2005.
Additional business was gained in Ireland by providing cellar services for a major brewery chain.
Changes in the provision of domiciliary oxygen in England and Wales were announced by the National Health Service in 2005.
BOC was awarded one of the 11 regional contracts and from February 2006 will supply all forms of domiciliary oxygen to patients for the Eastern region.
It is expected that this will lead to a reduction of BOCs home oxygen sales in the UK over the next two years.
However, the majority of BOCs UK medical gases business is with hospitals and the emergency services, which is unaffected by this change.
The AmericasThe disposal of BOCs US packaged gas business was completed on 30 July 2004 when initial cash proceeds of US$175 million were received.
This business had turnover of approximately US$240 million in 2003.
The ISP business in the US now consists of bulk medical gases, bulk supplies to distributors, tube trailer and liquefied helium.
BOCs US overhead costs were reduced following the disposal, as the business was then concentrated on a much smaller number of customers.
As a result the US business became profitable in 2005.
During 2005, new distributor channels were added, new helium business was secured in the US and new bulk industrial contracts were won with biotechnology and laser welding customers.
Buoyant conditions in the oil and gas industry helped towards an improved performance in Canada during 2005.
BOCs global helium business grew strongly in 2005 with increasing demand in China and Korea.
During 2006 the first supplies from a new source in Qatar will enable these markets to be served more efficiently.
However the financial impact is expected to be negative initially as additional volumes will be offset by higher feedstock costs.
Growth in Latin America was driven by increased sales in Venezuela and Colombia, where the medical sector is the most important.
However there was also growth in the industrial markets served by BOCs associated company based in Chile.
Africa Lower interest rates continued to stimulate South African domestic consumption and manufacturing output during 2005, leading to better turnover for the African region.
Operating profit also increased but by somewhat less than turnover, which was additionally inflated by higher liquefied petroleum gas LPG prices.
Turnover grew in every part of the South African business but was led by particularly strong sales of safety products.
During 2005 Afrox Safety was launched as a business brand and an on-site safety services business was acquired.
Sales of scientific gases increased but from a relatively low base.
Despite the challenge of a strong South African rand, export business also grew considerably.
Plans are in place to expand production of welding products for local use and particularly for export.
Other African countries also produced satisfactory results with particularly good performances in Kenya and Zambia.
46 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review comparing 2005 with 2004 Asia Pacific Most of the countries in south and south east Asia achieved good results in 2005 with especially strong performances in India, Thailand and Bangladesh.
Results in India were additionally supported by a profit from the disposal of some land in Bangalore.
At the same time, trading conditions during 2005 were difficult in Malaysia and industrial activity continued to decline in Hong Kong as production drifted to mainland China.
This trend also continued to affect Taiwan but to a lesser extent.
BOCs industrial products business remains relatively undeveloped in China.
Few attractive opportunities have been identified but growing demand for helium provides a better prospect.
The growth of automobile production stimulated demand for welding gases and investment in special gases and packaged chemicals production facilities supported increased sales of these products in Asia generally.
In Japan, both turnover and adjusted operating profit were similar to a year ago.
An improved performance in the south Pacific region was driven by demand from the natural resources sector and increased sales of safety products while consumption of welding products and gases by the manufacturing sector grew more slowly.
This reflects somewhat slower growth in the Australian economy than in 2004.
Growth was focused in the mining regions of Western Australia, Queensland and Papua New Guinea.
BOC was also successful in winning significant contracts to supply safety and personal protective products to Xstrata in Australia and to New Zealand Steel.
These added to similar contracts won with Western Mining in 2004.
The construction of a new special gases centre is under way at Wagga Wagga, in Australia, to meet the increasing demand for packaged chemicals such as ammonia, ethylene oxide and sulphur dioxide.
Meanwhile the gradual re-development of BOCs retail Gas and Gear stores that began in 2004 continued in 2005 and is now approximately two thirds completed.
BOCs joint venture company supplying liquefied petroleum gas in Australia faced the twin challenges of a sharp rise in input costs and the warmest winter on record in 2005.
Lower consumption for heating applications therefore led to a decline in volumes.
BOC Edwards Change 1 on 2004 2005 Change constant million on 2004 currency Turnover 826.0 1% 2% Operating profit 17.4 63% 63% 2 Adjusted operating profit 38.1 20% 21% 1.
The upturn in semiconductor equipment spending that had helped BOC Edwards order intake and financial performance in 2004 was not repeated in 2005.
At the same time, margins continued to be adversely affected by weakness of the US dollar, which is the currency in which much of BOC Edwards revenue is earned.
The adjusted operating profit for 2005 would have been approximately 9 million more if transactions had been conducted at the exchange rates of a year ago.
Adjusted operating profit was therefore lower in 2005, despite some initial benefit from cost reduction programmes.
Where new semiconductor or liquid crystal display LCD business was placed, BOC was generally successful in retaining or improving its market share.
Demand for integrated subsystems combining vacuum and exhaust management technologies grew in 2005.
BOC Edwards is now launching a new plasma abatement system for the destruction of ozone-depleting PFC chemicals, which are found in the exhaust streams after etch processes in semiconductor, LCD and solar cell manufacture.
BOC Edwards also became a leading supplier of subsystems for immersion lithography.
For the latest generation of LCD fabrication units, BOC Edwards has also launched its own iFxK and iHxK high-capacity pumping systems.
For semiconductor applications, a new cost-effective turbomolecular pumping system, whose magnetic bearings are controlled without the use of sensors, was developed.
Demand for component cleaning services and electronic materials was slightly lower as some semiconductor production rates were reduced in 2005 to reduce stock levels.
During 2005 BOC Edwards formed a joint venture to extend its component cleaning business into Taiwan.
While nitrogen trifluoride prices continued to fall in 2005, BOC Edwards made good progress with its alternative technology of on-site fluorine generation systems for cleaning vapour deposition chambers.
Production of fluorine generators has already been established in Korea to achieve lower production and distribution costs to serve the expanding customer base in Asia.
In October 2004 BOC Edwards expanded its electronic materials offering to include wet chemicals for flat panel display, semiconductor, and solar cell customers throughout Asia, by purchasing a 50 per cent ownership in Asia Union Electronic Chemical Corporation AUECC.
This company also formed a joint venture with Shanghai Huayi Group Company to supply wet process chemicals to the growing electronics manufacturing industry in China.
Through the joint venture, AUECC will use Shanghai as a base to produce, package and distribute a full range of ultra high-purity process chemicals for the semiconductor and flat panel display industries.
In 2005 BOC Edwards retained strong positions in the bulk gases markets of Taiwan and China and improved its position in Korea.
New production capacity was added to the existing pipeline network in the Hsinchu business park in Taiwan and additional business was obtained in the business parks at Suzhou, China.
BOC Edwards has also established a position supplying customers in the new Cheng Du park in China.
In Korea, BOC won potentially significant gases business with Samsung, having previously been a major supplier of semiconductor equipment.
BOCs joint venture company also won new business with semiconductor manufacturers in Singapore.
Operating review comparing 2005 with 2004 47 There was better demand for vacuum equipment from the chemicals industry and from the aerospace industry for metallurgical applications in 2005.
A general improvement in Asian markets also helped towards better results from BOC Edwards general vacuum business.
Vacuum pump production was expanded in the Czech Republic and some system assembly operations were established in Brazil during 2005.
Deliveries of pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging systems were at a higher level than in 2004.
The establishment of a new low-cost manufacturing base in China has opened up new possibilities for business with the fast-growing pharmaceutical industry in Asia generally and particularly in India.
Exceptional costs of 20.7 million were charged within BOC Edwards during 2005.
Some 14 million relates to the impairment of goodwill.
The remainder is a charge for restructuring.
Savings of approximately 5 million are targeted from this restructuring.
Afrox hospitals Change 1 on 2004 2005 Change constant million on 2004 currency Turnover 275.1 36% 38% Operating profit 37.2 38% 39% 2 Adjusted operating profit 37.2 38% 39% 1.
The disposal of the majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black empowerment investors was completed on 22 March 2005.
African Oxygen Limited Afrox, BOCs subsidiary in South Africa, retains a significant interest in the hospitals business through a 20 per cent holding in the new company.
Until disposal, Afrox Healthcare Limited was fully consolidated into the BOC Group accounts.
For the second half of 2005, a 20 per cent share of the results of the new company, with its adjusted operating profit and net interest charge, was included in the BOC Group profit and loss account.
The comparisons above are therefore distorted by this change.
After adjusting for this disposal and change of accounting treatment, the underlying performance of the Afrox hospitals business remained positive during 2005.
The disposal proceeds were received by Afrox in March and distributed to The BOC Group and Afrox minority shareholders by means of a special dividend in June, followed by a share buy-back in July 2005.
Gist Change 1 on 2004 2005 Change constant million on 2004 currency Turnover 315.9 8% 8% Operating profit 24.5 2% 2% 2 Adjusted operating profit 24.5 2% 2% 1.
While the market for distribution services remained difficult in the UK throughout 2005, Gist continued to expand sales with existing customers and won new business.
The higher turnover was not reflected in better operating profit, principally because of increased pension costs.
Gist accounts for a substantial proportion of BOCs UK workforce and the impact of pension costs is therefore significant.
Food business with Marks & Spencer, Gists major customer, expanded in 2005 as more new retail outlets were opened.
Logistic operations for the Ocado home food service in association with Waitrose also continued to grow.
Existing services for Carlsberg UK were expanded in 2005 and new business was won with Woolworths.
In September 2005 the Van Dongen group of logistics companies based in the Netherlands was acquired.
This adds to Gists primary distribution operations, bringing products from food manufacturers into the supply chain.
It also extends the reach into continental Europe, which is becoming an increasing source of food products for UK retailers.
This wider network has already generated additional business between the UK and continental Europe from a number of existing and new customers.
In November 2005, Gist was awarded an extension to its food logistics contract with Marks & Spencer.
The contract covers the retailers growing food business until 2011, confirming it as one of the UKs largest food logistics contracts.
Corporate Corporate costs increased in 2005 partly as a result of additional spending on procedures to ensure compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and discretionary spending on litigation support in the US.
The corporate charge also included a provision of 4.3 million for environmental clean-up in the US.
48 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 Group Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was 4,599.3 million in 2004, up six per cent compared with 4,323.2 million in 2003.
Operating profit was 559.5 million, up 28 per cent compared with 438.6 million in 2003.
After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling 92.0 million and net interest and other financing items of 72.6 million, profit before tax was 412.3 million, up 17 per cent compared with 351.9 million in 2003.
Earnings per share were 53.5p, up 20 per cent compared with 44.5p in 2003.
Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was 576.9 million, adjusted profit before tax was 504.3 million and adjusted earnings per share were 63.2p.
Comparisons of 2004 with 2003 were affected by exchange rate movements.
For the currencies that principally affect the Groups results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse.
If the 2003 results had been translated at the rates applied to 2004, turnover would have been reduced by 88.8 million.
There would have been an increase in operating profit of 3.3 million and a decrease in adjusted operating profit of 2.2 million.
Adjusted profit before tax would have been 2.9 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.2p lower.
Results for 2003 are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.

A reconciliation of turnover, operating profit and adjusted operating profit for 2003 at 2003 and at 2004 rates of exchange is shown on page 40.
Exceptional items in 2003 comprised 43.2 million for a litigation settlement, costs of 15.5 million for completion of restructuring programmes and 8.3 million relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 15.4 per cent.
Return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 14.9 per cent.
Free cash flow as defined on page 41 was 257.9 million in 2004.
Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including exceptional cash items, was 339.2 million in 2004.
A first interim dividend for 2004 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2004 and a second interim dividend of 24.5p per share was paid in August 2004.
In aggregate this was a 2.6 per cent increase over the annual dividend of the previous year.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries including interest capitalised was 256.1 million in 2004, compared with 281.2 million in 2003.
Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was 109.0 million in 2004, of which the BOC share was 49.2 million.
Equivalent expenditure in 2003 was 81.4 million, of which the BOC share was 36.1 million.
The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of 50.9 million in 2004 and proceeds from disposals were 98.3 million.

Increased turnover reflected strong demand worldwide for both steel and nonferrous metals.
In addition, sales from new production facilities accounted for approximately 14 million of the increase in turnover between 2003 and 2004.
Metal production increased in 2004 and world metal prices firmed as a result of strong demand from China.
This benefited BOCs steel and nonferrous metal customers in all the key markets throughout the year.
For 2004 as a whole, the food sector was buoyant outside the US despite the temporary consequences of avian flu in Asia and the imposition of US import tariffs on prawns.
The recovery in the electronics packaging industry created exceptionally strong demand for industrial gases in the electronics packaging sector.
BOC was a leading beneficiary of this because of its strong position in Asian markets.
Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 49 Several significant new supply scheme contracts were won in 2004.
BOCs hydrogen business with refiners will be substantially increased with a new plant to supply both a Sunoco refinery at Toledo, Ohio, and a nearby BP refinery.
The hydrogen will be used by both BP and Sunoco in the production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline and diesel fuels.
Outside the US, significant new business in the chemical sector was won with the Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company.
BOC will form a joint venture to invest in existing assets and then add further air separation capacity.
BOCs subsidiary in Thailand is to invest in a venture establishing a 1,300 tonnes-a-day plant to supply TOC Glycol Co. Ltd. TOCGC in Map Ta Phut and to increase merchant capacity in the area.
New business with steel customers was mainly concentrated in Asia.
In January 2004, BOC announced that its joint venture with the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation TISCO would expand its existing 1,500 tonnes-a-day capacity with the construction of two new 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation units.
In the UK, BOC supplies Corus at its Port Talbot, Scunthorpe, Rotherham and Redcar plants.
BOC is to increase its industrial gases supply to the Port Talbot strip products plant by 30 per cent to increase steel production locally.
Selling prices were generally firm during 2004 and sufficient to offset input cost inflation except in parts of north Asia.
EuropeTurnover increased in all parts of Europe except for Ireland.
Adjusted operating profit increased significantly, mainly as a result of more efficient plant operation and careful control of costs.
In the UK, manufacturing activity remained generally weak but customer closures and relocations that had affected business in 2003 were less evident in 2004.
Rising steel production led to increased demands for oxygen.
Price increases were generally sufficient to cover higher input costs in 2004.
Further increases are being implemented in 2005 to cover sharply higher electricity prices in the UK following the expiry of a fixed price supply contract.
Cryostar manufactures cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas LNG tankers.
As in 2003, turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 principally as a result of demand for shipboard compression units on LNG tankers and following continued investments for gases plants in Asia.
North AmericaTurnover increased as a result of including a full year of syngas production for Celanese at Clear Lake, Texas and the start-up of a new plant supplying hydrogen to Citgos refinery at Lemont, Illinois, in October 2003.
Adjusted operating profit was lower as a result of reduced carbon dioxide volumes to our food and dry ice customers, and reduced argon demand from the stainless steel and wholesale sectors.
In general, demand for industrial gases from steel customers was strong in 2004.
Liquid nitrogen volumes for food freezing applications strengthened during the year, mitigating the reduced carbon dioxide volumes into this sector.
BOCs carbon dioxide business with beverage customers continued to make good progress in 2004 and new business was won.
Selling prices remained generally firm and significant increases in fuel and energy costs were largely recovered with surcharges or general price rises.
Latin America Revenues increased across the region during 2004, although business in Venezuela continued to be affected by political uncertainty.
In Brazil, BOCs new 400 tonnes-a-day plant entered production serving CST, the worlds biggest producer of slab steel.
The benefits of re-pressurising the Pemex Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico with nitrogen from BOCs joint venture company continued to be realised during the year.
In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energys 30 per cent ownership interest in the joint venture company for US$59.7 million in cash.
This increased BOCs overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in September 2004.
AfricaTurnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further improved by cost savings and firm pricing trends leading to better margins.
Although the stronger rand adversely affected platinum and gold mining in 2004, strong demand and firmer prices led to increased activity in the steel industry.
JapanThe combination of BOCs and Air Liquides industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan took effect from January 2003.
This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit for BOCs three lines of business between 2004 and 2003 and with earlier years.
The results of Japan Air Gases were consolidated on an equity basis throughout 2004 and for the last three quarters of 2003.
In 2004 turnover increased mainly as a result of equipment sales and adjusted operating profit increased faster as a result of achieving integration cost savings as planned.
North AsiaTurnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 but at a more modest pace than in 2003.
Production plants across the region were almost fully utilised and little new capacity came on stream in 2004.
In China, turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in line with economic trends but further growth was constrained by available production capacity and by some unplanned shutdowns, mainly at customers plants.
BOC announced a new joint venture with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited SPC, a subsidiary of Sinopec Corporation, to meet the industrial gases needs of SPC in the Jinshan District of Shanghai.
Economic conditions were stable in Korea but increased turnover and adjusted operating profit came from some additional argon and hydrogen capacity to supply customers near Pohang.
Turnover in Taiwan increased as a result of full capacity utilisation but adjusted operating profit increased significantly as a result of improved efficiency in plant operations.
Hong Kong also enjoyed a better economic climate in 2004 for the same reasons and adjusted operating profit was sharply better.
50 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 South and South East AsiaThese regions came under the same business unit management during 2004.
The economies continued to be buoyant across both regions during the year, helped by generally strong steel demand and a more active electronics industry in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.
The SARS infection that had adversely affected 2003 was no longer an issue in 2004 but in Thailand and Malaysia the food sector was hit by an outbreak of avian flu.
The Thai shrimp industry was further affected by the imposition of US tariffs on imports.
In September 2004, BOCs subsidiary in Thailand announced a major investment in new joint venture air separation capacity to supply oxygen for ethylene glycol production and to increase the availability of products for sale in the expanding merchant market around Map Ta Phut.
South PacificTurnover and adjusted operating profit were higher than a year ago.
The Australian and New Zealand economies remained generally strong in 2004.
The strength of local currencies led to some further customer plant closures but firm commodity prices for minerals and particularly for steel enabled leading customers to prosper.
There was some increase in tonnage volumes but volumes overall were similar to a year ago.
Electricity prices increased in eastern Australia and more so in New Zealand.
Increased costs were passed through to tonnage customers and progressively recovered in the merchant markets.
At the same time, BOCs major plants in Australia achieved significant cost savings as a result of implementing a global plant optimisation programme.
During 2004 BOC outsourced the transport of its bulk products to Australias leading transport company, while retaining control of distribution and scheduling.
This change was made only after ensuring that there would be no diminution of safety standards or the quality of service to customers.
A hydrogen purification plant and bus re-fuelling facility to support BP in the Government of Western Australias environmentally friendly fuel cell bus trial came into operation during September 2004.
Three hydrogenfuelled buses will be operating in the city of Perth.
The trial is to continue for at least the next two years.
Water services BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation EMC, a US water services company in October 2002.
Turnover increased modestly in 2004 but the business remained close to breakeven after the amortisation of goodwill as a result of planned costs to increase business development resources.
BOCs strategy for water services is to focus on its industrial customers.
Significant new business was won during 2004, including a multiyear contract for process and waste water services to a major US beef producer.
Tightening regulations for proteins in effluent seem likely to create fresh demands for water treatment in the food industry.
Industrial and Special Products ISP Change 1 on 2003 2004 Change constant million on 2003 currency Turnover 1,782.3 2% 3% Operating profit 253.9 7% 5% 2 Adjusted operating profit 269.5 11% 10% 1.
Nearly all regions delivered better results in 2004 with increased turnover in most countries and an overall improvement in operating margin.
Robust economic conditions supported a further improvement in the south Pacific region and Africa delivered better results despite the handicap of the stronger currency on manufacturing and mining.
There was also some improvement in the US manufacturing economy.
At the same time further progress was made in successfully integrating the businesses recently acquired in Canada and Poland.
Sales to the medical sector grew further in 2004 as a result of both gases and liquid helium sales.
Heliox, a new low-density breathing mixture was introduced in the UK and in Australia.
This product enables patients with obstructed airways to breathe more easily and thereby provides time to treat the underlying problems.
Helium is also used to cool the coils of superconducting magnets in MRI scanners.
BOC not only sells the liquid nitrogen and helium cryogens but offers a related CryoFill service, taking responsibility for filling customers magnets.
Helium sales also increased in Taiwan, Thailand and China, where significant growth potential has been identified and where an important distributor agreement was signed with Meike.
The cost of producing and purchasing helium continued to increase rapidly during 2004 but BOC was largely successful in recovering higher costs in selling prices to customers.
BOC installed helium recovery systems at the University of Liverpool in the UK and at Trane in the US during 2004.
Consistent progress was made in growing refrigerant sales.
The alliance with Hudson Technologies for the reclaim of contaminated refrigerants began operation in the UK during 2004 and will be applied in South Africa in 2005.
BOCs major liquefied petroleum gas LPG businesses in Australia and South Africa were notably successful in managing volatile input costs and sustaining margins during 2004 as LPG prices increased sharply.
Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 51 Sales of industrial products increased in aggregate although some developed markets continued to reflect weak manufacturing activity.
Business development was helped by upgrading the retail environment of outlets in some major markets and by the continued introduction of safety products to the markets in the UK, Australia and South Africa.
EuropeTurnover and adjusted operating profit increased further in 2004.
Manufacturing activity continued to decline in the UK but BOC maintained a strong position in the market.
Improved service levels enabled selling price increases to be implemented.
At the same time costs were reduced through improved productivity.
Modest increases in industrial product sales were helped by rejuvenation of retail outlets in the UK.
Medical product sales increased as a result of gaining additional National Health Service business and continued demand for lightweight oxygen cylinders.
The range of lightweight cylinders will be expanded by introducing additional sizes during 2005.
The new business supplying helium to Oxford Magnet Technology for medical imaging devices began in 2003 and performed well throughout 2004.
It was also the first full year of the refrigerant reclaim service in the UK, based on an exclusive global licence with Hudson Technologies.
A range of gases for scientific applications was introduced during the year and some additional sales were generated following the launch of a mail order catalogue for gases and related products.
BOCs Sureflow beverage dispense gas operation was expanded by new business for Heineken outlets in Ireland during 2004.
BOCs business in Poland was enlarged from February 2003 with the acquisition of Praxairs Polish business.
2004 was therefore the first full year of the expanded business and there were further integration benefits.
North AmericaThe BOC Group announced on 27 January 2004 that it had signed a letter of intent to sell its US packaged gas business to Airgas.
The disposal was completed on 30 July 2004 upon receipt of initial cash proceeds of US$175 million.
Following this transaction, the ISP business in north America consists of bulk medical gases, bulk supplies to distributors, tube trailer and liquefied helium in the US as well as the Canadian packaged gas business.
In total these elements currently generate turnover of some US$450 million a year.
The impending disposal of the US packaged gas business created a challenging business environment for a significant part of the year.
US sales volumes and adjusted operating profit were lower in the period prior to the disposal.
Turnover increased in Canada principally as a result of the acquisition of Air Products Canadian gases and related products business with effect from April 2003.
Cost synergies arising from the integration further boosted adjusted operating profit in 2004.
Latin AmericaTurnover increased significantly and margins improved.
Growth across the region was driven principally by sales of medical products supplemented by sales of BOC-branded cutting and welding equipment.
Sales of packaged chemicals increased in Colombia and Venezuela.
Results improved strongly in Venezuela, despite a continuation of political unrest.
BOCs associated company achieved better results in Chile but there was a sharper improvement in Argentina.
Selling price increases offset inflation in Venezuela and Chile but the trends were less favourable in Colombia during 2004.
A new customer service centre was opened in Venezuela and new business systems were successfully implemented in Venezuela and Colombia during the year.
Africa Important sections of South African industry were depressed during 2004 because of the stronger currency.
Rand exchange rates reduced the profitability of gold mining and manufacturing for export in particular.
At the same time the cost of imported goods was lowered making them more competitive with those manufactured locally.
However lower interest rates began to stimulate domestic consumption towards the end of the year.
Despite the more difficult market conditions, adjusted operating profit improved significantly on the basis of a modest improvement in turnover.
Margins improved as a result of better productivity and operating efficiency, partly offset by increased transport costs arising from the temporary shutdown of some key supplier facilities.
Sales of cutting and welding products increased in South Africa and so did both the sales volume and the turnover of liquefied petroleum gas LPG.
Turnover of special products, including refrigerants, grew particularly rapidly.
Export sales of welding products manufactured by Afrox, BOCs South African subsidiary, also increased significantly.
There was a modest improvement in adjusted operating profit despite the currency disadvantage.
Sales of the AfroxPac emergency oxygen kit for underground miners were substantially lower in 2004 as order intake reflected weak activity in the gold mining sector.
A programme to renovate the Afrox retail network in South Africa with the development of a number of Gas & Gear outlets and a range of safety products is under way.
In addition a range of diving gases and a fire suppression product have been launched in South Africa.
Good progress was made in growing both turnover and adjusted operating profit in the other southern African countries during 2004.
A new carbon dioxide plant supported growth in Nigeria.
JapanThe basis of accounting for BOCs business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Full details can be seen in the PGS section on page 49.
In 2004 ISPs turnover in Japan was slightly less than the previous year but adjusted operating profit was higher through cost savings following the merger and from some asset disposals.
52 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 South and South East AsiaThese regions came under the same business unit management during 2004.
In aggregate there were modest improvements in both turnover and adjusted operating profit.
In Taiwan, buoyant activity in manufacturing and infrastructure development was reflected in higher turnover and adjusted operating profit.
There were also sharply better results from the industrial products business in Thailand but ammonia margins were under strong competitive pressure and liquefied petroleum gas LPG selling prices remained subject to restrictive regulation.
Hong Kong continued to be affected by the migration of manufacturing to mainland China and in Singapore shipbuilding and construction activity failed to improve in 2004.
Competition intensified in the Malaysian market for industrial gases.
Demand for helium was strong throughout Asia.
In south Asia, turnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further boosted by an asset disposal.
Trading conditions in Bangladesh were adversely affected by a combination of political uncertainty, strikes and floods.
South PacificTurnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 and margins were improved by holding down costs.
The economic environment remained favourable across the region.
Manufacturing activity was buoyant in Australia despite a challenging environment for export-oriented manufacturers created by the stronger currency.
New projects in the oil and gas sector and in mining generated increased demand for welding and safety products.
During 2004 BOC secured major contracts with Western Mining to meet its requirements for safety products across Australia.
The economy also continued to grow in New Zealand but somewhat less rapidly than in Australia.
There was also an improvement in the Pacific Islands, while gold mining activity and oil refining investment led to increased business in Papua New Guinea.
Major initiatives in 2004 included an agreement with the Australian CSIRO to commercialise ethanedinitrile, a gas that can be used to sterilise soil and timber, and which management believes has significant potential.
The acquisition of OccCorp, an injury management provider, gives BOC entry to a largely untapped market by combining BOCs safety services and products.
A dedicated refrigerant reclaim fleet was established to help customers comply with new refrigeration regulations that make it mandatory to recover, return and safely dispose of hydrofluorocarbons.
BOCs new Heliox gas mixture, which helps the treatment of patients with airway obstructions, and Inhalo, the new lightweight cylinder, were both successfully launched into the medical market.
BOC commenced an extensive redevelopment program of its Gas & Gear stores, supporting traditional industrial customers and new customers alike, giving a stronger retail position, providing better visibility, higher traffic flow, attractive merchandising and design.
The price of liquefied petroleum gas LPG was particularly volatile during 2004.
BOCs associated company in Australia, Elgas, was notably successful in preserving sales margins in these difficult circumstances and adjusted operating profit was increased.
Elgas expanded through the acquisition of a leisure gas business during the year.
The potential impact of Government plans to remove an excise tax exemption for automobile gas in the period from 2008 to 2012 was softened by a subsequent decision to delay the introduction by three years and by an agreement to provide capital allowances to encourage car owners to convert their vehicles to use LPG fuel.
Automobile gas is a minor part of Elgas turnover.
BOC Edwards Change 1 on 2003 2004 Change constant million on 2003 currency Turnover 816.5 19% 27% Operating profit 46.8 492% 588% 2 Adjusted operating profit 47.8 158% 181% 1.
Conditions improved in most of BOC Edwards key markets during 2004.
Orders for semiconductor equipment began to pick up in the first quarter leading to increased sales in subsequent quarters.
At the same time a major expansion of liquid crystal display flat panel manufacturing facilities got under way.
This provided fresh business opportunities for both gases and equipment.
Sales of chemical management equipment for new semiconductor fabrication plants improved only slightly and profitability continued to be affected by competitive market conditions.
Demand for scientific equipment vacuum systems and for pharmaceutical packaging machines was better in 2004 but sales of vacuum systems for aerospace metallurgy applications remained at a low level.
At the beginning of 2004, high levels of capacity utilisation encouraged a number of semiconductor manufacturers to add fresh capacity or upgrade existing facilities.
This led to increased orders, which were reflected in higher turnover and adjusted operating profit from the second quarter onwards.
BOC Edwards was successful in winning new equipment business with the majority of semiconductor fabrication facilities for which construction began in 2004.
These included several investments in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, Europe and the US.
Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 53 New pumping and exhaust systems were introduced for semiconductor, flat panel display and other vacuum applications.
A new range of iGX pumps for the semiconductor industry provides better control and monitoring capabilities and use less power than before.
BOC Edwards also launched high capacity pumps of its own design and manufacture for flat panel applications.
New turbomolecular and scroll pumps were designed for scientific instrumentation.
Wet chemical abatement systems were introduced to expand and complement the capabilities of BOC Edwards exhaust abatement systems.
Increased production of semiconductors was reflected in better demand for electronic materials.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride was expanded further in 2004 to over 100 tonnes a year.
New investments in semiconductor facilities also provided opportunities for nitrogen supply contracts.
BOC Edwards has become one of the leading suppliers of bulk gas to the growing semiconductor industry in China and continued to benefit from the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in Taiwan, Japan and Singapore.
New nitrogen generators were installed at several customer sites and further capacity was added to satisfy growing demand from customers within the Hsinchu science park in Taiwan.
Accelerated investment in new flat panel display production facilities led to significant orders for large capacity pumping systems in both Taiwan and Korea.
Gas supply contracts were also signed with a number of display manufacturers in Taiwan and Japan.
Liquid crystal display production leads to substantial demand for chamber cleaning chemicals.
Onsite fluorine generation equipment is now installed at a number of semiconductor and flat panel manufacturers.
A full commercial-scale generator is functioning at LG Philips new sixth generation plant in Korea.
Demand for pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging equipment picked up in 2004 leading to better sales and adjusted operating profit.
A new non-contact check-weighing machine was introduced.
Nuclear magnetic resonance technology allows every package to be checked, enables packing lines to operate at higher speeds and facilitates immediate correction of any deviation from specification.
The basis of accounting for BOCs gases business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Electronic gases turnover increased significantly in 2004 as a result of the pick up in the semiconductor industry.
The benefit of increased turnover on gases adjusted operating profit was amplified by synergy benefits arising from the merger.
Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services to electronic manufacturers.
These include gases management, chemicals supply, support services and materials logistics.
Other developments included an improved offering of gases and vacuum systems for lithography and supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning technology.
Afrox hospitals Change 1 on 2003 2004 Change constant million on 2003 currency Turnover 432.1 22% 9% Operating profit 59.8 30% 16% 2 Adjusted operating profit 59.8 30% 16% 1.
Adjusted operating profit increased faster than turnover as a result of careful control of overhead costs and positive pricing trends.
Hospital occupancy rates remained similar to a year ago.
Acquisitions were a minor factor in the turnover increase.
The Lifecare chronic care facilities and Afrox occupational health services both delivered a good performance in 2004.
The change to a new reimbursement system that began during 2003 was completed in 2004.
The previous system of paying health care providers a fee for their services changed to a fixed payment for each kind of procedure as well as a per day tariff structure.

The comparison of turnover and adjusted operating profit between 2003 and 2004 is distorted by a non-recurrent item during 2003.
In 2003 a gain of some 4.1 million arising principally from the termination of operations for the Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business was credited to adjusted operating profit.
The termination of this business also eliminated some 26 million of turnover in 2004 compared with 2003.
After adjusting for this item, underlying turnover grew principally as a result of increased food business for Marks & Spencer, as well as new contracts and the expansion of activity with Ocado and Carlsberg UK.
On the same basis, adjusted operating profit in 2004 was at a similar level to 2003.
Primary food distribution operations were also expanded in 2004 when Gist took on the transport operations of John Rannoch foods, one of the leading suppliers of poultry products to Marks & Spencer.
Gist manages the complex supply chain for all of Marks & Spencers chilled and ambient foods.
During 2004, a major investment was made to expand a chilled food facility in Kent to meet the demands of the growing network of M&S Simply Food stores.
