Review of operations Caspian turkmenistan Operations during year During 2005 we continued our programme of workovers and development drilling on the Burun field, whilst at the same time beginning the exploration of the remainder of the Nebit Dag PSA area.
On the Burun field, gross production in 2005 averaged 19,240 bopd, an increase of 24% over 2004 15,500 bopd.
On an entitlement basis production averaged 12,430 bopd in 2005 compared with 9,300 bopd in 2004, a 34% increase.
The production increase was driven by the continuous programme of workovers and development drilling, with 14 new development wells drilled, 13 of which were put on production.
Together with wells added from successful workovers, this led to a producing well count at the end of the year of 135 wells compared with 111 at the end of 2004.
We continued to upgrade our field processing facilities over the year, successfully commissioning new three-phase separation units and additional gas-lift compressors.
The commissioning of produced water treatment and pilot water-injection facilities is in process.
During the year we completed the interpretation of the 540 km of 3D seismic over the remainder of the Nebit Dag PSA area outside the Burun field and mapped five prospects for drilling.
"Four exploration wells three shallow and one deep which were drilled in 2005 on the Nebit Dag East prospect failed to find commercial hydrocarbons, but in March 2006 the second deep well on this prospect, NDE002, successfully tested oil at a rate of 400 bopd on a "" choke from a shallow reservoir at a depth of 1,385 metres."
Our intention is to perform an extended test followed by further appraisal drilling.
Future plans The focus of 2006 will be on continuing the programme of workovers and development drilling on Burun whilst accelerating the exploration drilling.
As well as five workover rigs, one of which will be used for shallow drilling, we now have two deep drilling rigs in operation with exploration wells on the south flanks of the Burun and Nebit Dag fields recently spudded.
Our aim is to drill all our identified exploration targets before the exploration area relinquishment deadline of February 2007.
The pilot water-injection scheme on Burun should also provide useful data on the longer term viability of secondary recovery and if successful will have a beneficial impact on field production.
Discussions will be continued with the international operators of neighbouring PSAs and the Turkmen government concerning a joint gas export scheme in western Turkmenistan.
