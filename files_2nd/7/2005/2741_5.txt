SECURING ENERGY FOR THE WORLDS THIRD FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY In Rajasthan Cairn is helping to discover the geological past to create the economic future.
The world class oil discovery at Mangala in early 2004 has not only transformed the fortunes of Cairn but, more importantly, it will also lead to investment in Rajasthan bringing oil and gas revenues both to the State and to the Central Government.
Cairn recognises that energy security is one of the top three goals of the Indian Government.
India has an annual oil import bill of over $20 billion.
Cairns success will help to reduce this.

GS-OSN-2003 1 CB OS-2 CB-X At both Lakshmi and Gauri there are oil-bearing reservoirs beneath the producing gas and condensate reservoirs.
These oil reservoirs are not thought to be well connected and the GAURI current plan therefore envisages each accumulation being developed independently.
The first of these accumulations is GAURI being developed via the GA-3 Gauri oil well, which was commissioned in November 2005.
The future performance of AMBE LAKSHMI this well will be important in determining the oil reserves in Gauri and it will also help in the assessment of the potential of the more extensive oil reservoirs at Lakshmi, where oil production has been targeted within the next 12 months.
OUR CREATIVE APPROACH TO DISCOVERING INDIAS POTENTIAL Right from the beginning at Cairn we have actively encouraged all our people to put their thoughts on the table.
Consider for a second that in the early 1990s major oil companies had drilled over 8,000 wells in South East Asia, but only 12 exploration wells had been drilled in India.
Dr Mike Watts, our Exploration Director, identified this key fact which was a huge factor in our decision to invest in Indias massive untapped potential.
Thus, India met our vision criteria with more than 20 unexplored basins to offer our bright, skilful and creative explorationists unlimited opportunities to apply their ideas.

We have believed from the beginning that the key ingredients for commercial success were present in Rajasthan.
It took perseverance and more than a dozen wells to zero in on the oil fairway.
This enabled us to discover first the Mangala field, and then the Aishwariya and Bhagyam fields, which collectively could underpin a 150,000 bopd production project with significant potential to further develop the area.
We now believe there is in excess of 3.5 billion barrels of oil in place on our acreage.
Taking into account the full value chain from wellhead to refinery, the total investment in all elements of this project is anticipated to be several billions of dollars with Cairn playing an important catalytic role in the investment.
