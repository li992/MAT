The majority of these projects are anticipated to come on line in the short to medium-term and include both new sites and extensions of existing mines.
Our smelting plant, Zhezkazgan Complex Summary of operational performance Over the last year, we have seen copper cathode production at levels comparable with previous years and improving production in zinc and precious metals, which, when combined with high copper and other metal prices, has resulted in strong financial results.
The copper market was buoyant in 2005, with average prices on the London Metal Exchange of $3,681 per tonne compared to $2,868 per tonne in 2004, a rise of 28.3% Source: Brook Hunt.
Exceptional demand from China has continued driving metal prices up to new higher levels.
In 2005, Chinese copper consumption increased by 7% compared to 2004.
We are a fully integrated copper producer and therefore benefit from any strengthening in the copper price.
The main end-user market for copper in 2005 remained the global construction industry.
In 2005, we completed the construction of the underground mine, Artemyevskoe, within budget and ahead of schedule so that the Group now comprises 12 underground and five open pit mines, nine concentrators and two copper smelter refineries, a zinc smelting plant, a precious metals refinery and a copper rod plant, and a fabricated products subsidiary, located in Germany.

Our copper cathode production facilities, Zhezkazgan studies continue to be undertaken and Zhaman-Aybat, which is expected to enter production during 2006.
Recently completed projects include Stepnoy, which is currently ramping up to full capacity and Artemyevskoe, which was completed in 2005 ahead of schedule and within budget, and is preparing to ramp up to full capacity in 2007.
Zinc We continue to make progress with the implementation of our growth plans in the zinc business, although our zinc smelter ramp-up is progressing at a slower rate than originally anticipated.
In 2005, we increased the output of zinc metal in concentrate to 82 kt from 66 kt in 2004.
Production of zinc metal increased from 18 kt in 2004 to 51 kt in 2005.
Over the course of 2006 we will continue fine-tuning our operating performance at the Balkhash zinc plant complex.
The zinc-rich concentrate from the recently completed Artemyevskoye mine should contribute to improving the quality of concentrate and ensure zinc metal production volumes are more consistent in 2006.
Precious metals Our precious metals refinery, located in the Balkhash region, recovers gold and silver from the slimes from all of the Groups operations.
We also treat slimes from third parties on a tolling basis.
