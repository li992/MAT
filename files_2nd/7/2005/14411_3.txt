West Africa met all the criteria.
As industry exploration efforts in West Africa move into ever deeper waters, the application of new technology provides access to significant reserve potential in under-explored shallow water areas.
Thus negotiations began with the appropriate authorities in targeted countries several years ago to establish a foothold in the region.
CONGO Marine XI was a significant first step, providing a cornerstone in the region.
Marine XI Review of 2005 activities The Company announced in August that its 85% owned subsidiary, SOCO Exploration and Production Congo SOCO EPC, signed a production sharing contract with Socit Nationale des Ptroles du Congo SNPC wherein it acquired an interest in the Marine XI Block, offshore the Republic of Congo Brazzaville.
SOCO EPC will be the operator with a 75% working interest in the Block that was licenced to SNPC by presidential decree in July 2005.
The exploration and production branch of SNPC 15% and Africa Oil & Gas Corporation 10% hold the 16.08.05 remaining interests.
The Block, located in the Lower Congo Adding strength to the balance Basin, is in shallow water adjacent to the coast with water sheet, the Company enters into depths ranging up to 110 metres and covers approximately a reserve-based, revolving credit 1,400 square kilometres.
There has been previous exploration facility of up to US$45 million with the International Finance activity on the Block resulting in four small oil discoveries, the Corporation, the private sector largest of which has initial recoverable reserves estimated to be arm of the World Bank Group.
in the 30 million barrel range.
The previous discoveries are located in the shallower horizons of the sedimentary section in Marine XI.
The deeper section, productive onshore and on trend to the south in Cabinda, has not been adequately evaluated as it could not be accurately mapped using older seismic data.
Subsequent events and 2006 outlook The Group has issued bid documents for a 3D seismic programme which it expects to conduct in the second half of 2006.
By employing the modern seismic techniques that the Company successfully applied in Vietnam to map the Basement reservoir, SOCO EPC expects to exploit the potential of the deeper section.
Although the Group is in discussions with various parties to farm-out a portion of its interests in Marine XI, it would retain a significant portion of the Block and operatorship.

The Group filed an application and development plan in 2005 with the Thailand Department of Mineral Fuels to convert the concession to a production licence on the Bualuang renamed from Pornsiri discovery on the Block.
The application was approved in March 2006.
The preferred development scenario is for the Group to farm-out a portion of its interest to a third party with expertise in development in the region.
Accordingly, the Group expects to conclude discussions with various interested parties to begin development of the Bualuang field during 2006.
