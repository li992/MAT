This represents a decrease of some 18 per cent on last years level due to a combination of natural decline and configuration changes which impact production rates but lead to considerable savings on operating costs.

Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 7 Operational review continued Middle East-Pakistan During the year, Premier was awarded the Jhangara exploration Premier continues to build the value of its strong asset portfolio block and drilled the Maliri-1 well.
This prospect was adjacent in Pakistan.
Business development efforts in the Middle East region to Premiers interests in the Bhit and Badhra gas fields, and though are focused on producing asset opportunities in partnership with high-risk, could have provided significant incremental value to government and local companies.
However, the well was found to be dry at the target Pab Sandstone level, and subsequently plugged and abandoned.

In the Cachar block there are a number of large structures which Negotiations continued over the sale of further gas from block A are relatively under-explored.
Premier has acquired seismic data with prospective buyers in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.

During the year discussions on the Ratna oil field redevelopment project were re-opened.
Most of the issues which have delayed Technical studies during 2005 focused on maturing prospects the project in the past have now been resolved.
Under the terms for an exploration drilling campaign in 2006.
On 31 January 2006 of the draft Production Sharing Contract, Premier is the operator Premier announced a successful gas discovery from its Macan and has a 10 per cent carried stake in this offshore project.

These zones are currently being tested.
The 2006 drilling campaign may include an appraisal well Philippines to be drilled on one of these discoveries.
Premier operates Service Contract 43 in the Ragay Gulf with a 42.5 per cent working interest.
During 2005 Premier acquired Vietnam 150 line kilometres of Transition Zone seismic data in the shallow Offshore Vietnam, Premier operates two PSCs: Blocks 12E and waters of the eastern Bondoc Peninsula.
This survey has confirmed 12W with 75 per cent working interest in each.
Subject to Government the presence of carbonate build-ups, and Premier is considering approvals, Premier also has an option to acquire operatorship and a well to target these structures in 2007. up to 67.5 per cent working interest in an adjacent block 7&8 97.
West Africa During 2005 we acquired and interpreted a 3D seismic survey over Premiers objective in West Africa is to deliver a series of high-impact the Dua discovery.
The interpretation confirms the potential for exploration opportunities, which offer exposure to significant commercial oil reserves, and a well is planned for the second quarter reserve additions, while building the value of the producing asset of 2006.
Following evaluation of the three 2D seismic programmes base in Mauritania.
acquired over blocks 12E, 12W and block 7&8 97, Premier will drill a second exploration well targeting the Blackbird prospect on Mauritania block 12E.
The development of the first phase of the 120 million barrel Chinguetti oil field in Mauritania is now complete at a cost of Premier also considers block 7&8 97 to have good prospectivity, approximately US$720 million US$58 million net to Premier.

The field of 2006, Premier will acquire further 2D marine seismic data over is located in 800m of water, some 90km west of the Mauritanian blocks 12E and 12W.
This will be designed to improve our capital Nouakchott.

The Phase 1 development includes six sub-sea production wells and five water injection wells for pressure support with flow-lines to a permanently moored FPSO, Berge Helene, with storage capacity of 1.6 million barrels.
Surplus gas not required for fuel will be re-injected into the nearby Banda reservoir via a single gas injection well.
The drilling of further production and injection wells Phase 2 is planned for early 2007.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 9 Operational review continued During 2005, three successful appraisal wells were drilled.
The Gabon Tiof-6 well intersected a Miocene reservoir sequence which flowed In Gabon in 2005, Premier drilled the high-risk Eboga-1 wildcat well 9,600 bopd on test.
A decision on the development strategy is on the Iris permit.
Premier entered this acreage as part of the 2003 expected in the second quarter of 2006.
Tiof-6 was followed by Mauritania acreage acquisition.
The well failed and Premier has a successful test of the Banda gas discovery, Banda-2.
This well subsequently withdrawn from this acreage.
In 2006, Premier will was drilled to allow excess-gas injection from the Chinguetti field, drill on the adjacent Themis acreage using 3D seismic acquired in a preferred alternative to flaring.
This well was successful and late 2005 to locate a suitable target.
proved the presence of a thick, high-quality gas reservoir in Banda.
The Tevet structure, located up-channel of the Chinguetti field was Congo also successfully appraised.
The well successfully found oil in the Premier has agreed, subject to parliamentary ratification to take Miocene sequence, and extended the proven limits of the Tevet on a 58.5 per cent interest including operatorship in the Marine IX accumulation.
Tevet-2 was deepened to the Cretaceous, to test a offshore block in the Republic of Congo.
The block contains the new play, and encountered an oil column.
This is very significant as large Frida prospect and a variety of tertiary and Cretaceous leads.
it is the first Cretaceous oil to be found on this acreage and opens 2D and 3D seismic programmes are planned for 2006. up the Cretaceous play system for further exploration.
These reserves may also be developed back into the Chinguetti field SADR in due course.
Premier was a successful applicant in the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republics SADR offer of PSCs for four offshore blocks, in which Three exploration wells were also drilled during the year.
Sotto-1, Premiers interest will be 50 per cent.
These contracts were signed similar in trap style to the Banda discovery, encountered no sands in March 2006.
The licence terms will come into effect on admittance in the target interval.
However, the knowledge gained increases of the SADR to membershipof the United Nations.
confidence in the presence of sands in prospects such as Colin and Kibaro, which lie in a similar geological setting and will be targeted in 2006.
The Espadon well, down dip to the west from the Tiof field, failed to find oil due to lack of sandstone reservoir at that location.
The final well of the sequence was a test of the Labeidna prospect, located close to Chinguetti.
An oil bearing sandstone was encountered, and is being evaluated for possible development and tie-back to Chinguetti in the future.
The Chinguetti field operator, Woodside Petroleum, has been notified by the Mauritanian government that it disputes amendments to the relevant PSCs.
The operator on behalf of the joint venture is currently exploring ways to resolve these disputes under the procedures set out in the PSC.
Guinea Bissau In Guinea Bissau, following on from the earlier drilling campaign, 2 Premier has acquired a 400km 3D seismic survey and reprocessed 2 800km of existing 3D seismic over the Eirozes and Espinafre salt-diapirs.
This has greatly improved the ability to image the steeply dipping flanks of these large prospects.
The 500m oil column in the models are working ahead of expectations around these features.
In 2006, Premier will operate wells back-to-back on the Eirozes and Espinafre prospects.
Timing of these wells is dependent upon arrival of the rig following third party drilling operations, currently expected in late 2006.
Success with either of the two wells would add significant value and increase the prospectivity on a number of lookalike prospects on the block.
