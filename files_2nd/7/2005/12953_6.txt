Review of operations For glossary of terms see the company website at www.
com FINANCIAL RESULTS Net profit for the year of US$40.9 million was more than double that of the previous year.
This was due to the start of commercial operations at Loulo, an improved performance at Morila and higher gold prices, which averaged US$445 per ounce compared to US$409 per ounce in 2004.
Attributable production was 314 831 ounces in 2005 compared to 204 194 ounces in 2004.
Earnings per share of 62 cents were up from 32 cents in 2004.
Industry wide cost pressures continued this year as a result of the weak dollar and high diesel and steel prices.
The security situation in Cte dIvoire has also impacted on costs since longer alternative supply routes are being used for Morila.
Loulo is less exposed than Morila to these elements due to its supply route through Senegal and lower diesel requirements resulting from the plant design.
Total cash costs for the group were US$211 per ounce for the year compared to US$184 per ounce in 2004.
Expenditure on exploration and corporate costs was US$22 million, well up from last years US$16 million, as extensive drilling programmes were undertaken in all countries in which the company operates except Ghana and Cte dIvoire.
Shareholders have enjoyed substantial Morilas five year corporate profit tax holiday ended in November capital returns in 2005 and the accounts include a provision of US$4.3 million for tax.

project, the company undertook a global equity offering in the year, raising US$103 million after costs.
This eliminates the need for any further hedging, which may have been required with bank financing, and provides sufficient funds for the foreseeable future.
There is another funding initiative which the company is investigating and that is a refinancing of the Loulo project finance at more favourable, flexible terms.
This should be achievable with the companys strengthened balance sheet, which had US$152 million in cash as at 31 December 2005.
Funds are only invested in fixed deposits and money market instruments with superior credit ratings.
The main balance sheet movements in the year include an increase in receivables.
This includes US$12.2 million of advances to the main contractor at Loulo, MDM Ferroman Pty Ltd. MDM was the contractor responsible for construction of the Loulo mine until the main construction contract was taken back on 30 December 2005.
Significant uncertainties exist relating to the recoverability of the amounts given as security for the advances.
MDM purport to have a claim for US$29 million against the company.
Randgold Resources has initiated legal processes to recover monies in an amount exceeding US$30 million which includes an application for the liquidation of MDM, the outcome of which is uncertain at this time.
Further details are given in note 26 of the consolidated financial statements.
12 Annual Report 2005 Randgold Resources Shareholders have enjoyed substantial capital returns targeting a further 25% increase in attributable production in the year with the share price rising 41% from US$11.42 for the year with estimated total cash costs of US$270 to US$16.13.

More importantly, an additional strategy was implemented in August 2005 which allowed 3.82 million ounces of this resource was converted into for the stockpiling of ore according to hardness and reserves, thus achieving the objective of adding value grade.
