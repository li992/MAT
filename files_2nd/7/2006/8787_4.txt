JKX Sect2 AW:JKX-report 11 4 07 11:21 Page 9 9 OPERATIONS REVIEW UKRAINE Poltava Petroleum Company PPC, a wholly owned subsidiary of JKX, holds four production licences covering 271sq.
km in the Poltava region of Ukraine.
Each production licence contains a particular field: Ignatovskoye, Molchanovskoye, Rudenkovskoye and Novo-Nikolaevskoye, which together form the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex.
0 225 km The four production licences are located on the southern edge of the Dneiper-Donetsk basin which is the main producing area in Ukraine licence areas eastern Ukraine.
The reservoirs in the PPC fields are formed by both clastic and carbonate formations of Devonian and Carboniferous age.
In addition to its production licences, PPC has three exploration permits in the area: Zaplavskoye, Elizaveytskoye and Chervonoyarske East, representing a total licenced area of 171.2sq.
Ukrainian operational overview We are very pleased with the progress and success of our 2006 work programme.
Our objectives this year included: The continued development of the northern area of the Molchanovskoye field: Appraisal work on the reefal features of the southern flank of the Ignatovskoye field: Further progressing the development of the Rudenkovskoye field by completing one well in the northern area of the licence and Chervonoyarske East commencing drilling of a further well in the southern area: and Elizavetovskoye The installation of a new compression facility to maximise gas recoveries from the Ignatovskoye field.
Novo-Nikolaevskoye In pursuit of the above objectives, the N75 and Kremco 900 rigs Complex operated in the PPC licences throughout 2006.
The Kremco 900 Offshore was used for workovers and to drill vertical wells up to 2,500m and the N75 was used for more complex and deeper wells.
Both rigs were contracted from Poland.
Production licences Ignatovskoye The Ignatovskoye field is located in the centre of the Novo-Nickolaevskoye Complex.
It was the first field that was developed by PPC and accounted for the majority of the Groups production until 2005 when it was overtaken by the Molchanovskoye field.
In 2006, three new wells I124, I125 & I126 were drilled in the Ignatovskoye field.
Two of these wells, I124 and I126, targeted reefal features in the Visean Carbonate on the southern flank of the main Ignatovskoye structure, which were found to be oil bearing with both primary and secondary porosity.
These structures are separate from the main accumulation and initial testing gave flowrates of 1,500 bopd and 1,850 bopd respectively.
Well I125 was drilled on the flank of the main accumulation and encountered oil in secondary porosity in the Visean limestone.
Initial testing of this well gave a rate of 425 bopd which is lower than the other two wells drilled largely because of pressure depletion in the main accumulation.
Other work in the Ignatovskoye field included the re-entering of well I101, which had been originally drilled in 1996.
At the time, a small oil accumulation in the Devonian sandstones was found.
This well was never placed on production due to problems with casing cementation.
I101 was side-tracked up-dip and initial testing gave a rate of 375 bopd and 3.7 MMcfd.
Focus JKX Sect2 AW:JKX-report 11 4 07 11:59 Page 10 10 In addition to the drilling activity, a new compressor was installed to reduce the flowing pressure of the existing gas wells in Ignatovskoye thereby maintaining productivity and maximising recovery.
Looking forward, there are plans for further drilling activity in Ignatovskoye during 2007.
Following the success of I125, our aim is to drill a new well on the eastern flank of the structure with the objective of finding secondary porosity in the oil bearing Visean carbonate.
Consideration is also being given to drilling an infill well to maximise recovery from the oil bearing sandstone reservoirs in Ignatovskoye.
Molchanovskoye The Molchanovskoye field is located Rudenkovskoye approximately 8km from Ignatovskoye and is the southernmost field within the complex.
The licence has two distinct structures: Ignatovskoye the southern area which contains gas condensate and the Novo-Nikolaevskoye northern area which consists of a black oil reservoir with a gas cap.
While the main producing formation in both areas is the Molchanovskoye Devonian sandstone, commercial production has now been established from the overlying Tournaisian carbonate and Zaplavskoye 0 7.5 km sandstone.
At the end of 2005 there were three producing wells in the main area of Molchanovskoye: M31, M36 and M202 and four wells in the northern area: M28, M150, M151 and M152.
All of these wells were completed in the Devonian sandstone.
During 2006 five new wells were drilled in the northern area of Molchanovskoye.
Of these wells M153 and M154 are horizontal wells draining the Devonian reservoir.
A third well, M155, was to be another horizontal well in the Devonian to target the thin oil column on the gently dipping northern flank of the structure but unfortunately the depth of the Devonian was greater than expected and below the oil water contact.
The well was therefore completed in the overlying Tournaisian carbonate and after acidisation produced at an initial rate of 500 bcpd and 5 MMcfd.
M156 was the fourth well drilled in the field in 2006 with the purpose of targeting the Tournaisian sandstone and Tournaisian carbonate in the central part of the structure.
This well produced at an initial rate of Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex 1500 bcpd and 17.5 MMcfd.
The last well, M157, targeted the T2 carbonate in a structural position that is similar to M155.
This well produced at an initial rate of 620 bcpd and 7.3 MMcfd after acidisation.
Russia Europe via Ukraine Following the success of M155, M156 and M157, a further 140 Bcm yr appraisal well is planned for 2007.
This well will be designed to 0 225 km evaluate a separate fault block on the northeast side of the northern area of Molchanovskoye.
Although the proposed block contains an old well drilled by a Ukrainian state company which failed to produce hydrocarbons, we believe this was due to poor drilling and completion practices at the time.
Moreover, evidence from more recent wells, especially M155 and M157, further underline our assessment that Tournaisian carbonate in the block is likely to have hydrocarbon bearing properties that would lead to the establishment of production from this area.
Work plans for 2007 also include a further development well in the northern area of Molchanovskoye which will target the Tournaisian sandstones on the southern flank of the structure.
Consideration is being given to drilling a further well in the main area of Molchanovskoye.
Novo-Nikolaevskoye Lying 3km to the west of Ignatovskoye, previous exploration of this area by Ukrainian state companies Ukraine basin areas and gas export pipelines targeted the Tournaisian carbonates which are found to be hydrocarbon bearing throughout the PPC licences.
In most Hydrocarbon basins Gas export pipelines cases these have been found to have low permeability and poor production characteristics with the notable exception from recent results in the northern part of Molchanovskoye.
JKX Oil & Gas plc Report and Accounts 2006 JKX Sect2 AW:JKX-report 11 4 07 11:21 Page 11 11 A number of the old wells in this area drilled to the carbonate also penetrated overlying Visean sands between 1,500m and Share of Ukraine oil production 1,800m.
Well N9 in this structure was found to contain Visean sands which were hydrocarbon bearing resulting in some commercial production being achieved.
However, N9 was shut-in during the early 1990s prior to PPC obtaining the licence.
PPC reinitiated production from the field in 2004 73.9% following refurbishment of well N9 with the initial flow rate of JKX share 1 MMcfd of gas and 400 bcpd far exceeding expectation.
More 1.8 MMbbl importantly, upon the recommencement of production, it was evident that the well gave a far higher condensate yield than previously recorded.
During 2006 a rod pump was installed in N9 to maintain production and maximise recovery.
The possibility of drilling a new well up-dip of N9 is under consideration for 2007.
6.6% produced by private companies Rudenkovskoye Rudenkovskoye is the most northern of the four production licences.
The target reservoirs within the licence are the Tournaisian and Devonian sands, which are found at Total market depths between 3,000m and 5,000m.
Based on data from old 36.6 MMbbl wells drilled by Ukrainian state companies in the 1970s and 1980s, two productive areas have been identified in this area.
Well R12 is located in the south of the two productive areas.
The well which was originally completed by a Ukrainian state Share of Ukraine gas production company, penetrated a gross interval of 1,200m of Devonian sands.
Of this interval only the upper 60m was ever tested and placed on production.
In 2005 the well was re-drilled by PPC to a depth of 4,000m, exposing 440m of the original untested section 37.9% of the Devonian reservoir.
Modern logs were run and the well JKX share 13.7 Bcf was completed with the main gas bearing interval being tested and placed on production.
There remain two further gas bearing intervals to be tested which require a workover to gain access because of their greater depth.
It is important to note, however, that these intervals are thinner and of poorer reservoir quality in comparison to those that are in current production.
Well R101 was spudded in late 2005 in the northern of the fields productive areas and reached a depth of 4,579m in mid January 4.9% produced by 2006.
Mud logs indicated more than 200m of gas bearing private companies Tournaisian sandstones in a number of intervals from approximately 4,100m.
Gas shows were recorded at downhole pressures of between 9,000 psi and 11,000 psi.
Drilling was Total market halted at 4,579m when pressures in excess of 12,000 psi were 737.7 Bcf encountered.
These high pressures exceeded the design parameters for the well and were 30% higher than the maximum values indicated by drilling reports produced by the Ukrainian state company in the 1970s.
A cement plug was set to isolate this Liquids Gas lower horizon following which a liner was run and cemented.
MMbbl Bcf During 2006 two intervals in the Tournaisian were tested.
Both PPC reserves intervals were perforated underbalanced using tubing conveyed Proven plus probable reserves guns.
The first interval from 4330m to 4449m, flowed at an initial As at 1 January 2006 7.9 243.1 rate of 1 MMscfd but declined rapidly indicating that the interval is of very low permeability.
The second interval from 4,095m to Production 1.8 13.7 4,210m flowed 2 MMcfd during initial testing and has As at 31 December 2006 6.1 229.4 subsequently been placed on production.
This second interval is considered suitable for massive hydraulic fracture stimulation and planning is progressing to perform a fracture treatment during the first half of 2007.
In December 2006 well R102 was spudded to further evaluate the Devonian sandstones in the southern area of Rudenkovskoye.
An extensive data gathering programme is planned which includes 80m of core being taken for detailed study and analysis.
The data gathering is focused on evaluating natural fractures.
JKX Sect2 AW:JKX-report 11 4 07 11:21 Page 12 12 Production facilities In late 2006, PPC was granted permission to access the Soyuz gas pipeline which carries gas from Russia through Ukraine to western Europe.
A hot tap into this line is planned for March.
In January work began on the 10km pipeline that will tie in PPCs production to the Soyuz pipeline.
A metering skid, gas compressor and hydrocarbon dew point control plant have been ordered to increase the overall capacity of the plant and enable gas production capacity to be increased.
Gas exports via the Soyuz line are expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Exploration licences PPC holds three exploration licences in Ukraine.
Zaplavskoye This licence is adjacent to the Molchanovskoye production licence and comprises an area of 95.7sq.
The 300 permit is valid until 2010.
During 2006 an exploration well was drilled targeting the Devonian sandstone.
No hydrocarbons were encountered and the well has therefore been abandoned.
Seismic reprocessing is underway and any further activity will depend on the results of this work.
Production 13.7 Bcf 250 Elizavetovskoye Located in the central part of the DneiperDonetsk basin, the Elizavetovskoye licence covers an area of 70sq.
km and is approximately 45km from PPCs existing production licences.
The licence benefits from having a structural feature that is associated with the adjacent Mashivske field.
A number of wells 200 have been drilled on this feature and some have been placed on production.
PPCs licence contains three such producing wells.
The producing wells are owned by Ukrgasvydobuvannya, a subsidiary of Naftogas of Ukraine, the state oil and gas company and are tied into its production facility.
Negotiations are underway with Ukrgasvydobuvannya to resolve the issues 150 related to these wells, and to establish conditions under which PPC can initiate production from this licence.
Chervonoyarske East The Chervonoyarske East licence was obtained in December 2005 from an open auction held by 10 100 the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Ukraine.
The auction was the first of its kind in Ukraine.
The licence covers a total Production 1.8 MMbbl area of 5.5sq.
Chervonoyarske East is located about 75km from the PPC production licences on the northern margin of the DneiperDonetsk basin.
It is adjacent to the Chervonoyarske field and has 50 5 produced gas condensate from Carboniferous reservoirs.
A data package including a seismic survey covering 110km was purchased along with the licence and a work programme will be defined based on the evaluation of this data.
At least six wells have been drilled within the licence area, one of which produced small quantities of hydrocarbons.

This has now been processed and incorporated into Anadarkos extensive evaluation of this block, which already included: 2,333km of 2D seismic: A 14,300km aeromagnetic survey: An onshore geological survey: and A comprehensive regional geological study.
As a result of this, Anadarko has identified a number of significant prospects.
The primary target is deep-water turbiditic Miocene sandstone at depths of between 3,000 and 4,000m below sea level.
Water depth Offshore in the prospective area varies from 1,000 to 1,500m.
In July 2005, BP, TPAO, TPOCs parent company and Unocal who jointly hold the licence in the adjoining Turkish Black Sea area, spudded a well very close to the edge of JKXs contract area.
The rig moved off location at the end of 2005 but no information has been released regarding the results of the well.
BP has subsequently notified its intention to withdraw from both the block in Turkey and from offshore Georgia.
Anadarko has invited proposals from a number of interested parties to expand the consortium of companies in the licence area.
Anadarko is also seeking access to a drillship and is proceeding towards drilling a well, potentially as early 2008.

0 145 km The blocks, covering a total of 4,171sq.
km, contained well Bulgaria licence area defined prospects and leads.
JKX earned its initial 25% interest in both permits by funding the 200km 2D seismic programme.
By committing to drill an exploration well in the B Golitza Permit, JKX has increased its interest in both permits to 50% and has taken over operatorship.
JKX will fund the first $1 million of expenditure on the well, following which it will be funded according to working interest ownership.
The permits were previously held 100% by Balkan Explorers Bulgaria Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aurelian Oil & Gas Limited, which retains the balance of the interest in these permits.
Bulgaria became a member of the European Union on 1 January 2007 and offers excellent operating terms with an open gas market and extensive infrastructure.
B Golitza permit The Golitza play is a large tilted fault block of Moesian Platform sediments Jurassic sands and shales and Golitza Triassic limestones and shales that has been overridden by the thrusts moving from the south.
As a result, imaging of the true structure beneath the thrust has only been possible Golitza licences through the use and interpretation of modern seismic data.
Leads Prospects B-Golitza The 2D seismic acquired in late 2005 firmed New Seismic up the location for an exploration well, lines B1-Golitza West B1-Golitza East Golitza 1 to test the Golitza prospect which has the potential to contain several hundred Bcf of gas.
Golitza 1 will be a near vertical well with a total depth of up to 4,900m and is expected to take 120 days to drill.
It is planned to spud the well in April 2007.
B1 Golitza permit Following a recent relinquishment, there are two distinct parts to the B1 Golitza permit: the 0 34 km northern area which shares geological properties similar to the B Golitza permit and the eastern area which is comprised East Omurtag Golitza of much younger Tertiary age rock that shares geological characteristics similar Preslav N. Golitza to the western Black Sea.
The primary Ajtos W. Golitza reservoirs within the permit have been identified as Eocene and Oligocene age turbidite sandstones.
Previously, several gas fields have been discovered both to the north and east, as well as inside the permit itself.
The reprocessing and interpretation of the pre 2005 2D seismic data and the part of the 2005 seismic dataset that was acquired over B1 Golitza confirmed the presence of several attractive leads with prominent amplitude anomalies.
The evaluation of the seismic and existing well data is ongoing and during the first half of 2007, the decision of whether to acquire further seismic data or bring one or more of the leads to drillable status on the existing data will be made.

km Civita exploration permit, onshore Italy.
The Civita permit is located south of Pescara and is adjacent to an ENI production concession.
The primary target in the permit is the shallow Tertiary sands which form the reservoir for a significant number of shallow gas fields in this area.
The gas produced from the Tertiary is biogenic in origin and is essentially pure methane.
In addition, there are a number of oil and gas fields within the same basin producing from the deeper Cretaceous carbonates.
During 2004, the Civita 1 exploration well tested a structural closure which was defined by 3D seismic.
There was a strong amplitude anomaly coincident with the structure.
The well found 6m of gas-bearing Tertiary sands between 1,157m and 1,169m which flowed at a maximum stabilised rate of 2.6 MMcfd through a 1 2 choke, with a wellhead flowing pressure of 723 psi.
Following evaluation, JKX calculated gas in place of 1.4 Bcf and has a potential recovery of 1 Bcf.
ENI decided that the Civita discovery was not material to them and indicated that it did not want to apply for a production concession.
After completing feasibility studies JKX concluded that the discovery could be economically developed.
In 2006 JKX submitted a production concession application for approval, to be owned 100% by JKX.
During 2006 ENI completed a Seismic Inversion project convolving the 3D seismic data with the available well data.
JKX interprets these results to show several small but low risk exploration opportunities remaining on the block.
ENI holds a 70% working interest and Operatorship in the permit.
JKX is keen to accelerate the evaluation of the remaining exploration opportunity in the Civita block and is pressing the Operator to make a drilling decision.
Any further exploration well will have to be completed by 31 May 2008 which is the end of the current exploration phase.
Looking forward, the work programme for Civita will involve the installation of minimal production facilities and tying the well in to nearby infrastructure via a 1.1km long 3 flowline.
The gas will be treated to sales specification and compressed to pipeline pressure in existing facilities under the terms of the production and transportation agreement.
Negotiations on an agreement with the Comprensione Understanding JKX Sect2 AW:JKX-report 11 4 07 11:21 Page 16 16 owners of the existing facilities are well advanced.
First gas is now expected in early 2008 but remains dependent on the approval process of the national and regional authorities.
Fiume Arrone JKX has a 30% interest in the Fiume Arrone permit 358sq.
km located to the west of Rome in the Lazio Basin.
The permit was issued in July 2002.
Three leads have been identified in this permit from old seismic data purchased by the working interest owners.
Agreements have been reached with two companies under which they will farm into the permit and fund the drilling and testing of the Fiume Arrone exploration well.
Following the completion of this farm-in, JKX will retain a 10% working interest: Italmin Exploration Slr will hold 30%, Ascent Resources will hold 40% and Oracle Energy Corporation 20%.
Ascent will assume operatorship from the drilling activity phase.
The Fiume Arrone exploration well will test a structural closure in the Pliocene at approximately 800m.
The available 2D seismic data shows a strong amplitude anomaly at this depth.
Access has been obtained to the surface location and, depending on the availability of a rig, the well is expected to spud in Q2 2007.
Montalbano JKX holds a 40% interest in the 165sq.
km Montalbano permit in the province of Matera in southern Italy.
The remaining 60% is equally divided between Vega Oil SpA and Nettis Gas Plus an Italian gas distributor now a wholly owned subsidiary of Gas Naturel, a Spanish gas producer and distributor.
The primary targets in the permit are the Plio-Pleistocene sands, which provide the reservoir for a number of shallow gas accumulations in the area.
There is an existing small discovery on the permit and initial efforts will concentrate on evaluating this discovery and the area around it.
The work programme for 2006 involved purchasing existing seismic.
During 2007 this data will be reprocessed and interpreted, following which a decision on whether to acquire further seismic or drill will be made.
Vega will operate the permit during the evaluation phase, with JKX assuming responsibility as operator when any drilling phase commences.
Corropoli In November 2004, JKX applied for the Corropoli Permit 176sq.
km which is located in the eastern part of central Italy, in the Abruzzo region.
The permit was previously relinquished by ENI, who recorded an 80sq.
km 3D seismic survey, identifying several leads and prospects.
ENI also drilled one well, Fonte Armata 1, which found gas shows but was not tested.
The primary target is the clastic layers in the middle and lower Pliocene at approximately 3,000m.
Structures are identified along a NW SE overthrust fold belt that runs through the permit.
Several fields are located along this axis adjacent to the permit area.
JKX is undertaking an environmental survey as part of the application process.
The permit award is expected during 2007.
JKX Oil & Gas plc Report and Accounts 2006 JKX Sect2 AW:JKX-report 11 4 07 11:21 Page 17 17 USA JKX holds a 34.4% working interest in 11,290 acres in the Centre Deep Federal Unit in Shelby County, East Texas.
The operator is Rosetta Energy Partners LP.
0 1500 km Texas The primary geological target in the Unit is the Lower Cretaceous James Lime formation, which produces gas from a number of wells adjacent to the Unit, most notably in the Huxley USA licence area field where a number of wells with multiple horizontal laterals have been drilled.
The first well on the Unit CDU 5, drilled in 2001, resulted in a gas discovery with the well originally testing at a rate of 2.5 MMcfd.
The performance of CDU 5 failed to meet initial expectations.
Following studies to determine the reasons for its poor performance, two additional wells were drilled in the latter part of 2004.
These horizontal wells were drilled in a central location in the Unit, each with a single lateral extending approximately 4,000ft at a vertical depth of 6,200ft.
The wells were drilled underbalanced.
Despite acidisation and a number of other attempts to improve their productivity, it has not been possible to maintain continuous production.
It has therefore been concluded that the reservoir properties in this part of the unit are poor.
Currently, there remain a number of areas on the unit where it is believed commercial quantities of hydrocarbons can be found Center Deep within the units initial target, the James Lime.
However, the next well will focus in on two formations underlying the James Lime the Travis Peak and Pettet.
Both these formations were found to be gas bearing when they were initially drilled in 1946 and 1954 but due to the lack of a gas market at the time, these discoveries were not placed on production.
Discussions with the operator are ongoing regarding drilling a new 9,500ft vertical well adjacent to the abandoned Pettet discovery well to penetrate the James Lime, the Pettet and the Travis Peak.
JKX is hopeful that the well will be drilled in 2007.

This group of three permits, together known as the Karakilise Licence, Turkey licence areas covers a total of 1,230sq.
km and contains a discovery well Karakilise 1 and associated production facilities.
The Karakilise discovery is close to a number of fields discovered by Shell between 1960 and 1980.
Karakilise 1 was drilled in 2003 and initially flowed at a rate of 300 bopd from the Cretaceous Mardin formation, a fractured carbonate which is the primary producing horizon in this area.
Appraisal well Karakilise 2 was drilled during the second quarter of 2005.
Karakilise 2 found the Mardin reservoir close to the expected depth.
However, the reservoir quality in the upper oil bearing section was poor.
Better reservoir quality was found deeper in the section but despite extensive stimulation and testing, the well failed to flow commercial quantities of oil and has been suspended.
In line with the work programme, Karakilise 1 was re-entered and deepened by approximately 2,000 ft in October 2006.
The purpose of this was to evaluate the Triassic, Hazro and Ordovician Bedinan Thrace Karakilise formations within a mapped four way dip closure.
The deepened well failed to find hydrocarbon in these horizons and was plugged in December 2006.
The production 0 15 km facilities have been moth-balled.
Further interpretation work is being carried out on the seismic Karakilise Discovery Well data within the block to the south of the Karakilise field.
If a suitable lead is identified, further seismic data will be acquired in order to bring the lead to ready to drill status.
Thrace In October 2005, JKX farmed into two onshore exploration licences 3998 and 3999 in the Thrace region in the west of Turkey.
These two licences cover a total of 897sq.
km, JKX will earn a 25% interest in the permits Karakilise licences by paying 50% of the costs of study work and new seismic up to a maximum of $415,000.
Thrace Basin gas is relatively straightforward to develop and benefits from extremely attractive commercial terms.
The licences contain two strong leads, but additional seismic data is required to firm up drillable prospects.
The planned 2006 seismic data acquisition programme was delayed by a lack of available seismic crews in the area and is now planned for Q2 2007.
A first well could be drilled in 2008.
The target formations are Tertiary sands which produce gas from a number of fields in Thrace, with the closest producing field being 25km east of the licence boundary.
In 2006 JKX also acquired a 25% interest in Licence 4187, adjacent to Licences 3998 & 3999, with a total area of 980sq.
Prior to the farm-in, the permits were held 100% by AME.
Tethys Oil Turkey AB Tethys is acquiring a 25% interest on the same terms as JKX.
Following the farm-in, the licence interests will be: AME 50% operator : JKX 25%: and Tethys 25%.
