Cookson Group plc { 15 } Annual Report 2006 OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED Group performance The financial information provided in this review is at reported exchange rates and reflects the restatements described further in the Financial Review on page 29.
Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Unless otherwise stated, for revenue and trading profit the impact of changes in exchange rates between 2005 and 2006 has not been material and, as a result, the percentage improvement between 2005 and 2006 is the same at both reported and constant exchange rates.
Group revenue from total operations for 2006 was 2% higher than in 2005.
In the Groups continuing operations, which exclude the results of the Laminates and Monofrax businesses in 2006, revenue was 9% higher.
The increase in revenue from continuing operations reflected both strong organic growth plus the impact of higher metal prices being passed through to customers in the Precious Metals division and the Assembly Materials and Chemistry sectors of the Electronics division.
Revenue trends were broadly similar between the first and second half of the year on a constant currency basis, with 10% and 9% increases respectively.
Trading profit from total operations increased by 17% compared to the prior year.
In continuing operations, the growth rate was 20%.
Each division reported significantly higher levels of profitability than in the prior year, reflecting both the strong organic revenue growth and the benefit of the cost reduction initiatives implemented over the last two years.
Trading profit increased by 22% to 89.5 million in the Ceramics division: by 11% to 58.5 million in the Electronics division: and by 41% to 11.0 million in the Precious Metals division.
Return on sales from total operations for the Group of 9.5% has improved by 1.3 percentage points compared to 2005.
In continuing operations, the Groups return on sales is also 9.5%, 0.9 percentage points higher than for 2005.
Each division recorded good growth in return on sales from continuing operations with the margin of the two largest divisions, Ceramics and Electronics, well into double-digit levels at 11.8% and 10.5%, respectively.
If metals prices in 2006 had remained at similar levels to those in 2005, the return on sales from continuing operations in 2006 would have been 0.4 percentage points higher at 9.9%.
The fastest growing and most profitable region for the Group continued to be Asia-Pacific, which accounted for 23% of Group revenue from continuing operations in 2006 and 42% of trading profit.
NAFTA which comprises the US, Canada and Mexico and Europe remain the Groups largest regions in terms of revenue: however, despite revenue growth in both these regions, higher levels of growth in Asia-Pacific in particular has seen their combined share of Group revenue fall from 75% in 2005 to 72% in 2006.
Divisional performance Ceramics division Known in its markets as Vesuvius, the Ceramics division is the world leader in the supply of advanced flow control refractory products and systems to the global steel industry and a leading supplier of specialist ceramics products to the glass and foundry industries.
It is also a regional leader in the US, UK and Australia in the supply and installation of monolithic refractory linings.
The division had another excellent year with strong revenue growth in its higher-margin speciality products, improved profitability in the linings business and improved operating efficiencies resulting in a record level of profitability.

Whilst this improvement is encouraging, this businesses which were either sold or closed during the year, level of profitability is still well below that of its main but which did not qualify to be treated as discontinued competitors and we believe that further significant operations for financial reporting purposes.
These include the improvements can be made going forward.

Cookson Group plc { 19 } Annual Report 2006 OPERATING REVIEW CONTINUED Electronics division The Electronics division is a leading supplier of advanced surface treatment and plating chemicals and assembly materials to the automotive, construction and electronics markets.
2006 was a strong year for the division with generally strong end-market demand combined with the benefit of our ongoing programme of restructuring in the more mature markets of the US and Europe and further investment in faster-growing markets, particularly China.
The disposal of the Laminates business in April 2006 further strengthened the division by reducing its exposure to this lower-margin and more cyclical part of the electronics market.
Market overview Following the disposal of the Laminates business, only around 65% of the divisions continuing revenue now comes from electronics markets with the remainder deriving from automotive and other industrial markets.
The improved market conditions in the global electronics industry that were evident in 2005 have continued throughout 2006.
The worldwide semi-conductor industry grew 9% by value in 2006, whilst printed circuit board PCB production grew 8% by value.
Electronic equipment production worldwide grew by 10% by value in 2006, driven by strong consumer-led demand for PCs, mobile telephones, games consoles, plasma and LCD televisions and MP3 players.
Global PC sales grew by 9% by volume in 2006, whilst the total annual production of mobile phones reached one billion units for the first time, representing growth of 23% over 2005.
Regionally, Asia-Pacific experienced the strongest growth both as a result of production capacity migrating to this region and also from strong local end-market demand.
Electronic equipment production, for example, whilst growing 10% worldwide saw lower growth in both the US and Europe 5% and 4% respectively being more than offset by growth of 25% in China.
The world-wide transition to lead-free products continued strongly in 2006, with new EU regulations the Reduction of Hazardous Substances Act coming into force in mid-2006, which forbids the use of lead in the majority of electronic assemblies.
The use of lead-free products is a significant change, not just for the Assembly Materials sector, whose solder products have traditionally contained lead.
Non-lead solders melt at higher temperatures and so all other PCB components, including fabrication chemistries, must also be able to withstand these temperatures.
In the third quarter of 2006, it was estimated that 53% of the global market for solder was lead-free.
The increasing move to lead-free products is expected to continue over the next few years, albeit at a slower pace.
For the non-electronics markets, 2006 was a mixed picture: despite overall global economic growth, the most important non-electronics market for the division, the automotive industry, was subdued, with only a marginal increase in vehicle production in Europe and a near 3% reduction in the US.
Divisional performance Revenue for the year from continuing operations excluding the results of the Laminates business at 555 million was 13% higher than last year at reported exchange rates 14% higher at constant exchange rates.
Excluding the impact of higher metals prices tin and silver prices in the Assembly Materials sector and gold and palladium in the Chemistry sector and the impact of disposals and closures PVC Cements in December 2006 and the closure of the European Industrial Metals business in Naarden, the Netherlands in June 2006, organic revenue was 6% higher.
Trading profit from continuing operations increased by 11% to 58.5 million, giving a return on sales for the division of 10.5%.
The return on sales is marginally below that reported in 2005 10.7% due to the impact of higher metal prices.
If metals prices in 2006 had remained at similar levels to those in 2005, the return on sales in 2006 would have been 0.8 percentage points higher than for 2005.
Return on net assets for the division increased strongly from 37.6% in 2005 to 42.2% in 2006.

Products include alloy materials, semi-finished jewellery components and finished jewellery.
Market overview 2006 saw overall retail jewellery market conditions being marginally stronger than for 2005.
Retail demand was stronger in the US with all of the key retailers such as Wal-Mart, Signet, Tiffany and Zales, reporting improved trading conditions.
Market conditions in Europe remained weak.
Demand for finished jewellery products is influenced to a large extent by both consumer confidence and consumer preferences.
Consumer confidence, whilst generally robust, was negatively impacted by higher interest rates and energy prices during the year.
The shift in customers discretionary spend over the last few years away from jewellery products and more towards consumer electronic products such as mobile phones and MP3 players has continued.
The preference of buyers and wearers of jewellery for white metals and gemstones, which started in 2004 and continued throughout 2005, has showed some early signs of abating with some return to fashion in 2006 of the yellow gold look.
