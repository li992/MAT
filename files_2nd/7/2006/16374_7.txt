Report of the Directors continued Operating review by region Basis of reporting In this Operating review we comment on our changes in revenue on the basis of underlying sales growth USG.
This measure reects the change in revenue at constant rates of exchange, average exchange rates for the preceding year excluding the effects of acquisitions and disposals.
It is a measure that provides valuable additional information on the underlying performance of the business.
In particular, it presents the organic growth of our business year on year and is used internally as a core measure of sales performance.
USG is not a measure which is dened under either IFRS or US GAAP.
It should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with either IFRS or US GAAP.
This measure as reported by us may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The reconciliation of USG to turnover for each of our reporting regions is given in the following section, and for the Group in total on page 25.
The reporting in this section is based on results for continuing operations.
Following the disposal of the majority of our European frozen foods businesses during 2006, the operations which we classify under this heading are different from those which were included as continuing operations in our Report and Accounts 2005.
