IPD UK Annual Industrial Index Overall UK sample It is also relevant to look at the amalgam of IPDs results for the market areas where Brixton is represented and the overall figure produced is 1.7% rental growth which compares directly to our portfolio figure of 3.8%.
Additionally we compare very favourably to IPDs overall numbers for Greater London at 2.6% and the South East as a whole at 1.1%.
It should also be noted that in the two sub-markets where we appear to have lagged IPD there are perhaps mitigating circumstances.
