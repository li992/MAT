Performance Operational review Production and reserves 7 Reserves and contingent resources 2006 has seen key milestones in a number of our development projects and initial success mmboe in our high impact exploration programme.
These are material steps forward in achieving 350 our medium-term production target of 50,000 boepd and in growing our portfolio of four 300 regional businesses.
250 200 Working interest production for 2006 averaged 33,000 boepd.
Comparable production 150 from 2005 was 33,300 boepd.
Production comprised 33 per cent liquids and 67 per cent 100 gas, with Pakistan and Indonesia each accounting for around 37 per cent and 35 per cent 50 of the total respectively, the UK 2 per cent and West Africa the remainder.
On an 0 2004 2005 2006 entitlement basis, group production for the year was 28,900 boepd 2005: 28,700 boepd.

At year-end, reserves comprised 8 per cent liquids and 82 per cent gas, and the equivalent volume on an entitlement basis amounted to 32 mmboe 2005: 46 mmboe.
Booked reserve revisions represent the write-down of 5 mmboe from the Chinguetti field in Mauritania, offset by an increase in booked reserves from the Anoa field in Indonesia following strong offtake volumes by the buyers under the existing Gas Sales Agreement GSA.
Discoveries made in the year in Vietnam have not been recorded in booked reserves, pending completion of ongoing appraisal and commercialisation work.
These volumes, together with others in the process of being commercialised including unsold gas in Indonesia and other discoveries which have not yet received development sanction elsewhere give increased total reserves and contingent resources of 289 mmboe 2005: 232 mmboe.
Exploration and appraisal Premiers achievement in growing its exploration portfolio in recent years yielded a series of exploration successes in 2006 and the opening up of significant follow-on opportunities.
The company has also continued to seek and sign-up new prospective areas in its North Sea, West Africa and Asia regions.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Operational review continued 8 In 2006 Premier drilled exploration and appraisal wells with a success rate of over 60 per cent.
In Vietnam we drilled three wells resulting in a successful appraisal well and two new exploration discoveries.
In our Indonesian West Natuna Blocks we made three discoveries.
Five of these six wells were Premier-operated, and Premiers E&A success rate has continued to exceed 50 per cent since 2000.
In Indonesia we have now drilled 3 out of 5 successful operated exploration wells since 2000.
The Blackbird oil discoveries are the first in the vicinity, and open up substantial future opportunities across two large tranches of mostly unexplored acreage in Vietnam Block 2 and Block 7&8 97 and another large tranche in Indonesia the Tuna Block, awarded in March 2007.
These successes in Asia have confirmed the validity of our strategy of extending the knowledge we have gained over many years from our interests in the Indonesian Natuna Sea area into the neighbouring Vietnamese waters.
In adding acreage around the world during 2006 in Vietnam, in Indonesia, in Congo and in Norway we have been mindful of staying within our areas of competency.
Premier planned to spend no more than US$50 million on seismic and drilling in 2006.
In order to ensure a broad exposure to high reward prospects and, at the same time, keep the cost exposure down, we undertook several farmouts reducing our equity in projects in return for funding current exploration on favourable terms.
These projects include farmouts for the 2006 wells in Vietnam Block 2E and W, and for the 2007 wells in Guinea Bissau, the UKCS Peveril well and the Philippines Ragay Gulf SC43 licence.
2007 sees a very active exploration programme, with Espinafreand Eirozesbeing drilled offshore Guinea Bissau, Peverilin the UKCS, Masimpur-3 targeting a large structure in NE India, several exploration wells in Indonesia, a deep-water well in Indus offshore Pakistan, a well on our Themis Block in Gabon, and programmes unfolding in Vietnam for 3D acquisition and more wells drilling in late 2007 and through 2008.
The 2007 programme will include up to 5 wells at an estimated pre-tax cost of US$ 00 million post-tax and recoveries: US$70 million.
Asia Asia India Indonesia Premiers core asset in Indonesia is its interest in the West Natuna Gas project, which supplies gas under a long-term gas sales contract to Singapore.
This is held through Vietnam equity interests in the Natuna Sea Block A and the Kakap PSCs.
Philippines In 2006, Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A sold an overall average of 30 billion British thermal units per day BBtud gross with a further 66 BBtud gross average sold from the non-operated Kakap fields under the same agreement.
Oil production from Indonesia Anoa averaged 2,58 barrels of oil per day bopd gross 2005: 3,023 bopd gross with the reduction due to natural depletion of the oil reservoirs.
Oil production from Kakap averaged 6,998 bopd gross 2005: 7,263 bopd gross.
Overall, net production from Indonesia amounted to, 550 boepd 2005: 2,050 boepd with Anoa and Kakap contributing 7,890 boepd and 3,660 boepd respectively.
Premiers commitment to health, safety and environmental performance was demonstrated with the award of OHSAS 800 and retention of the ISO 400 certification and Indonesias PROPER Blue rating.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Performance The West Lobe wellhead platform was installed in April 2006 with hook-up taking place 9 in May 2006.
The Seadrill-5 jack-up drilling rig arrived on location at the platform in August 2006 to drill four gas production wells into the West Lobe of the Anoa field.
All wells achieved their objectives with first gas flowing from the platform in December 2006.
During the drilling campaign an opportunity was taken to appraise an un-drilled potential oil reservoir in the central area of the Anoa field.
The well successfully encountered and evaluated a 67ft oil column before being sidetracked to the planned gas development location for the well.
Planning is now under way for the development of the oil discovery with a well expected to be drilled in the first half of 2007 which is expected to add initially up to 2,000 bopd gross to Anoa production.
Negotiations for further gas sales from Natuna Sea Block A continue with prospective buyers in the region and we are targeting sales of gas from 20 0 to the Singapore petrochemical sector.
Discussions have also been held with PLN, the Indonesian national power company, to sell gas domestically to Batam.
We expect to move to definitive gas sales agreements on these projects during the second half of 2007.
The 2006 Indonesian exploration drilling campaign resulted in a 00 per cent success rate with a gas discovery in Macan Tutuland the discovery and testing of oil and condensate rich gas at Lembu Peteng-.
Lembu Peteng forms part of a trend of structures that stretches east to the existing Lembudiscovery, dating from 984.
Further exploration and appraisal wells on the trend are planned for 2007 to establish the significance and development potential of this area as part of the drive to ensure maximum value is extracted from the Natuna Sea Block A asset.
Technical studies were also carried out across other areas on Block A to identify additional potential drilling targets for the 2007 drilling campaign.
A number of prospects have been highlighted for further assessment with the final programme dependent on ongoing work and results of the early wells.
During the year, Premier acquired a 6.67 per cent stake in the North Sumatra Block A PSC.
Initially Premier partnered with Japex and Medco holding equal interests.
After year-end Premier increased its stake in the PSC to 4.
67 per cent by jointly purchasing the ConocoPhillips share of the PSC with Medco.
The acquisition cost for the two transactions was US$53 million.
The acreage contains undeveloped discoveries on the Alur Siwah, Alur Rambong, and July Rayeu fields, with certified reserves of over 650 billion cubic feet bcf of gas.
There is substantial upside from around 20 identified exploration prospects, with total prognosed unrisked potential reserves of.
5 trillion cubic feet tcf gross, Enhanced Oil Recovery EOR opportunities through redevelopment of old abandoned oil fields, as well as from the possible development of the giant Kuala Langsa gas field.
Subject to completing a GSA, first gas is expected to commence in early 20 0, supplying feed gas to two fertiliser plants in North Sumatra.
In December, Premier was awarded an interest in the Buton PSC in South Eastern 2 Sulawesi.
The Buton PSC covers 3,396km and lies on the south-eastern side of Buton Island, Sulawesi, Indonesia.
It is an underexplored block in an onshore frontier area.
Oil seeps are prolific over the island and volumes of expelled oil are sufficient to underpin the commercial asphalt mining operations that have been ongoing on the island since colonial times.
The acreage has potential for multiple targets on structures that are known to exist from satellite image analysis.
Our initial work programme will focus on identifying prospects to support a high impact drilling opportunity in 2009.
Premier is partnered by Japex and KUFPEC in this PSC, and holds a 30 per cent non-operated interest.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Operational review continued 0 Vietnam Premier drilled three successful exploration wells as operator and acquired over, 500km of 2D marine seismic data on Block 2.
The first discovery, Dua-4X, drilled in the north of the Dua field, confirmed the extent of an oil accumulation first discovered in 974 with the DuaX well.
Dua-4X was then sidetracked to delineate the northern half of the Dua field.
The rig was then moved to drill the Dua-5X well which intersected oil in multiple reservoirs in the southern part of the Dua field.
Two reservoir zones were tested and flowed at a combined rate of 6,947 boepd.
Dua-5X was then suspended as a potential producer.
The second exploration structure to be drilled was 20km to the southwest at Blackbird, where well 2E-CSX discovered oil in multiple reservoir zones, two of which were tested at a combined rate of 6,569 boepd.
This well was sidetracked to delineate the extent of the hydrocarbon bearing reservoir.
Following this exploration success, Premier has commenced appraisal and development studies for each of the Blackbird and Dua discoveries.
Oil in place across the two discoveries is currently estimated to be in the range of 80 to 620 mmbbls, of which approximately 80 mmbbls represents most likely recoverable volumes.
With first oil currently scheduled for 20 0, Premier has commenced pre-development studies for both fields and a programme of 3D seismic acquisition is expected to commence in April 2007 to clarify the volumetric uncertainty on the Blackbird field.
The Dua field is already covered by 3D seismic data acquired in 2005.
The 3D area will be extended beyond the Blackbird field to define other prospects ahead of the next phase of exploration drilling, likely to be in 2008.
Premier holds a 37.5 per cent exploration working interest in Block 2, with partners Santos 37.5 per cent and Delek 25 per cent.
In December, Premier exercised an option to acquire from VAMEX a 45 per cent working interest in, and operatorship of, Block 7&8 97.
Block 7&8 97 is located immediately to the southeast of Block 2 in the Nam Con Son Basin.
Interpretation of 2D marine seismic data from Block 7&8 97 has demonstrated the existence of the same play elements which create petroleum prospectivity in Block 2 and the potential for numerous large structures suitable for high impact well locations.
India Drilling commenced on the high impact Masimpur prospect in Assam on 2 January 2007.
Work is under way to prepare for the drilling of two follow-up wells to Masimpur on the large Hailakandi and Kanchanpur gas prospects.
Road and site construction has begun at Hailakandi following environmental approvals.
Premier is operator of the Cachar Block and holds a 4.5 per cent working interest.
All outstanding issues have been resolved between the partners regarding the development of the Ratna oil fields, offshore Mumbai, and documentation leading to the formal signature of the PSC is being progressed through the ministries concerned.
Premier holds a 0 per cent carried working interest in the Ratna fields, estimated to contain around 80 mmbbls.
Philippines During 2006, Premier operated the SC43 licence in the Ragay Gulf area of SE Luzon province with a 42.5 per cent working interest.
Seismic reprocessing, geological studies and preparatory work for a well on the Monte Cristo prospect have been carried out.
Geological work led to the identification of a new prospective trend in the Panaon Limestone formation and marine seismic acquisition is planned in 2007 to pursue this promising lead.
Subsequent to year-end, Premier has farmed out 2.
5 per cent of its 42.5 per cent interest to Pearl Energy and PNOC in exchange for a carry in the forthcoming well, now expected in the first half of 2008.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Performance Middle East-Pakistan Middle East-Pakistan Pakistan The record production level achieved in 2005 was exceeded during 2006.
Production net to Premier in 2006 was 2, 50 boepd, an increase of 6 per cent over 2005, 500 boepd.
The increase in production was mainly due to higher sales from the Zamzama field, from Egypt exceptionally high gas demand.
Pakistan Qadirpur produced an average of 3,866 boepd, for Premiers net interest of 4.75 per cent 2005: 3,807 boepd.
The project to enhance Qadirpur plant capacity from 500 mmscfd to 600 mmscfd was ongoing through 2006 and first gas from that increased capacity is expected by the end of December 2007.
A Term Sheet has been signed with the gas buyer, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, to increase the Annual Contract Quantity ACQ from the existing 450 mmscfd to 550 mmscfd.
The Qadirpur Deepwell has been drilled to a depth of 4,68 metres.
The well encountered hydrocarbons in several zones and was suspended when higher than anticipated temperatures were encountered.
Specialist equipment has now been ordered and testing on the well will resume later in 2007.
On Kadanwari, the K- 5 well was tied back to the processing plant.
The additional production from it compensated for the natural decline of the field and also provided some production redundancy.
The field produced an average of, 200 boepd during 2006 2005:, 228 boepd for Premiers interest of 5.79 per cent.
To exploit additional reserves in Kadanwari, two wells K- 6 and 8 are planned to be drilled in the first half of 2007.
Zamzama produced an average of 4, 40 boepd, net to Premier, during 2006 from its 9.375 per cent interest.
This was some 3 per cent higher than the previous year 2005: 3,677 boepd.
Work continued in 2006 on the Zamzama Phase 2 development to make available gross 50 mmscfd high calorific value sale gas in the third quarter of 2007.
The production level in the Bhit field, from Premiers 6 per cent working interest, was 2,944 boepd in 2006 2005: 2,788 boepd.
A supplemental GSA to increase the Bhit ACQ from 270 mmscfd to 300 mmscfd has been signed by the gas buyer Sui Southern Gas Company Limited SSGCL and by joint venture partners.
The Bhit plant capacity is being enhanced to 3 5 mmscfd to allow accelerated Bhit field production and production of Badhra reserves starting by the end of the fourth quarter of 2007.
In Zarghun South, negotiations on the GSA were successfully concluded with the gas buyer, SSGCL, for the sale of 22 mmscfd gas from the field.
The field development has commenced and first gas is planned for the first quarter of 2009.
Premiers interest of 3.75 per cent is carried by the operator other than for government commitments during the development and production phases of the field.
Egypt In Egypt, the Al Amir-2 well was drilled to appraise the 2005 Al Amir discovery on the onshore North West Gemsa Concession.
The discovery well, Al Amir-, had flowed oil at over 750 bopd from the South Gharib Formation.
The Al Amir-2 well confirmed oil at the same reservoir level.
However, on test, the well flowed water and oil at sub-commercial rates and was plugged and abandoned.
The Al-Fagr wildcat well was plugged and abandoned after MDT tests were run.
Although shows were recorded while drilling and logs displayed possible hydrocarbon saturations in the target section, no hydrocarbons were recovered on test.
Subsequent to year-end, Premier has exercised an option with the operator, Vegas, to reduce its interest to 0 per cent in the block which entitles Premier to a partial refund of past costs.
Premier continues to participate in exploration licensing rounds and farm-in discussions with a view to building on its position in Egypt.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Operational review continued 2 Our new business efforts continue to be focused on building existing relationships in the region.
In February 2007 we signed an MoU with Emirates International Investment Corporation EIIC, an Abu Dhabi investment company, with a view to acquiring new interests in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere in the region.
North Sea North Sea In the North Sea, Premier is continuing to pursue the established strategy of seeking Norway out high impact exploration opportunities while maximising the value from its existing producing assets.
United Kingdom UK Production in the UK in 2006 amounted to 6,850 boepd 2005: 9,750 boepd representing 2 per cent of the group total 29 per cent in 2005.
This represents a decrease of some 30 per cent on last years level due to a combination of natural decline and specific operational problems.
The Wytch Farm oil field contributed 3,205 boepd net production to Premier, down 20 per cent on last year.
In 2006, the production performance was severely impacted by a number of serious well failures.
In January, the F05 well, producing 3,000 bopd gross, failed and required a workover.
The well was brought back onstream in March.
The M07 well was completed and brought on production in February but was suspended due to a suspected collapsed hole.
The subsequent intervention was unsuccessful and the well was redrilled and production re-established in June.
Year-end production recovered to 27,000 boepd gross 3,300 boepd net.
The operator, BP, is planning to complete two new wells and four workovers during 2007, together with various plant upgrades and a new office facility.
Net production from Kyle was, 962 boepd, down 46 per cent on last year.
Gas production remained below the annual target for most of the year, however, this was compensated by higher oil production that enabled Kyle to deliver in line with the annual composite production budget.
The re-perforation of the Kyle- 5 well was delayed until October and when completed produced disappointing results.
The K- 6 well that was scheduled to be drilled in 2006 has been rescheduled to 2008.
The gas lift project that was originally planned to commence in 2006 has now slipped and is expected to be completed in May 2007.
Concurrently facility upgrades are being undertaken on the Petrojarl Banff host processing facility.
In the Fife area, Premiers net production amounted to, 56 bopd from the Fife, Fergus, Flora and Angus fields.
The Angus field was suspended in September after an intervention failed and remains suspended subject to the joint venture determining the forward strategy for this asset.
The Fife FPSO fixed contract term ends in December 2007 with discussions currently under way with Bluewater to exercise the contract extension option.
Scott and Telford accounted for the remainder of net UK production.
In December, the company received notification of Hess intention to sell its 20.05 per cent equity interest in the Scott field to Nexen Petroleum UK.
Premier has since advised Hess that it is pre-empting the proposed transaction.
Upon completion of the relevant Sale and Purchase Agreement, Premiers working interest will become 2.
83 per cent effective January 2007, representing an average 2007 entitlement of 5,000 bopd at expected production rates.
Detailed evaluation of the UK exploration portfolio continued throughout 2006 working on developing the prospects to drillable candidates for 2007 and 2008, specifically in Blocks 23 22b P 8 and 2 7b P 77 in the Central North Sea.
Further geological and geophysical work integrated with a comprehensive commercial evaluation on Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Performance the Southern North Sea portfolio of Blocks 44 2 c, 44 26b P 84, Blocks 42 0, 3 42 5 P 229 and Blocks 43 22b, 43 23, 43 27b, 43 28 and 43 29 P 235 resulted in Premier having fulfilled the work obligations for these licences, relinquishing them in December as no commercial viable hydrocarbon prospects were identified.
Integration of the results from the 2 6a-7 well on the Palomino prospect in licence P 048, which was plugged and abandoned dry in January 2006, are being integrated into the adjacent licence P 77 evaluation to assess the remaining prospectivity.
Premiers 00 per cent equity in the Fife area Blocks 39 c and 39 2c was successfully farmed down to a 30 per cent equity level carried through the forecast costs of the Peveril prospect well, which spudded on 26 March 2007 to test the Jurassic Fulmar sands in a similar setting to the Angus field.
Significant follow on potential is provided by Blocks 39 b and 39 7 P 52 where additional prospects have been identified on the reprocessed 3D seismic.
Two licence applications were made by Premier in the UK 24th Licensing Round covering Blocks 5 23c, 5 24a, 5 25f and 5 29e.
In February 2007 it was announced that Premier had been awarded a split portion of the 5 24a application area.
Norway The five licences awarded to Premier in the APA 2005 Licensing Round, are being progressed through the work programmes tendered to reach critical decision points: drill or drop for three of the licences by the end of 2007: acceleration of a possible well on one licence and development approval for the Fry potential redevelopment.
These licences offer a spectrum of redevelopment, appraisal and exploration opportunities which have the potential for both early production and high impact exploration.
The five APA 2005 licences consist of Blocks 35 2 and 36 0 licence PL378: Blocks 6 part and 6 4 licence PL359, Blocks 34 2 and 34 5 licence PL374 s, Blocks 34 4 part and 34 5 licence PL375, and Blocks 25 2, 25 3, 25 5 and 25 6 PL364 Fry.
The Fry field was abandoned in 200 by a previous operator in a much lower oil price environment and due to the imminent abandonment of the nearby Frigg field to which it was tied back.
The Fry field is the subject of extensive redevelopment studies with plans to seek early development approvals.
Premier was very active in the APA 2006 Licensing Round, submitting applications for five potential licences.
The licence round announcement in January 2007 confirmed that we had been successful in securing five new licences, including two licences in the very competitive Bream discovery area.
The licence interests obtained in the APA 2006 Round are as follows: Block no.
Working interest % Operator 7 8,9, 2 & 8 7, 0 Bream appraisal 20 British Gas 7 2, 8 3, 9, 8 0 & 8 Bream exploration 40 Premier Oil 3 3, 32, 36 0 40 Revus 35 9 part 25 Nexen 35 8 5 Nexen The Bream appraisal area contains the Bream discovery which is to be appraised by a well with a declaration of development by the end of 2008.
Contingent upon a successful appraisal of the Bream structure, the partnership group will drill a further exploration well to target additional resources identified in this highly prospective area.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Operational review continued 4 Premier successfully qualified as an operator in Norway in 2006 and the award as operator for the Bream exploration acreage reflects Premiers commitment to develop a business in Norway.
The licence has a five-year first-term duration requiring 3D seismic acquisition and a firm well.
Blocks 3 3, 32 and 36 0 are adjacent to the PL378 licence and help in the development of a core area around the Tampen Spur for Premier.
The remaining two licence awards are adjacent to the Gja field which is currently being developed and offer some interesting stratigraphic potential.
West Africa West Africa Mauritania SADR The Chinguetti oil field started production in Woodside operated PSC B on 24 February 2006 at an initial rate of 70,000 bopd 5,600 bopd net to Premier.
The field is located in Mauritania 800m of water some 90km west of the capital Nouakchott.
The initial development of six production wells and three water injectors did not perform Congo to initial expectations in 2006.
This is the result of greater than expected reservoir Guinea Bissau compartmentalisation due to reservoir geometry and complex structure.
Production at Gabon the end of 2006 was in the region of 22,000 bopd, 780 bopd net to Premier.
Remedial action to increase production commenced in late December with the drilling of the Chinguetti- 8 well.
This well encountered 35 metres of net oil pay, close to expectations, and was being completed at the end of the reported period.
Additional development drilling is planned in the third and fourth quarter of 2007, with up to six wells being considered, which would extend the drilling campaign in to 2008.
The performance of the initial development wells has had an impact on the expected reserves of the field, with the operators proven and probable reserves being reduced from the pre-development expectation of 23 million barrels of oil mmbo to 62 mmbo.
Further revisions are expected as a result of a 3D high-resolution and 3D seismic survey that is to commence in the first half of 2007 over the field.
Premier expects that, as a result, the 2P reserves will be revised upwards in the course of the year.
The reserves are also expected to increase with further phases of development drilling, if commercially viable.
In 2006, the Mauritanian government challenged certain amendments avenants to Woodside operated concessions, including those in which Premier has an interest PSCs A and B.
This resulted in the joint ventures signing revised PSCs with the Mauritanian government in June 2006, under which the fiscal provisions in the contracts were altered to reflect the higher oil prices prevailing at that time at a net cost to Premier of US$9.2 million.
Two exploration wells were drilled in Premiers Mauritanian acreage, Dorein PSC B and Colinin PSC A.
Both wells failed to encounter hydrocarbons.
A third well, Kibaro-, which had been planned to test a Cretaceous objective in PSC A, was deferred to 2008 due to rig scheduling necessitated to drill the Chinguetti- 8 well.
In December, following a number of approaches, the Board determined that our interests in Mauritania were unlikely to generate high impact exploration opportunities which are our key targets in the region.
Accordingly, we have decided to conduct an auction with a view to the sale of the asset.
The results of the Mauritanian operation have, therefore, been classified separately in the financial statements under assets held for sale.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Performance Guinea Bissau 5 During 2006 processing of the 2005 3D seismic data over the Eirozes prospect, and re-processing of the existing 3D seismic over the Espinafre prospect, were completed.
The two data sets were interpreted to mature the Espinafre and Eirozes prospects for drilling.
The Global Santa Fe jack-up rig Baltic was contracted for a two well programme commencing in the first quarter of 2007.
The Espinafrewell was plugged and abandoned on 23 March 2007 after encountering hole stability problems.
The second well, Eirozes-, was spudded on 3 March 2007.
A successful outcome to the programme could lead to a significant increase in value and enhance the prospectivity of a number of lookalike prospects on the block.
Gabon In 2006 both existing 2D and 3D seismic data on the Sterling Energy operated Themis Permit were re-processed.
The results of the interpretation of this re-processed data have been incorporated into a block-wide understanding of the prospectivity to mature a prospect for drilling.
Premier, as drilling operator for the joint venture, has contracted the Global Santa Fe Adriatic 6, to drill this exploration well, which will take place during the third quarter of 2007.
Data interpretation and studies on the Dussafu Permit have been carried out during 2006 leading to development of a leads and prospects portfolio.
This will be used to find potential targets for drilling in the fourth quarter of 2007, or the first quarter of 2008.
Congo During 2006, Premier was awarded a 58.5 per cent operated working interest in Block IX, with its joint venture partners Ophir Energy Company Limited and the Congo national oil company, SNPC.
The PSC was ratified by the Congolese Parliament on 5 October 2006.
The block contains several prospects with high impact exploration potential.
Technical evaluation is ongoing with the expectation that the first well on the block could commence in 2008.
SADR The companys exploration assets in the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic SADR remain under force majeure, awaiting resolution of sovereignty under a United Nations mandated process.
