Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Financial review Reported results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs Reported results are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
In addition to reported results, the Groups performance in this Financial Review and throughout this Annual Report and Financial Statements is also explained through the use of APMs that are not defined under IFRS.
These APMs relate to adjusted results and movements on an underlying basis.
Management are of the view that these measures provide a more meaningful basis on which to analyse business performance and are consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by Management and reported to the Board.
These APMs are explained in detail on pages 33 to 36 and include reconciliations to the closest measure prescribed under IFRS where appropriate.
The analysis of underlying movements in adjusted results is set out at the end of the Financial Review.
Following the publication ofan amendment to IAS 1, the Group no longer shows non-IFRS adjustments on the face of its incomestatement.

Adjusted results UKPIL revenue declined by two per cent, with parcel revenue up three per cent and total letter revenue down five per cent.
Weaker Sterling had apositive impact of 28 million on UKPIL revenue.
This has been excluded from underlying movements.
Total parcel volumes increased by three per cent, with growth largely driven by Royal Mail account parcels.
Account parcel volumes, excluding Amazon, grew by four per cent.
In the consumer channel, we saw improving trends in volume and revenue.
The weakening of Sterling has impacted our international parcel volumes.
The rate of growth of import volumes slowed compared to last year.
We undertook a number 1 Following the Groups acquisition of the remaining 49per cent shareholding in Romec Limited Romec at the beginning of 2016-17, Romec has been consolidated into the UKPIL segment previously the Groups 51per cent shareholding was reported within 'Other' segment.
The 2015-16 UKPIL results have been re-presented to reflect thischange.
2 Stamped, metered and other prepaid revenue channels are subject to statistical sampling surveys to derive the revenue relating to parcels, marketing mail and letters.
These surveys are subject to continuous refinement, which may over time reallocate revenue between the products above, and which may occasionally lead to a consequent change to this estimate.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 | 21 Royal Mail plc | UK Parcels, International &Letters UKPIL ofinitiatives, including working to improve the UK delivery service with China Post which improved import AURs and revenue.
Export volumes declined for the year overall but grew in the second half.
Total parcel revenue was up three per cent.
Addressed letter volumes declined by six per cent excluding the impact of political parties election mailings, at the higher end of our forecast range of decline of four to six per cent per annum.
This reflected the levels of business uncertainty following the EU Referendum and a strong prior year which saw a one-off return of direct delivery volumes.
Total letter revenue including marketing mail decreased by five per cent reflecting the impact of low inflation on pricing and declines in volumes across all main letter products.
The methodology used to estimate the value of marketing mail revenue was refined during the year.
The prior year estimate for marketing mail revenue has been re-presented to reflect the change in methodology resulting in a reallocation of 18million of revenue from 'Letters and other' to 'Marketing mail' revenue.
Marketing mail revenue, which includes our data businesses, declined by eight per cent.
There was a slowdown in marketing activity over the year reflecting a softening in economic conditions.
Low AUR unaddressed letter volumes were down three per cent.
Revenue from election mailings relating to the EU Referendum was in line with that in the prior year relating to the 2015 General Election.
Weare expecting revenue from election mailings relating to the General Election called for June 2017.
Given the short run-up, it is likely to be lower thanin 2016-17.
UKPIL's performance in the first half of 2017-18 will be impacted by the phasing of performance over the prior year.
In particular, letters performance in the first quarter of 2017-18 may look relatively weak given the strong comparative quarter last year Q12016-17: Addressed letter volume two per cent decline.

Our cost avoidance programme in UKPIL delivered 225 million costs avoided in the year, comprising people costs of 132 million and non-people costs of 93 million.
We have delivered benefits across a number of initiatives during the year, including reducing layers in our management structures within operations, better vehicle utilisation, transformation of our IT infrastructure and lower property costs.
As previously disclosed, as a result of the new single-tier state pension scheme introduced in April 2016, the Group saw an increase in its employer National Insurance contributions for employees participating in the RMPP of 65 million in the year.
People costs declined by one per cent, largely driven by a 2.7per cent improvement in collections, processing and delivery productivity in the core network.
This more than offset pay increases, largely the 1.6per cent frontline pay award.
The improvement in productivity was achieved through a 1.9per cent reduction in core network hours, coupled with the absorption of a higher workload.
The higher workload was driven by an increase in tracked products which more than offset the impact of declining letter volumes.
We continue to target annual productivity improvements of2.0-3.0per cent per annum.
As previously disclosed, wage legislation such as the Working Time Directive, Apprentice Levy and increased costs relating to redundancy payments will impact people costs in the future.
The impact of the Apprentice Levy for 2017-18 is expected to be around 20 million.
We would expect to exclude the first year impact of such legislative changes from underlying movements if material.
Distribution and conveyance costs increased by one per cent, driven by increases in the cost of sales related to the international business.
Terminal dues increased by 62 million, of which 37 million reflects weaker Sterling and has been excluded from underlying movements.
The remaining 25million of the increase reflects the mix of export parcels revenue.
This trend is expected to continue next year.
Inaddition, we have seen increased costs associated with handling tracked volumes and larger parcels and we expect this to continue.
Total diesel and jet fuel costs of 159million were 13 million lower than the prior year due to lower pricing and improved fleet management.
We expect diesel and jet fuel costs to be around 140million in 2017-18.
Infrastructure costs were down one per cent with benefits from our cost avoidance programme more than offsetting the increase in depreciation and amortisation of around 20 million, due to parcels systems and tracking investments coming into use.
Within infrastructure costs, the cost avoidance programme has delivered benefits in property through the integration of Romec, IT transformation and lower discretionary spend across the entire estate.
Over the past five years, we have invested significantly in IT and other assets as part of the transformation programme.
As a result, the depreciation and amortisation charge is expected to increase by a further 30 million in 2017-18 but should stabilise thereafter.
Other operating costs were flat, with the increased cost of marketing and other spend in our new business areas being offset by activity within the cost avoidance programme, including lower discretionary spend.
22 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016-17 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information We remain on track to avoid annualised operating costs of around 600 million by 2017-18.
However, there remain cost pressures, in particular, the next pay deal and increased depreciation.

There was a net decrease of around 730 employees in UKPIL in the year.
However, there was a reduction of around 3 3,500full time equivalent employees FTEs to 148,170 FTEs reflecting a change in the mix of full-time and part-time employees and a reduction in variable hours.
Project costs were 75 million, largely relating to projects supporting the cost avoidance programme.
We expect transformation costs to be in the range 130 to 150 million per annum going forward.
Operating profit after transformation costs Adjusted operating profit after transformation costs was 411 million, giving a margin of 5.4per cent, down 10 basis points on an underlyingbasis.
3 Full time equivalent FTE numbers relate to the total number of paid hours including part-time, full-time and agency hours divided by the standard full-time working hours inthe same period.
