PORTFOLIO AND OPERATIONAL REVIEW PERFORMING WELL OPERATING EFFICIENTLY St. Modwen Properties PLC 38 Annual report and financial statements 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Portfolio focus and capital discipline Portfolio value Valuation performance Our portfolio was valued at 1.7bn at the end of November 2017.
1.7bn Adjusted for investments and disposals, our portfolio value increased by 2.6% during the year.
This valuation uplift was largely Industrial logistics pipeline driven by development gains and an increase in the value of our industrial portfolio, partly offset by a modest weakening in retail values and the New Covent Garden Market NCGM cost provision.
c. 700m The value of our income producing portfolio, which makes up 51% of our total portfolio 2016: 45%, increased by 1.5%.
Industrial logistics values increased 6.2%, reflecting a combination of yield compression and rental value growth.
Retail values were down 2.1% as valuation yields softened and other assets mostly PRS student housing were up 0.8%.
Overall, our income producing portfolio was valued at an equivalent yield of 7.5% at the end of November, which was down 20bps for the year on a like-for-like basis.
The remainder of our portfolio consists of a combination of current developments 19% and land earmarked for future development 30%.
Commercial land values were up 3.5% during the year, whilst commercial developments were up 15.9%.
Residential land values were up 1.1%, as increases in value of land at NCGM and other sites including South Ockenden were partly offset by the increased cost provision for NCGM.
Looking forward to 2018, we expect retail values will continue to see some further softening, but good investment and occupational demand continues to underpin industrial logistics values.
We expect upside in land values to be largely reliant on potential further planning gains.

St. Andrews Park has a rich history and as the former RAF Uxbridge played a pivotal role in the Battle of Britain.
The development is home to the Battle of Britain Bunker museum and operations room as well as the Grade II listed Hillingdon House, which sits at the heart of the park and is set to become home to a new restaurant.
What we did The vision for St. Andrews Park is to create a thriving, sustainable community in the heart of Uxbridge, comprising a comprehensive range of imaginative new homes, in a highly accessible, well connected location.
New homes are being developed in several phases including 85 St. Modwen Homes, currently under construction.
How the community gained The new John Locke Academy school has already welcomed its first students.
A new 40 acre park will provide a green heart and a focus for recreation.
St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual report and financial statements 2017 41 PORTFOLIO AND OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED Longbridge, South Birmingham Longbridge is a 468 acre regeneration site which sits south of Birmingham city centre and is being transformed into a mixed-use, high quality urban environment.
It has a worldwide reputation as the historical home to the Austin Mini and has latterly retained a 60 acre research and production facility for MG Motors.
What we did St. Modwen has worked on significantly regenerating Longbridge and has successfully reinvigorated employment in the area through the completion of Longbridge Innovation Centre, Devon Way and the Cofton Centre.
St. Modwen has also successfully completed the first two phases of the town centre, including a new 66m purpose built college and over 350 new homes.
How the community gained The regeneration of Longbridge is expected to create up to 10,000 new jobs through a diverse range of employment opportunities.
The town centre now attracts over 64,000 shoppers each week and in 2017 alone we hosted 14 free public events in the town centre.
The ripple effect of the regeneration of Longbridge is evident and looks on course to become the driving force for prosperity and social wellbeing in the area.

We already sold 1,188 plots during the year and we continue to see At New Covent Garden Market, via our JV with VINCI, we sold good demand from housebuilders.

Following the disposal of Nine Elms Square we have undertaken a full review of the remaining works.
The complicated nature of working on a site with a live market and an anticipated extended duration of the project have resulted in an increase in expected construction costs, with our share of this increase being 24.6m.
This was partly offset by a 14.5m increase in the value of our land holdings.
Our share of the remaining 10 acres of land, which will be released upon completion of the market relocation, is now valued at c. 6m per acre.
During the year we secured two new large residential-led developments.
At Kingsgrove, Wantage we signed a development agreement to deliver a mixed-use community of 1,500 homes over the next 10-15 years across a 227-acre site and St. Modwen Homes commenced works in late 2017.
We also signed a development agreement to deliver Buckover Garden Village, a new community of up to 3,000 homes in Gloucestershire over the next 25 years, together with our development partner, the Tortworth Estate.
We anticipate submitting a planning application for the 536-acre site during the second half of 2018.
Looking forward, we will continue to pursue new regeneration opportunities on a capital light basis, but as these new projects are opportunistic by nature, it is difficult to make specific forecasts for this.
St. Modwen Properties PLC 44 Annual report and financial statements 2017 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Additional information Parkside Business Park, Doncaster A 27 acre strategic development site, situated close to Doncaster Town Centre and within easy reach of the M18 and A1, Parkside is one of the largest managed business parks in Doncaster.
What we did Outline consent for 250,000 sq ft of business units on the development plot was granted in December 2015, including detailed planning consent for two high-specification units of 36,846 and 41,095 sq ft. St. Modwen remediated the land for these first two units which included the recycling of more than 13,000 tonnes of concrete.
How the community gained These units have recently been let to Bosch for an Automotive Training Centre and to Schenker for a servicing facility for the East Coast Main line.
In summer 2018, St. Modwen will complete the speculative development of two more versatile units which will further satisfy the shortage of mid-size industrial units in the South Yorkshire market.
