Approximately 76 per cent of the current portfolio is classified as either Core income or Growth income.
Core income assets typically exhibit long lease lengths, high cash on cash returns and are predominantly multilet, often with some form of indexation.
Growth Income assets constitute approximately 30 per cent of the current portfolio.
These assets are typically lower yielding but with higher intrinsic growth prospects.
20 per cent of the portfolio comprises properties which have shorter term, more intensive asset management plans underway.
These opportunities are typically incomeled with a significant percentage of prelet income being secured before development commences.
Our ability to create marginal revenue and enhance the quality of assets is fundamental to our overall strategy.
Where we believe we have maximised the potential of individual assets or where the market is prepared to pay a higher price than our view of the assets intrinsic value, we will look to recycle that capital into new opportunities.
