installed base of original equipment.
The Weir Group PLC 30 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Operational Review: Weir Minerals continued To take full advantage of these positive trends the division was proactive, investing in additional sales, engineering and project management capability.
It also extended its global service centre network with new facilities in Canada, France, Poland, Sweden, the Dominican Republic and Russia, taking our total number of service centres to approximately 100.
The division encountered some shortterm operational challenges in North America and Europe as a result of plant and supply chain reconfigurations to meet demand growth, but these had been substantially remediated by the end of the year.
Good progress was made globalising newer product lines such as the comminution offering and Delta Valves while new technology introductions included advanced spools for oil sands applications.
Key priorities in 2018 Safety continue our strong performance on safety and embed next phase of Weir Zero Harm programme.
Strengthen our engineering presence at service centres and customer sites.
Fully capture comminution, brownfield, tailings and spares opportunities.
Execute operational excellence and internal efficiency projects.
Outlook for 2018 Miners are expected to increase sustaining capital expenditure in 2018, supporting global ore production growth.
Assuming supportive market conditions continue, it is anticipated the division will deliver moderately higher constant currency revenues and slightly higher full year operating margins, with performance supported by both the strong order book and investment in growth initiatives in 2017.

The Weir Group PLC 38 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Operational Review: Weir Oil & Gas continued Reducing complexity to increase safety and productivity Increased safety and productivity are key priorities for our customers and so, after extensive consultation, we designed the Simplified Frac System which significantly reduces the amount and complexity of iron ona frac site.
Our solution provides a more streamlined, fit-for-purpose system that can be tailored to any condition or basin.
In addition to improving site safety, its linear flow-path design also prevents directional fluid changes that create accelerated wear, resulting in longer product life and extended productivity.
Seaboard One Straight Line OSL Frac Connection Engineered for demanding frac applications, the Seaboard One Straight Line OSL Frac Connection significantly reduces the amount of iron and connections required on the wellsite.
This means a corresponding reduction in non-productive time, rig-up time, labour costs, potential leak paths, and safety hazards.
SPM Swivels Weir SPM robust swivels enable the safe and efficient flow of fluids on a frac site at pressures of up to 15,000 psi.
All SPM swivels feature uniform wall thickness for consistent fluid flow and extended life.
SPM ball bearing connections combine strength and consistent rotation inthe most severe applications.
SPM QEM 3000 Frac Pump The SPM QEM 3000 is Weirs nextgeneration frac pump.
This continuous-duty pump delivers a 17% reduction in total cost ofownership through reduced downtime as fewer backup pumps are required on site.
