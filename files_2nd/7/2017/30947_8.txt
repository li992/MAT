The all-in sustaining cost from operations in 2018 is expected to be between $960 and $990per gold equivalent ounce or $13.0 and$13.4 per silver equivalent ounce which includes a full year of the new detoxification process at Inmaculada, further development costs at the Pablo vein and an investment of $14 million in a highly value accretive hydraulic backfill project at San Jose.
Arcatas costs are expected to be higher in line with its resource base despite the implementation of significant cost control measures.
