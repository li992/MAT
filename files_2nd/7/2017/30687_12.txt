Gross production in the latter part of 2017 was consistently above 90,000 bopd and we expect to build on this as we commence drilling in 2018.
Turret Remediation Project Following the discovery of the issue with the turret bearing of the Jubilee FPSO Kwame Nkrumah in 2016, Tullow has been able to continue efficient production operations while working on the permanent solution which involves converting the FPSO to a spread moored vessel.
The first phase of this work, involving the installation of a stern anchoring system, was completed in February 2017, after which the tugs maintaining the FPSO on heading control were removed.
Preparations continue in advance of the planned turret bearing stabilisation work in the first quarter of 2018.
This work is expected to take place over two shut-down periods, totalling four to six weeks.
A further planned shut-down of approximately three weeks is expected around year end 2018 to rotate the FPSO to its permanent heading and install the final spread GARY THOMPSON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR WEST AFRICA mooring anchoring system.

On 23 September 2017, the International Tribunal for the Law ofthe Sea ITLOS made its decision with regard to the maritime boundary dispute between Ghana and Cte dIvoire.
The new maritime boundary, as determined by the tribunal, does not affect the TEN fields.
Tullow subsequently received notification from the Government of Ghana to recommence drilling in the TEN fields and a multi-year incremental drilling programme will start this year, seeking to ramp up production from the TENfields to utilise the full capacity of the FPSO and sustain this over a number of years.
In the last quarter of 2017, Tullow signed the TEN Associated Gas TAG Gas Sales Agreement with the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and Tullow anticipates the start of gas sales from TEN in the first half of 2018.
Gross gas sales equivalent to 4,200 boepd net: 2,000 boepd have been forecast for the year.

The installed infrastructure from this initial phase can then be utilised for theoptimisation of the remaining South Lokichar oil fields, allowing the incremental development of these fields to be completed at a lower unit cost post-First Oil.
The Foundation Stage is currently planned to involve an initial 210 wells through 18 well pads at Ngamia and 70 wells through seven well pads at Amosing.
This stage will target volumes of around 210 mmbo of the total estimated 2C resources of 560mmbo and a plateau rate of 60,000 to 80,000 bopd.
The incremental development of the remaining 2C resources and the significant upside potential are expected to increase plateau production to 100,000 bopd or greater.
It is anticipated that theFEED and baseline Environmental and Social Impact Assessments ESIA for the foundation development will commence in the second quarter of 2018, with FID targeted for2019 and First Oil for 2021 22.

The proposed development plan reflects the Partnerships desire to sanction the project in a manner that is commercially robust, ensures the earliest possible FID and First Oil and supports the required infrastructure given the location of the South Lokichar Basin some 750 km from the Kenyan coast.
Appraisal campaign and resource estimates A total of 21 appraisal wells have been drilled in the South Lokichar Basin.
Tullow has also conducted extended well tests, water injection tests, well interference tests and water-flood trials, all of which have proved invaluable for planning the development of the oil fields.
The appraisal campaign has firmed up the Groups resource estimates and improved Tullows understanding of the subsurface at the key producing fields.

On 9 January 2017, Tullow announced that it had agreed to transfer 21.57 per cent of its 33.33 per cent Uganda interests toTotal for a total consideration of $900 million.
CNOOC subsequently exercised its pre-emption rights under the joint operating agreements to acquire 50 per cent of the interests being transferred to Total on the same terms and conditions.
Having signed pre-emption documents with its Joint Venture Partners and officially notified the Government of Uganda of the transaction, Tullow and its Joint Venture Partners are awaiting approval of the transaction from the Government of Uganda.
As previously disclosed, Tullow anticipates that the farm-down with Total and CNOOC will complete in the first half of 2018 with a cash payment of $100 million on completion and payment of the working capital completion adjustment and deferred consideration for the pre-completion period including $60 million for the whole of 2017 being received at this time.
