financial review Conduct and Disclosure of Purchases Purchases of shares under the ECMP will be made in the market at prices not exceeding 105% of the average middle market closing price of the shares over the previous five days, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List.
The purchasing activity of Batiss will be conducted and disclosed in keeping with existing regulation governing UK corporate share repurchases.
Future Application of Xstrata Shares Held by Batiss Xstrata Capital intends that the shares held by Batiss will either be used by the Group as a source of nancing for future acquisitions, in keeping with the Groups growth strategy, or placed in the market.
If the share price rises, Xstrata Capital would profit on a placing to the extent that the price realised for the shares in the market exceeds the original market price paid plus associated funding costs.
Xstrata Capital and Xstrata plc will consider in the future whether any shares held by Batiss will be acquired by Xstrata plc.
Any repurchase of shares by Xstrata plc would be subject to the approval of Xstrata plc shareholders and to appropriate clearance being obtained from the Swiss tax authorities.
The decision when to place the shares in the market, use the shares to assist the Group in facilitating future transactions, or to repurchase shares for cancellation, will be considered in light of the Group's funding requirements and capital structure at the time.
Accounting Treatment For so long as the shares continue to be held by Batiss they will be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the earnings per share of Xstrata plc.
Batiss will be consolidated by Xstrata as a quasi-subsidiary, and the shares held by it will be accounted for as a deduction from shareholders funds in the consolidated balance sheet of the Group.
If Xstrata shares held by Batiss are subsequently disposed of by way of a placing or as consideration for an acquisition by the Group, any gain or loss will be taken directly to the Groups reserves to the extent that the market value of the shares so disposed is above or below the cost of those shares.
No gain or loss would be recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account of the Group.
If shares held by Batiss are repurchased and cancelled by Xstrata, this would be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as though it had occurred at the time of the purchase of the shares by Batiss.

Xstrata plc 27 alloys Chrome Markets Demand for ferrochrome continued to grow through the year as the market moved out of a destocking phase, which had reduced global ferrochrome stocks to below normal levels by the end of the first quarter, and as stainless steel producers struggled to source sufficient stainless steel scrap at economic levels.
Western world stainless steel production increased to an estimated 19.1 million tonnes in 2002, some 5.8% up on 2001, excluding over 600,000 tonnes produced in the rapidly expanding Chinese market.
Europe accounted for over 8 million tonnes or 43% of western world production in 2002, an increase of some 6% over 2001.
Expansions at AvestaPolarit, ALZ Arcelor and AST in Italy are expected to increase European stainless production to some 8.5 million tonnes in 2003.
Based on stronger demand in the automotive and housing sectors, North American stainless steel production rose to 2.2 million tonnes in 2002, a recovery to 2000 levels and over 20% up on 2001 1.8 million tonnes.
Stainless steel production in Japan, Korea and Taiwan remained strong in 2002 at around 6.7 million tonnes.
While concerns exist regarding deationary pressures in the US, European and Japanese economies, rapidly increasing demand for stainless steel in China continues to provide major support to the industry, particularly in the Far East.
Korean production is expected to grow by more than 18% in 2003, primarily to feed the continuing increase in Chinese consumption, which was up 17% to 2.8 million tonnes in 2002 and which is estimated to increase a further 11% to over 3 million tonnes in 2003.
To meet the increased ferrochrome demand, estimated at around 4.4 million tonnes in 2002, western world supply of ferrochrome increased from approximately 3.8 million tonnes in 2001 to 4.2 million tonnes.
Ferrochrome stocks continued to reduce through the year and were at low levels by the end of 2002.
Reecting the strong demand and the improved performance of the South African Rand against the US Dollar, two successive 3USc lb benchmark increases were negotiated for delivery of material in the third and fourth quarters of the year.

The strength of the South African Rand will place upward pressure on prices, and the on-going situation in Zimbabwe, which accounts for around 5.5% of global ferrochrome production, may impact on supply into the market.
Operations The growth in sales volumes, up 25% year-on-year, reected the stronger demand for ferrochrome in the market.
During the first and second quarters of the year, production capacity was contained in favour of inventory correction.
As a consequence, annual sales volumes exceeded annual production and inventories reduced to lower than average levels.
In response to demand, Xstrata Chrome began a measured process of capacity restarts from the second quarter onwards, bringing back four of its idle ferrochrome producing furnaces during the course of the year: two furnaces at the Wonderkop plant annual capacity 170,000 tonnes and two at the Rustenburg operation annual capacity 140,000 tonnes.
Two furnaces, with a total combined annual capacity of 120,000 tonnes remain shut, one of which is under contract to AngloPlatinum.
The mining operations responded to the improved smelter activities producing some 2.9 million tonnes run of mine chrome ore.
Operational costs were well controlled in both the mining and smelting divisions in 2002.
The rapidly rising cost of reductants in the third and fourth quarter did however impact negatively on cost performance.
Despite this, management succeeded in limiting cost increases to 7.5% in Rand terms, compared to 2001, against the backdrop of a 14% increase in the producer price index.
Average production costs in US Dollar terms were down 5.8% compared to 2001.
In addition to its impact on costs, successfully mitigated by managements efficiency programmes, the significant strengthening of the Rand during the last quarter of 2002 resulted in a negative translation impact on EBIT of US$16.6 million, due to Xstrata plc 29 alloys EBIT Variance: Chrome US$m EBIT 31.12.01 59.3 Sales price variance 21.6 Volume variance 11.8 Cost reductions in real terms 12.5 Ination impact on costs 20.6 Change in exchange rates 13.5 Other variances 2.9 Depreciation and amortisation 2.0 EBIT 31.12.02 55.8 foreign exchange losses arising from US Dollar denominated trade debtors.
EBIT before the impact of foreign exchange on net working capital increased US$20.4 million year-on-year.
Additional cost cutting initiatives in 2003 include a project to reduce the reliance on coke as a primary reductant source and the renegotiation of electricity supply agreements to provide the operations with a more exible tariff structure, thus reducing power costs.
Progress is also being made on the development of the Mega-Mine concept at the Kroondal mine, which will reduce xed cost structures in the mining division.
Health, Safety & Environment All the ferrochrome plants and the mining division have health and safety management systems in place that are based on the Occupational Health and Safety Management System standard OHSAS 18001.
All mines and plants are working towards attaining these specications.
The loss time injury frequency rate LTIFR for the business both employees and contract workers improved from 9.4 in 2001 to 9.1 in 2002.
The target for 2003 is to reduce this to below 5.0.
Notwithstanding this progress, two employees and two contract workers were fatally injured during 2002.
Full investigations were conducted and remedial measures put in place to prevent similar unfortunate incidents.
In addition, a comprehensive safety audit commenced in January 2003.
In respect of environmental management, all of Xstrata Alloys ferrochrome production plants are certied in terms of International Organisation for Standardisation ISO 14001.
The mining divisions strategic environmental target is to achieve certication as well.
The process is well under way, with an on-going programme throughout mining operations.
Key environmental issues being addressed by the mining division include the rehabilitation of old opencast workings, of rock dumps and of tailings dams, and continual improvement of water, noise and air quality management.
At the Rustenburg ferrochrome plant, approval was obtained from the relevant authorities for the construction and commissioning of a pelletising plant.
During a tri-annual South African Bureau of Standards SABS ISO 14001 audit, there were no findings recorded against the plant.
Successful modications to the bag lter plants resulted in increased availabilities of the plants: from 96.80% in 2000 to 99.25% in 2001 to 99.72% in 2002.
The Lydenburg plants environmental achievements include modications to the bag lter plants, which have resulted in improved efficiencies and availabilities, and the management of storm water, dust and noise as elements of their Environmental Management System.
The Wonderkop plant also had zero findings recorded during the second bi-annual SABS ISO 14001 audit.
Key environmental issues addressed as part of the environmental management system include air pollution, water, waste disposal and noise.
30 Xstrata plc Developments Capital expenditure for the year at US$7.3 million predominantly comprised expenditure on the continuing development of the Waterval West chrome mine at Rustenburg, which will come on stream in 2004.
Other capex programmes included the construction of a second ore pelletising line at the Wonderkop joint venture, and a partial simulation of the Lydenburg pre-reduction technology at the Rustenburg works, both of which will improve efficiencies and reduce costs.
The furnace lease agreement with AngloPlatinum, which was due to expire at the end of 2002, has been extended until the end of April 2003.
Thereafter, the furnace will be reconverted at no cost to Xstrata, in order to be available for ferrochrome production.
Capital expenditure in 2003 is likely to be around US$30 million.
Projects for the year include the scheduled refurbishment of four furnaces, which, in the light of the expected strength in ferrochrome demand, has been planned to ensure that utilisation of Xstrata's operating capacity exceeds 90% for the year.
Xstrata plc 31 alloys EBIT Variance: Vanadium US$m EBIT 31.12.01 pre-exceptionals 3.1 Sales price variance 0.5 Volume variance 3.1 Cost reductions in real terms 2.5 Ination impact on costs 6.1 Change in exchange rates 3.0 Other variances 1.0 Depreciation and amortisation 3.0 EBIT 31.12.02 pre-exceptionals 7.1 Vanadium Markets The December 2002 results published by the International Iron & Steel Institute IISI indicate that global crude steel production which accounts for some 87% of vanadium use has grown by 6.4% year-on-year.
Together with the continued growth in the proportion of vanadium used in steel production, this led to a marked increase in demand for vanadium products.
However, the vanadium market remained in a situation of chronic oversupply for most of the year, which kept market prices for vanadium pentoxide V2O5 and ferrovanadium FeV at historically low levels throughout most of the period.
Market sentiment improved at the end of the year, with a corresponding increase in prices, due to a number of factors.
In the short-term these included a significant decrease in Russian production, which even ceased completely for short periods, due to legal disputes between producers and raw material suppliers, and the strengthening of prices in the United States, in expectation of the imposition of anti-dumping duties on FeV produced in South Africa and China.
Other factors supporting prices throughout the year included the on-going reduction in the quantity of V2O5 being offered in the spot market, as new integrated FeV producers came on stream, and the continued low-level of Chinese exports, due to the growth in domestic demand and ongoing quality and environmentally driven reductions of capacity.
Driven by these factors, and the strengthening South African Rand at the end of the year, prices at end of 2002 were up on 2001s year-end price by 42% for V2O5 US$1.60 lb versus US$1.12 lb and 61% for FeV US$10.15 kg versus US$6.30 kg.
The return of the Russian vanadium units would have led to an unavoidable return to chronic oversupply and a significant fall in prices.
While the suspension of operations at Windimurra, which produced some 12 million pounds of V2O5 in 2002, will constrain supply and provide some upward pressure on prices in 2003, price increases will depend on other producers closing the large number of uneconomic production units still in the market.
Operations Ferrovanadium sales volumes were 61% higher and V2O5 sales 13% lower in 2002 than 2001.
This reects Xstratas on-going strategy to switch output to the higher value FeV product, and follows the commissioning of new FeV production facilities at Rhovan during the second half of 2001.
To accommodate increased sales volumes, 2002 FeV production, at 6.5 million kilograms, was some 6% higher than 2001 6.1 million kilograms.
V2O5 production increased to 41.3 million pounds in 2002, 6% higher than 2001s total of 38.9 million pounds.

However, better sales results were achieved as 2002 progressed, and contracts signed to date should ensure that the chemical plant will be running at full capacity approximately 1.6 million pounds during 2003.
Production increased by 118% from 214,000 pounds in 2001 to 466,000 pounds in 2002.
Unlike much of the industry, Xstratas South African vanadium operations have remained profitable, notwithstanding significant increases in raw material input prices, as a result of on-going efficiency programmes, which reduced the average unit cost of V2O5 production in US Dollar terms by over 7% period on period.
