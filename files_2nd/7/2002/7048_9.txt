Additionally, the opportunity for The measures taken at the start of the year, in consolidation in the industry is particular in aggregates, to mitigate potential volume excellent and this supports our declines, along with a good performance in the other businesses, were the drivers behind the divisions continued focus on this market.
These measures included modifying work schedules and reducing stock levels, overtime and maintenance programmes.
HBMA ended the year with trading profit before goodwill of 291.3m down 12.7% on sales of 1,824.2m down 6.2% reecting a drop in US construction activity and a weakening dollar.
Excluding the effects of exchange, trading profit was down 9%.
The softening markets experienced in the second quarter of the year carried through to the second half, and with poor weather in November and December US aggregate volumes bn tons also hampering progress, aggregates volumes fell 11.5% over the year.
Heritage pipe and products 3.0 shipments and volumes for ready-mixed concrete were off by 5.7% and 4.6% respectively.
Brick 2.5 shipments were down 1.8%, but the roof tile business edged ahead 1.3% to complete a record year.
2.0 Acquisitions, which were principally in the pipe and products division, added 11.8m in profit, but earnings 1.5 from heritage operations were down by 54.1m.

The depletion of our highly profitable Radum quarry in California 9.5m and the adverse impact of exchange 13.6m also had a major impact.
In 2002, volumes for the US aggregates industry declined for the first time since 1991, when ISTEA the landmark federal funding legislation took effect.
This decline was not unexpected given the cyclical nature of the construction materials business.
Nonetheless, demand for heavy building materials over the long term is expected to continue to grow, reecting favourable underlying demographic trends and the growth in the overall economy.
Against that backdrop HBMA is well positioned, with a broad geographic base and considerable reserves to build on.
We are confident that the dynamics of the industry 16 Review of operations Hanson Building Materials America will lead to continuing consolidation opportunities US population forecast millions and, as a result, increasing returns.
350 Aggregates 330 Overall earnings for the division were down 21% 310 at 150.9m as volumes fell 11.5% to 133.8m tons, but margins were supported by limiting our spending 290 early in the year in response to the anticipated 270 fall in demand.

Against this background, prices inevitably came under pressure in the second half, although the headline gure for the year showed an excellent 3% increase.
We expected the depletion of our Radum quarry in California to present a formidable hurdle to overcome.
Recognising that new land-based reserves are very difficult to secure, we have established water borne HBMA supplies through a combination of local dredging 12 months to December 31, 2002 and importing from British Columbia in Canada.

Overall, shipments improved by 2.6% but prices fell, reecting weaker demand as commercial development plummeted.
Recovery in 2003 will be difficult, particularly with the challenges facing the technology sector which had previously fuelled economic growth in the region.
Pipe and products Pipe and products saw profit slip 2.6% to 100.8m, including acquisitions, reecting a decline in heritage volumes and the adverse effects of the exchange rate.
Regionally, the performance was mixed, with generally stronger results in our principal markets in Texas and Arizona.
The Eastern and South Eastern markets, in particular, suffered from lower demand and the mid-West was highly competitive.
As a result, and with poor weather in the second half of the year also playing a part, heritage volumes were down 5.7%, but prices moved ahead 2.7%.
Pressure pipe slipped back from a record year in 2001, due mainly to lower volumes and the delay of a major project in Dallas, but good progress was made with prices across most of the regions.
The acquisitions of Centennial in Canada and Choctaw in the South Eastern USA also made an important contribution, pushing overall volumes up by 12.7%.
Overall, our order book remains relatively healthy and we expect pressure pipe to recover lost ground, aided by an expansion in production capacity which will be operational from mid-2003.

Source: US Census Bureau Demand in Canada and Texas remained strong but conditions in the Carolinas were difficult.
Forecasts suggest that the housing market will slow in 2003 from the very high levels seen in 2002.
However, the brick and tile division should have another good year as benets from the recent reorganisation and significant capital investment are realised.
Outlook Looking ahead, we expect volumes in most markets to be slightly lower in 2003.
It was encouraging to see some stability in the fourth quarter in our important Eastern USA and California markets, but demand in Texas dipped late in the year across all products, and the indications are that this important market will remain challenging throughout the year.

There were also significant year-on-year improvements in the newly-formed building products division and in Spain and Israel.

UK aggregates A major reorganisation of the UK aggregates business was completed in 2002.
This has been a significant development for the business with the establishment of a national administration centre serving seven geographical areas.
Reorganisation costs were incurred in 2002 and the benets, in particular improved customer service, will be realised in 2003.
Aggregates volumes remain a key driver to the divisions underlying results.
The encouraging start to the year was followed by an unexpected slowdown inuenced, to some extent, by the introduction of the aggregates levy in April.

Price increases of 4.4% for aggregates and 6% for ready-mixed concrete were achieved, resulting in a direct profit increase as improved cost performance enabled us to absorb HBME the effects of ination.

There was continued buoyant demand in all our major markets, particularly Barcelona and Madrid.
The aggregates business was expanded with the acquisition of two adjoining limestone quarries near Madrid and a pair of neighbouring sand and gravel operations near Valladolid.
Our other Continental European operations increased profit by 3.8m.
Israel continued to make steady progress in a difficult economic and political environment, while there was an improvement in Germany resulting from the ongoing disposal of a number of loss-making concrete operations.
The Czech Republic benefited from heritage gains and the acquisition of two quarries in May.
Outlook The outlook for HBME is heavily inuenced by the UK.
Despite some weakness in the final quarter of 2002, we expect general market conditions to stay broadly at current levels for 2003.
The continuing stability anticipated in the housing market and growth, albeit at low levels, in the private sector should benefit our UK bricks and aggregates businesses.
In addition, our aggregates business in particular will benefit from new major infrastructure projects.
Internally, benets from the newly reorganised operations will continue to materialise.

the nine months to December 31, 2002 following the initial price increase on April 1. profit increased by 20.4m to 34.9m and heritage margins were up by 4.1% a welcome recovery from 2001 and a good basis for further improvement in 2003.
The prime driver for the improvement in performance was the strength of the Sydney metropolitan market, triggered by growing infrastructure, residential and commercial work, and a strong second half in the Western region, where volumes were also ahead.
In the Southern region, aggregates and concrete volumes moved forward in Melbourne and there Hanson Australia were strengthening sales in most country markets 12 months to December 31, 2002 as infrastructure spending picked up in these areas.

The substantial Sydney market looks positive, with the promise of large volumes from the cross-city tunnel and Western orbital highway towards the end of the year.
Overall, we remain committed to building on the success of 2002 and achieving acceptable returns for the division through continuing strong demand coupled with further improvement in selling prices and cost control.

The downturn in construction activity in Hong Kong, our largest operation, was the principal reason behind this performance.
Other key markets of Malaysia and Singapore remained at the depressed levels experienced in 2001.
The one notable exception to the trend was in Thailand, where a good year-on-year improvement was driven by a strong performance from the concrete operations.
