coal commissioning a geohydrological investigation and assessment for the Tweefontein Division.
Upon completion, this will be combined with the results of a similar study on the contiguous iMpunzi Division and used to develop a long-term water management plan through to post-closure of the operations: commencing a rehabilitation programme for disused reject dumps inherited by XCSA: and the successful identication of key environmental performance indicators and the development of a system of data analysis for management purposes.
Developments Australia Some US$45 million of 2002s US$72 million capital expenditure related to two major projects: the introduction of longwall mining at United and the establishment of the Beltana Mine.
The remaining US$27 million included a range of smaller growth projects and other projects involving the replacement of equipment to sustain operations.
The introduction of longwall mining at United, which commenced in June 2002, is on track for successful completion on time and within budget early in 2003, with US$34 million of the projects total capital cost of US$37 million expended in 2002.
The transformation of United, which also involved the construction of a coal handling preparation plant to process the additional coal produced, will increase production of high quality semi-soft coal by 1.4 million tonnes, while reducing operating unit costs by some 20%.
Development of Beltana underground mine at the Bulga Complex continued on schedule and within budget, with US$11 million of the total project cost of US$28 million incurred during 2002.
The longwall is expected to produce first coal in mid- 2003, following completion of mining at South Bulga underground in the first half of the year.
Beltanas highly competitive cost structure, which is expected to be amongst the lowest in Australia, will further increase XCAs productivity, and reduce the average unit cost of the business.
Other sustaining capital expenditure included US$5 million in equipment replacement at Bulga Opencast, US$3 million to construct the Ulan water management scheme and US$4 million on coal clearance capacity and the longwall upgrade at West Wallsend.
A further US$14 million was spent on a number of other sustaining capital requirements such as advancing face, minor equipment replacement, land purchases, exploration and other miscellaneous items across all of the mining sites, with individual items costing less than US$1 million each.
Capital expenditure for 2003 is expected to be similar to that of 2002.
Work will continue on the Beltana Mine in the first half of the year, while at Ulan the installation of a water management scheme will be completed and a new drift conveyor to 44 Xstrata plc reduce costs assessed.
Work continues on the Glendell and Bulga long-term projects.
On-going equipment replacements, land purchases for future mining activities and water management projects will also form a large part of the capital requirements for 2003.
Following the year-end, XCA announced the successful acquisition of 11.5% of Oakbridge from Tomen Corporation for US$58 million.
The transaction, which was effective 1 January 2003, increases XCAs shareholding in Oakbridge from 66.5% to 78%, and its attributable coal sales capacity by some 1.1 million tonnes.
South Africa The US$47 million of capital expenditure at XCSAs operations in 2002 was allocated to a number of projects across the business, the most significant of which was the US$4.1 million payment for the Zaaiwater property, which added a further 15.5 million tonnes of saleable reserves to the Boschmans and Goedgevonden operations.
In addition, US$1.7 million was spent at Boschmans Colliery replacing an expensive cut, drill and blast section with a new continuous miner section in order to increase secondary mining and maximise reserve utilisation.
US$2.6 million was spent on infrastructure and equipment at Douglas Tavistock JVs Boschmanskrans project, with a further US$1.6 million directed to Tavistock Colliery for the second phase of the processing plant upgrade.
US$0.9 million represents Xstratas share of the costs associated with re-engineering the conveyor systems and services infrastructure at Arthur Taylor Colliery Joint venture operation with TESA, which has already delivered a 40% increase in productivity between Q1 and Q4, 2002.
In addition, a further US$0.7 million was spent on the initial work associated with the two-year relocation of Arthur Taylor Opencast Mine to the new North Pit.
Finally, US$0.7 million was allocated to the 50% expansion of WitCons Colliery, a US$4.4 million project which includes a third production section, to allow for secondary extraction, and the upgrade of the main conveying system and processing plant.
Planned capital expenditure in 2003, which is expected to increase to around US$75 million, will target strategic projects such as the Phase V expansion of the Richards Bay Coal Terminal capacity from 72 to 82 million tonnes per annum approximately US$16 million to be spent over a two-year period : the initial development of the mini-pit contractor operation at Goedgevonden Colliery estimated capex of US$2.5 million in 2003 : and the US$4.2 million relocation of ATCOMs mining operations to the North Pit.
Remaining capital expenditure will be directed towards planned expansions at certain operations, such as Witcons and Tavistock, with the balance directed to sustaining the output of other XCSA operations.
Xstrata plc 45 zinc Markets Following a number of both temporary and permanent zinc mine closures, a consequence of the extremely low prevailing zinc price, world zinc mine output fell 2% to 8.7 million tonnes of contained zinc in 2002.
Similar cutbacks in smelter production, mainly in the USA, Peru, Europe, Japan and China, were offset by increased production from Canada, Spain and South Korea, which resulted in a net increase in zinc output of 2.0% to 9.4 million tonnes in 2002.
The consequent concentrate supply deficit contributed to an 11% fall in contract treatment charges, from an average of US$189 t in 2001 to US$169 tonne in 2002.
Spot market treatment charges fell even further, to lows of around US$130 tonne, due to increased demand for imported concentrates in China.
The main consuming sectors for zinc are construction and automobiles, which together account for approximately 70% of zinc consumption worldwide and which are highly correlated to the level of economic activity and particularly to industrial production.
Recovery of economic activity in the main industrialised countries, and therefore demand for metals, has been weaker than expected.
World usage of rened zinc rose by 2.5% to 9.0 million tonnes.
In Asia, further strong growth in China, together with increased zinc consumption in South Korea and other South East Asian countries, resulted in overall growth for the region of over 4% in 2002.
Growth in Europe was more modest at 1.0%.
Reecting the zinc metal supply surplus of the market, zinc stocks at LME warehouses increased by 218,000 tonnes during the year, and prices remained at historically low levels.
The average LME zinc settlement price was 12% lower at US$779 tonne in 2002 compared to an average of US$886 tonne in 2001.

The smelter has run at full capacity since commissioning and production of zinc metal increased from 390,792 tonnes in 2001 to 460,015 tonnes in 2002.
In addition, total process loss at San Juan has been reduced from 4.4% in 2001 to 3.7% in 2002, due to the positive impact of new technology used in the expansion and as a consequence of the plants on-going modernisation, process research and productivity programmes.
Total sales in 2002, of 448,321 tonnes, increased 71,714 tonnes 19%, against 2001.
In addition, sales into the higherpremium domestic market increased some 7% year-on-year.
Product mix also improved in 2002, with sales of value added products up by 35% in export market and by 5% in the domestic market.
The domestic sales net premium rose by 2%, while the export sales net premium decreased by 21%, as the major portion of the production increase was exported as ingot.
During 2002 Xstrata Zinc also produced 693,749 tonnes of sulphuric acid, 7,808kg of germanium as GeO2, 14,614 tonnes of zinc oxide Arnao plant and 25,427 tonnes of liquid Sulphur Dioxide Hinojedo plant.
The expansion contributed to the on-going cost cutting performance of Xstrata Zinc, and consolidated San Juans position as the worlds largest and lowest-cost zinc smelter.
Unit costs throughout the plants have also reduced as a result of the recent implementation of a sustainable cost reduction programme across the business, which has focused on improving the utilisation and reducing the costs of industrial consumptions, sourcing alternative suppliers and materials, and on-going optimisation of metallurgical processes.
The benets of higher production and lower unit costs mitigated the negative impact of the collapse of the zinc price and the depreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro at the EBIT level.
The breakdown of a transformer in the tankhouse and lower production of sulphuric acid and germanium had a negative impact on EBIT.

Notwithstanding the reducing production prole of the mine, in advance of its anticipated closure in July 2003, production exceeded budgeted levels, particularly lead concentrate production, which was higher in 2002 than 2001.
As a consequence of the business-wide cost reduction programme, the Reocn mines unit costs in Euros per tonne was 6% lower than budgeted and 4.5% lower than 2001.
Health, Safety & Environment The on-going success of the health and safety programmes across Xstrata Zinc is reected in the reduction in its lost time injury frequency rate LTIFR.
At the metallurgical plants this has decreased progressively from 94.5 in 1995 to 53.2 in 2002.
This trend reversed in 2001, when the LTIFR moved from 51.5 2000 to 61.6 2001, as a result of the incorporation of a significant number of new workers and additional departments as part of the expansion at San Juan.
The improvement back to an LTIFR of 53.2 in 2002 compares with the average national industrial LTIFR rate for Spain of 63 2001, the most recent data available.
At Reocn, the 2002 LTIFR 61.7, represents a 58% reduction against 2001s performance, and a 45% reduction from the average of the last eight years.
The central thrust of health and safety activities in 2002 centred on the relaunch of an updated safety and occupational health plan, following the conclusion of the expansion project and the start-up of new installations.
The principal objective for 2003 is a 20% reduction in the accident rate.
The major focus centres on reducing incidents in two specic departments at San Juan that together account for 46% of the total accident rate.
The major achievements in respect of environmental management in 2002 include approval by the environmental authorities of the Environmental Impact Assessment for the future oleum plant, the successful adoption and approval of the 48 Xstrata plc
