The incremental impact of 2001 and 2002 acquisitions was not material.
Like for like, profits rose by 2% principally reflecting the beginnings of solid recovery at Indalex through volume improvement and a reduced cost base and second half growth in IBS helping to offset reductions in SPS.
These results are after a 6m increase in pension charges for the year under SSAP 24.
Total pension costs charged in the year for both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, amounted to 13m 2001: 7m, of which 4m 2001: nil related to UK defined benefit schemes.
Total cash contributions for all schemes in the year were 9m 2001: 8m.
Under FRS17 the Group deficit on all defined benefit plans at the balance sheet date was 188m 2001: 33m after set off of deferred taxation.
This deficit is primarily due to the decrease in asset values over 2002 and has no immediate impact on the funding requirements of the Group schemes, which will be determined for UK schemes at the next triennial valuation at March 2003 and for other schemes at their annual valuation.
We anticipate these valuations will increase charges under SSAP24 by potentially as much as 18m and that further funding contributions will be likely from the second half of 2003.
The Group does not currently intend to adopt FRS17 ahead of mandatory implementation.

Net trading cash flow from continuing operations before cash restructuring costs of 24.5m 2001: 26.9m was 102m 2001: 118m, representing a cash conversion of 87%.
Net debt reduced by 54m over 2001 to 219m.
Interest costs were covered by Operating Profits 10.4 times, net debt to EBITDA was 1.4 times and Group gearing was 46%.
