options within the securities including prepayment options and periodic or absolute caps.
Prepayment risk arises from uncertainty about the rate at which early repayment will take place on the underlying mortgages on which these securitised assets are based.
The rate of prepayment is partly related to underlying demographic and economic conditions for example, the income level of mortgage holders and partly to current market interest rates.
These risks are modelled using scenario analysis and option cover is arranged as appropriate.
Specific limits have been developed for prepayments along with the range of other risks: these risks are included within the set of limits comprising the Treasury Mandate the framework for managing Wholesale Bankings market risks as described more fully under Risk management included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

2 Included within US treasury and other US government agencies and corporations and Other issuers are a number of asset-backed securities.
These securities are classified in the table according to their contractual maturity dates: however, redemption of these securities is expected on average to take place between 3 and 9 years from date of issue.
As with the underlying assets, asset-backed securities involve prepayment risks: however, the Groups exposure to this type of risk is significantly reduced due to the high proportion of floating rate assets in this category.
A further explanation of the Groups risk management and hedging strategy is set out under Risk management included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Specific provision a specific provision is established for all impaired loans after a specified period of repayment default where it is likely that some of the capital will not be repaid or recovered through enforcement of any applicable security.
The length of the default period depends on the nature of the advance and is generally no more than three months.
Once a loan is considered to be impaired an assessment of the likelihood of collecting the principal of these loans is made.
This assessment is made using statistical techniques developed based on previous experience and on management judgment of economic conditions.
These techniques estimate the propensity of loans to result in losses net of any recovery where applicable.
For advances secured on residential property the propensity of loans to become repossessed is also calculated.
General provision a general provision is established to cover losses which are from experience known to exist at the balance sheet date but which have not yet been identified as impaired.

This is partly offset by the continued focus on credit quality across the businesses and further falls in arrears levels.
Provisions on UK advances secured on residential properties have decreased as the benefit of a reduction in arrears and fall in properties in possession.
This has been partly offset by asset growth and an increase in the level of general provisions.
Provisions on other UK secured advances have slightly decreased due to a reduction in the retail finance loan asset.
Growth in customer lending balances resulted in the provision charge relating to UK unsecured personal advances increasing, although experiencing a further improvement in the arrears, as a result of continued improvements to enhance front end underwriting and the middle office operational controls.
This is further offset due to a combination of improvements in new lending criteria, and the sale of assets previously written off.
Non-UK provisions have remained relatively constant compared to prior year.

Interest rate sensitivity Interest rate sensitivity refers to the relationship between interest rates and net interest income resulting from the periodic repricing of assets and liabilities.
The largest single administered rate items in the Abbey National Group balance sheet are residential mortgages and retail deposits, the majority of which bear interest at variable rates.
The contractual maturity of mortgage loans is generally more than five years but the maturity of the majority of retail deposits are primarily within three months.
This apparent mismatch gives rise to issues which are addressed by the Group in its liquidity management.
However, their effect on interest rate management is less significant.
Abbey National has the ability to reprice both its retail variable rate liabilities and variable rate mortgage assets, subject to the constraints imposed by the competitive situation in the market place.
Management believes this ability enables Abbey National to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on net interest income in UK Retail Banking.
Abbey National also offers fixed rate mortgages and savings products on which the interest rate paid by or to the customer is fixed for an agreed period of time at the start of the contract.
Abbey National manages the margin on fixed rate products by the use of derivatives matching the fixed rate maturity profiles.
The risk of prepayment is reduced by imposing penalty charges if the customers terminate their contracts early.
Wherever possible, the Group seeks to minimise the risks associated with movements in market prices such as interest rates or exchange rates.
However, given the nature of financial activities, a level of market risk is inevitable.
Abbey National has developed and implemented structures and systems to manage this market risk exposure.

Volume and rate variances have been calculated on the movement in the average balances and the change in the interest rates on average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities.
The variance caused by changes in both volume and rate has been allocated to rate changes.
