alloys Xstratas vanadium operations continued to benefit from an off-take agreement with Glencore International AG, which provided a guaranteed minimum price of US$3.80 per pound for 7 million pounds of V2O5 produced during 2002.
This agreement concluded at the end of 2002, and revenues in 2003 will be based purely on market prices.
The profitability of Xstratas Australian operation, Windimurra, is strongly affected by two factors: the United States Dollar Australian Dollar exchange rate and the price of V2O5.
Notwithstanding an impressive year-on-year cost reduction of some 39% in Australian Dollar terms 30% in US Dollar terms, Windimurra was not profitable in 2002, impacting EBIT negatively by some US$6.2 million.
The outlook for the plant remains poor due to the growing strength of the Australian Dollar and the on-going weakness in the vanadium price, which remains depressed by the structural oversupply within the industry.
Given these factors, and Xstratas commitment to respond rationally to supply-side excess in its markets, the decision has been taken to stop production and suspend operations at the Windimurra plant as soon as possible, and to assess options, which include permanent closure.
At the time of Xstrata plcs IPO and listing, an impairment provision was recorded which reduced the carrying value of Windimurra on Xstratas books to US$28.6 million.
The Board of Xstrata has now decided to reduce the carrying value of Windimurra at 31 December 2002 to nil.
Health, Safety & Environment Both Rhovan and Vantech have implemented Codes of Practice as prescribed by the Mining Health and Safety Act, 1996 Act 29 of 1996.
There were no fatalities during the year.
The LTIFR for Xstrata Vanadium in 2002 was slightly higher, at 17.8, than the 17.5 recorded in 2001.
Rhovans safety management system has been in place since 1996 and is based on the National Occupational Safety Association of South Africa NOSA.
The inquiry into health and safety at the Vantech operation, conducted by the South African Department of Minerals and Energy DME, was concluded during 2002.
The DMEs final report confirmed that: Vantech has complied fully with the Mine, Health and Safety Act and was not negligent: no person had ever died due to exposure to vanadium: exposure to vanadium can cause occupational asthma, which is a reversible condition: no non-employees were affected at all by the mines operations: and that Vantech was in full compliance with all permits held at the various government departments.
Following the investigation, Vantech has initiated additional measures in order to improve further the working conditions at the operation.
34 Xstrata plc During May 2002, Rhovan obtained certication in terms of ISO 14001.
Vantech initiated its programme of ISO 14001 certication in September 2002, with implementation of OHSAS 18001 scheduled for the fourth quarter 2003.
The key environmental issue for both Rhovan and Vantech is water management, and systems to monitor groundwater quality are in place at both plants.
At Vantech contaminated groundwater is abstracted into specially designed ponds for evaporation and re-use.
The project, which will be completed in July 2003, reduces the need for clean water at the plant.
During 2002, 44 000cbm of water was re-used.
Both plants have conducted ambient air dispersion modelling of emissions from the plants to determine the effects on the environment and surrounding communities.
Developments The major portion of 2002s US$1.1 million capital expenditure related to exploration drilling to rm up the geological data available for the Rhovan ore reserve.
The balance concerned smaller projects to update equipment and improve efficiencies.
Capital expenditure for 2003, estimated at around US$6 million, is earmarked for the V2O5 FeV furnace project at Rhovan.
In 2002, the US Department of Commerce and International Trade Committee both issued final rulings, effectively levying an antidumping duty on ferrovanadium sales into the United States of 116% on Xstrata and Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited products.
However, it is not anticipated that the ruling will have any material impact on earnings.
Xstrata is also in advanced stages of discussion with manufacturers and or suppliers of vanadium bearing batteries for the supply of their raw material requirements.
Studies by the vanadium bearing battery developers suggest potential for a strong growth market for vanadium within the next two years.
Given its potential impact on the heavily oversupplied vanadium market, Xstrata Alloys continues to pursue opportunities in this area.
Xstrata plc 35 coal Markets European and Domestic South African Markets The spot market for thermal coal in the Atlantic basin was characterised by a high degree of volatility in 2002, with prices starting the year at a high of US$29.5 tonne FOB, pulling back to a low of US$20.5 tonne in August and then recovering sharply to around US$27.0 tonne in the final quarter of the year.
First half year volumes suffered from weakening demand, particularly in the second quarter, due to the cumulative impact of a mild European winter, lower gas prices in the United Kingdom, increased competition from Russian, Indonesian and Australian imports into Europe, and higher than average hydro-generation, all of which contributed to create an oversupplied market, resulting in depressed spot prices.
The second half of the year saw a resurgence in sales volumes on the back of reduced competition from Russia, Indonesia and Australia linked to the lower, more competitive FOB prices out of South Africa and high ocean freight rates from Australia to Europe, a lack of hydro reserves particularly in the Iberian peninsula and re-stocking by generators prior to the onset of the European winter.
The increase in demand, together with the impact of production cuts estimated at 7.5 million tonnes, in South Africa, Colombia and Russia in the face of falling prices and oversupply, facilitated a rapid recovery in prices at the end of the third quarter.
The absence of Asian supply into the European market, as a result of signicantly higher freight rates, and the tight availability of supply from South Africa and Colombia continue to provide support for prices in the first quarter of 2003.
Xstrata Coal South Africa XCSA exported 12.5 million tonnes through Richards Bay Coal Terminal RBCT in 2002, some 200,000 tonnes less than export volumes in 2001.
Average annual prices received for RBCT exports fell some 19%, from US$30.3 tonne in 2001 to US$24.6 tonne for the 2002 year, before recovering to US$27.86 tonne at the end of December 2002.
As a result of the dramatic increase in demand in the last quarter, RBCT ended the year with historically low stock levels of some 2.1 million tonnes, or approximately 11 days shipping.

The 2002 Eskom price, of ZAR53.4 tonne ex-mine, also improved by 12% year-on-year, as a result of the ination linked price formula and premiums received for tonnage and quality, which were delivered above the base contract parameters.
The 2002 average ex-mine domestic prices of ZAR127.40 tonne increased by 10.3% year-on-year, reecting XCSAs strategy to optimise domestic prices whilst maximising export sales volumes.
Far East and Australian Markets Demand for seaborne thermal coal in the Pacic region increased by approximately 8% compared to the previous year, although the market was characterised by a short-term period of oversupply in the middle of the year.
This was largely a result of additional capacity from Australia and Indonesia, as well as sluggish economic growth in most of the major Asian markets, with the notable exception of China.
Over the year, spot thermal coal prices uctuated between a high of US$28.9 tonne in February to a low of US$22.0 tonne in August.
During the fourth quarter spot prices in the Pacic market began to recover and, by the end of the year, were around US$25.0 tonne.
The improvement in spot prices was due in part to problems at a number of Japans nuclear power plants and, as a consequence, power utilities were required to maximise output at their coal-red power generating plants.
38 Xstrata plc Furthermore, the predicted increases in Chinese coal exports failed to materialise for reasons of domestic priority, which resulted in domestic prices exceeding those available in the export market.
Chinas strong domestic market also led to a significant increase in coal imports over the course of the year.
Asia remains the predominant market for sales from Xstrata Coal Australias XCA operations, with 2002 sales to the region representing approximately 70% of total sales.
For the 12 months commencing April 2002, the Japanese Reference Price for Australian thermal coal contracts to Chubu Electric declined by 7.7% from the previous year to US$31.85 tonne largely as a result of increasing supply from Australia and Indonesia.
This price reduction followed a 20% increase realised during the previous year.
Semi soft coking coal prices into the Asian steel mills also declined by between 7% and 9%, and contract volumes to the region were lower, largely as a result of increased competition from Chinese producers.
Sales to new customers in Brazil and Europe partially offset the fall in sales to Asia.
In 2002, approximately 75% of all sales from XCAs mines were sold under term annual contracts, with the balance being sold on the spot market.
Indications are that this percentage will reduce in 2003, as a number of major customers in the region, particularly in Korea, move to increase purchases from the spot market.
The Australian domestic market remains a strong focus for XCA mines, with around 18% of production currently being sold to local power utilities up from 13% last year.
Approximately 85% of XCA sales into the domestic market are under longterm contracts, with 2002s average price received, of AUD31.6 tonne some 17% down on 2001s average domestic price of AUD38.3 tonne.
The reduction is due to the changed contract mix, following the acquisition of Ravensworth and Narama in March 2002.
The projected growth in coal demand by power stations in New South Wales will lead to a number of new, long-term opportunities for XCA mines.
Xstrata plc 39 coal Pro forma EBIT Variance: Coal US$m EBIT 31.12.01 311.5 Sales price variance 140.4 Volume variance 39.3 Cost reductions in real terms 37.3 Ination impact on costs 26.4 Change in exchange rates 20.9 Depreciation and amortisation 12.0 EBIT 31.12.02 230.2 Pro forma 12 months to 31.12.02 includes Coal acquisition from 01.01.02 Pro forma 12 months to 31.12.01 includes Coal acquisition from 01.01.01 While XCA continues to build a broader customer base for its thermal and semi soft coal products in non-traditional markets, with sales into India and Brazil supplemented by a recent 2.5 million tonne thermal coal contract into Mexico, the Far East Japan in particular remains the prime focus.
Our positive outlook for the Far East takes into account external factors, including the recently announced phased introduction of a coal tax by Japan.
Given coals enviable position as the cheapest fossil fuel for power generation, and the fact that existing taxes on competing fuels LNG and LPG will increase simultaneously with the introduction of the coal tax, we do not believe that this tax will have any material impact on Japanese thermal coal demand growth in the medium term.
Operations Australia Full year consolidated production of 27.6 million tonnes was 4.2 million tonnes, or 18% higher, than 2001.
The increase can be attributed to completion of the capacity expansion at the Mt Owen opencast mine 0.4 mt, purchase of the Ravensworth Narama operations in March 2002 2.5 mt, commencement of longwall mining at United in June 2002 1.1 mt, and increased production from the Ulan complex 0.4 mt.
With a capacity increase of over 40%, Mt Owen is now capable of producing in excess of 5 million tonnes per annum.
Increased production from the Ulan complex reects the higher productivity achieved since the current management took over in February 2001.
By the end of 2002, a productivity improvement of 25% and 15% was achieved at the opencast and underground mines respectively, due to the implementation of management initiatives and reduced manning levels.
On-going cost improvements, together with the acquisitions and increased productivities outlined above, achieved a reduction in unit operating costs by approximately 2% in US Dollar terms compared to the same period last year.
In local currency terms, unit operating costs reduced by 7% over the same period.
Year-on-year, EBIT was marginally lower at US$127.3 million, compared with US$132.2 million in 2001, due to lower prices, offset by increased sales volumes and reduced local currency operating costs.
The impact of a strengthening US$ AUD foreign exchange translation from US$0.517 to US$0.543 was fully offset by currency hedging, which enabled XCA to achieve an average conversion rate of US$0.516.
This alone offset the impact of lower prices by US$34 million.
In order to address possible oversupply in the market, and to cap further build-up of stock levels, some 400,000 tonnes of projected export production was cut in the June quarter.
These cutbacks were achieved, together with a further reduction in costs, by decreasing contractor numbers and overtime, increasing holiday closures and reducing staffing levels.
40 Xstrata plc In late 2002, significant changes were made to a number of operations in order to reduce costs further in 2003.
At Bulga Opencast a 9% reduction in costs is targeted for 2003, following the introduction of an optimised mine plan, a 33% reduction in employee numbers, and improved operating practices, all of which will result in significant productivity improvements.
At Liddell, re-contracting the operation is forecast to deliver a 3% reduction in costs.
Furthermore, a number of projects, planned for 2003, are expected to deliver improved productivity and unit cost savings, including: full year longwall mining at United, commencement of Beltana underground following depletion of South Bulgas reserves and a new mining contract at Liddell.
The planned cessation of underground mining at Cumnock in 2003 is not expected to curtail XCA production due to continuation of Cumnock opencast operations and growth from other XCA mines.
South Africa In the pro forma 2001 accounts, XCSAs ATC and ATCOM operations were accounted as joint ventures for 12 months, while Douglas Tavistock was accounted as an associate for 11 months.
From January 2002, these entities are reported as Joint Arrangement not an Entity JANE and are therefore proportionately consolidated.
Had they been reported as JANEs in 2001, turnover for the 2001 year would have been US$138.2 million higher.
On a like-for-like basis, therefore, XCSAs 2002 performance reected a weaker export coal market, with own production turnover down US$112.3 million as a result of reduced export volumes down 2% and reduced export prices, down US$5.7 per tonne 19% year-on-year.
Total coal sales were 16.8 million tonnes, 1% lower than 2001 levels.
The impact of the weaker market on earnings was partly mitigated by cost reductions, with the FOB average cash cost down 9% year-on-year.
This reected the ability of the business to keep cash cost increases in Rand terms well below the prevailing ination rate a 7.7% increase versus an increase in the South African producer price index of 14%, as well as an exchange rate benefit associated with the weaker Rand.
Total XCSA production during 2002 was 16.4 million tonnes, 8% lower than 2001, due to the closures of the Rietspruit Colliery, as a result of depleted reserves, and the high-cost Strathrae Colliery.
These closures of production capacity were partially offset by the re-commissioning of the low-cost South Witbank Colliery in late 2001.
Production was also impacted by the second-quarter decision to reduce output due to European market oversupply and the resultant increase in coal stocks.
This involved stopping operations for an extended period over Easter, deferring the restart of the Waterpan coal re-treatment plant and shutting down certain higher cost production sections at some of the mines.
Xstrata plc 41 coal The South Witbank mine, which was re-commissioned in late 2001 with new equipment including a beneficiation plant, underground mining equipment, coal conveying and, storage systems, has achieved the highest productivity and lowest production cost of all XCSAs operations averaging approximately US$6 per tonne on a free on rail basis.
During the period under review significant operating improvements were made at a number of operations.
The technologies and systems employed to achieve significant gains at South Witbank are being systematically implemented at other XCSA operations, such as Arthur Taylor Colliery, which achieved a 40% increase in underground section productivities between the first and fourth quarters of 2002.
The Witcons and Tavistock collieries are currently in the process of implementing these improved systems, which are also scheduled for implementation at Boschmans Colliery in 2003.
In addition, total employee numbers were reduced across the business by 695 13%, with only a marginal increase in the number of contractors employed.
This resulted in a 14% year-on-year increase in productivity run of mine tonnes per employee, including contractors.
EBIT fell by US$76.4 million 43%, from US$179.3 million in 2001 to US$102.9 million in 2002, due to lower sales volumes and prices, with the overall impact mitigated by the management initiatives outlined above.
Health, Safety & Environment Australia XCA demonstrated an improvement in health and safety key performance indicators year-on-year, reecting the on-going implementation and effectiveness of management controls.
During 2002, XCA recorded no fatalities.
The lost time injury frequency rate LTIFR fell by 15% from 27 in 2001 to 23 in 2002, and the total recordable injury frequency rate TRIFR fell by 33% from 93 to 62.
The fall in the LTIFR continued the positive trend established in 2001.
External audits of each operations safety management system were used to determine the level of compliance with the XCA Safety Management framework.
The average audit score increased by 5.7%, based on the scoring system applied by the external auditor, demonstrating continual and overall improvement.
During 2002, key health and safety activities and achievements included: endorsing and implementing a Safety Management framework aligned to the Australian Standard AS 4804 and consistent with Group Standards: progressing the successful establishment of each operations own safety management systems aligned to the XCA framework: implementing the standard for Energy Isolation across the group and auditing each operation for compliance: integrating the new Xstrata plc reporting requirements into XCAs reporting systems, and conducting the Xstrata plc Group risk review, which initiated three major audits and system improvements at XCA operations: and implementing a risk management approach to water management structures located across XCA sites.
During 2002, XCA achieved considerable progress in the area of environmental management.
XCA has a Group Environmental Management System EMS in place, based on the principles of ISO14001, and requires all of its sites to develop their own EMS, which must be consistent with that of the Group.
Audit results confirmed each sites progress and improvement in EMS implementation.
XCA is a signatory to the Australian Minerals Industry Code for Environmental Management and is required to complete annual Code Implementation Surveys CIS and undergo a three yearly audit.
The 2002 audit showed the majority of sites demonstrated improvement with the CIS, with some sites demonstrating substantial improvement i. e. 5% increase in 42 Xstrata plc scores.
The number of recorded incidents of environmental non-conformance reduced to three incidents, one of which occurred in 2000, prior to XCA acquiring the operation.
During 2002, key environmental activities and achievements included: endorsement of the Group EMS in October 2002: conducting environmental audits by external consultants for three sites, as part of a programme where every site is audited at least once every three years: producing XCAs inaugural Environmental Report, with work underway to extend the 2003 report to include XCSA: assessing numerous projects focused on the management and minimisation of greenhouse gas emissions.
XCA has an active greenhouse programme in place which involves recording data, independent and external auditing of data, assessing and analysing data and trends, and identifying objective targets: and commissioning a risk assessment on all dams to assess the potential for dam failures, with a preliminary assessment identifying 12 of the 192 dams as requiring further investigation regular monitoring to ensure ongoing performance.
South Africa XCSAs continued improvement in health and safety management during 2002 was marred by two fatalities in the last six weeks of the year.
Immediate responses included a three-day production halt at one of the relevant sites, for intensive safety coaching and the revision of certain specic safety systems.
Group wide audits were conducted thereafter to ensure compliance.
The 2003 health and safety programme has been structured to capture the learning points from these accidents and will include, inter alia, the development of fatal risk registers at each operation to serve as a guide to where safety efforts need to be maximised.
Despite these two tragic events, the overall rate of lost time accidents decreased from 5.7 in 2001 to 2.3 lost time accidents per million hours worked.
XCSA adapted the Xstrata Coal Environmental Management System EMS to its operations and has commenced implementation in January 2003.
An organisational structure for environmental management was developed and implemented, with a baseline for environmental management performance successfully established.
During 2002, key environmental activities and achievements included: adopting the XC Environmental Vision and Policy, and appointing a Group Environmental Manager: employing external consultants to conduct a performance assessment of both the EMPRs for current operations and closure cost assessments, the results of which will be used to implement action plans to address non-compliance or any potential under-funding: Xstrata plc 43
