24 GKN plc 2002 OPERATING REVIEW AEROSPACE: CONTINUING STRONG GROWTH FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT BUT CIVIL SECTOR DOWN MORE THAN 30% FROM 2001 PEAK.
Aerospace financial highlights Sales 2002 m By origin By market Aerospace sales of 1,502 million were level with 2001 but with Europe 1,126 977 different year-on-year performance in subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Subsidiary sales of 559 million were 71 million 11% lower as Americas 376 440 a consequence of the fall in demand for civil aircraft.
Joint venture Rest of the World 85 and associate sales mainly AgustaWestland were 943 million, an increase of 80 million 9% as production peaked on EH101 Total 1,502 1,502 and Apache.
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, after charging GKNs 11 million share of redundancy and reorganisation costs in AgustaWestland, was 118 million compared with 119 million in 2001.
The net impact from currency, acquisitions and divestments on sales and profit was not material.
On a reported basis, profits of subsidiaries of 23 million were 9 million 28% lower than 2001 with joint ventures and associates 8 million 9% higher at 95 million.
However, in addition to redundancy and reorganisation costs, currency and acquisitions, these comparisons are also affected by the treatment of one-off fees paid in 2001.
Adjusting for all these items, the subsidiaries profits of 23 million represented a 1 million 4% reduction while joint ventures and associates were level at 95 million.
Operating profit after goodwill amortisation and exceptional items was 91 million 2001 32 million.
Market background Expectations of a near-term recovery in the civil aerospace market have now been discounted by industry forecasters.
The decline in deliveries has been precipitate.
In 2001 Boeing and Airbus delivered a total of 850 aircraft.
The figure for 2002 was 684 aircraft and their forecast for 2003 is for 580 new aircraft deliveries.
This represents a 32% decline over two years and some forecasters expect further falls in 2004.
Current low levels of new civil aircraft build are therefore likely to continue for some time.

Work was initially focused on the 2001 resulted in more than 800 redundancies within the workforce, radical Sonic Cruiser concept but Boeing has since announced that mainly at Cowes on the Isle of Wight.
The rationalisation was mostly its focus is now on a more conventional aircraft but one which will completed in the first half of 2002.
The business is now operating still require a high content of advanced materials.
This is GKNs first at a size appropriate to current demand but the management task major involvement as a tier one supplier to Boeings commercial continues to be challenging.
GKN Aerospace Services has grown rapidly through acquisition AgustaWestland Sales 865 million 2001 784 million and outsourcing.
In 2002 it completed two small but significant AgustaWestland, a 50:50 joint venture between GKN and US transactions which brought new technology to the business.
