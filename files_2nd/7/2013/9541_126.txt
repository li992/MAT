The most significant increase was at the Middelkraal operations and is almost entirely due to the increase at Saffy shaft where the ore reserve position increased 108.7% from 2012 in line with plans to ramp up production at the shaft.
Westerns operations also delivered a significant year on year increase in ore reserves with a 36.6% increase at Rowland shaft.
The overall improvements are in line with Lonmins strategy of creating greater flexibility at these shafts.
The ore reserve position remained largely unchanged but healthy at the Karee operations and decreased as planned at the Easterns operations.
