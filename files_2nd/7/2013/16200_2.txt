58 Tullow Oil plc 2013 Annual Report and Accounts Directors Report 2 The field production was impacted during the second half of 2013 due to a number of unplanned shutdowns of the FPSOs water injection system.
The system is now fully operational and reservoir pressure and well capacity have been restored to over 130,000 bopd.
During 2013, the Ghana National Gas Company announced further delays to the start up of the onshore gas processing plant that is required to enable the export of Jubilee associated gas.
The gas plant is now expected to be fully operational in the second half of 2014.
As a consequence of this ongoing delay in gas export, the Jubilee partners have had to pursue various alternative gas handling options.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, a third gas injection well was drilled and brought online.
However, this well has had a limited impact.
Discussions are ongoing with the Government of Ghana on other alternatives, including limited flaring, that will enable the field to average 100,000 bopd gross in 2014.
TEN On 29 May 2013, the Government of Ghana formally approved the TEN PoD.
This paved the way for Tullow and its partners to proceed with the development.
The project is on target to deliver first oil in mid-2016 which will be followed by a steady ramp up to an expected FPSO gross production capacity of 80,000 bopd.
Development of the TEN Project will require the drilling and completion of up to 24 development wells which will be connected through subsea infrastructure to a FPSO vessel, moored in approximately 1,500 metres of water.
The overall cost of the development is estimated to be $4.9 billion, excluding FPSO lease costs.
All major contracts, including the FPSO and subsea infrastructure, have been awarded and the West Leo rig has been secured to carry out the drilling and completion of the development wells.
In October 2013, the Centennial Jewel trading tanker arrived in the Jurong Shipyard in Singapore, where it has begun its conversion into the TEN FPSO.

Gross capex spend for 2014 on the TEN Project is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion.
Exploration and Appraisal The Sapele-1 exploration well, which was completed in February 2013, was plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.
This completed our drill-out of the Deepwater Tano licence which expired on 18 May 2013 with the remaining, nonprospective acreage being relinquished.
The Jubilee Unit Area, the TEN Development and Production Area and the Wawa Discovery Area have been retained.

The partnership is planning some additional appraisal activities in 2014 in the West Cape Three Points licence that will assist in identifying the optimum development plan for the Mahogany, Teak and Akasa fields.
In January 2013, the discovery area associated with the Banda discovery on the West Cape Three Points licence was relinquished.
Mauritania In Mauritania, Tullow commenced its exploration drilling campaign in August 2013 targeting new, deeper plays in the offshore Mauritanian basin.
The first well, Frgate-1, in the Block 7 licence, was drilled to a depth of 5,426 metres and has encountered up to 30 metres of net gas-condensate and oil pay in multiple sands.
The data will now be integrated with Tullows regional 3D seismic surveys.
The well is being plugged and abandoned and the rig will move to drill the Tapendar prospect in Block C-10.

These initial discoveries were both successfully flow tested in February and July 2013 respectively.
Both wells flowed at constrained rates of around 3,000 bopd of 25 to 35 degree API sweet waxy oil with no indication of pressure depletion, and unconstrained rates of over 5,000 bopd per well are considered possible.
In May 2013, drilling commenced on the Etuko prospect, 14 km east of Twiga South-1 in Block 10BB.
The well successfully opened the Basin Flank Play in the eastern part of the South Lokichar Basin.
Ekales-1 commenced drilling in July 2013 and continued the successful run of discoveries on the Basin Bounding Fault Play, on trend with Ngamia and Twiga South.
The Ekales-1 well was followed by two further discoveries at Agete-1 in November 2013 and Amosing-1 in January 2014.
The seventh discovery in the basin to date also came in January 2014 at Ewoi-1 which continued to fide-risk the Basin Flank Play opened by Etuko-1 earlier in 2013.
Well testing at Etuko-1 has been completed and flowed at a combined rate of over 550 boepd.
Additional potential pay zones were unable to be tested due to the large hole size and so the rig is now drilling a 650 metre well, Etuko-2, to evaluate and potentially test this shallower interval.
Ongoing activities include the testing of the Ekales-1 well and the drilling of Emong-1 and Twiga South-2 exploration and appraisal wells.
A significant programme of some 40 exploration and appraisal wells in the coming two years will assess not only the South Lokichar Basin but up to a further six separate Tertiary Rift Basins across Tullows Kenyan acreage.
Tullow is currently operating three rigs, the PR Marriott 46, Weatherford 804 and Sakson PR5 rigs and a workover unit, the SMP-5.
Given the significant volumes discovered and the extensive exploration, appraisal and seismic programme planned to fully assess the upside potential of the South Lokichar Basin, Tullow and its partner have agreed with the Government of Kenya to commence development studies.
