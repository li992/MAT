24 EnQuest PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 2013: High operational uptimes and high OPERATING REVIEW production efficiency In 2013, EnQuest delivered nine wells with well workovers and OUR new production and water injection wells, growing production by 6.2% to 24,222 Boepd 2012: 22,802 Boepd : a performance underpinned by high operational uptimes, high production PERFORMANCE efficiency and strong reservoir performance.
This was achieved whilst ensuring that safe results, no harm to people and respect for the environment remained our top priorities.
In EnQuests first four years, revisions to reserve estimates have increased our net 2P reserves by 25.4 MMboe, reflecting the benefits of our infill drilling programme and our increased reservoir knowledge.
These upgrades to reserve estimates High production performance was are a direct result of EnQuests operational work programmes and an important source of value creation: in the four years underpinned by operational uptimes, since our inception, 9.6 MMboe has been produced by Thistle high production efficiency and strong and we have increased Thistles net 2P reserves by almost twice that level, by 19.0 MMboe.

These included a focus on maximising production through loss management programmes and improved standardised reporting methods.
New controls were also put in place to maximise our ability to avoid major accident hazards: a new major accident prevention model was developed, a new asset integrity review board was established, along with a new incident 25 STRATEGIC FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE REPORT STATEMENTS EnQuest PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013 review system.

The FPSO was moved to the Tyne for finishing and commissioning work.
By the end of 2013, subsea infrastructure was in place including subsea trees, manifolds, pipelines and umbilicals.
Risers and mooring systems were pre-installed, awaiting arrival of the FPSO.
