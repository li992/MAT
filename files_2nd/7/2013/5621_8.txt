We expect throughput from now to run at around 20 mmtpa, or 143 mmbbls peryear.
Vadinar is now a state-of-the-art refinery, accounting for around 10% of Indias total refining capacity.
It is well placed to capitalise on rising demand in India and internationally for the high value fuels it is capable of producing, particularly middle distillates gasoil and jet fuel where there is the greatest domestic and international growth in demand.
59% of Vadinars production consisted of middle distillate products during FY2013, against 43% in FY2012.
Of the middle distillates, around 80% was gasoil.
