As outlined at its Capital Markets Day in November 2013, the Group is targeting a net annual benefit of c. 30m by 2016 from its four key strategic initiatives to improve business performance, covering procurement, commercial vehicles, branch network and eCommerce.
SIG believes procurement has the most potential for savings and is targeting a 1.5% reduction in purchasing costs by 2016.

Phase one, which relates to the further optimisation of its existing UK network, is currently underway and due to conclude in H1 2014.
Phase two, which involves scoping more fundamental network change, is continuing and will be informed by the performance of the Groups new supersite in the North East of England.
