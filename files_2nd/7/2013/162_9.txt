Copper production of 4.9 million pounds for the year was 20% lower than the prior year 2012: 6.1 million pounds due to the reduced throughput and grade pro!le.
DEVELOPING OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY Cash cost per ounce sold for the year of US$890 was 11% higher than the prior year 2012: US$803 per ounce.
Cash costs were negatively impacted by lower production levels and the resultant lower co-product revenue.
This was partially offset by lower maintenance, consumable usage and labour costs and lower sales-related costs due to lower sales volumes and a lower realised gold price.
Cash costs per tonne milled for the year increased to US$200 US$187 in 2012 as a result of the lower throughput and costs outlined above.
AISC per ounce sold for the year of US$1,344 was 8% higher than the prior year 2012: US$1,245 per ounce.
This was driven by the higher cash cost base and increased capital expenditures per ounce as a result of reduced production, which more than offset the 28% reduction in sustaining capital expenditure.

Gold sold for the year amounted to 187,348 ounces, 21% above that of the prior year 2012: 155,322 ounces sold due to the increased production base and the sale of concentrate on hand from Q4 2012.
Copper production for the year of 7.1 million pounds was 5% higher than the prior year 2012: 6.7 million pounds, driven by the increased throughput, slightly offset by lower copper grades.
Cash cost per ounce sold for the year of US$945 was 11% lower than the prior year 2012: US$1,066 per ounce sold.
Cash costs were positively impacted by increased production levels and resultant co-product revenue, lower Geo-metallurgical analysis of the ore body at Buzwagi labour costs, due to a signi!cant reduction in the revealed that high concentrations of cyanide would be international workforce, and increased capitalised stripping required during the gold extraction process, especially costs in H1 2013.

Total capital expenditure for the year of US$82.5 million was positively impacted by a negative non-cash reclamation adjustment of US$9.2 million, due to the increase in risk-free interest rates combined with a reduction in closure costs estimates.

Head grade and mill recovery were positively impacted by an increase in ore tonnes mined and grade, predominantly driven by mining from the Gokona pit due to a change in the life of mine plan.
Gold ounces sold for the full year of 260,945 ounces were 2% higher than production due to the sale of ounces on hand from Q4 2012, and 40% higher than that of the prior year 2012: 186,600 ounces sold, due to the increased production base.
Cash cost per ounce sold for the year of US$659 was 31% lower than the prior year 2012: US$953 per ounce.
Cash costs were positively impacted by increased production levels and increased capitalised stripping costs.
This was partially offset by higher contracted services and A key focus of ABGs community awareness campaigns maintenance costs due to planned equipment and plant is to enhance awareness of the inherent dangers that maintenance.

The deferral of Cut 3 at commitments to stop illegal mining and to pursue Gokona in Q4 2013 led to a reduction in tonnes moved and alternative livelihoods.
To date, the co-operative has an associated reduction in capitalised development for the over 700 members and has of!ces in each of the fourth quarter.
Key capital expenditure for the year included seven local villages, with the objectives of increasing capitalised stripping costs US$65.6 million, investments in membership and initiatives.
