The decline in net 31 December 2012 and for the period until 5 December 2013. generation volumes was due to lower demand with a 2% decrease in electricity consumption in Kazakhstan compared to the prior Revenues year.
Competition from domestic power stations also impacted Electricity revenues attributable to Kazakhmys in 2013 were generation volumes, as local producers supplied electricity at 14% below the prior year partly because revenues in 2013 are relatively low tariffs to maintain their sales volumes.
The decline only included until 5 December 2013 whereas the prior year in Ekibastuz GRES-1s domestic sales volumes was partially offset revenues included 12 months.
by a 1,680 GWh increase in sales volumes exported to Russia.
Revenues generated by Ekibastuz GRES-1 in 2013 were also lower The net dependable capacity of Ekibastuz GRES-1 increased by due to the challenging domestic electricity market.
Sales volumes 321 MW in 2013 mainly due to the commissioning of Unit 8 in declined by 11%, driven by a reduction in domestic demand and the fourth quarter of 2012.
The optimisation and modernisation increased competition from local producers, resulting in domestic programme also continued at the power station and two ESPs sales falling by 24%.
To partially offset the decline in local demand, were installed during the year, thereby reducing emissions and Ekibastuz GRES-1 more than doubled the electricity volumes also raising the stations net dependable capacity.
com 35 Directors Report Operating Review continued The reduction in Ekibastuz GRES-1s electricity sales volumes was Expansionary partially offset by a 7% increase in the weighted average realised Ekibastuz GRES-1 has been undergoing a major expansion tariff.
The ceiling tariff applicable for domestic sales rose to programme to restore the power station to its nameplate capacity of 4,000 MW.
This programme continued during 2013 7.30 KZT kWh in 2013, a 12% increase from the ceiling tariff with work progressing on the rehabilitation of Unit 2.
During applicable for the majority of 2012 of 6.50 KZT kWh.
The tariffs the year, dismantling works on the turbine, auxiliary equipment for export sales to Russia were also higher than in the prior year and generator took place and some of the new equipment was with an increase in market prices in Russia, but remain below the received.
The rehabilitation of the unit remains on schedule to domestic tariff.
EBITDA excluding special items Ekibastuz GRES-1 is proceeding with the rehabilitation of the final Ekibastuz GRES-1s EBITDA attributable to Kazakhmys was 19% dormant unit, Unit 1.
The projects design documents have been below the prior year as the 2013 results only included operations developed and dismantling work continued during the year.
up to 5 December 2013 and the profitability of the power station The unit is planned to be operational in late 2016. declined with lower revenues and higher operating costs.
To improve the environmental footprint of the power station, Total cash operating costs at Ekibastuz GRES-1 rose by 10% in 2013 Ekibastuz GRES-1 has been installing ESPs to the plants generators as ination increased the costs of inputs used in power generation.
to reduce ash emissions to international benchmark standards.
Fixed costs also increased with the growth in the power stations Under this programme of work, ESPs were installed at Units 3 generation capacity as Unit 8 operated for a full year in 2013 after and 7 during the year.
All the operating units at Ekibastuz GRES-1 it was re-commissioned in the last quarter of 2012. now have ESPs installed, signicantly improving the environmental footprint of the power station.
Expenditure on coal, which comprises around 45% of Ekibastuz GRES-1s cash costs, was consistent with the prior year as prices Captive Power Stations charged by suppliers increased by around 10% which offset the $ million unless otherwise stated 2013 2012 reduced consumption due to the lower generation volumes.
Sales revenues 223 169 Employee costs rose with inationary pay awards made during 2013.
Electricity generation 192 154 Staff numbers also increased to cater for the growth in the power Heat and other 31 15 stations production capacity, with Unit 8 operational throughout 2013 and Unit 2 planned to commence in 2014.

The growth in the EBITDA excluding special items 48 19 average cash operating costs was partially due to lower sales volumes on a higher xed cost base and also reected the impact of ination, Capital expenditure sustaining 67 47 in particular on coal prices.
Revenues Capital expenditure Revenues from the sale of electricity and heat to Kazakhmys Mining Sustaining and to third parties by the captive power stations rose by 32% in Ekibastuz GRES-1 runs a cyclical maintenance programme for the 2013.
Electricity revenues grew by $38 million mainly as the ceiling six 500 MW units operating at the power station to extend each tariff for the captive power stations increased 12% from 4.55 units operating life.
As part of this programme, major capital repair KZT kWh in 2012 to 5.10 KZT kWh in 2013 leading to a rise work on the boiler and auxiliary equipment at Unit 3 was conducted in the average realised tariff.
Heat revenue also benefited from in conjunction with the installation of a new ESP in 2013.
The an increase in approved tariffs in 2013. second phase of the major overhaul of Unit 7 was also completed Electricity sales volumes were marginally higher than the prior year in November 2013. as generation at the captive power stations remained close to Work was performed to enhance infrastructure at the power capacity.
The suspension of the Zhezkazgan smelter and Satpayev station with the reconstruction of the switchyard which integrates concentrator in the second half of 2013 led to a decrease in the Ekibastuz GRES-1 with the Kazakhstan power network, upgrade consumption of electricity at Kazakhmys Mining.
This enabled the works to the stations ash disposal system and also the water captive power stations to increase external sales in 2013 by 13%, treatment facilities.

ENRC is treated as an asset held for sale from 24 June 2013 and a discontinued operation in the Groups financial statements.
In 2014, capital expenditure is expected to be between Kazakhmys share of ENRCs EBITDA excluding special items in $60 million and $80 million.
2013 of $276 million is for the period to 24 June 2013 compared to a full year contribution in 2012.
Kazakhmys share of ENRCs EBITDA in 2013 was also below the prior year, as ENRCs profitability in the first half of 2013 when compared to the corresponding period in 2012 was impacted by lower contributions from the Ferroalloys, Alumina and Aluminium and Energy Divisions.
ENRCs revenues were $37 million lower in the first half of 2013 as higher sales volumes across all Divisions, except for the Iron Ore Division, reduced the impact of the lower realised prices obtained for key products such as ferroalloys.
Operating cash costs were also higher than the comparative period in the prior year with the growth in sales volumes, an increase in wage rates and higher corporate costs in the first half of 2013. www.
