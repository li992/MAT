21 LEGOLAND CALIFORNIA HOTEL WHAT DID WE DO?
In April we continued our programme of transforming our theme parks into destination resorts when we opened our first LEGOLAND hotel in America, at the entrance to LEGOLAND California.
The 250 bedroom hotel is the third LEGOLAND hotel, after LEGOLAND Billund and LEGOLAND Windsor.
The hotel represented an investment of approximately $45 million and has been financed entirely from Merlins cash flow.
Merlins expert hotel team, combined with local architects and project management experts, was responsible for building on the plans and experiences from the LEGOLAND Windsor hotel, which opened a year earlier.
We supplemented the team with strong local hotel expertise and integrated the hotel operation into the LEGOLAND California Resort.
This has secured the optimal leverage of the hotel for sales and marketing of the resort: created a seamless guest experience: ensured the cost effective use of operating facilities: and enabled us to deploy our combined team in an efficient way.
The project was delivered two months ahead of schedule and within budget.
The excitement for the LEGOLAND hotel led to its becoming the biggest PR story since the opening of the park in 1999.
Financial performance has been stronger than expected, outperforming the business case for developing the hotel.
Guest satisfaction scores have been very high and, in line with our experience in other resorts, even higher than for visitors not using the hotel, thus underlining the logic of continuing to reposition the parks as short break destinations.
