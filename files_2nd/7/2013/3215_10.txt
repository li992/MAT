Strategic Report In February 2013, I shared the three components of Centrica Energys strategy: to invest for value in E&P with a focus on North America: to integrate Operating Review across the gas value chain by increasing our presence in LNG: and to limit our capital employed in power.
This is a strategy that has proved robust in International the face of considerable market and regulatory challenges and one against which we have made substantial progress in delivering.
Upstream In E&P, our C$1 billion acquisition with QPI of onshore oil and gas assets in Western Canada from Suncor and our investment in UK shale with Cuadrilla are important steps towards diversifying our portfolio.
In LNG, we signed significant agreements with Cheniere and Qatargas to import sufficient gas to supply up to 1.8 million and 3 million homes respectively.
In power, we commissioned the Lincs offshore wind farm in September and chose not to invest in new nuclear, demonstrating our ongoing Health and safety commitment to capital discipline and shareholder value.
remains a core In 2014, we will continue our focus on driving up returns and respond to market conditions by taking advantage of the diversity and flexibility within priority and we had our portfolio, reallocating capital towards the most attractive opportunities.
