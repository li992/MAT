I am pleased to report that Ophir hasadapted well to these changes and thistransition has been achieved in line withour plans.
In some areas, such as in theapproach to managing relationships withlocal communities, Ophir has been ableto enhance and improve its processes and procedures through learning from the experience of the teams already working on the Kerendan development in Indonesia and the production, development and exploration operations in the Gulf of Thailand.
In other areas, such as drilling, where Ophirhas demonstrated best in class performance, we have been able to apply Ophirs operational practices to improve theprocesses within the Asian business units.
The net result has been that it has been a good opportunity to upgrade our processes and procedures in pursuit of operational excellence.
A great example ofthis in practice was the work that we completed on the Bualuang field in late 2015 early 2016.

This process will result in Ophir focusing capital and people on those exploration opportunities that offer shareholders the best potential risk-adjusted return.
The Rakhine Basin in Myanmar has exploration potential that has excited the industry.
It is a large deepwater province with proven basins that, for political reasons, has been under-explored.
Ophir moved quickly from signing the PSC at the end of 2014 to completing the acquisition of over 10,000 sq km of 3D seismic by mid-2015.
This seismic survey was completed safely and under budget.
The processing of this seismic will be completed in 2Q 2016.
