STRATEGIC REPORT DIVISIONAL OPERATING REVIEW ASIA PACIFIC CONSULTANTS Hays is the market-leading specialist recruitment company in Australia, having been a pioneer 1,195 of the industry in the country since 1976.
OFFICES This year our Australian business returned to year-onyear growth for the first time since 2012, driven by our 45 Perm business as candidate confidence improved in several key markets, and our New Zealand business also delivered good growth.
