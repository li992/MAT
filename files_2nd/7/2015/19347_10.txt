2015 2014 Metal inventories 13 39 Total impairment charges reversals 13 39 The net write-down of metal inventories of uS$13 million recognised in 2015 is related to the low-grade material at varvara mined before re-starting the copper circuit and the low grade ore stockpiled for heap leaching at Birkachan.
reversals recorded in 2014 were related to ore in heap leaching piles, work-in-progress and metal for refinery previously impaired, which was further processed or determined to be economic for further processing.
The reversals were mainly driven by the decline in unit cash costs required to bring the work-in-progress stockpiles into saleable metal.

Operating cash flows before changes at the current exchange rates, capital expenditure in 2016 is expected to total approximately uS$340 million including in working capital decreased by 18% year-on-year to uS$504 million as a result of the decrease in adjusted eBiTDa and exploration, capitalised stripping and construction of the Kyzyl project in line with previous guidance: increase in cash tax payments by albazino and Omolon, where previously tax losses carried forward were available.
as a result, the Company expects to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow with the capacity to make further net operating cash flows were uS$490 million, compared to uS$518 million in 2014.
