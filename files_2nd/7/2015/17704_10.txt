During 2015, programmes of aircore drilling and diamond core drilling were undertaken to test for indications of economic mineralisation North Mara within 2-5 kilometres of the Bulyanhulu mine.
In the Northwest and Nose Zone areas a Bulyanhulu total of 103 aircore holes for 4,583 metres and four diamond core drill holes for 1,856 TANZANIA metres were drilled to test several targets primarily associated with the Reef 2 series vein extensions.
All the diamond core holes intersected gold mineralisation in a series of 2-5 veins per hole similar to those types of reefs intersected on Reef 2.
These results, together with those from previous drilling programmes, confirm the presence and lateral extension of the targeted multiple reefs associated with the Reef 2 series veins.
