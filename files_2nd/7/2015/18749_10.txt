OPERATING REVIEW We manage our markets based on the strategic roles they play, with markets prioritising Growth or Returns.
Our portfolio priorities are focused on driving the performance of our Growth and Specialist Brands.
Brand Performances Our Growth and Specialist Brands are the most important assets in our portfolio and together they account for 56.9 per cent of our tobacco net revenue, up 270 basis points.
The rest of our portfolio consists of Portfolio Brands, local and regional brands that fulfil a variety of roles.
Some add to our revenue momentum, while others will create more value by being migrated into Growth Brands.

Growth Brands have broad consumer appeal.
They generate a significant amount of our volume and revenue and our aim is to increase the contribution they make to the business.

Specialist Brands appeal to specific consumer groups across the tobacco spectrum.
Net revenue declined in the year, largely due to lower sales of Gitanes in Iraq and Syria.
Excluding this impact, underlying net revenue was up 2.9 per cent.
Market Performances We divide our footprint into Growth and Returns Markets.
In Growth Markets we prioritise long-term share and profit growth and in Returns Markets the focus is on sustainable profit delivery and effective management of our strong share positions.

Greece Revenue was up, with Davidoff performing well and increasing sales of Rizla, and we successfully completed the migration of Maxim into JPS.
Sweden and Norway Volume, revenue, profit and share were all higher as we further built on our snus position with another excellent performance from Skruf, supported by gains from Knox.
Turkey Our results were impacted by significant price competition and we implemented a restructuring programme to reduce costs and strengthen our performance.
Iraq and Syria Volumes, largely of Growth Brands, declined considerably due to deteriorating conditions in territories where we have a high presence.
Cost saving initiatives elsewhere in the Group offset the financial impact.
Saudi Arabia Contributions from West, Davidoff and Gauloises Blondes enhanced our share in a growing cigarette market.
Egypt We improved our cigarette share as we continued to build our presence with Davidoff and Parker & Simpson.
Japan Positive progress was underpinned by cigarette share gains from West and a focus on developing long-term retailer partnerships.
Taiwan Davidoff performed well, supported by our new marketing campaign, although our overall cigarette share was held back as a result of a decline in West following a price increase.
Vietnam Regulatory changes and excise-driven price increases have significantly fuelled illicit trade, impacting our volume and share performance.
Cambodia Price competition undermined the positive progress of Fine.
In response we extended the brand franchise with the launch of Fine Blue to strengthen our position.

Our enhanced revenue and profit performance reflects the contribution from ITG Brands since the completion of the acquisition of assets from Reynolds American on 12 June 2015.
The table above reflects the combined performance of ITG Brands and our existing USA operations.
The net contribution of the acquisition to the USA performance was tobacco net revenue of 242 million and volumes of five billion, increasing our total USA volumes to 13.2 billion.
The percentage of tobacco net revenue generated by Growth Brands declined, as a consequence of the larger post-acquisition portfolio.
The acquired cigarette brands Winston, Salem, Kool and Maverick performed well in the fourth quarter, maintaining stable market shares.
In addition, USA Gold gained share in key focus states.
As a result of the USA acquisition our Growth and Specialist Brands have been reclassified, effective 1 October 2015.
Winston has been added to Growth Brands, replacing USA Gold, which becomes a Portfolio Brand, and Kool has joined our Specialist Brands.
Our new portfolio strategy is primarily focused on growing Winston and Kool in the premium segment and Maverick and USA Gold in the discount segment, and the development of these brands is being supported by new retail merchandising programmes.
Competitor discounting impacted our mass market cigar performance and we are responding by strengthening the retail focus of the cigar business model and enhancing the consumer appeal of our key brands Dutch Masters and Backwoods.
