This was largely on account of planned maintenance activity at Mangala Processing Terminal at Rajasthan, higherthan-expected water cuts at Bhagyam in Rajasthan and suspension of gas sales at Ravva for around three months as a result of the breakdown of the OMGC gas pipeline.
This was partially offset by higher production at Cambay and better performance of the Mangala field in Rajasthan.
