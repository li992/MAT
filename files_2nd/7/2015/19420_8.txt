Provincial revenue grew by 3% in the year driven by a 2% increase in customer visits.
Excluding the impact from the opening of Southend, admissions were broadly at against last year which is in line with the latest available data for the UK casino market.
This lack of visit growth was disappointing and will be a focus for the coming year.
Comparable revenue was up 2%, driven by increased spend per visit offset by a lower win margin.
Disappointingly, operating pro t fell by 3% in the year due to higher irrecoverable VAT, start-up losses at Southend, a lower win margin and other one-off costs.
