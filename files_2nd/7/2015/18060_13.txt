50 Centamin plc Annual report 2015 strategic report OPERATIONAL REvIEw continued resources and reserves Sukari During the year, Centamin updated its mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates for the Sukari Gold Mine as at 30 June 2015.
An updated NI 43101 resource and reserve report was completed and filed on SEDAR at www.
The total measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 13 million ounces Moz gold is reported as an open pit resource at a 0.3g t cutoff grade.
This total is inclusive of the 1.0Moz underground mineral resource.
The open pit and surface stockpile mineral reserve estimate is 8.3Moz and the underground mineral reserve estimate is 2.7 million tonnes Mt containing 0.5Moz gold.
The total combined open pit and underground mineral reserve estimate of 8.8Moz represented an increase of 7% over the previous 8.2Moz as at 30 September 2013.
The increase is due to lower operating mining and processing costs associated with lower international fuel prices, and continued drilling from underground to move ounces up through the resource categories and increase the underground reserve.
Resource and reserve definition drilling continues to target higher grade areas of the Sukari Hill deposit, in parallel with expanding underground infrastructure.
Positive results from the ongoing programme are discussed in the following section.
The mineral resource estimate is based on the open pit mined surface as at 30 June 2015 and adjusted for underground mine workings as at 30 June 2015.
All available assays as at February 2015.
Resource data set comprises 252,449 two metre down hole composites and surface rock chip samples.
Mineral resources are reported inclusive of those resources converted to proven and probable mineral reserves.
The resources are estimates of recoverable tonnes and grades using multiple indicator kriging with block support correction.
Measured resources lie in areas where drilling is available at a nominal 25m x 25m spacing, indicated resources occur in areas drilled at approximately 25m x 50m spacing and inferred resources exist in areas of broader spaced drilling.
The resource model extends from 9700mN to 12200mN and to a maximum depth of 0mRl a maximum depth of approximately 1,000m below wadi level.

The mineral resource is reported above 2g t within interpreted mineralised domains.
The mineral resource estimate is depleted by underground mine workings as at 30 June 2015.
All available information has been used including mapping from underground mining and assays as at June 2015.
Available resource data resulted in 21,369 one metre down hole composites used for grade estimation.
The mineral resources were estimated utilising a single indicator weighted kriging method IK to estimate gold for each of the mineralisation domains.
Measured mineral resources are defined by a drill spacing of at least 20m x 20m and confined to the interpreted mineralisation defined by underground mine development.
Indicated mineral resources are defined as areas outside the measured mineral resource and defined by approximately 20m x 20m drill spacing.
Inferred mineral resources include all remaining estimated mineralisation defined by a drill spacing of approximately 50m x 50m.
The underground resource is located within the boundaries of the open pit resource, and is included within that total.
