[ 20 ] Operational Review Safety Our commitment to zero harm and safe production remains undiminished.
We have introduced varied and far reaching remedial measures following the fatalities earlier in the year.
Operationally, 2011 has been an encouraging year in which we have reaped the benefits of the operational turnaround we undertook in 2009 and 2010.
Safety We have historically been proud of the progress we have made in making our working environment safer and in the leading position in safety that we have occupied within the industry.
The entire team is therefore very disappointed and saddened by the six fatalities experienced in the 2011 financial year.
The incidents were examined using our standard Incident Cause Analysis Methodology ICAM process and we spent a great deal of time trying to understand the failures and root causes.
Across the six incidents, there are few, if any, common factors.
While four of those fatally injured were contractors, the location, nature of the incident and the root causes were different in all six cases.
In fact, the only common theme was that the deaths all resulted from known hazards, for which there are well established protocol and risk mitigation processes, however, some of these were not adhered to as a result of unsafe behaviour.
Lonmin mining operations have introduced varied and far reaching remedial measures following the fatalities that occurred pertaining to Fall of Ground, Trucks and Tramming, Engulfment, Caught in Between, Scraping and Rigging.
In addition, workplace stoppages were instituted in response to conditions believed to be unsafe, together with self-initiated mine wide production stoppages instituted by management on 30 March and 14 April 2011 to reinforce the importance of safety following two of the fatal accidents.
Our commitment to zero harm and safe production in our work place remains undiminished and we achieved four million fatality free shifts across all Lonmin operations at the end of September 2011 only the second time in Lonmins history that this milestone has been achieved.
We believe that our fundamental approach to safety management remains sound, however, we continue to learn from the root causes of each incident.
The LTIFR for the financial year was 4.71 and over the past three years the LTIFR has improved by 33%.
Rowland shaft leads in the industry with an achievement of twelve million fall of ground fatal free shifts.
This remarkable achievement took ten years to accumulate.
Another exceptional performance to note was 4B shaft achieving 4.6 million fatality free shifts.
The processes and procedures for safe production remain sound and, in consultation with our union leadership and the DMR, we are reinvigorating our efforts to re-assert our industry leading position.
We believe that, together with our stakeholders and the working groups that have been established, this will lead to the entrenchment of sound leadership, an enabling environment, simple systems, a positive safety culture and improved contractor safety management.

the palladium market has seen consistent redemptions since March, resulting in a net drawdown for this year.
Our long term view for this demand category is that it will remain a modest net consumer over time.
Outlook South African supply side challenges remain largely unchanged whilst some aspects are amplified due to social pressures.
Deeper mines, lower grades, skill shortages and power and water supply challenges all remain.
A further deterrent to investment has been the widely broadcast debate on nationalisation.
Incidents of social and labour unrest place additional strain in an industry that has to compete for capital to deliver the supply required to match future demand.
The strength of the Rand and inflationary pressures continue to squeeze operating margins and cash flows.
These factors not only provide an underpin to metal prices, but may also leave the market in deficit if demand picks up more strongly than anticipated.
