Financial Performance EBITDA for FY 201011 was US$258.2 million, 67% higher than FY 200910.
This improved performance was primarily driven by rising volumes and LME prices, partially offset by higher carbon and coal costs, which were further increased by Improving energy around 30% by Coal India in March 2011 and a new green tax on coal.
