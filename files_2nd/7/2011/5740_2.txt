operational review OPERATIONAL REVIEW Strategy our aim is to enhance shareholder value by production: 2 exploration and appraisal using increasing both our production of crude oil seismic and other techniques to enhance reserves and our audited reserves of crude oil, whilst and resources: and 3 completing our physical at the same time maximising our average infrastructure to minimise operational costs.

We seek to addition we will consider selective acquisitions achieve this by a combination of 1 our ongoing of, for example, adjacent licence areas.
drilling programme to sustain and increase oil Drilling In 2011 we drilled 24 wells one exploration, five programme were announced throughout 2011 appraisal, three water injection, fourteen producers via rnS, and all announcements can be found on and one water supply well.

Exillon WS Exillon WS produced 2,079,207 bbl and generated We completed construction of the first stage of an revenue of US$139.7 million.
in-field oil processing facility at the EWS II field, allowing production of commodity oil from that in February 2010, we began construction of a field.
In addition we completed the second stage Transneft oil terminal, which was successfully oil processing facility on EWS i, construction of completed in Q1 2012.
When commissioned, an oil filling station, installed 3MW gas power this will enable us to reduce transportation and generators on EWS i, constructed well pads 2, 4, processing costs.
