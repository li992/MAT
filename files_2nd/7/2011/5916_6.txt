Ferrexpo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 20 Review of Operations Reserves and Resources Ferrexpos resource base consists of magnetite ore of 30% iron content, which is particularly well-suited for pelletising.
The ore body is a single 50 kilometre-long strike divided into 10 adjacent deposits.
Five of these deposits are classified according to the international JORC Code and as at 1 January 2012 represented estimated resources of 6.8 billion tonnes.
The other five deposits, representing an estimated 14.2 billion tonnes, are FSU classified.

Ferrexpo is currently working together with international consultants to convert these resources to the universally accepted Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee JORC standards.
These deposits are collectively known as the Northern Deposits and are classified under the names Manuilovskoye, Vasilievskoye, Kharchenkovskoye, Zarudenskoye and Brovarkovskoye.

The State Service for Geology and Use of Natural 6.8bn Resources of Ukraine has granted Ferrexpo development licences for the GorishneJORC resources Plavninskoye, Lavrikovskoye, Yeristovskoye, Belanovskoye and Galeshinskoye deposits.
Exploration licences are held for the remaining Northern Deposits.
In general, a development licence is granted for a period of 20 years and an exploration licence is granted for 10 years.

resources classified according to the Former Soviet Union code Production In 2011, Ferrexpo was the largest exporter of pellets in the CIS and one of the top 10 pellet producers in the global seaborne iron ore market.
Production continued at full capacity and a record quantity of iron units was produced and shipped in the form of pellets.
On a Fe equivalent basis, the Groups output of iron units has doubled in the last 10 years of production.
In addition, the average grade of its pellets has increased significantly by over 1% to 63.5% Fe.
