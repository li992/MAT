Strategy group operations aim is to be a world class operations business whilst ensuring value through cost and process efficiency.
this will be achieved by providing excellent technology and effective process to support the businesses: driving simplification, automation and continuous improvement: developing world class operations, leadership and capability: and maintaining strong controls to protect the group.
the success of the integration programme in delivering a platform and single set of processes now enables the group to commence its simplification programme as part of the group strategic transformational journey.
the simplification programme is well underway and is now targeting cost savings of 1.7 billion in 2014 as well as improving service and the customer experience.
group operations will play a major part in the whole programme but particularly through sourcing, end to end processes, and property initiatives.
sourcing: we will optimise our demand management, simplify specifications and further strengthen our supplier relationships, reducing the number of suppliers to the group from around 18,000 to under 10,000, and further focus on a core group of lead suppliers to achieve approximately a 15 per cent saving on addressable spend.
end to end processes: we will conduct an end-to-end redesign of our processes, which will include significant process automation, simplifying processes for our staff, increasing accuracy, and reducing complaints.
this will result in more time to serve customers, generate sales, and create an improved customer experience.
property: we will further consolidate the groups property portfolio, enabled by the delivery of process and efficiency savings from the simplification programme.
group operations will also play a key role in delivering the technical expertise and support for the other group strategic initiatives.

total income increased by 1,181 million to 1,829 million primarily due to a 1,143 million increase in volatility and liability management effects.
these included a 872 million increase in liability management gains.
in addition, there was a 615 million reduction in the mark-to-market losses arising from the equity conversion feature of the Groups enhanced capital notes, partly offset by a 344 million adverse movement on banking volatility, which is attributed to ineffectiveness in hedge accounting relationships and banking book derivatives not mitigated through hedge accounting.
liability management gains arose on transactions undertaken as part of the Groups management of capital, largely the exchange of certain debt securities for other debt instruments or, for 2010 only, ordinary shares.
these transactions resulted in a gain of 1,295 million in 2011, which comprises 696 million recognised in statutory net interest income, reflecting a reduction in the carrying value of certain debt securities as a result of changes in expected cash flows, and 599 million recognised in statutory other income relating to the exchange of existing securities into new securities.
