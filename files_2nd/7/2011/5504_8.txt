EnQuest increased 2011 operational summary Two wells were drilled on Thistle and contingent resources to 116.78 MMboe at Deveron in 2011, following the 2010 rig the end of 2011.
Nine wells were finished refurbishment and drilling facilities during the year eight of these were upgrade.
This resulted in Thistle producing at its highest annual rate operated by EnQuest and two new for over ten years.
exploration discoveries were made at Conrie and Crathes.
At Heather and Broom, following the subsurface review in 2010, 2011 was focused on the first phases of the oil rig nigel hares Chief operating officer reactivation programme.
Production at Heather and Broom delivered the strongest growth of all of our hubs, up 20%, partly due to the new pipeline installed between the fields in 2010.
The Don fields contributed over 50% of our total production in 2011.
Production for the year also benefited from the discovery in early 2011 of the Conrie field, with the S7 well coming on stream in August 2011.
