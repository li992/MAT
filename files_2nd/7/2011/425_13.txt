CI-01 borders the maritime boundary with Ghana, and lies adjacent to the major Jubilee and Tweneboa oil and gas discoveries made in recent years.
By applying the latest understanding of Cretaceous depositional systems to the existing well and seismic dataset, to redefine the distribution of oil and gas in existing discoveries on the block, we believe that the potential exists for these accumulations to be significantly larger than originally mapped.
2012 Outlook The partners plan to acquire more 3D seismic over the block.
