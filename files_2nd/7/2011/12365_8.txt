Reconstruction of the Omsukchan concentrator 2 As of 1 April 2011, the Group changed its methodology for calculating and reporting gravity circuit launched on the metals it produced.
Previously, production of metals contained in dor and zinc precipitate was recorded by the Group upon shipment of the dor or precipitate Expansion of the Kubaka plant Merrill-Crowe from its mine gold rooms to third party refineries.
Under the new methodology, these metals are considered to be produced upon receipt of dor or precipitate at section installed the Groups gold rooms.
In addition, production of metals contained in concentrates was previously recorded upon shipment of concentrate to third party off-takers, Inaugural silver and gold concentrate sales whereas under the new methodology these metals are considered to be produced Dukat to Kazakhstan, Albazino to China when concentrate is bagged, sampled and prepared for shipment.
The Company believes that the new methodology is more accurate as it reflects the Groups Implementation of laser scanning of mining physical production and eliminates variations associated with shipment cycles.
This mostly applies to concentrates, where stockpile build-up accelerated during 2011. works at Dukat for further automated mine To a lesser extent, it also applies to dor and precipitate, where shipment cycles planning have remained largely unchanged during 2011.
Consequently, year-on-year comparisons have not been restated, as the Company believes such restatement would not lead to material differences to those results.
3 Polymetal reports production of metals contained in concentrates based on percentages payable for these metals by off-takers.
Final assays are typically determined at the receiving smelters several months after shipment from the Groups mines.

The largest increase 1,248 Kt, representing plan to process ore with grades close to our current a 2.8 fold increase came from Omolon.
Significant reserve grade of 4.2 g t. additional contributions came from the Amursk hub with another 625 Kt of ore, due to start of underground mining Production at Mayskoye and the open-pit mine at Albazino reaching Throughout the year we consistently improved full capacity.
production results on a quarter-on-quarter basis, as we overcame the operational challenges of the first half of Average grades in ore mined decreased slightly from the year and started to reap the rewards of ramping-up 4.4 g t of metal equivalent to 3.8 g t, with the decline new plants and reconstruction of existing facilities in the mostly coming from mature operations such as Dukat, second half of the year.
As a result, in Q4 we achieved Khakanja and Voro.
The grade decline at Omolon was a record production level of 250 Koz of gold equivalent, related to mine sequencing mostly heap leach ore mined representing a run-rate of 1 Moz per year.
This was compensated for by grade growth at new operations, in particular Albazino and Mayskoye Major contributions to production growth resulted from which both produce high grade refractory gold ores.

The circuit completion difference between ore mined and processed resulted principally from inability to operate a winter road at the start Amursk hub the start of production and ramp-up of 2011 at Omolon.
As a result, ore from Sopka could not of the Albazino processing plant produced saleable be processed at the Kubaka plant as originally planned.
