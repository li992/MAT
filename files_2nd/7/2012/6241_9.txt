In addition, we employ 465 local define metallurgy and determine mining method at Orisyvo community members across our project sites.
Initiate the pre-feasibility study at Las Casas Cinega Considerable attention is given to promote sustainable development and maintain good health and safety practices at all times.
In 2012 we renewed our ISO-14001:2004 certication, ensuring that all of our exploration activities are completed under strict care for the environment.
We maintain six nurseries with 18,000 plant specimens What we did in 2012 that thrive in the climate regions where we explore, including An aggressive exploration programme was completed in 2012, endangered species.
We conducted dozens of community including 593,968 metres of core and 249,225 metres of reverse engagement and environmental education activities in 2012 to circulation drilling on 20 properties, following geological mapping strengthen our mutually beneficial relations with local communities.
Silver resources were increased 12.2% to 2.03 billion ounces and gold resources increased 15.0% to27.0 million ounces.
Reserves and replenishment of the mined ore were increased to 498.5 million ounces silver 23.6% and5.5 million ounces gold 19.6%.
The Board of Directors approved the San Julin project in 2012, andwork on the new mine began immediately.
Ramp construction continued at Centauro Deep, advancing to 9,228 metres.
A prefeasibility study was concluded at Juanicipio, and we are following the recommendations of the independent third party.
At Orisyvo, a bulk sample of sulphide gold ore from the exploration adit was submitted to the lab for metallurgical test work and a full-scale evaluation is underway.
At Las Casas, additional drilling delivered significant improvements in tonnage and grades, and conversion to indicated from inferred resources: mine work has now reached the veins.
