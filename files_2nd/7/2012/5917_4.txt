This mine has operated successfully for over 40 years without any significant disruptions or delays in production.
At FPMs production facilities, the crude ore is ground and crushed to remove rock and concentrated, thereafter, it is formed into balls FPM Highlights and fired to produce iron ore pellets which Increase in production from own ore of 2.6% have a current average iron content of 63.3%.

Output, however, is currently limited to 10mtpa due to the amount of crude ore available from the FPM pit and certain bottlenecks in concentrating and pelletising, which are being upgraded and modernised as part of the FPM pit as at July 2011 sustaining capital expenditure programme.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, FPM increased the amount of iron ore mined to 29,761 thousand tonnes compared to 29,637 thousand tonnes in 2011.
9,301 thousand tonnes of pellets from own ore were produced, of which 4,118 thousand tonnes had circa 65% iron content and 5,183 thousand tonnes had circa 62% iron content.
FPM also produced 108 thousand tonnes of pellets from FYM ore and 281 thousand tonnes of pellets from purchased third party concentrate.
FPM plans to mine up to 30 million tonnes of ore per year from the pit equating to an estimated mine life in excess of 25 years.
