COM 20 BUSINESS REVIEW 01 The appraisal programme achieved its objectives: EAST AFRICA demonstrating the consistent, high quality reservoir TANZANIA across the Jodari eld: conrming the 3.4TCF mean recoverable resource estimate: and conrming the feasibility of high-angle sub-horizontal drilling, thereby reducing development costs and positively impacting the economics of the asset and potentially increasing Block 7 well recoveries.
Block 4 Block 3 East Pande The Jodari-1 well discovery, at 3.4TCF recoverable, Block 1 materially exceeded pre-drill estimates.
The two wells drilled into the discovery were Jodari Gross area: Water depth: South-1 including Jodari South ST-1 a deviated 2 side-track from the Jodari South well and Jodari 33,078km 3,000m North-1.

These potential to anchor Tanzanias first multi-train appraisal results were in line with pre-drill prognoses and LNG development have confirmed the widespread, high quality Oligocene reservoir properties.
Gross recoverable resources for the Play opening discoveries at Mzia and Papa in the Upper Jodari asset have been re-confirmed at a mean case of Cretaceous intraslope play of the Rovuma and Ruji Deltas 3.4TCF, with an upside P10 case of 3.7TCF.

Successful exploration wells Mzia-2 encountered 62m of net gas pay in Cretaceous during 2012 reservoirs and established pressure communication between the Mzia-2 and Mzia-1 gas columns.
This result confirms a vertical gas column of at least 200m for the 6 Mzia eld.
Management estimates for gas in-place for Mzia have Successful drilling campaigns been revised upwards from 2-6TCF to 4-9TCF with a during 2012 mean of 6TCF.
The Jodari and Mzia discoveries in Block 1 are both now likely to be anchor assets for Tanzanias first LNG development.

Basin oor fans and amalgamated channel sequences of Tertiary age have been interpreted, which are geologically analogous to those seen on the adjacent, Mozambique side of the Rovuma Delta, where significant recent success has been announced.
Discovering gas in Block 3 Papa-1 was the first Cretaceous gas discovery outboard of the Ruji Delta in Block 3 and the sixth consecutive discovery by the Joint Venture offshore Tanzania.
Based on the available preliminary data, Ophir estimates in-place gas volumes of 0.5 2.0TCF.
Detailed core and petrophysical analysis will confirm the scale of thediscovered resource.
The Papa-1 discovery further fide-risks the deeper, Upper Cretaceous intraslope play in Tanzania.
Joint Venture collaboration Ophir was originally awarded a 100% interest in Block 1 on 29 October 2005.
Blocks 3 and 4 were subsequently awarded on 19 June 2006, again on a 100% basis.
The Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation TPDC has back-in rights of 12% in Block 1 and 15% in Blocks 3 and 4.
In April 2010 Ophir entered into a farm-out agreement with BG Group for a 60% interest in each block, with Ophir retaining 40%.
After drilling the first three discovery wells, on 1 July 2011 operatorship of all three blocks was formally transferred to BG Group.
As part of this arrangement, BG Group also took over operatorship of the Mtwara port facility on behalf of the other participating operators Ophir, Petrobras and Statoil.
During 2011 the Mtwara base was upgraded to accommodate multiple operators working simultaneously.
BG Group and Ophir continue to collaborate on the commercialisation and development options for the Joint Venture, including commencing site selection forthe LNG plant.

Due to the high quality reservoir properties proven by drilling in the Jodari eld, the Joint Venture anticipates that the actual ow rate obtained on test may be constrained by the limits of testing equipment.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 23 BUSINESS REVIEW REVIEW OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED Exploring the potential KENYA Capitalising on synergies with its Tanzanian Block 7, Ophir acted quickly to acquire two 3D seismic surveys in 2012 in order to enable the Group to unlock the potential of its Kenyan assets.
The Ndoto 3D survey in Block L-15 was designed to target two plays: the western edge of Block L-15 the Lamu Toe Thrust and Tertiary and Cretaceous Fault Block L-9 Blocks of the Davy Walu High.
The Nala 3D survey in Block L-9 was designed to test three targets: the southern extent of the Mbawa Inversion zone: Mbawa South, an en-echelon play: and the Simba Graben, an Gross area: Water depth: onlap play.

Currently analysing the data and plan to drill in 2014 Ophir has a good footprint in the rapidly emerging play offshore Kenya.
Exciting prospects Block L-9 covers 5,110km2 offshore Kenya on the Davy-Walu structural trend.
During the first two-year exploration period, Ophir has a commitment to shoot 500km2 of 3D seismic data, reprocess 2,500km2 of 2Dseismic and carry out geological and geophysical eld studies.
The Lamu Basin has the potential to contain both gas and liquids as demonstrated by previous wells in the area.
Synthetic aperture radar has also identied possible oil seeps locally.
Adjacent to L-9 are blocks being operated by Apache and Anadarko.
The Mbawa-1 discovery, which was drilled by Operator Apache in 2012 in Block L-8, is along trend lines from similar features in L-9 and has proven the presence of hydrocarbons in the area.
Ophir signed an agreement to work together with Apache to acquire a 3D seismic programme in 2012 over the L-8 L-9 Mbawa South area.
Block L-15 lies in the Lamu Basin offshore Kenya and covers an area of 2,331km2.
It lies to the north of L-9 and also extends onto the Davy-Walu structural high.
Koa-1, which was drilled by Union Oil in 1985, is the only well which has been drilled to date in Block L-15 and encountered oil and gas shows in the Palaeogene and Upper Cretaceous intervals.

Ophir drilled Kora-1, the first well on the block, to a total depth of 4,447.5m subsea in July 2011.
The primary Albian and secondary Coniacian and Barremian reservoir intervals were penetrated close to their anticipated depths, but the well encountered a predominantly claystone and thinly bedded limestone sequence, rather than the predicted sandstone reservoir facies.
Kora-1 was subsequently plugged and abandoned.
The well did, however, provide valuable information on the potential charging mechanisms in the block and encouragement for future exploration.
