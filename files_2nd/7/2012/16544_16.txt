In 2011, Indias apparent steel use grew by 2.5% to reach 67.7mt in contrast to 2012, when the growth rate is forecast to accelerate to 6.9%.
However, rises in export taxes and rail freight costs have signicantly increased Indian export costs.

With the aim of extending the Companys capability to handle higher volumes, Sesas River Fleet Services team targeted barge turnaround times as a key contributor to improving transportation efficiency.
Analysis using LEAN industrial engineering techniques mapping processes combined with root cause analysis and cross functional brain storming sessions identied areas for improvement in the process.
New barge management software was rolled out to track, monitor and schedule barges in real time using a Global Positioning System GPS.
As a result, barge turnaround time has been reduced by an impressive 37%, down from 38 hours to 24 hours, maximising barge utilisation and optimising barge capacity.

Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 45 EBITDA in FY 201112 was lower at US$721.4 million compared with US$1,174.1 million in the previous year.
Lower EBITDA was mainly due to the increase in export duty, sales volume impact due to the mining ban, logistics constraints and lower mine grade of iron ore.
The export duty on iron ore fines and lumps was increased by the Government of India from 5% and 15%, respectively, to 20% on both fines and lumps effective from March 2011: and subsequently this was increased from 20% to 30% with effect from the end of December 2011 which impacted EBITDA by US$201 million.

com 56 OIL & GAS Operational Review continued Oil & Gas Enhancing oil recovery in the Mangala oil eld The Mangala oil eld in Rajasthan is being developed with the help of water injection.
The eld contains moderately viscous oil, with a consistency almost like honey and with nearly 2040 times the viscosity of the injected water.
This contrast in viscosity reduces the efficiency of the water in displacing the oil and ultimately reduces the overall oil recovery in a given time period.
Increasing the viscosity of the injected water is one of the ways of decreasing this contrast and improving oil displacement.
Extensive screening studies were done to select the most suitable Enhanced Oil Recovery EOR method for the Mangala eld, with chemical EOR emerging as the best option.
Polymer ooding is the simplest of the chemical EOR methods in which the viscosity of injected water is increased by adding small amounts of Polymers.
A pilot was implemented in CY 2010 and is proving to be effective under actual eld conditions, showing significant potential for accelerating and increasing oil production from the Mangala eld on a larger scale.
The application of chemical EOR methods can contribute to the commercialisation of over 300 million barrels of oil from Rajasthans Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya elds cumulatively.
