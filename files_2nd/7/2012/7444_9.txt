In Argentina, Production In 2012, Hochschild once again met its full year production target, producing 20.3 million attributable silver equivalent ounces, comprised of 13.6 million ounces of silver and 111.8 thousand ounces of gold.
The Company has announced a production target of 20.0 million attributable silver equivalent ounces for 2013.
Production at each of the Companys main operations is expected to be in line with 2012.
As anticipated, production at the ageing Ares mine will continue to decline, re ecting lower tonnages and grades.
Production at the Moris mine in Mexico is not expected to be material.
A view of Arcata OUR CORE ASSETS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS In 2012 we not only achieved our annual production target but we also received excellent results from our brown eld exploration programme and maintained our life-of-mine which is also now supported by a more robust resource base.
