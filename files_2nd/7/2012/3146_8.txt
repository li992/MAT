Operational and Exploration Review Centamin intends to continue to grow and diversify its project pipeline through targeted acquisitions of exploration and development prospects in the region and beyond.
OVERVIEW Centamins principal asset is the Sukari Gold Mine, which is located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, approximately 700km from Cairo and 25km from the Red Sea.
For the 12 months ended 31 December 2012, production from Sukari was 262,828 ounces 2011: 202,699 ounces of gold at an operating cash cost of US$669 per ounce.
The first pillar of Centamins growth strategy is the expansion of Sukari, which includes the growth of Sukari Hills resources and reserves, the development of the underground mine and the Stage 4 expansion, which will double the plants processing capacity from 5Mtpa to 10Mtpa.
Construction of the Stage 4 expansion was steady during the first half of the year, although the second half saw some delays, meaning that, whilst some commissioning activities will still begin in Q1 2013, we now anticipate the bulk of commissioning to commence in the second half of 2013, versus the previously-expected Q2, with completion before year end.
The capital cost of the Stage 4 expansion which is funded by PGM out of cost recoveries, is US$325 million including contingency, with expenditure to date of US$228.5 million.
Our exploration team at Sukari focused on identifying high grade mineralization from both the underground mine and other prospects in the wider Sukari tenement area.
An update resource and reserve statement will be delivered in the second half of 2013.
Centamin continued exploration on its tenements in northern Ethiopia where exploration drilling commenced in the first half of 2012.
Centamin intends to continue to grow and diversify its project pipeline through targeted acquisitions of exploration and development prospects in the region and beyond.
17 Operational and Exploration Review The expansion of the underground mine continued with EGYPT SUKARI GOLD MINE the connection of the Ptah decline into the primary Health and Safety ventilation circuit.
The first phase of development of the Ptah decline is schedule to be completed mid-2013, The Lost Injury Time LTI incident rate for 2012 was with diamond drilling commencing in the first quarter 0.69 per 200,000 man-hours 2011: 1.25 per 200,000 2013.
This secondary decline will provide both a man-hours, with a total of 5,819,877 man hours worked ventilation intake and haulage way to the central and during 2012 2011: 4,312,043.

Surface drilling in 2012 continued north through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into the northern Pharaoh zone.
Underground drilling was progressively stepped-up during the year as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high grade extensions of the deposit.
The ore body has not yet been closed off by drilling to the north, or at depth.
Further exploration of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2013, predominantly from both the Amun and Ptah declines and an update resource and reserve statement will be delivered in the second half of 2013.
