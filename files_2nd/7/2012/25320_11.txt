Our Hungarian business delivered a very strong performance.

Key to this result are the excellent employee engagement levels in our Hungarian business and we are very proud that it was awarded the best workplace in Hungary and, subsequently, the sixth best workplace across Central and Eastern Europe.
This high level of employee engagement is the foundation of the very strong 2012 performance which delivered good growth in customers and credit issued together with excellent credit quality.

He was previously Regional Managing Director of our Mexican operation.
Our business in Romania had a difficult year, set against a backdrop of continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, political instability and austerity measures that reduced household income and consumer confidence.
Lower than expected growth, together with higher than anticipated impairment and increased costs arising from infrastructure investment to support our growth plans, resulted in a 1.9 million reduction in profit to 2.2 million.
Our performance in Q1 2012 was impacted signicantly by higher impairment and all of the reduction in profit is attributable to this period.

He was appointed Country Manager of Mexico in 2012.
The key objectives for the Mexican business in 2012 were to build on the improved operational performance delivered in 2011 and to increase revenue per customer by issuing larger loans to creditworthy customers: this is a key building block in our aim of delivering a profit of 33 per customer by 2015.
The business performed well against these objectives in 2012, delivering strong growth in credit issued together with lower impairment through good operational management.
This resulted in the Mexican business delivering a record profit of 4.9 million, an increase of 3.4 million compared to 2011, and this equates to a profit per customer of 7.
