Operating review Bulyanhulu Operating performance Bulyanhulu produced 236,183 ounces in 2012, 10% lower than in 2011, asa result of paste fill delays, lower than planned availability of high grade stopes and lower equipment availabilities resulting in reductions to ore tonnes hoisted and head grade mined.
Whilst corrective actions are underway, progress has been slowed by potential changes to Tanzanian pension legislation which has led to significant numbers of long serving Tanzanian employees resigning.
These included a number of skilled underground mining personnel as well as maintenance staff dealing with improving mobile equipment availabilities.
With the end of the Offer Period we are now actively hiring as well as rotating staff from elsewhere in our operations, in order to minimise further impacts in 2013.
Head grade of 8.0 g t was lower than in 2011 8.5 g t as a result of paste fill delays limiting access to the primary long hole stopes leading to increased tonnes being mined from lower grade stopes.
The lower mined grade together with lower recoveries in the CIL circuit led to a recovery rate of 90.6%.
Gold ounces sold for the year were 235,410 ounces, which was broadly inline with the production figure, but 13% lower than in 2011.
Copper production for the year of 6.1 million pounds was 20% lower than in 2011.
This was primarily due to mining of lower copper grade areas and lower recoveries.

com Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Buzwagi Operating performance Buzwagi produced 165,770 ounces in 2012, 16% lower than in 2011, as a result of the reversion to mining at reserve grade for a significant part of the year, with production further impacted by plant operational factors leading to decreased processing rates in the first half of the year.
With the installation of diesel back-up power and improved plant operational availability and efficiencies in the second half of the year, 2012 mill throughput increased by 24% compared to 2011.
In addition, there was asignificant increase in tonnes mined compared to 2011, as a result of a larger mobile fleet and improved equipment availability.
We expect the improvement in both mining and milling rates to continue through 2013.
Gold ounces sold decreased by 23% to 155,322 ounces 200,518 ounces in 2011, falling below production by 6% due to a delay in sales as a result of the back-ended nature of production in the fourth quarter.
Copper production for the year of 6.8 million pounds was 6% lower than in 2011.
This was primarily due to the mining of lower copper grades in 2012.
Cash costs for the year were US$1,087 per ounce sold US$691 in 2011.
Cash costs have been affected by lower production and resultant lower co-product revenue and increased diesel consumption driven by a requirement to self generate electricity.
Increased consumable usage andcontract services costs, due to increased maintenance and repair contractor MARC charges were offset by increased capitalised Key mine statistics stripping costs due to the waste stripping undertaken.

Gold ounces sold amounted to 186,600 ounces for the year, 9% higher than in 2011, due to the increase in production, but trailing production by 3% due to the back-ended nature of production in the fourth quarter of the year.
Head grade of 2.5 g t improved by 19% on 2011, as a result of increased ore tonnes mined and mine grade during the second half of the year, leading to a reduction in mill feed from the lower grade stockpiles.
Recoveries of 85.4% increased 6% on 2011, primarily as a result of the positive impact from the completed gold plant upgrade.
We focused on the continuation of the substantial waste stripping programme in both the Gokona and Nyabirama pits throughout the year in order to open up higher grade zones for future years.
Mining in the Gokona pit was adversely impacted by delays in the issuing of PAF waste dumping permits during the first half of the year, and delays in relocating villagers surrounding the Nyabirama pit led to the suspension of mining inthe pit from the second quarter.
As a result, total tonnes mined of 18.4 million tonnes were 16% lower than in 2011.
Ore tonnes mined amounted to 1.7 million tonnes, a reduction of 24% on 2011 2.3 million tonnes.

com Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Tulawaka Operating performance Tulawakas attributable gold production for the year was 31,028 ounces, compared to 58,871 ounces in 2011.
The decreased gold production levelresulted from lower mined grade from underground stopes and theapplication of batch milling in order to drive plant efficiencies.
Gold ounces sold were broadly in line with production.
Cash costs for the year were US$1,269 per ounce sold, compared toUS$727 in 2011.
This cost increase was mainly due to the lower production base and the impact of lower capitalised mining.
These were slightly offset by lower sales related costs due to lower sales ounces.
Cash cost per tonne milled increased to US$219 in 2012 US$146 in 2011, primarily as a result of a lower mill throughput due to the batch millingcampaign.
Capital expenditure for the year of US$24.6 million was 22% lower than in2011 US$31.7 million.
Key capital expenditure for 2012 included: capitalised exploration drilling and underground development costs US$10.2 million, relating to mine life extension evaluations: and infrastructure investments into the tailings storage facility, security and accommodation US$4.2 million, which will form part of the closure plan.
Included in capital expenditure is a non-cash reclamation adjustment which amounted to US$1.3 million.
