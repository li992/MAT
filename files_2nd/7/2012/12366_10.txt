2012 was a 24% remarkable year for the asset, with Gold recovery to concentrate 87% the mine and concentrator achieving expected throughput and recoveries, and a major exploration success during the year which places 205% Albazino in the world class assets league.
As a result, Albazino Gold in concentrate produced: 181 Koz produced more than 180 Koz of gold in concentrate in 2012, and the resource base has doubled compared to the beginning of the -25% year.
In 2013, further improvements in performance are expected as soon Total cash costs, US$ GE oz: 767 as the Amursk POX plant reaches capacity.
On the back of this sizeable resource increase, we are now undertaking a feasibility study for 2.7 Moz Albazino-2 with a view to expanding the mine and concentrator.
