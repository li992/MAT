com 29 Operating review continued Iron Ore In Mauritania, West Africa, Xstrata has interests in three iron ore projects.
The large-scale Guelb el Aouj project, which is a 50 50 joint venture with Socit Nationale Industrielle et Minire SNIM, Mauritanias majority state-owned iron ore producer, is currently in prefeasibility study phase following agreement being reached with SNIM on the project development pathway.
The Lebtheinia resource, located 145 kilometres from the port of Nouadhibou is in concept study phase, while the Askaf project, located 35 kilometres south of Guelb el Aouj is in the final stages of feasibility and the exploitation licence for the project was granted in Q3 2012.
In the Republic of Congo, Xstrata has a 50% plus one share interest in Jumelles Limited BVI in respect to the Zanaga iron ore project.
Prefeasibility studies continued during 2012, building on the prefeasibility study undertaken by Jumelles.
Approval to proceed into feasibility study phase is expected to be sought in 2013.
Significant progress on upgrading the ore resource and reserves in both Mauritania and the Republic of Congo was achieved, with over 12 billion tonnes of JORC resources now declared up from 8.6 billion tonnes in 2011.
