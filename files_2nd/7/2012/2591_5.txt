In 2012, PT Berau recorded a strong operating performance, mining 21.0 mt of coal, an 8.1% increase on 2011, and recording sales of 21.1mt.
The increase in the amount of mined coal was mainly due to increased production in recently opened pits at Sambarata.
PT Beraus average selling price on a free on board basis was $70.9 per tonne for 2012 2011: $81.4 per tonne, reflecting weaker thermal coal prices.
Production cost of sales at PT Berau was $37.8 per tonne 2011: $35.9 per tonne restated.
The increase in the production cost of sales from 2011 was mainly due to increased overburden removal distances leading to increased fuel usage and mining cost, higher fuel prices and a slight increase in the stripping ratio.
The average stripping ratio was slightly higher than last year at 9.6 bcm t 2011: 9.5 bcm t, although this reduced in the fourth quarter to 7.6 bcm t following a revision to the mine plan.
