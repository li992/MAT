To ensure a fair comparison of 2012 performance, 2011 direct costs have been restated with an equivalent offsetting increase in recharges to divisions.
during 2012, direct costs have fallen by 130 million 4 per cent driven by simplification savings and the continued focus on cost management which more than offset inflationary rises and incremental costs from Group investment projects.
Group Operations continues to play a major part in leading the delivery of the programme as well as through initiatives to improve sourcing, re-engineer end-to-end process, and consolidate and rationalise property and iT.
We are continuing to optimise our demand management, simplify specifications and strengthen our supplier relationships.
We have reduced the number of suppliers to the Group from just over 18,000 at the start of the programme to around 10,500: while further concentrating our expenditure within our top tier of suppliers.
We have also introduced a number of efficiencies across our iT estate including the rationalisation of servers and storage devices and the optimisation of licence arrangements, with iT costs falling by 2 per cent after absorbing increased costs from delivering Group strategic initiatives which deliver income and cost benefits in other divisions.
Operations costs decreased by 9 per cent through the continuing rationalisation of our major Operations functions.
We have delivered a number of significant improvements to our core processes and are seeing the benefits come through in terms of improved customer experience and reduced complaints.
These include re-engineering our account switching and closure processes: streamlining our commercial lending process: and a quicker General insurance claims experience with dedicated advisers managing claims end-to-end.
Group Property costs decreased by 3 per cent as we continued to consolidate the Groups property portfolio: as well as having set up a number of specialist operations centres of excellence and successfully outsourced our property facilities and asset management services.
cEnTRAl iTEMs 2012 2011 m m Total underlying expense income 132 339 Total costs 251 259 impairment 1 3 Underlying loss profit 384 77 Total underlying income largely reflects the net impact of items not recharged by the Groups corporate Treasury to the divisions.
The reduction in income in 2012 is partly due to the retention in the centre of expense items relating to certain risk and balance sheet management actions, including the run-off of prior year actions.
Total costs include the costs of certain central and head office functions and corporate costs such as the Financial services compensation scheme charge and the Bank levy.
