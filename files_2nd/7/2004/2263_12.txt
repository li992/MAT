OPERATING REVIEW Introduction The Groups results are prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and comply with UK Companies Act requirements.
While the UK GAAP reporting basis provides the core information for users of this report and accounts to understand the financial performance of the Group, management believes that users will be assisted in understanding the performance relative to previous periods by presenting the results in an alternative manner.
This presentation isolates the impact of currency movements from year to year and eliminates the impact of exceptional or non-recurring items.
This is consistent with the basis used by management to measure performance of the business and is a component of variable compensation plans.
The elements of this alternative presentation are described in more detail below.
Impact of currency movements The Group has operations in some 50 countries around the world and the majority of its profit is generated outside the UK.
Results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange against sterling for the year.
Changes in such rates from year to year can significantly affect the Groups results when these are presented in pounds sterling.
In some cases, such changes may make it difficult to understand underlying business performance trends without providing additional information.
For example, the average value of the South African rand to pounds sterling changed by ten per cent in 2004 compared with 2003.
When looking at the financial performance of the Afrox hospitals business segment in 2004, it is therefore important to highlight this currency impact to users of the information.
Consequently, management has for many years monitored business performance on a constant currency basis.
This basis eliminates the impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into sterling by retranslating the results of the comparative year at the rates of exchange used in the current year.
This is the basis for all internal management reporting throughout the year.
In this operating review, the comparison of financial performance between years may in places be referred to as on this constant currency basis.
Comments on all segmental performance are on a constant currency basis.
The impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into sterling is shown in the table below.
This enables users of the information to have a better understanding of underlying business performance.
Examples of such items in 2004 include the loss on disposal of the packaged gas business in the US, costs relating to the subsequent restructuring of the remaining US business and charges relating to the integration process in Japan that began in 2003 following the merger of the industrial and medical gases businesses there of BOC and Air Liquide to form Japan Air Gases.
Included in 2003 was a litigation settlement expense, the costs of the business initiative programme announced in August 2001, other restructuring programmes and charges relating to the integration in Japan.
34 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review Exceptional items include those items classified as both operating and non-operating under UK GAAP.
The review of results excluding exceptional items is part of the normal internal management reporting process.
The growth in operating profit excluding exceptional items is also one of the measures used in the variable element of the senior management compensation scheme.
Further information regarding the exceptional items is given in the financial review on page 49.
An analysis of all operating and non-operating exceptional items is given in note 2 b to the financial statements on page 89.
In this review, the adjustments to eliminate exceptional items have been made to operating profit both Group and by segment, profit before tax and earnings per share.
Exceptional items are commented on in the Group results section as well as in the individual business segments to which they relate.
A reconciliation of these adjusted items to the equivalent UK GAAP measure is shown in the profit and loss account on page 78.
When any results or measures used in this review have been adjusted to exclude exceptional items, they are referred to as adjusted.
Within the individual business segments of the operating review, operating exceptional items are commented on separately.
Comments on other aspects of financial trends and performance are based on adjusted operating profit.
This provides more meaningful comment on underlying business performance.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to operating profit is given in the table below.

Adjusted return on capital employed removes exceptional items from the measure of operating profit used in the calculation.
Adjusted return on capital employed is used by management for reasons similar to those described above.
A reconciliation of these two measures is shown below.

ROCE is operating profit as a percentage of the average capital employed excluding net pension liabilities.
Average capital employed and ROCE for 2003 and 2002 have been restated following the application of UK GAAP UITF37 and UITF38 in 2004 see note 31 to the financial statements.
The Group commentary in this review also comments on free cash flow.
Free cash flow is a measure often referred to by BOC management and other users of financial information to highlight the cash flow available from underlying ongoing business operations before acquisition and disposal activity.
Whether or not this remains positive over time is an indicator that dividends to shareholders are being paid out of cash generated by existing Group businesses.
As such it is a useful additional measure of financial performance.
A reconciliation of this measure to the nearest equivalent UK GAAP measure, net cash flow, is shown below.
2003 2002 2004 restated restated million million million Free cash flow 257.9 141.8 166.5 Exceptional cash items 11.9 28.3 67.3 Acquisitions and disposals 92.5 118.3 215.5 Other items within capital expenditure and financial investment: Purchases of intangible fixed assets 0.2 1.2 0.1 Net purchases sales of current asset investments 0.9 16.6 4.3 Purchases of trade and other investments 3.8 3.3 19.7 Sales of trade and other investments 5.6 5.3 0.9 Net cash inflow outflow before use of liquid resources and financing 339.2 12.6 130.9 35 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 OPERATING REVIEW COMPARING 2004 WITH 2003 Turnover, including share of joint Group ventures and associates Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was 4,599.3 million in 2004, up six per cent million compared with 4,323.2 million in 2003.
Operating profit was 559.5 million, up 28 per cent compared with 438.6 million in 2003.
After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling 92.0 million and 5,000 net interest and other financing items of 72.6 million, profit before tax was 412.3 million, up 17 per cent 4,000 compared with 351.9 million in 2003.
Earnings per share were 53.5p, up 20 per cent compared with 44.5p in 3,000 2003.
Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was 576.9 million, adjusted profit before tax was 504.3 million and adjusted earnings per share were 63.2p.
2,000 Comparisons with 2003 are affected by exchange rate movements.
For the currencies that principally affect 1,000 the Group's results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse.
If the results of a year ago had been translated at the 0 02 03 04 rates applied to this year, turnover would have been reduced by 88.8 million.
There would have been an increase in operating profit of 3.3 million and a decrease in adjusted operating profit of 2.2 million.
Adjusted profit before Profit before tax tax would have been 2.9 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.2p lower.
The table set out below summarises results reported both under UK GAAP and as adjusted.
Results for million 2003 are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.
A reconciliation of turnover, operating profit and adjusted operating profit for 2003 at 2003 and at 2004 rates of exchange is shown on page 34.
A reconciliation of adjusted results with UK GAAP results is shown on page 35 and in the profit and loss account on page 78.
Exceptional items in 2004 amounted to a charge of 92.0 million.
This comprised a loss of 79.5 million on disposal of the US packaged gas business, a charge of 14.8 million for restructuring the remaining business in the US following the disposal, a charge of 2.6 million relating to the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan, and a profit of 4.9 million on the disposal of fixed assets.
Exceptional items in 2003 comprised 43.2 million for a litigation settlement, costs of 15.5 million for completion of restructuring programmes and 8.3 million relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 15.4 per cent.
Return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 14.9 per cent.
Free cash flow as defined on page 35 was 257.9 million in 2004.
Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including exceptional cash items, was 339.2 million in 2004.
A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 35.
A first interim dividend for 2004 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2004 and a second interim dividend of 24.5p per share was paid in August 2004.
In aggregate this was a 2.6 per cent increase over the annual dividend of the previous year.
A first interim dividend for 2005 of 15.9p per share has been declared for payment in February 2005.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries including interest capitalised was 256.1 million in 2004, compared with 281.2 million in 2003.
This was covered by cash inflow from operating activities.
Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was 109.0 million in 2004, of which the BOC share was 49.2 million.
Equivalent expenditure in 2003 was 81.4 million, of which the BOC share was 36.1 million.
The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of 50.9 million in 2004 and proceeds from disposals were 98.3 million.
Equivalent items in 2003 were 135.5 million and 3.9 million respectively.

All comments below are on a constant currency basis.
Increased turnover reflected strong demand worldwide for both steel and non-ferrous metals.
In addition, sales from new production facilities accounted for approximately 14 million of the increase in turnover between 2003 and 2004.
The principal facilities coming into production in 2003 and 2004 were hydrogen and carbon monoxide plants supplying TPCC at Map Ta Phut, Thailand, and Citgos refinery at Lemont, Illinois.
Metal production increased in 2004 and world metal prices firmed as a result of strong demand from China.
This benefited BOCs steel and non-ferrous metal customers in all the key markets throughout the year.
For 2004 as a whole, the food sector was buoyant outside the US despite the temporary consequences of avian flu in Asia and the imposition of US import tariffs on prawns.
In October 2004, a new plant to produce beverage grade carbon dioxide was commissioned in Pakistan to satisfy growing demand for carbonated drinks.
36 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 The recovery in the electronics packaging industry created exceptionally strong demand for industrial gases in the electronics packaging sector.
BOC was a leading beneficiary of this because of its strong position in Asian markets.
The EcoSnow business that was acquired in 2003 performed strongly in 2004 and contributed to the growth of the PGS business in the electronics packaging sector.
Several significant new supply scheme contracts were won in 2004.
BOCs hydrogen business with refiners will be substantially increased with a new plant to supply both a Sunoco refinery at Toledo, Ohio, and a nearby BP refinery.
The hydrogen will be used by both BP and Sunoco in the production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline and diesel fuels.
The complex will be capable of supplying over 120 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen.
BOCs partner for engineering and construction is Linde BOC Process Plants of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
BOC is investing more than US$100 million in the facility, which is currently scheduled to be completed early in 2006.
Outside the US, significant new business in the chemical sector was won with the Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company.
BOC will form a joint venture to invest in existing assets and then add further air separation capacity.
BOCs subsidiary in Thailand is to invest in a venture establishing a 1,300 tonnes-a-day plant to supply TOC Glycol Co. Ltd. TOCGC in Map Ta Phut and to increase merchant capacity in the area.
When completed early in 2006, this will be the largest air separation unit in Thailand.
It will be owned and operated by a joint venture between BOCs Thai subsidiary TIG and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company.
New business with steel customers was mainly concentrated in Asia.
In January 2004, BOC announced that its joint venture with the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company TISCO would expand its existing 1,500 tonnes-a-day capacity with the construction of two new 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation units.
TISCO is already the largest stainless steel producer in China and its expansion to a capacity of 900,000 tonnes a year will make it one of the biggest in the world.
In Chinas Pearl River delta, BOCs associated company is to expand capacity to supply the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Company and is also adding new air separation capacity to supply the Zhujiang Iron & Steel Corporation.
In the UK, BOC supplies Corus at its Port Talbot, Scunthorpe, Rotherham and Redcar plants.
BOC is to increase its industrial gases supply to the Port Talbot strip products plant by 30 per cent to increase steel production locally.
Selling prices were generally firm during 2004 and sufficient to offset input cost inflation except in parts of north Asia.
Increases in fuel and power costs taking effect at the end of 2004 will require further selling price increases to maintain margins.
The expiry of a fixed term contract in the UK will cause a particularly sharp increase in UK power costs in 2005.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.
Europe Turnover increased in all parts of Europe except for Ireland.
Adjusted operating profit increased significantly, mainly as a result of more efficient plant operation and careful control of costs.
In the UK, manufacturing activity remained generally weak but customer closures and relocations that had affected business in 2003 were less evident in 2004.
Rising steel production led to increased demands for oxygen.
The reorganisation of steel processing at Corus will lead to a 30 per cent increase in gases supply for steel production at Port Talbot from the end of 2005.
A new operations centre was established in Poland during 2004 and adjusted operating profit increased through efficiency savings derived from better operational control.
Cost savings following the outsourcing of carbon dioxide distribution also led to increased adjusted operating profit in Ireland.
Price increases were generally sufficient to cover higher input costs in 2004.
Further increases are being implemented in 2005 to cover sharply higher electricity prices in the UK following the expiry of a fixed price supply contract.
Cryostar manufactures cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas LNG tankers.
As in 2003, turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 principally as a result of demand for shipboard compression units on LNG tankers and following continued investments for gases plants in Asia.
North America Turnover increased as a result of including a full year of syngas production for Celanese at Clear Lake, Texas and the start-up of a new plant supplying hydrogen to Citgos refinery at Lemont, Illinois, in October 2003.
Adjusted operating profit was lower as a result of reduced carbon dioxide volumes to our food and dry ice customers, and reduced argon demand from the stainless steel and wholesale sectors.
In general, demand for industrial gases from steel customers was strong in 2004.
Liquid nitrogen volumes for food freezing applications strengthened during the year, mitigating the reduced carbon dioxide volumes into this sector.
BOCs carbon dioxide business with beverage customers continued to make good progress in 2004 and new business was won.
Selling prices remained generally firm and significant increases in fuel and energy costs were largely recovered with surcharges or general price rises.
Latin America Revenues increased across the region during 2004, although business in Venezuela continued to be affected by political uncertainty.
In Brazil, BOCs new 400 tonnes-a-day plant entered production serving CST, the worlds biggest producer of slab steel.
The benefits of re-pressurising the Pemex Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico with nitrogen from BOCs joint venture company continued to be realised during the year.
Pemex attributes an increase of some 600 thousand barrels a day in oil production to the nitrogen injection.
Plant reliability was further improved during 2004 leading to some increase in supply.
In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energys 30 per cent ownership interest in the joint venture company for US$59.7 million in cash.
This increased BOCs overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in September 2004.
37 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 Africa Turnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further improved by cost savings and firm pricing trends leading to better margins.
Although the stronger rand adversely affected platinum and gold mining in 2004, strong demand and firmer prices led to increased activity in the steel industry.
New business was obtained for carbon dioxide in the beverage sector and for the use of oxygen in the fide-lignification of wood pulp.
Japan The combination of BOCs and Air Liquides industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan took effect from January 2003.
This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit for BOCs three lines of business between 2004 and 2003 and with earlier years.
The results of Japan Air Gases were consolidated on an equity basis throughout 2004 and for the last three quarters of 2003.
In 2004 turnover increased mainly as a result of equipment sales and adjusted operating profit increased faster as a result of achieving integration cost savings as planned.
North Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 but at a more modest pace than in 2003.
Production plants across the region were almost fully utilized and little new capacity came on stream in 2004.
However a number of new plants will add significantly to production within the next 12 months.
In China, turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in line with economic trends but further growth was constrained by available production capacity and by some unplanned shutdowns, mainly at customers plants.
Management expects that new production capacity to be added over the next 12 months will more than double BOCs capacity in China.
Four large air separation plants are under construction to supply petrochemical and steel customers and a further five nitrogen generators will supply a variety of customers in the electronics and metals markets.
In addition to the expansions at Taiyuan and Nanjing covered in the operating review last year, BOC has more recently announced a new joint venture with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited SPC, a subsidiary of Sinopec Corporation, to meet the industrial gases needs of SPC in the Jinshan District of Shanghai.
The joint venture expects to invest in the production of nearly 3,000 tonnes a day of air separation capacity initially through the acquisition of SPCs existing industrial gases assets followed by the construction of a new world-scale air separation unit ASU.
This will support SPCs fast growing petrochemical business and those of additional customers in the area.
The Jinshan District is one of the major areas of petrochemical investment in China and, aside from the SPC complex, includes the nearby Shanghai Industrial Chemical Park, where a number of global and local chemical companies are located.
Economic conditions were stable in Korea but increased turnover and adjusted operating profit came from some additional argon and hydrogen capacity to supply customers near Pohang.
The relocation of labour-intensive manufacturing from Taiwan to mainland China that had provided a difficult economic background in 2003 slowed in 2004.
Turnover increased as a result of full capacity utilization but adjusted operating profit increased significantly as a result of improved efficiency in plant operations.
Hong Kong also enjoyed a better economic climate in 2004 for the same reasons and adjusted operating profit was sharply better.
South and South East Asia These regions came under the same business unit management during 2004.
The economies continued to be buoyant across both regions during the year, helped by generally strong steel demand and a more active electronics industry in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.
The major market sectors for PGS across the region are steel, petrochemicals and the food industry.
The SARS infection that had adversely affected 2003 was no longer an issue in 2004 but in Thailand and Malaysia the food sector was hit by an outbreak of avian flu.
The Thai shrimp industry was further affected by the imposition of US tariffs on imports but some recent relaxation of these should lead to better conditions in 2005.
During 2004, BOC began to manufacture food-freezing equipment in Thailand.
Turnover increased in 2004 and adjusted operating profit was significantly better with improved margins arising from business efficiency and productivity gains.
Additional carbon dioxide capacity was added to serve beverage industry customers in Pakistan in October 2004.
Although there were few new petrochemical projects started in 2004, demand for industrial gases increased as a result of fide-bottlenecking existing facilities.
In September 2004, BOCs subsidiary in Thailand announced a major investment in new joint venture air separation capacity to supply oxygen for ethylene glycol production and to increase the availability of products for sale in the expanding merchant market around Map Ta Phut.
During 2005 additional air separation capacity will be added at Hyderabad by BOCs Indian subsidiary to support growing demand for merchant products in the area.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit were higher than a year ago.
The Australian and New Zealand economies remained generally strong in 2004.
The strength of local currencies led to some further customer plant closures but firm commodity prices for minerals and particularly for steel enabled leading customers to prosper.
There was some increase in tonnage volumes but volumes overall were similar to a year ago.
Electricity prices increased in eastern Australia and more so in New Zealand.
Increased costs were passed through to tonnage customers and progressively recovered in the merchant markets.
At the same time, BOCs major plants in Australia achieved significant cost savings as a result of implementing a global plant optimisation programme.
During 2004 BOC outsourced the transport of its bulk products to Australias leading transport company, while retaining control of distribution and scheduling.
This change was made only after ensuring that there would be no diminution of safety standards or the quality of service to customers.
A hydrogen purification plant and bus re-fuelling facility to support BP in the Government of Western Australias environmentally friendly fuel cell bus trial came into operation during September 2004.
Three hydrogenfuelled buses will be operating in the city of Perth.
The trial is to continue for at least the next two years.
38 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 Water services BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation EMC, a US water services company in October 2002.
Turnover increased modestly in 2004 but the business remained close to break-even after the amortisation of goodwill as a result of planned costs to increase business development resources.
BOCs strategy for water services is to focus on its industrial customers.
Significant new business was won during 2004, including a multi-year contract for process and waste water services to a major US beef producer.
Tightening regulations for proteins in effluent seem likely to create fresh demands for water treatment in the food industry.
Industrial and Special Products ISP Change 1 on 2003 2004 Change constant million on 2003 currency Turnover 1,782.3 2% 3% Operating profit 253.9 7% 5% 2 Adjusted operating profit 269.5 11% 10% 1.
Nearly all regions delivered better results in 2004 with increased turnover in most countries and an overall improvement in operating margin.
Robust economic conditions supported a further improvement in the south Pacific region and Africa delivered better results despite the handicap of the stronger currency on manufacturing and mining.
There was also some improvement in the US manufacturing economy.
At the same time further progress was made in successfully integrating the businesses recently acquired in Canada and Poland.
Sales to the medical sector grew further in 2004 as a result of both gases and liquid helium sales.
Heliox, a new low-density breathing mixture was introduced in the UK and in Australia.
This product enables patients with obstructed airways to breathe more easily and thereby provides time to treat the underlying problems.
Helium is also used to cool the coils of superconducting magnets in MRI scanners.
BOC not only sells the liquid nitrogen and helium cryogens but offers a related CryoFill service, taking responsibility for filling customers magnets.
Helium sales also increased in Taiwan, Thailand and China, where significant growth potential has been identified and where an important distributor agreement was signed with Meike.
The cost of producing and purchasing helium continued to increase rapidly during 2004 but BOC was largely successful in recovering higher costs in selling prices to customers.
BOC installed helium recovery systems at the University of Liverpool in the UK and at Trane in the US during 2004.
Consistent progress was made in growing refrigerant sales.
The alliance with Hudson Technologies for the reclaim of contaminated refrigerants began operation in the UK during 2004 and will be applied in South Africa in 2005.
BOCs major liquefied petroleum gas LPG businesses in Australia and South Africa were notably successful in managing volatile input costs and sustaining margins during 2004 as LPG prices increased sharply.
Sales of industrial products increased in aggregate although some developed markets continued to reflect weak manufacturing activity.
Business development was helped by upgrading the retail environment of outlets in some major markets and by the continued introduction of safety products to the markets in the UK, Australia and South Africa.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003, as well as for the restructuring of the ISP business in the US following the disposal of the packaged gas business.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased further in 2004.
Manufacturing activity continued to decline in the UK but BOC maintained a strong position in the market.
Improved service levels enabled selling price increases to be implemented.
At the same time costs were reduced through improved productivity.
Modest increases in industrial product sales were helped by rejuvenation of retail outlets in the UK.
Medical product sales increased as a result of gaining additional National Health Service business and continued demand for lightweight oxygen cylinders.
The range of lightweight cylinders will be expanded by introducing additional sizes during 2005.
Changes in the provision of domiciliary oxygen in England and Wales are to be implemented by the National Health Service during 2005.
A single contractor will be chosen in each one of 11 regions to supply all forms of domiciliary oxygen to patients.
BOC currently has a leading share of the cylinder oxygen business but is a minor supplier of oxygen concentrators.
The new business supplying helium to Oxford Magnet Technology for medical imaging devices began in 2003 and performed well throughout 2004.
It was also the first full year of the refrigerant reclaim service in the UK, based on an exclusive global licence with Hudson Technologies.
A range of gases for scientific applications was introduced during the year and some additional sales were generated following the launch of a mail order catalogue for gases and related products.
BOCs Sureflow beverage dispense gas operation was expanded by new business for Heineken outlets in Ireland during 2004.
BOCs business in Poland was enlarged from February 2003 with the acquisition of Praxairs Polish business.
2004 was therefore the first full year of the expanded business and there were further integration benefits.
North America The BOC Group announced on 27 January 2004 that it had signed a letter of intent to sell its US packaged gas business to Airgas.
This business had turnover of approximately US$240 million in 2003.
The disposal was completed on 30 July 2004 upon receipt of initial cash proceeds of US$175 million.
39 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 Following this transaction, the ISP business in north America consists of bulk medical gases, bulk supplies to distributors, tube trailer and liquefied helium in the US as well as the Canadian packaged gas business.
In total these elements currently generate turnover of some US$450 million a year.
The impending disposal of the US packaged gas business created a challenging business environment for a significant part of the year.
US sales volumes and adjusted operating profit were lower in the period prior to the disposal.
Turnover increased in Canada principally as a result of the acquisition of Air Products Canadian gases and related products business with effect from April 2003.
Cost synergies arising from the integration further boosted adjusted operating profit in 2004.
Latin America Turnover increased significantly and margins improved.
Growth across the region was driven principally by sales of medical products supplemented by sales of BOC-branded cutting and welding equipment.
Sales of packaged chemicals increased in Colombia and Venezuela.
Results improved strongly in Venezuela, despite a continuation of political unrest.
BOCs associated company achieved better results in Chile but there was a sharper improvement in Argentina.
Selling price increases offset inflation in Venezuela and Chile but the trends were less favourable in Colombia during 2004.
A new customer service centre was opened in Venezuela and new business systems were successfully implemented in Venezuela and Colombia during the year.
Africa Important sections of South African industry were depressed during 2004 because of the stronger currency.
Rand exchange rates reduced the profitability of gold mining and manufacturing for export in particular.
At the same time the cost of imported goods was lowered making them more competitive with those manufactured locally.
However lower interest rates began to stimulate domestic consumption towards the end of the year.
Despite the more difficult market conditions, adjusted operating profit improved significantly on the basis of a modest improvement in turnover.
Margins improved as a result of better productivity and operating efficiency, partly offset by increased transport costs arising from the temporary shutdown of some key supplier facilities.
Sales of cutting and welding products increased in South Africa and so did both the sales volume and the turnover of liquefied petroleum gas LPG.
Turnover of special products, including refrigerants, grew particularly rapidly.
Export sales of welding products manufactured by Afrox, BOCs South African subsidiary, also increased significantly.
There was a modest improvement in adjusted operating profit despite the currency disadvantage.
Sales of the AfroxPac emergency oxygen kit for underground miners were substantially lower in 2004 as order intake reflected weak activity in the gold mining sector.
During 2005 the Afrox refrigerants business is projected to expand by offering a service to recover and reclaim the contents of customers refrigeration plant.
This service will be provided on-site if required and will be based on technology that is the subject of BOCs global alliance with Hudson Technologies.
A programme to renovate the Afrox retail network in South Africa with the development of a number of Gas & Gear outlets and a range of safety products is under way.
In addition a range of diving gases and a fire suppression product have been launched in South Africa.
Good progress was made in growing both turnover and adjusted operating profit in the other southern African countries during 2004.
A new carbon dioxide plant supported growth in Nigeria.
Japan The basis of accounting for BOCs business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Full details can be seen in the PGS section on page 38.
In 2004 ISPs turnover in Japan was slightly less than the previous year but adjusted operating profit was higher through cost savings following the merger and from some asset disposals.
In aggregate there were modest improvements in both turnover and adjusted operating profit.
In Taiwan, buoyant activity in manufacturing and infrastructure development was reflected in higher turnover and adjusted operating profit.
There were also sharply better results from the industrial products business in Thailand but ammonia margins were under strong competitive pressure and liquefied petroleum gas LPG selling prices remained subject to restrictive regulation.
Hong Kong continued to be affected by the migration of manufacturing to mainland China and in Singapore shipbuilding and construction activity failed to improve in 2004.
Competition intensified in the Malaysian market for industrial gases.
Demand for helium was strong throughout Asia.
In south Asia, turnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further boosted by an asset disposal.
Trading conditions in Bangladesh were adversely affected by a combination of political uncertainty, strikes and floods.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 and margins were improved by holding down costs.
The economic environment remained favourable across the region.
Manufacturing activity was buoyant in Australia despite a challenging environment for export-oriented manufacturers created by the stronger currency.
New projects in the oil and gas sector and in mining generated increased demand for welding and safety products.
During 2004 BOC secured major contracts with Western Mining to meet its requirements for safety products across Australia.
The economy also continued to grow in New Zealand but somewhat less rapidly than in Australia.
There was also an improvement in the Pacific Islands, while gold mining activity and oil refining investment led to increased business in Papua New Guinea.
Major initiatives in 2004 included an agreement with the Australian CSIRO to commercialise ethanedinitrile, a gas that can be used to sterilize soil and timber, and which management believes has significant potential.
The acquisition of OccCorp, an injury management provider, gives BOC entry to a largely untapped market by combining BOCs safety services and products.
40 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 A dedicated refrigerant reclaim fleet was established to help customers comply with new refrigeration regulations that make it mandatory to recover, return and safely dispose of hydrofluorocarbons.
BOCs new Heliox gas mixture, which helps the treatment of patients with airway obstructions, and Inhalo, the new lightweight cylinder, were both successfully launched into the medical market.
BOC commenced an extensive redevelopment program of its Gas & Gear stores, supporting traditional industrial customers and new customers alike, giving a stronger retail position, providing better visibility, higher traffic flow, attractive merchandising and design.
The price of liquefied petroleum gas LPG was particularly volatile during 2004.
BOCs associated company in Australia, Elgas, was notably successful in preserving sales margins in these difficult circumstances and adjusted operating profit was increased.
Elgas expanded through the acquisition of a leisure gas business during the year.
The potential impact of Government plans to remove an excise tax exemption for automobile gas in the period from 2008 to 2012 was softened by a subsequent decision to delay the introduction by three years and by an agreement to provide capital allowances to encourage car owners to convert their vehicles to use LPG fuel.
Automobile gas is a minor part of Elgas turnover.
BOC Edwards Change 1 on 2003 2004 Change constant million on 2003 currency Turnover 816.5 19% 27% Operating profit 46.8 492% 588% 2 Adjusted operating profit 47.8 158% 181% 1.
Conditions improved in most of BOC Edwards key markets during 2004.
Orders for semiconductor equipment began to pick up in the first quarter leading to increased sales in subsequent quarters.
At the same time a major expansion of liquid crystal display flat panel manufacturing facilities got under way.
This provided fresh business opportunities for both gases and equipment.
Sales of chemical management equipment for new semiconductor fabrication plants improved only slightly and profitability continued to be affected by competitive market conditions.
Demand for scientific equipment vacuum systems and for pharmaceutical packaging machines was better in 2004 but sales of vacuum systems for aerospace metallurgy applications remained at a low level.
At the beginning of 2004, high levels of capacity utilization encouraged a number of semiconductor manufacturers to add fresh capacity or upgrade existing facilities.
This led to increased orders, which were reflected in higher turnover and adjusted operating profit from the second quarter onwards.
BOC Edwards was successful in winning new equipment business with the majority of semiconductor fabrication facilities for which construction began in 2004.
These included several investments in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, China, Europe and the US.
New pumping and exhaust systems were introduced for semiconductor, flat panel display and other vacuum applications.
A new range of iGX pumps for the semiconductor industry provides better control and monitoring capabilities and use less power than before.
BOC Edwards also launched high capacity pumps of its own design and manufacture for flat panel applications.
New turbomolecular and scroll pumps were designed for scientific instrumentation.
Wet chemical abatement systems were introduced to expand and complement the capabilities of BOC Edwards exhaust abatement systems.
Increased production of semiconductors was reflected in better demand for electronic materials.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride was expanded further in 2004 to over 100 tonnes a year.
New investments in semiconductor facilities also provided opportunities for nitrogen supply contracts.
BOC Edwards has become one of the leading suppliers of bulk gas to the growing semiconductor industry in China and continued to benefit from the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in Taiwan, Japan and Singapore.
New nitrogen generators were installed at several customer sites and further capacity was added to satisfy growing demand from customers within the Hsinchu science park in Taiwan.
Accelerated investment in new flat panel display production facilities led to significant orders for large capacity pumping systems in both Taiwan and Korea.
Gas supply contracts were also signed with a number of display manufacturers in Taiwan and Japan.
Liquid crystal display production leads to substantial demand for chamber cleaning chemicals.
On-site fluorine generation equipment is now installed at a number of semiconductor and flat panel manufacturers.
A full commercial-scale generator is functioning at LG Philips new sixth generation plant in Korea.
Demand for pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging equipment picked up in 2004 leading to better sales and adjusted operating profit.
A new non-contact check-weighing machine was introduced.
Nuclear magnetic resonance technology allows every package to be checked, enables packing lines to operate at higher speeds and facilitates immediate correction of any deviation from specification.
The basis of accounting for BOCs gases business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Electronic gases turnover increased significantly in 2004 as a result of the pick up in the semiconductor industry.
The benefit of increased turnover on gases adjusted operating profit was amplified by synergy benefits arising from the merger.
41 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2004 with 2003 Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services to electronic manufacturers.
These include gases management, chemicals supply, support services and materials logistics.
Other developments included an improved offering of gases and vacuum systems for lithography and supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning technology.
Afrox hospitals Change 1 on 2003 2004 Change constant million on 2003 currency Turnover 432.1 22% 9% Operating profit 59.8 30% 16% 2 Adjusted operating profit 59.8 30% 16% 1.
Adjusted operating profit increased faster than turnover as a result of careful control of overhead costs and positive pricing trends.
Hospital occupancy rates remained similar to a year ago.
Acquisitions were a minor factor in the turnover increase but 2004 was the first full year of ownership for Joint Medical Holdings and the Little Company of Mary hospitals.
During the year Afrox Healthcare increased its holding in the Wilgeheuwel hospital from 28 per cent to 80 per cent and closed down the Cape Anaesthetic and Brackenfield surgery centres in Cape Town.
It also sold its interest in the 123 bed Jan Marais hospital in Cape Town.
The Lifecare chronic care facilities and Afrox occupational health services both delivered a good performance in 2004.
The change to a new reimbursement system that began during 2003 was completed in 2004.
The previous system of paying health care providers a fee for their services changed to a fixed payment for each kind of procedure as well as a per-day tariff structure.
Legislative changes in South Africa may have a limited and as yet uncertain impact on the Afrox hospitals segment.
A certificate of need will be required to licence health care facilities in the future to prevent oversupply in particular areas but Afrox hospitals have been exempted for at least 20 years on the basis of current utilisation.
Corporate ownership of hospital and retail pharmacies is now allowed and the vast majority of Afrox facilities have now been registered accordingly.
On the other hand, corporate control of pathology services may be prohibited in the future.
Afrox Healthcare has minority interests in a number of pathology facilities.
In July 2003 African Oxygen Limited Afrox announced that it was in the process of considering its strategic options with regard to its shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited.
On 17 November 2003, Afrox announced that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment investors.
In April 2004, the South African Competition Commission advised that the transaction should be approved subject to certain conditions, which were acceptable to both the buyers and the seller.
The sale remains subject to approval by the South African Competition Tribunal, at which closing hearings are currently scheduled for March 2005.
In addition an application has been brought in the South African High Court by two shareholders in Afrox Healthcare Limited to have the Scheme of Arrangement, by which the disposal would be implemented, declared to have lapsed.
This application, which is being opposed, is currently due to be heard in the week commencing 29 November 2004.
Gist Change 1 on 2003 2004 Change constant million on 2003 currency Turnover 293.2 no change 1% Operating profit 25.1 14% 14% 2 Adjusted operating profit 25.1 14% 14% 1.
The comparison of turnover and adjusted operating profit between 2003 and 2004 is distorted by a non-recurrent item during 2003.
In 2003 a gain of some 4.1 million arising principally from the termination of operations for the Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business was credited to adjusted operating profit.
The termination of this business also eliminated some 26 million of turnover in 2004 compared with 2003.
After adjusting for this item, underlying turnover grew principally as a result of increased food business for Marks & Spencer, as well as new contracts and the expansion of activity with Ocado and Carlsberg UK.
On the same basis, adjusted operating profit in 2004 was at a similar level to 2003.
A slowdown in the previous trend towards outsourcing logistics operations was a factor in pricing pressures in UK distribution and so were dislocations arising from recent consolidation in the industry.
During 2004 Gist became the logistics partner for Intergreen, the Dutch flower producer, transporting horticultural products between the Netherlands and the UK.
This, and new business with regional produce suppliers, led to a doubling of activity at Gists Lincolnshire depot.
Primary food distribution operations were also expanded in 2004 when Gist took on the transport operations of John Rannoch foods, one of the leading suppliers of poultry products to Marks & Spencer.
Gist manages the complex supply chain for all of Marks & Spencers chilled and ambient foods.
During 2004, a major investment was made to expand a chilled food facility in Kent to meet the demands of the growing network of M&S Simply Food stores.
42 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 OPERATING REVIEW COMPARING 2003 WITH 2002 Group Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was 4,323.2 million in 2003, up eight per cent compared with 4,017.9 million in 2002.
Operating profit was 438.6 million, up three per cent compared with 425.6 million in 2002.
After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling 67.0 million and net interest and other financing items of 86.7 million, profit before tax was 351.9 million, up five per cent compared with 335.3 million in 2002.
Earnings per share were 44.5p, up seven per cent compared with 41.4p in 2002.
Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was 505.6 million, adjusted profit before tax was 418.9 million and adjusted earnings per share were 52.9p.
Comparisons with 2002 were affected by exchange rate movements.
For the currencies that principally affect the Groups results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse.
If the results of 2002 had been translated at the rates applied to 2003, turnover would have been reduced by 39.0 million.
There would have been an increase in operating profit of 0.8 million and adjusted operating profit would have been unchanged.
Adjusted profit before tax would have been 5.3 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.3p higher.
Results for 2002 are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.
2002 at 2003 1 2003 2002 exchange rates Turnover including share of joint ventures and associates million 4,323.2 4,017.9 3,978.9 Operating profit million 438.6 425.6 426.4 2 Adjusted operating profit million 505.6 500.1 500.1 Profit before tax million 351.9 335.3 342.8 2 Adjusted profit before tax million 418.9 430.0 435.3 Earnings per share 44.5p 41.4p 41.9p 2 Adjusted earnings per share 52.9p 55.9p 56.2p 1.
A reconciliation of turnover, operating profit and adjusted operating profit for 2002 at 2002 and at 2003 rates of exchange is shown on page 34.
Exceptional items in 2003 amounted to a charge of 67.0 million.
This comprised 43.2 million for a litigation settlement, costs of 15.5 million for completion of restructuring programmes and 8.3 million relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan.
Exceptional items in 2002 included restructuring charges of 47.2 million and a 21.3 million charge relating to the closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOC Process Plants with Linde Engineering in the US.
An exceptional charge of 21.2 million was made to write down the value of OSK, BOCs gases business in Japan, in advance of the then proposed merger of OSK with part of Air Liquide Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 12.6 per cent.
Return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 10.9 per cent.
Free cash flow as defined on page 35 was 141.8 million in 2003.
Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including exceptional cash items, was 12.6 million in 2003.
A first interim dividend for 2003 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2003 and a second interim dividend of 23.5p per share was paid in August 2003.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries including interest capitalised was 281.2 million in 2003, compared with 354.3 million in 2002.
Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was 81.4 million in 2003, of which the BOC share was 36.1 million.
Equivalent expenditure in 2002 was 74.2 million, of which the BOC share was 34.5 million.
The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of 135.5 million in 2003 and proceeds from disposals were 3.9 million.
Equivalent items in 2002 were 207.3 million and 10.6 million respectively.
Process Gas Solutions PGS Change 1 on 2002 2003 Change constant million on 2002 currency Turnover 1,242.7 4% 8% Operating profit 177.1 10% 15% 2 Adjusted operating profit 184.0 1% 3% 1.
A reconciliation of results for 2002 at 2002 and at 2003 rates of exchange is shown on page 34.
Increased turnover in 2003 resulted from generally firm price trends as well as revenues from acquisitions and new plants serving chemical industry customers.
The additional revenues came principally from BOCs joint venture with Yangtze Petrochemical Corporation YPC at Nanjing, China, from a new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant at Map Ta Phut, Thailand and from the acquisitions of a partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, Texas, and the US water services company, Environmental Management Corporation.
43 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 Improved adjusted operating profit was also a result of operational efficiency gains.
The closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOCs Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US led to lower costs towards the end of 2002 and there was a full year of savings in 2003.
There were also further cost reductions arising from continued progress in delivery scheduling and remote plant operation.
As in 2002, economic uncertainties constrained the authorisation of investment projects by customers during 2003.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant serving Citgos oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois came into production in October 2003 and a new air separation plant was then under construction in Nanjing.
This will supply industrial gases to nearby chemical facilities being completed by a joint venture company established between BASF of Germany and the Chinese chemical company YPC.
Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those that were part of the programme announced in August 2001.
Additionally, there were charges relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in the UK and in Poland in 2003 but declined slightly in Ireland.
A full year of revenues from the plant commissioned in January 2002 to supply hydrogen to Huntsman on Teesside and from the Teesside pipeline system acquired in July 2002 were contributors to increased turnover in the UK.
Despite continued weakness in UK manufacturing, sales volumes increased in the merchant market for liquefied gases and prices were also slightly firmer.
The key factors behind the increase in adjusted operating profit were lower costs in 2003 as a result of restructuring and a charge of 3.6 million in 2002 for an asset write down and debt provision after a steel customer went into receivership.
The relocation of some customers and a general decline in manufacturing activity led to lower sales volumes and adjusted operating profit in Ireland during 2003.
As in the UK, the trend of selling prices remained positive and marginally ahead of inflation.
Business in Poland benefited from stable economic conditions in anticipation of joining the European Union in 2004.
The acquisition of the business of Praxair Polska took effect in February 2003 and added additional air separation capacity as well as BOCs first source of carbon dioxide in the region.
Cryostar is BOCs engineering company based in France, manufacturing cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas LNG tankers.
Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 as a result of strong demand for industrial gas applications in China and for shipboard expansion units on LNG tankers.
North America Despite a small increase in turnover, adjusted operating profit in 2003 was at a similar level to 2002.
Selling price trends were favourable particularly in the second half of the year and were sufficient to offset cost inflation.
Sales volumes were lower as a result of general weakness in manufacturing industries and some business was lost early in 2003 as customers changed to alternative supplies.
At the same time, a significant volume of new liquefied gas business was obtained, mainly in the closing months of the year.
Steel industry customers that had benefited from US tariff protection in the previous year faced renewed competitive pressure in 2003.
Some customers were operating under chapter 11 creditor protection.
Carbon dioxide for beverage applications continued to be in strong demand.
During 2003 BOC improved analytical capabilities to upgrade product quality assurance for its Premier Beverage carbon dioxide service to the soft drinks industry.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, Texas, from Celanese.
Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake.
The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a world scale vinyl acetate monomer plant and the worlds largest acetic acid plant.
These require large quantities of oxygen and nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide.
A new HyCO plant serving Citgos oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois began production in October 2003, further expanding BOCs hydrogen business with a variety of petroleum and chemical industry customers around the world.
Latin America Turnover increased significantly, although growth was held back by a general strike in Venezuela in the period December 2002 to February 2003.
This inevitably affected customers requirements for industrial gases.
Adjusted operating profit also increased because of better sales volumes especially in Chile and Brazil and because of selling price increases that generally exceeded local rates of inflation.
BOCs joint venture company in Mexico supplying high-pressure pure nitrogen to Pemex for pressurising its Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico performed steadily throughout the year.
In September 2003, a new 200 tonnes-a-day air separation unit was commissioned in Santiago to supply oxygen for leaching copper ores.
Another plant was under construction in Brazil to supply oxygen for CST, a steel producer.
Africa Both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003.
Sales volumes were broadly similar but selling prices were higher and cost controls also contributed to better margins.
The focus of business development was on the use of gases in mineral processes in the extraction of precious metals.
Until then the results of OSK, BOCs gases business in Japan, were consolidated as a subsidiary.
Subsequently BOC accounted for its share of turnover and profit of the merged company, Japan Air Gases, on an equity basis.
This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit between 2003 and earlier years for BOCs three lines of business.
On the respective bases used in each year, there was an increase in both turnover and adjusted operating profit for PGS in Japan for 2003.
44 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 The integration process that began in 2003 made good progress.
The two organisations were successfully integrated in the key areas and the number of branch offices was reduced.
Cryogenic equipment manufacturing was integrated into a single location.
North Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit were up significantly in 2003.
Margins improved as a result of better operational efficiency coupled with some price increases.
Turnover gains were largely as a result of growth in north China but there was also growth in mainland south China, Korea and Taiwan.
Turnover was down in Hong Kong as some customers relocated production to mainland China.
Underlying growth of adjusted operating profit in south China was further boosted by additional profit arising from the renegotiation of a power supply contract.
Results in north China benefited from the addition for a full year of the joint venture begun in May 2002 serving the petrochemical industry in Nanjing.
Further liquefaction capacity was added to its existing air separation plant during 2003 to serve the local merchant market.
Results also benefited from strong growth in the steel industry as a result of increasing local demand.
In 2003 construction of a new air separation plant for BOCs joint venture in Nanjing began.
When completed this plant will supply gases to the BASF and Yangtze Petrochemical Company YPC joint venture chemical facility under construction nearby.
South East Asia Economic growth was generally buoyant across the region but Singapore continued to be affected by the migration of electronics and other industries to lower cost countries in Asia.
The outbreak of the SARS infection also curtailed travel and affected business activity.
Economic trends in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia were favourable.
In aggregate, both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased across the region.
Margins improved as a result of operational efficiency gains.
Prices were held down by competitive pressures in Malaysia and Thailand but improved in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Tonnage volumes increased in Malaysia as a result of sales to the steel industry and growing demand from the electronics assembly and food-freezing industries.
Turnover was also boosted by a full year contribution from Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc NIOI which became fully owned by BOCs associated company in Malaysia during September 2002.
Increased turnover in Thailand was based on better underlying demand as well as increased production.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide HyCO plant began production at Map Ta Phut during 2003 and carbon dioxide capacity was doubled with the addition of a new 300 tonnes-a-day plant at Rayong to serve food and beverage customers.
Underlying trends were favourable in both Indonesia and the Philippines but results in the Philippines were adversely affected by the closure of a customers plant.
South Asia Economic growth in India led to better sales of liquefied gases in the merchant market and sustained demand from the steel industry.
A new 225 tonnes-a-day oxygen plant was commissioned in the last quarter of 2003 for the Tata Iron and Steel Company, BOCs principal tonnage customer in the region.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit were slightly higher in 2003 than in 2002 despite adverse business trends in some Australian industries.
The strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2003 had a negative impact on the important minerals sector, which responded by restructuring.
There was also an adverse effect on the food industry.
Volumes of liquefied gas sales in the merchant market were therefore lower.
The Australian steel industry was somewhat less affected and a low cost base enabled it to remain globally competitive.
New business was obtained with BHP in New South Wales.
In January 2003 BOC commenced supplying additional oxygen and nitrogen, following a process upgrade to BOCs Port Kembla facility.
Improved operational efficiencies helped to improve margins in the merchant market.
Centralised plant operation was further extended during 2003 to the control of plants in New Zealand from an operations centre in Australia.
Prices were raised in the merchant market.
Process systems During 2003 BOC continued to benefit from lower costs arising from the combination of its Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US to form the new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
This transaction was completed at the end of September 2002, making Linde Engineering the principal supplier of BOCs industrial gas plants worldwide with access to Lindes global technical capabilities in air separation, hydrogen production and other gas technologies.
2003 was another year of low demand for new industrial gas facilities.
This was particularly so in the developed western economies and business opportunities were principally in the developing economies of the Far East.
Water services In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation EMC, a US water services company with the intention of using a similar business model to that of PGS in developing additional business with industrial customers.
EMC is a management company providing services for steam systems, cold and chilled water systems and wastewater treatment.
Customers include small to medium sized municipalities and industrial customers, many of which are in the food manufacturing sector.
Turnover was on an increasing trend in 2003.
Integration of the business was achieved smoothly but initial integration costs made the business unprofitable in 2003.
45 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 Industrial and Special Products ISP Change 1 on 2002 2003 Change constant million on 2002 currency Turnover 1,751.2 9% 9% Operating profit 238.2 4% 3% 2 Adjusted operating profit 242.7 2% 3% 1.
Good business performances in most markets were offset by a disappointing result in the US.
Market conditions remained depressed in the US and in the UK but there was an overall improvement elsewhere.
Trends were particularly favourable in South Africa and in the south Pacific region during the first half of 2003 but the pace of growth slowed later in the year as a result of exchange rate movements, which affected exporting industries.
BOCs helium business continued to grow globally and so did the packaged chemicals business and the sales of medical gases.
Margins improved in the liquefied petroleum gas LPG markets as a result of more rapid selling price adjustments to reflect changing input costs.
In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar.
Deliveries from this new source are expected to begin in July 2005 and the location will assist in satisfying fast-growing demand in Asian markets.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 despite weak manufacturing activity in the key markets.
BOC achieved turnover growth in the mature UK manufacturing sector by extending the range of products and services offered to its customers.
Growth of adjusted operating profit was also assisted by productivity improvements, control of costs and favourable price trends.
Sales to the medical sector increased because of service improvements and the introduction of new products notably lightweight portable cylinders for emergency applications.
Sales of special gases including helium also increased and a new contract to supply the needs of Oxford Magnet Technology for medical imaging devices was announced during 2003.
Sales of Sureflow hospitality gases and equipment improved, as did sales of refrigerant gases.
Economic growth in Ireland slowed during 2003.
Despite improved hospitality product sales, turnover was almost unchanged and adjusted operating profit was marginally lower.
Increased turnover and adjusted operating profit in Poland were principally because of the addition of the business of Praxair Polska that took effect from February 2003.
The integration with BOCs existing business in Poland and the introduction of common business systems has proceeded smoothly.
Price increases in Poland were adequate to recover cost inflation during 2003.
North America In total, sales of gases in 2003 were similar to those of 2002 but sales of welding products were depressed.
Weak conditions in the manufacturing economy across north America coupled with costs related to the implementation of a new business system in the US led to a sharp decline in adjusted operating profit.
Increased volumes of LPG and of special gases, including helium, together with modest price increases for most products were sufficient to offset lower volumes of industrial gases leading to a marginal improvement in gases turnover in the US.
Market conditions were also difficult in Canada but the acquisition of business from Air Products in Canada led to a higher turnover and adjusted operating profit.
Latin America There was an improvement in both turnover and adjusted operating profit across the region.
This was generally based on trends that were favourable in terms of both volumes and selling prices.
Despite extended unrest and political uncertainty, there was a particularly strong performance in Venezuela.
BOCs associated company based in Chile also achieved good growth.
Business in Colombia was expanded during 2003 with the acquisition of an LPG business.
Turnover from respiratory homecare products grew in Colombia, where a local homecare company was acquired during the year, as well as in Chile, where an acquisition was made in the previous year.
Africa Turnover and adjusted operating profit again increased significantly in 2003, as manufacturing activity was strong in South Africa.
Although economic growth moderated later in the year as the rand strengthened, the increased international investment in manufacturing in South Africa continued to provide a firm base for sales of gases and welding products.
The mining industry also provided good business opportunities.
There was a significant expansion of platinum mining and ferro-chrome was also in strong demand.
Production of the AfroxPac was further increased in 2003 as demand for the product continued to accelerate.
Several of the major mining companies were issuing this device to their workforce to provide an emergency oxygen supply for those working underground.
Exports of Afrox welding products started the year well but growth was later curtailed by the strengthening of the rand, which began to reduce the competitive advantage.
LPG sales increased and margins improved as a result of lower input costs.
Results from other countries in Africa were somewhat mixed with good performances in Namibia and Kenya offset by weakness in the Zambian copper industry.
Overall, results were not significantly different in 2003.
46 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 Japan The basis of accounting for BOCs business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Full details can be seen in the PGS section on page 44.
On the respective bases used in each year, turnover and adjusted operating profit for ISP in Japan were lower in 2003.
East Asia Turnover increased but adjusted operating profit was marginally lower in 2003, with the full year benefit of acquisitions being reduced by the effect of industrial decline in the key market of Hong Kong and also by the increase in business overheads to support the future development of business in the region.
Two acquisitions affected business performance comparisons in 2003.
Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited UGP was acquired by BOCs subsidiary in Thailand in May 2002 and BOCs associated company in Malaysia took full control of Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc NIOI in September 2002.
The integration of NIOI proceeded smoothly during 2003 and the business performed well.
Although better than those of 2002, results from UGP were adversely affected by sharply competitive conditions in the ammonia business but LPG, which is the other main product line for UGP, improved due to partial deregulation of end consumer prices.
While competition remained strong in industrial products, especially in Thailand and Malaysia, investments in special products facilities enabled this more profitable business to be expanded.
Facilities for breaking bulk and repackaging refrigerant gases had already been installed in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Malaysia and a further facility was scheduled to be built in Thailand during 2004.
South Pacific Although economic growth was less rapid in 2003 than it was in 2002, both turnover and adjusted operating profit improved.
Increased turnover was largely a result of better prices rather than increased sales volume and firm prices were coupled with effective cost controls.
Good progress was made in developing the safety products business in 2003 with significant new business from major customers.
The medical gas business also benefited from the introduction of new products.
A webbased customer portal was launched enabling customers to carry out transactions as well as to track and pay their accounts over the Internet.
BOCs joint venture company, Elgas, a leading supplier of LPG in the eastern part of Australia, enjoyed a record year.
Sharp increases in costs before the Iraq war were successfully recovered by rapid adjustments to selling prices.
After difficult conditions in 2002, better results were obtained from Papua New Guinea and the other Pacific islands during 2003.

Compares with a loss of 2.2 million in 2002.
The semiconductor equipment downturn that affected most of 2002 continued throughout 2003.
The second half of 2002 had benefited from some improvement in activity but this proved transient and no such upturn was repeated in 2003. Business was concentrated with those manufacturers with a specific investment strategy.
This was predominantly for upgrades and expansions of existing facilities rather than new plants.
Demand for general vacuum products from key customers in the chemicals, aerospace and automotive industries was also weaker in 2003.
Turnover and adjusted operating profit were therefore lower.
The impact of these adverse business conditions was lessened by rationalising manufacturing facilities and by careful control of costs.
Industrial vacuum and pressure products manufacturing in Philadelphia, Bolton and the Czech Republic was rationalised.
Also in 2003, the size of a facility in Massachusetts was reduced to suit the lower volume of business available.
The pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging business suffered from delayed investment by pharmaceutical manufacturers during 2003.
Semiconductor gases turnover was essentially unchanged in 2003 as a whole, despite an improving trend in the second half.
Additional volumes from new business were offset by pressure on prices as competition became more severe during the second year of the downturn.
The focus was therefore on retaining market share, winning new business in Asia and on product development.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride was increased and fluorine generators were under evaluation by leading semiconductor manufacturers.
The basis of accounting for BOCs business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
On the respective bases used in each year, turnover and adjusted operating profit for BOC Edwards in Japan increased in 2003.
47 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Operating review comparing 2003 with 2002 Vacuum equipment volumes worldwide were slightly better in 2003 and much of the increase was derived from pumping products for flat panel display manufacture.
However, these pumps currently earn lower margins than semiconductor pumping systems.
Although semiconductor equipment demand was weak in 2003, improved products were developed to strengthen BOC Edwards position in vacuum technology.
These included single axis on-tool semiconductor pumps and a range of small dry pumps for the growing scientific equipment market.
The Kachina process tool component cleaning service grew in 2003 but the chemical management business suffered from the small number of new semiconductor plants being built.
Cost levels were reduced to improve financial performance.
Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services to electronic manufacturers.
Afrox hospitals Change 1 on 2002 2003 Change constant million on 2002 currency Turnover 353.4 36% 16% Operating profit 46.1 55% 31% 2 Adjusted operating profit 46.1 55% 31% 1.
Although hospital occupancy rates increased only marginally in 2003, turnover and adjusted operating profit both increased significantly.
This resulted from some minor acquisitions, positive price trends and a reduction in overhead costs.
New facilities continued to be added to existing hospitals in order to widen the range of available services.
There was a significant change in the reimbursement system during 2003.
Insurance companies had previously paid private health care providers such as Afrox hospitals a fee for their services but this was then changing to a risk reimbursement system.
This involves a fixed payment to be made for each kind of procedure thus transferring some financial risk to the provider if complications arise.
Although acute care hospitals continued to make up the great majority of both turnover and adjusted operating profit, there were better results from the Lifecare chronic care business, from occupational health services and from the Direct Medicines pharmacy services business following restructuring to address more competitive market conditions.
Gist Change 1 on 2002 2003 Change constant million on 2002 currency Turnover 291.8 10% 10% Operating profit 29.2 15% 13% 2 Adjusted operating profit 29.2 15% 13% 1.
Improved turnover reflected both new contracts and increased volumes with existing customers.
The increase in adjusted operating profit was not only as a result of higher turnover but also because of a gain of some 4.1 million arising principally from the termination of operations for the Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business.
Gist continued to operate all of Marks & Spencers chilled and ambient food distribution and services and remained its largest supply chain provider.
In 2003, a contract with Carlsberg-Tetley, a leading brewer, was expanded to manage the entire primary transport distribution business.
A contract to manage the international inbound supply chain was also secured with New Look, the UK high street fashion retailer.
