NEPAL Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 09 Operational Review Cairn is involved in a range of oil and gas exploration and production activities: from scouting of acreage, mapping of prospects through to seismic surveys, land procurement, well drilling on and offshore, processing facilities and pipeline installation, operation of processing facilities and finally to the sale and exportation of oil and gas.
Cairns head office is located in Edinburgh, there are regional centres in Chennai and Dhaka and operational and support offices in Barmer and Delhi.
The majority of Cairns operational activity during 2004 and to Mike Watts Phil Tracy date in 2005 has been focused on Rajasthan and the infill Exploration Director Engineering & Operations Director development drilling at Sangu and Lakshmi.
In Rajasthan this has resulted in the discovery and appraisal of a number of fields, including the world class Mangala field and two other significant discoveries Bhagyam and Aishwariya in the north of the block.

Cairn holds a 100% equity interest in discovered hydrocarbons on the very northern edge of the block wide exploration and in January 2005 ONGC exercised its contract area.
