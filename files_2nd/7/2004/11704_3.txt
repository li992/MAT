Production levels have been maintained at close to 2003 levels due to the positive results of an active investment programme offsetting the underlying natural production decline of the more mature assets in the portfolio.
Total investment in projects and developments during 2004 was 77.2 million compared with 59.8 million in 2003.
Further organic growth is anticipated during 2005, when we expect to invest some 135 million in our existing asset base.
Exploration activity also increased during 2004, with total investment being 10.4 million compared with 9.8 million in 2003.
We anticipate spending 15 million on exploration projects during 2005, the primary focus being on Scandinavian and UKCS activity with participation in up to eight wells.

This programme will continue until mid-2006.
Two infill wells and two workovers were completed on the Palaeocene reservoir in the Arbroath Field using a heavy duty jack-up rig.
This programme successfully increased the production capacity of the field and restored well integrity.
One of the infill wells was deepened to the underlying oil-bearing Zechstein formation constituting the Carnoustie Field: this deeper reservoir has been tested at rates in excess of 2,000 bopd, and discussions are underway to commingle this production with production from the Palaeocene reservoir.
The Brechin exploration well, drilled in May, discovered oil in a structure to the east of the Arkwright Field.
A development plan for this discovery has been rapidly progressed, and DTI approval for the development of the Brechin Field as a single subsea well tie-back through the Arkwright manifold was secured in November.
The development is proceeding on schedule and budget and first oil is expected in July 2005, only 14 months after discovery.
