The Capital FM Network In the past year, the Capital FM Network has continued to operate as a branded radio network with two strengthened management teams focused on the flagship London station, 95.8 Capital FM, and the regional stations respectively.
At 95.8 Capital FM, the key challenges have been to build on early improvements to the schedule, succeed in an increasingly fragmented and competitive London market and launch a new breakfast show successfully after 17 years.
In the last RAJAR results, while increasing share of listening quarter on quarter, 95.8 Capital FM also increased reach, widening the gap on our nearest commercial competitor.
