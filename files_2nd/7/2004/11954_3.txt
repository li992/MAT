CHIEF EXECUTIVES OPERATIONAL REVIEW Mercedes-Benz of Huddersfield New dealership opened during 2004 We have had another very successful and busy year, ending with an outstanding set of results.
The integration of the Pendragon and Bramall businesses has progressed ahead of plan and the acquisition of Bramall, using borrowings, has significantly increased earnings in the year.
For the longer term it has added more momentum to our drive to increase operational efficiencies through economies of scale.

Trading environment During 2004 the UK new car market remained stable at around 2.5 million registrations.
Demand in all segments of the market, retail, fleet and corporate, was strong in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2003.
The trend in the remaining nine months showed a decline in sales to private buyers with this segment finishing the year 4.4 per cent down on 2003.
The fall in retail customer sales was compensated in the market by fleet registrations which ended the year strongly.
The strong fleet market demand for cars was mirrored in commercial vehicles where registrations were up again in 2004 at 0.4 million.
The large truck segment of this market was stable with light commercials making up most of the 7.2 per cent increase year on year.
The aftersales market in both cars and commercials continued strongly backed by a number of years of stable sales and a steadily growing vehicle parc in the UK.
Overall the US market remained fairly buoyant with sales of cars and light trucks up by 1.4 per cent to just under 17 million.
New car sales were more difficult in the narrow range of brands we represent in California with sales of Land Rover and Jaguar both down.
In Germany the market for our products suffered again as a result of the lacklustre economy although total registrations for all brands were slightly up.
Registrations for brands we represent, Jaguar and Land Rover, were down six and fifteen per cent respectively.
Mercedes-Benz of Huddersfield Adrian Patterson Business Manager Karen Kellett Service Adviser CHIEF EXECUTIVES OPERATIONAL REPORT CONTINUED The principal activity of our business is the sale and servicing of motorcars.
We also operate a number of commercial vehicle dealerships.
Within the business there are distinct areas of activity: new vehicle sales, used vehicle sales, aftersales and support services.
In 2004 new vehicle sales accounted for 32.1 per cent of gross profit, used car sales for 18.1 per cent, aftersales for 44.2 per cent and support services 5.7 per cent.
These percentages have not changed significantly year on year.
Motor vehicle retail business We have businesses in three of the largest car markets, UK, USA and Germany.
The business in the UK accounted for 97 per cent of our underlying operating profits in 2004.
UK We own and operate 244 franchised dealers from 213 sites in the UK.
This now includes 33 commercial vehicle dealerships.
We have a national network of dealerships from Scotland in the North to the south coast of England with a diverse portfolio of franchises consisting of specialist, luxury, volume and commercial vehicles.
The CD Bramall acquisition early in the year added 133 franchises.
These have brought scale in certain areas such as Ford and Vauxhall volume businesses and broadened the portfolio to include other franchises such as Peugeot and Citron.
Our specialist and luxury car franchises include Aston Martin, BMW, Ferrari, Jaguar, Land Rover, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Mini and Porsche.
The principal volume franchises are Ford and Vauxhall.
Commercial vehicle franchises include DAF, Iveco, LDV, MercedesBenz and Mitsubishi.
We also have five sites selling Harley-Davidson and Japanese motorcycles.

Whilst the new businesses have diluted the operating margin slightly, the results for the combined business have been outstanding.
Of our luxury and specialist franchises Aston Martin, Jaguar and Porsche performed well in the year.
The new car over supply situation in 2003 for Jaguar was rectified, leading to a much more orderly market and stock holdings at more normal levels.
Aston Martin and Porsche benefited from the introduction of new models.
Of the other luxury marques Mercedes-Benz was more difficult compared to 2003 with sales and margins under pressure throughout the year.
As stated previously, we have been working to further improve the margins in our existing Ford business.
This has been achieved on sales of 272 million.
Given that Ford registrations were down three per cent nationally it is an excellent performance.
Our Ford franchise group, with the addition of the CD Bramall sites, had sales of 760 million in 2004 and as we bring more of this business into our shared services model we expect to see more scale benefits arising.
The other main volume business we operate is Vauxhall with sales of over 300 million in the year.
The dealerships performed well in a more competitive market.
Year on year profitability declined slightly although good margins were maintained on reduced sales volumes.
With the introduction of more of this franchise group to our new technology system this year we anticipate that some of the scale benefits already enjoyed elsewhere in the group will start to enhance this franchise groups already good performance.
We are now one of the biggest commercial vehicle retailers in the UK and, against the background of another strong market, we saw the performance of this division Chatfields of Sheffield DAF David Wright, Technician move forward in the year with margins ahead by almost one per cent.
Eight dealerships were disposed of or closed during the year.
Seven of the eight were acquired CD Bramall dealerships which were either non core or unlikely to meet our performance criteria.
We have enhanced our relationship with General Motors during the year with a number of developments and acquisitions.
We now represent General Motors with Vauxhall, SAAB, Chevrolet and Cadillac.
We have been appointed sole distributor and retailer of Cadillac cars in the UK, with initial representation plans for London, Manchester and Birmingham.
We expect to deliver the first cars to customers in April this year.
We acquired three SAAB dealerships towards the end of 2004 and have added a further one in Nottingham in January 2005.
We also acquired three Chevrolet businesses in December 2004, which complement our existing Vauxhall network.
USA We have again moved the profitability of our US business forward compared to the prior year.
This is mainly due to utilising the business model we developed in the UK to control costs and drive sales, and to the continuing good results in the aftersales operations of the dealerships.
Including two new SAAB dealerships we acquired in January 2005, we now operate twelve franchises from nine locations in southern California.
The portfolio of brands consists of Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin, SAAB, Lincoln and Mercury.
Whilst the portfolio remains concentrated on a few brands, we are continuing with our plan to introduce other franchises as we move the business forward.

Better cost control and more efficient working practices enabled us to grow the operating margin by 0.5 per cent.
In January 2005 we took our first step to establish a relationship with General Motors in the US through the acquisition of two SAAB dealerships.
Both dealerships are well established businesses in the Los Angeles area.
We believe this is an important step in both building on the relationship we enjoy with General Motors in the UK and in SAAB Santa Monica enriching the portfolio of brands we Acquired January 2005 sell in the Californian market.
Our management team has completed a lot of the groundwork in 2004 to enable the roll out of more of our in-house technology systems in 2005.
As a consequence we will be able to operate the business on a more integrated model thereby simplifying future expansion.
We have also continued to strengthen our established leadership team in order to take advantage of suitable opportunities to expand our business in California.
Germany The German economy remains weak and the performance of our businesses continues to be disappointing.
In total we operate five sites in Munich and Frankfurt with ten franchises: five Jaguar, three Land Rover and two Aston Martin.
In comparative terms it is a small part of the group contributing just over 1 per cent of turnover and an underlying operating loss of 2.1 million 2003: loss of 1.6 million.
Support services We provide a broad range of support services to both the Pendragon group and to outside customers.
The services are provided by a number of specialist businesses, which principally comprise: Contract hire and leasing Computer software solutions Wholesale parts distribution Shared services Loxley House CHIEF EXECUTIVES OPERATIONAL REPORT CONTINUED A number of new businesses acquired with CD Bramall have been added in this area in 2004.
These are the Quickco parts wholesale operation, Bramall Contracts and the Extra Leasing business.

The total fleet size at the year end was twelve thousand compared to thirteen thousand on a like for like basis at the end of 2003.
The Extra Leasing business stopped writing new primary leases in June 2003 and we continue to manage the disposal of vehicles and plant when they come to the end of their hire period.
The number of vehicles and plant at the end of 2004 was eight thousand, a reduction of two thousand from the end of 2003.
Pinewood T echnologies Pinewood is responsible for the computer and telecoms network for the group as well as providing services to third party customers.
The focus of activity in the year for Pinewood has been the development, sale and installation of the new dealer management system, Pinnacle.
At the end of 2004 we had Pinnacle installed at 24 dealerships within the Pendragon group and demand from external customers has continued to grow.
Since the year end we have continued with installations, and plan to have substantial numbers of our dealerships on the new system by the end of 2005.
Also within Pinewood Technologies is CFC, which provides software solutions for the management of small fleets, contract hire and workshops.
Shared Services The customer service centre at Loxley House provides a broad range of services to the group including a call centre, video sales functions, customer retention and accounting services.
During the year we have integrated more dealerships from the group into parts of this business model, including the call centre activities for our BMW and Porsche franchise groups and a further 19 Ford dealerships.
Pinewood technology system Loxley House Profits from property disposals Property disposals generated 47.1 million proceeds 2003: 11.8 million and a net profit before tax of 18.5 million 2003: 3.0 million.
We are continuing to manage our property portfolio in order to release value from properties.
As announced on 1 December 2004 we have obtained planning consent on one of our properties which when disposed of in 2005 will result in a significant exceptional gain.
We have a number of other properties also awaiting change of use planning approval.

Pictured above are the winners of the 2004 awards for outstanding achievement.
Outlook Our efforts in the year have been focused on integrating the Bramall business whilst still continuing to drive the performance of the group.
Our achievements in 2004 have confirmed our position as the UKs leading auto retailer.
The UK remains our primary market place where new car registrations have been stable over the last five years.
Industry analysts are, at this early stage of the new year, forecasting a slight dip in new car registrations compared to 2004.
We see the aftermarket continuing to remain strong in the coming year.
Whilst we are being cautious on outlook at this early stage we are confident that we will achieve our objectives in the year including a further reduction in our debt and the roll out of our new technology platform to a large proportion of the group.
