Operational review Production reached a rate of 10,000 bopd in December 2007 through production drilling on Snezhnoye and Maiskoye.
Infrastructure including pipelines and field facilities was built to enable Imperial to deliver its crude to market.
A successful exploration campaign resulted in a number of field discoveries and significant increases in reserves.
Reserves The independent reserve engineers DeGolyer and McNaughton D & M completed their annual review and updating of hydrocarbon reserves as at 31 December 2007 for Imperials interests in the Tomsk Region, Western Siberia.
For the first time a certain amount of gas reserves are included.
D & M were not asked to review Imperials interest in the Kostanai region, Kazakhstan, which is still subject to continued exploration drilling.
Imperial is also reporting its current Russian Registered Reserves on a field by field basis.

The total production in 2007 was 833,799 bbls.
Approximately, 80% of production came from the Maiskoye field and 20% from the Snezhnoye field with a total number of producing wells reaching 25 by the end of 2007.
Whilst 2008 started with production in February and March lower than expectations due to technical and logistical issues, upward momentum has been regained as this report goes to print.
Future production In 2008, Imperial plans to drill 69 production wells.
The Directors are targeting an increase in production to 25,000 bopd by the end of 2008, 35,000 bopd by the end of 2009: 60,000 bopd by the end 2010 and 80,000 bopd by the end 2011.
The targeted production is expected to come from at least five of Imperials fields: Snezhnoye, Maiskoye, Festivalnoye, Kiev-Eganskoye and Dvoinoye.
As further wells are drilled and tested as part of Imperials work programme, the Directors targets of future production may be adjusted upwards or downwards in line with results achieved.
2008 work programme Imperial is pursuing an aggressive work programme in 2008, the total expenditure in relation to which is expected by the end of the year including accrued payments to amount to approximately US$350 million.
In total, the current programme includes 72 wells, 2D and 3D seismic surveys, pipelines and infrastructure construction.
An exploration well is also being drilled currently at Imperials Torgai Block in Kazakhstan.
Imperials exploration programme for the Tomsk region in 2008 includes drilling three exploration wells: wells 361 and 362 at KievEganskoye and well 6 at Glukhovskoye.
In total, approximately 69 production wells are planned to be drilled on Maiskoye, South Maiskoye, Kiev-Eganskoye, Festivalnoye and Snezhnoye fields in 2008.
At Snezhnoye, drilling is expected to continue strongly through the year with some 24 wells drilled, hydraulically fractured on the Vasyugan reservoir, and put into operation.
At Maiskoye, Imperial plans to further develop the facilities and plans to drill 16 wells.
Having successfully drilled and tested its first well at the South Maiskoye field, Imperial plans to drill a further 3 wells in 2008 under a pilot production scheme.
On Block 80, Kiev-Eganskoye, Imperial plans to drill the first production well in H1 2008.
3D seismic on that structure and the 2D seismic on other potential targets in this Block have been obtained ahead of schedule.
Based on the results of these surveys, Imperial will drill two exploration wells on the north of the structure by the end of H1 2008 with an option to drill another appraisal production well under a pilot production scheme.
Pending further technical appraisal, over 2008, Imperial plans to drill some 15 production wells expected to be at Kiev-Eganskoye.
Festivalnoye will continue to be developed with approximately 10 production wells expected to be drilled during 2008.
Kazakhstan Drilling still continuing at Imperials North Torgai property, Kazakhstan, with promising signs of oil already identified.
Results of the exploration well are expected to be available by the end of May 2008.
Infrastructure Transport Imperials current oil production is being sold into the Russian domestic market through its wholly owned pipelines.
At the beginning of 2007, Imperial obtained all necessary permissions from the relevant Russian ministries and authorities for the construction of two pipelines of 208km in length in aggregate in the Tomsk region.
Imperial successfully completed and commissioned both of these pipelines and oil is now successfully flowing through the new processing facilities at Snezhnoye and Maiskoye directly into the Transneft system through Imperials own custody transfer stations and tie-ins at Zavyalovo and Luginetskoye.
The first pipeline, Snezhnoye-Zavyalovo, is approximately 49km in length and extends from the Snezhnoye field to the Transneft main trunk pipeline at Zavyalovo.
This pipeline serves Imperials Blocks 74 and 77.
The second pipeline, , is approximately 159km in length and extends from Imperials Maiskoye field, on Block 70, through Festivalnoye field, on Block 69 to the Transneft pipeline tie-in at Luginetskoye.
This pipeline serves Imperials Blocks 69, 70, 85 and 86.
A third pipeline, east of the Ob River, to service Block 80, has completed its construction phase with completion and commissioning due by the end of summer 2008, and first oil is expected to be transported in autumn 2008.
Field facilities In 2007, Imperial invested significant sums in upgrading field facilities at a number of its fields.
First phase field facilities costing approximately US$24 million were completed at Maiskoye.
The facilities are capable of upgrade to handle 30,000 bopd by 2010.
The Snezhnoye facility has been upgraded from early to full production facility, with storage tanks, pump systems, firefighting capabilities and a 3 megawatt gas fired electric power station.
New production facilities at Snezhnoye were successfully tested and commissioned in summer 2007.
This US$28 million Snezhnoye facility, together with the newly built 49km long pipeline to Zavyalovo custody transfer station, are currently processing all production from the field.
Imperial has also up-graded pad facilities at Festivalnoye and started the construction of early production facilities at Kiev-Eganskoye.
Oil sales Prior to pipeline completion in 2007, Imperial was selling all of its oil at the wellhead to local off-takers for use in the Russian domestic market.
The average realised oil price per barrel in 2007 was US$33.35.
In total, Imperial sold 597,577 bbls of oil in 2007.
The completion of Imperials pipelines gives Imperial the ability to transport all of its oil production to both domestic and export markets.
The Groups agreement with Vitol SA opened up the export market, and the first oil was exported in January 2008.
Under current Russian market practice, oil companies export up to approximately one third of their production.
RIG In April 2006, Imperial Energy established its own drilling company Rus Imperial Group RIG, which is now an autonomous structure within Imperial Group.
RIG ordered three new drilling rigs which are British designed and fabricated in China.
These top-drive rigs use the latest technology with the capability to drill down to 5,000 metres.
They are also skid mounted for ease of transportation by helicopter or with all terrain transport vehicles.
RIGs well services equipment includes a brand new workover rig Rig-KRS-1 fabricated by ELAZ Russia.
RIG is currently drilling wells for Imperial Energy at the Snezhnoye field and drilling is expected to commence on Imperials other fields in April and May 2008.
RIG has also stepped into the supervision role of the drilling operations for Imperial Energy in Kazakhstan.
IFS As part of RIG, Imperial Energy has its own Russian registered frac services company, 50% owned by the management of Imperial Fracturing Services IFS.
As the IFS frac fleet is helicopter transportable it allows Imperial to hydraulically fracture and test exploration wells, book reserves and register fields during the summer months.
This accelerates Imperials development programmes significantly.
IFS is already in successful operation fraccing Imperials production and exploration wells and servicing third parties on demand.
