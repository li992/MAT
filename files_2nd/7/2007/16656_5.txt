OPERATING REVIEW THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED STRONG UNDERLYING GROWTH IN THE CERAMICS DIVISION.
THE FASTEST GROWING AND MOST PROFITABLE REGION FOR THE GROUP CONTINUED TO BE ASIA-PACIFIC.
GROUP PERFORMANCE Group revenue from total operations for 2007 was 2% higher than in 2006 at constant exchange rates, although marginally lower by 2% at reported exchange rates.
In the Groups continuing operations, which exclude the results of the Monofrax business in 2007 and 2006 and the Laminates business in 2006, revenue was 6% higher at constant exchange rates and 2% higher at reported exchange rates.
The increase in revenue from continuing operations principally reflected strong underlying growth in the Ceramics division and the impact of higher metal prices being passed through to customers in the Precious Metals and Electronics divisions.
This revenue growth was partially offset by the loss of approximately 37 million of revenue relating to businesses which have been sold or closed in the last two years but which do not qualify to be treated as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.
Revenue growth from continuing operations at constant exchange rates was stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half 8% and 4% respectively reflecting the impact of higher metal prices in the second half of the year and the normal seasonality of the Precious Metals division.
Trading profit from total operations increased by 11% at constant exchange rates compared to the prior year 7% at reported exchange rates.
In continuing operations, the growth rate was higher, being 17% at constant exchange rates and 13% at reported exchange rates.
Trading profit at constant exchange rates increased by 25% to 109.4 million in the Ceramics division: by 3% to 58.0 million in the Electronics division: and decreased slightly by 2% to 9.9 million in the Precious Metals division.
The strong growth in trading profit resulted in a significant increase in the Groups return on sales from continuing operations at constant exchange rates to 10.5% from 9.5%.
But for the impact of higher metal prices increasing reported revenue without any impact on profitability, this increase would have been around 0.4 percentage points higher.
The fastest growing and most profitable region for the Group continued to be Asia-Pacific, where revenue from continuing operations by location of customer and at constant currency increased by 9% compared with 2006.
Europe and NAFTA which comprises the US, Canada and Mexico contributed 34% and 31% respectively of Group revenue: however, despite revenue growth in both these regions, higher levels of growth in Asia-Pacific in particular has seen their combined share of Group revenue fall marginally from 66% in 2006 to 65% in 2007 with Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World representing 35% of Group revenue in 2007.

It is also the regional leader in the 757 722 US, UK and Australia in the supply and installation of monolithic refractory linings.
The division had another outstanding year with strong underlying revenue growth in the higher margin speciality products, improved profitability in the linings business, and improved operating efficiencies resulting in a record level of profitability.
Market overview 05 06 07 The Ceramics division benefited from the good market conditions experienced in 2006 continuing throughout 2007.
Trading Profit The divisions key end market is global steel production, which accounts for around 70% of the m divisions revenue.
In 2007, global steel production rose by 7.5% to over 1.3 billion tonnes.
Following the 9% growth in 2006, the rate of growth in 2007 remained strong, being 10% in the first half and 6% in the second half of the year.
China reinforced its position as the worlds leading steel producer with year-on- 109.4 year growth of 16% and accounted for 36% of the worlds total production in 2007.
Notwithstanding the 89.5 strong growth from this region, global production outside of China still showed growth of 3%, with 73.1 marginally lower production in the US down 1% being more than offset by strong growth in the major regions of India up 7%, the CIS up 3% and the enlarged European Union up 2%.
Steel prices remained high during 2007 and the industrys financial position remains strong.
Following the merger of Mittal and Arcelor in 2006 to form the worlds largest steel producer, consolidation of the steel industry continued in 2007 with a number of acquisitions including Tata Steels acquisition of the Anglo-Dutch producer, Corus.
05 06 07 This trend is expected to continue and is expected to be particularly marked in China where the government has stated its intention to create a small number of industry champions out of the currently very fragmented market place.
For example, one of Chinas largest steel producers will be created on the Return on Sales completion of the proposed merger of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation Group with Benxi Iron & Steel.
% The end-markets for most of the divisions products and services which are not related to steel production, namely foundry, glass and industrial products, are generally linked to GDP growth.
Demand for 14.0 solar energy and thus the divisions Solar Crucibles used in the manufacture of photovoltaic solar cells was very strong in 2007 as high oil prices and heightened environmental concerns stimulated 11.8 demand for renewable sources of energy.
10.1 Divisional performance Good market conditions, combined with the beneficial impact of the investment and restructuring initiatives 05 06 07 implemented in the last two years resulted in a further strong improvement in performance.
Revenue on continuing operations for the year at 781 million was 7% higher than 2006 at constant exchange rates and 3% higher at reported exchange rates.
These results exclude the results of Monofrax, the US-based fused cast refractory business, which was sold in February 2007 and the results of which are included in discontinued operations.
The divisions results do, however, include the results of a number of smaller businesses which were either sold or closed during the last two years but which did not qualify to be treated as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.
These include the principally US-based Ceramics Fibres business sold March 2006, the UK-based Carbon Blocks business sold June 2006, the UK based Magnesia-carbon Bricks business closed December 2006 and the US-based Alumina Bricks business sold February 2007.
Excluding the revenue from these businesses, underlying revenue for the division was up 11% at constant exchange rates, well ahead of the growth in world steel production which grew 7.5%.
This outperformance reflects some market share gains, together with the progressive increase in the divisions addressable market, as the steel industry in countries such as China, Russia and Ukraine increasingly converts to enclosed continuous casting technology which requires the divisions steel flow control products.

05 06 07 Electronic equipment production worldwide is reported to have grown by 8% by value in 2007, marginally lower than the 10% growth in 2006, but well ahead of global GDP growth.
This growth was Trading Profit driven by strong consumer-led demand for PCs particularly laptops, mobile telephones, games consoles, m navigation systems, high definition flat screen televisions and MP3 players.
Global PC sales grew by 13% by volume in 2007, whilst the total annual production of mobile phones reached 1.2 billion units, growth of 16% over 2006.
In the first three quarters of 2007, the worldwide semi-conductor industry grew 9% by 58.5 58.0 volume but only 3% by value due to pricing pressures.
Printed circuit board PCB production grew 4% 52.5 by volume in 2007 driven by continued strong growth in Asia, particularly China.
Regionally, Asia-Pacific experienced the strongest growth both in terms of production capacity migrating to this region and also strong local end-market demand.
Electronic equipment production, for example, whilst growing 8% worldwide saw lower growth in both the US and Europe 2% and 4% respectively being more than offset by growth of 21% in China.
The market penetration of lead-free products, which had accelerated strongly in 2006 with EU 05 06 07 regulations coming into force in mid-2006 the Reduction of Hazardous Substances Act which forbid the use of lead in the majority of electronic assemblies, remained broadly unchanged in 2007 compared to the end of 2006.
The use of lead-free products is a significant change impacting the whole division, not just Return on Sales for the Assembly Materials sector, whose solder products have traditionally contained lead.
Non-lead % solders melt at higher temperatures and so all other PCB components, including circuit board fabrication chemistries, must also be able to withstand these temperatures.

Trading profit from continuing operations increased by 3% to 58.0 million at constant exchange rates 1% lower at reported exchange rates giving a return on sales for the division of 10.4%.
The return on sales is marginally below that reported in 2006 10.5% due to the impact of higher metal prices.
If metals prices in 2007 had remained at similar levels to those in 2006, the return on sales in 2007 would have been 0.9 percentage points higher at 11.5%.
Return on net assets for the division reduced marginally from 43.0% in 2006 to 40.0% in 2007, reflecting higher levels of trade working capital arising from higher metal prices.
