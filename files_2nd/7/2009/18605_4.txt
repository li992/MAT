Residential units owned 09, 6,807 08, 6,894 07, 4,520 06, 2,739 Prospects Since the year end, we have continued to sell properties.
As at 30 October our UK residential sales pipeline being completed sales, exchanged contracts and in solicitors hands amounted to 55m.
Given our recent refinancing and depending on future market conditions, we do not anticipate making the same level of investment sales in 2010 as we have in the last year.
This is expected to produce an improvement in overall sales margins albeit at the expense of total sales volumes.
Despite some recent signs of recovery in market conditions, we are still cautious in our near term view.
Against this context, we will seek to use our expertise and experience to ensure that acquisitions offer the potential to create and enhance value for our shareholders in the medium to long-term.
