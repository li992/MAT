61.7m We had predicted the global downturn would negatively impact the markets in 2008: 76.3m which we operate and our performance in 2009, although the exact timing and From continuing operations scale of impact was uncertain.
We commenced our preparations in the second half of 2008, well before any visible impact of the recession in our markets.
Credit controls were substantially tightened, management were focused on collections Earnings per share rather than growth and costs and borrowings were reduced.
The outturn for the year clearly reflects both the recessionary external environment and the focus of management action: Customer numbers, receivables and revenue 17.78p remained relatively flat but profit before tax from continuing operations reduced by 19% to 61.7 million 2008: 76.3 million.
Impairment costs increased by 2008: 21.48p 37.1 million 31% but were largely offset by a reduction in agents commission From continuing operations costs of 8.0 million 9% and other costs of 23.2 million 5%.
Finance costs increased by 5% reflecting the increase in funding costs since October 2008.
Customer numbers The result for the year benefited by approximately 10 million as a result of our decision to change product terms and pricing in the second half.
This benefit will continue into the first half of 2010 but will be offset by increased early settlement 2.06m rebates on the introduction of the EU Consumer Credit Directive in 2010.
2008: 2.03m Our developing markets in Mexico and Romania progressed, as planned, with Mexico achieving a maiden profit and Romania a much reduced loss.

By Quarter 4, Group profit was ahead of the previous year by 9%.

As a result, impairment levels rose sharply and the market became loss-making.
In response, we removed agent service from about 80,000 poor paying customers and passed them to our centralised debt recovery team.
In June and July we substantially reduced our headcount and cost base to a level commensurate with the reduced customer base.
These actions, alongside continued tight credit controls, returned the Hungarian business to profit for the second half of the year and leave it well placed to rebuild its customer numbers and profitability over the medium-term.
The impact of the recession in the rest of our established Central European markets was much less pronounced.
Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia reported a pre-tax profit of 83.7 million compared with 89.9 million in 2008.
As expected, the global recession had a sudden and sharp impact on these markets in the first quarter of the year leading to lower credit issued, reduced revenue and increased impairment charges.
As the first half progressed conditions stabilised and the benefits of the actions we had taken at the end of 2008 became increasingly influential with performance improving substantially from Quarter 2, 2009.
In the second half of the year these markets returned to growth and profits recovered well, with fourth quarter profits up by 8% year on year.

We also made good progress in Romania.
Although we opened no new branches in 2009, the business grew strongly with customer numbers increasing from 85,000 to 164,000 and start-up losses reduced significantly to 2.4 million 2008: 7.8 million.
As previously indicated, we expect Romania to report a profit for 2010.
Whilst 2009 was a challenging year, the rapid recovery from the recession and the improved performance during the second half demonstrate the resilience of our business model, the effectiveness of our credit risk management systems, and our ability to reduce costs and generate cash.
As we enter 2010, the outlook for the global economy has improved and conditions in our markets are generally better than at the start of 2009, but uncertainty remains.
The unusually severe weather across many parts of Europe in the first weeks of the year has had a negative impact on our collections performance and impairment, particularly in Poland.
We expect that this will unwind later in the year as collections performance improves, but it will impact our first quarter results.
Nevertheless, we aim to carry the momentum achieved in the second half of 2009 into 2010 and deliver improved results, with Mexico building on its maiden profit and Romania on track to achieve a full year profit for the first time.
Discontinued operations The closure of the pilot operation in Russia was completed in April 2009.
In Russia, the liquidation of our businesses is progressing to plan.
The loss for the year in respect of these discontinued operations is 12.8 million, including the tax charge noted in the financial review.
We closed our pilot test in Russia because of slower than anticipated growth in customer numbers.
We believe this largely reflected consumer caution during a period of recession rather than a lack of underlying demand for our products and service.
However, we reached the conclusion that the cost of continuing the pilot for a potentially long period until market conditions returned to normal was too great and that in the near-term our resources would be better used in the development of our existing markets.
New markets Nonetheless, taking our business model to new, emerging markets remains a key element of our strategy and we will look to enter new markets when conditions are right.
We do not plan to commence pilot operations in any new countries this year, but during 2010 we will progress our research on potential new markets with a view to possibly commencing a new market in 2011.

being well below the same period of the previous year resulting in a significant increase in impairment charges.
As a result, Central Europe was loss making in Quarter 1, 2009.
However, from the end of the first quarter onwards we saw a significant divergence in performance: In Poland and Czech-Slovakia we saw improved collections performance and impairment levels returned to normal.
As a result we were able to progressively relax credit controls following the blanket tightening implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Both markets returned to good levels of profit in the second quarter and in the third and fourth quarter profits were up year on year.
In addition, both reported a return to growth in credit issued in Quarter 4.
Hungary was the market which experienced the most severe impact from the global recession.
Although performance stabilised by May, we did not see the same improvement witnessed in the other markets and the operation continued to be loss making.
To remedy this we implemented a restructuring programme focused on good payers: From a customer base of about 300,000 we passed to our debt recovery team approximately 80,000 poor paying customers.
This enabled a substantial reduction of the cost base of about 20%, including a reduction in the headcount.
This restructuring was completed in July 2009 at a cost of 3.0 million.
Credit quality and collections performance thereafter improved and the businesses returned to profit in the second half albeit at much reduced levels compared with 2008. www.

The higher levels of impairment experienced in the first quarter led to higher levels of customer write-offs, coupled with a lower level of new customer recruitment 758,000 due to the tight credit controls implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008.

This was most pronounced in the first quarter when credit issued was down by 22% on the prior year.
From the 2008: 255.5m second quarter, collections performance and credit quality improved enabling a progressive relaxation of credit controls such that credit issued grew by 5% year on year in the fourth quarter.
As a result of the reduction in customer numbers and credit issued, average receivables were down year on year by 7% and revenue Poland reduced by 4%.

Other costs were reduced year on year by 24.5 million 2008: 19% 10% through a combination of lower marketing costs, improvements in the efficiency of field operations and the re-negotiation of third party costs.
As a result, other costs reduced to 35% of revenue, which compares favourably with a ratio of 39% in 2008.
During the period, finance costs increased by 6%, mainly reflecting changes in interest rates and borrowing margins, whereas agents commission costs reduced by 8%, in line with the reduction in receivables.

For the year as a whole credit issued reduced by 11%.
However, in the fourth quarter the market returned to growth 383,000 and credit issued grew by 5%.
As a result of the reduction in customer numbers and credit issued, average receivables fell by 7% year on year but revenue for 2008: 397,000 the year was similar to that for 2008.
This is partly due to the mix of receivables moving towards shorter-term products which have a higher effective interest rate, and partly due to changes to product term and price implemented in the second half.
Czech Republic and Slovakia Average net receivables Impairment increased by 15.3 million 43%, with the majority of this increase experienced in the first quarter, when the impairment charge grew by nearly 100% to 26.3 million Quarter 1 2008: 13.7 million.
This meant that the impairment 118.9m charge in 2009 represented 28% of revenue compared with 20% in 2008.
2008: 118.7m In the opening weeks of 2010 we have experienced unusually severe weather conditions with extreme cold and substantial snowfall.
This has made it more difficult for agents to reach customers and collect repayments and it also caused temporary falls in the incomes of households with outdoor employment.
As a Czech Republic and Slovakia result our collections performance has reduced and impairment has risen.
Impairment as a % of revenue Whilst we expect this will negatively impact our first quarter results we expect that our collections performance will return to normal levels in the coming weeks and the negative impact will unwind over the course of the year.

Hungary The impact of the global recession on our customers was much worse in Hungary than the other markets.
During 2009 it reported a loss for the year of 7.2 million compared with a profit in 2008 of 16.1 million.
This exacerbated its impact with the result that during 2009 GDP contracted by 6.3%.
This resulted in a sharp reduction in employment and pay cuts for many of those remaining in employment.
These factors and increased taxation led to a sharp reduction in household income which, in turn, meant that our collections performance was much reduced through the first and second quarters.
A large number of customers fell into arrears and despite intensive management action we were unable to return them to a reasonable level of repayment.
This led to a significant increase in impairment and reductions in the volume of credit issued, and therefore revenue, with lower collections performance driving a reduction in the number of customers qualifying for the offer of further credit.

This entailed reducing the number of agents by approximately a third and reducing employee numbers by approximately a quarter.
The Hungarian business ended 2009 with 227,000 customers, a reduction of 40% just under a third, with similar reductions in average receivables and revenue.
The reduction in the volume of credit issued was higher at 41%.
This reflects the 2008: 23% tight credit controls we maintained throughout the year, with a lower proportion of new and existing customers qualifying for loan offers.
This has resulted in a significant improvement in credit quality and collections performance throughout the second half of the year with credit quality on new loans granted in 2010 at levels significantly better than our benchmark levels.
We have maintained these very tight controls at the expense of growth whilst we stabilised the business following the mid-year restructuring.
However, we are now in a position to ease credit controls at the start of 2010.
As a result of the tight credit controls, impairment returned to more normal levels in the second half and was 29% lower than the second half of 2008.
Agents commission costs reduced by 43% and other costs reduced by 16% compared with the second half of last year, reflecting the downsizing of the business.
