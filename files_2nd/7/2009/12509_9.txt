In Milling, sales revenue was down 17.6%.

9 March 2010 Outlook The Group has made progress during 2009 in developing its strategy of growing branded sales and in expanding gross margin through the benefits of consumer insight and scale.

20 Premier Foods plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Stock code: PFD Our business Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Hovis gives it 100% In December 2009 Hovis announced it will be backing British farmers and moving to flour milled from 100% British Wheat across its entire range the first major British bread brand to do so.
Launched in early 2010, the move, which represents a multi-million pound investment, comes as part of the brands continuing renaissance, which began with its award-winning Go on Lad advertising campaign and packaging re-brand in September 2008.
Hovis has been growing a strain of Canadian Red wheat here in Britain for the past five years in trials and now has over 600 farmers across Great Britain growing wheat for Hovis loaves.
This is the equivalent to one in eight British wheat fields being grown for Hovis.
NFU President Peter Kendall said: It is fantastic news that Hovis will be committing to source 100% of its wheat from Britain from next year.
This shows real commitment to UK farming and its skill, professionalism and reliability, by a well-known and respected UK company.
Jon Goldstone, Marketing Director at Hovis said: We used to import 18m worth of Canadian wheat, 18m which will now go to British farmers.
This is a significant amount of cash.
Hovis move to 100% British will not only be a good deal for farmers.
The new strain of wheat means a tastier, better quality, all-British Hovis loaf without any price rise for consumers.
