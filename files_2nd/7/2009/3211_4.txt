Operating British Gas Review Restructuring the business model to lead in the low carbon world Downstream UK 2009 was a strong year for our As announced in February 2009, British Gas has been restructured downstream UK business, British and is now run as a single business, focused on meeting the energy and related service requirements of our customers.
Operational efficiency and management team is in place and support functions have been customer service improved across integrated.
British Gas New Energy is now also part of the overall structure.
We are building the capability of our operational staff to the business, and a continued work across our broad range of products, thereby further improving the efficiency of our operations and the overall customer experience.

This progress led to efficiencies.

This is customer satisfaction levels which, an important indicator for British Gas and the deeper customer combined with our residential relationship should result in a greater level of retention.
This growth reflects increased levels of cross-selling, with the proportion of sales energy price reductions, helped of energy products through services channels and sales of services products through energy channels both increasing.

Under new management we will now look to grow leadership positions in deregulated markets, investing for incremental growth and value, with the aim over time of further developing the integrated energy model.
We will do this alongside continuing to focus on improving returns from the existing business.
Residential energy supply Our residential energy business produced a good underlying performance, as a decline in customer numbers in Canada and Texas was broadly offset by an increase in the US North East customer base.
In our Canadian deregulated markets we scaled back on sales of fixed-price long-term contracts, where the level of capital support required is higher.
In Texas we saw a slight reduction in customer numbers, as we delayed price cuts in order to maintain underlying margins on pre-hedged load in the first quarter.
However in the US North East we have grown our customer base by around 150,000 to over 500,000 as authorities look to open up their markets to competition, offering the prospect of further growth for the future.
