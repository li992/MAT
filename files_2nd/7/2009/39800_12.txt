In France we saw rental falls of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent for logistic warehousing around Paris and of 56 per cent around Lyon where there is typically a six month lag in price movements compared to Paris.
In Germany there were regional variations with Dsseldorf and Hamburg suffering declines of 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the rentals achieved for logistics space whereas Berlin experienced rental falls of up to 15 per cent.
In both France and Germany rents for light industrial units held up well, with no significant rental decline.
In Poland, pockets of oversupply and last years fall in currencies have added to downward pressure on headline rental values which are commonly set in euros.
Logistics assets have experienced falls in rental value of approximately 5 per cent, although in certain areas of excess supply such as Poznan, this was as much as 10 per cent.
