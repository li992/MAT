The Kosmurun mine closed in the fourth AT A GLANCE quarter of 2008 due to the depletion of the open pit with plans for the mine to move underground currently being developed.
KAZAKHMYS COPPER The main factor behind the lower production volumes was the Kazakhmys Copper includes principle by-products of zinc, gold and silver closure of the Akbastau mine, which, in 2008, produced 2.4 MT of ore containing 59 kt of copper.
The mine was suspended as the ore body is being preserved ahead of the construction of a new concentrator at the site which will reduce ore transportation costs.
The loss of ore output from the mine closures was partially offset by the opening of the West Nurkazgan underground mine in early 2009 and an improved performance from the South mine following operational difficulties in the first half of 2008.
The copper grade was lower at 1.18% mainly due to no production taking place at the high grade Akbastau mine.
The impact of the mine closure was partially offset by the average copper grade at the Zhomart mine increasing to 1.80% up from 1.39% in 2008 and the suspension of the low grade Konyrat mine.

The devaluation were 47 kt below the prior year, due to reduced production from reduced tenge denominated costs such as labour, local services and both own and purchased copper concentrate.
The impact of lower utilities.
The currency was relatively stable against the US dollar for the production on sales volumes was partially offset by a sell down of remainder of 2009, trading within the National Bank of Kazakhstans nished goods inventories at the start of the year, as copper sales target range of 145 to 155 KZT $.
The National Bank has indicated volumes were 15.3 kt higher than production volumes.

The growth in other 116 US cents per pound in 2008 to 72 US cents per pound.
The lower revenue compared to the prior year was largely driven by sales cash operating costs, together with an increase in by-product credits, of power from the Karaganda plant and the ramp up of sulphuric resulted in the net cash cost falling signicantly.
In 2010, a lower copper grade will raise the unit cost of production.

26 Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors Report: Business Review MARKET AND OPERATIONS REVIEW CONTINUED Revenues AT A GLANCE In 2009, Kazakhmys Gold sold dor under an annual contract to a European trader, with the price determined by reference to the LBMA KAZAKHMYS GOLD price less rening charges.
These arrangements are expected to remain unchanged in 2010.
Kazakhmys Golds revenues decreased by only $2 million to $47 million in 2009, despite a reduction in gold sales volumes following the closure of the Zhaima mine in 2008, and the decrease in output from Mizek Oxide.
The lower sales volumes were largely offset by the strength of gold prices in 2009, with an average realised price of $982 per ounce, 12% higher than in the prior year.
EBITDA excluding special items The improved EBITDA in 2009 resulted from the higher realised gold price which maintained revenues at the same level as the prior year, whilst production volumes, and therefore costs, were lower.
Kazakhmys Gold also benefited from the currency devaluation on its tenge denominated cost base and the price of various input materials fell compared to 2008.
Cash cost OPERATIONS: The cash cost is lower in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the Location: Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan devaluation of the tenge and lower input prices.
The cash cost in 2008 included royalty payments of $21 per ounce which are not present in Mines: Mizek Oxide and Central Mukur 2009 following changes to the Kazakhstan tax code.

Sales revenues: $47 million Expansionary Kazakhmys Golds major focus in 2009 was the progression of the EBITDA excluding Bozymchak gold-copper project which successfully moved from the special items : $24 million feasibility stage to development towards the end of the year.
The projects development will be funded by the allocation of $100 million from the loan facility negotiated with the China Development Bank and Samruk.

During 2009, ore extraction took place at Kazakhmys Golds two Bozymchak will commence operations as an open pit mine in late 2010, operating mines, Mizek Oxide and Central Mukur.
The output producing around 5 MT of ore over a six year period with a gradual figures for 2009 reflect the impact of the closure of the Zhaima transition to underground mining from 2014, which will produce a mine in September 2008, and also lower output from Mizek Oxide.

com 27 AT A GLANCE Market overview In October 2008, Samruk, announced its intention to acquire a stake KAZAKHMYS POWER in the power plant, and completed the acquisition of a 50% stake in Ekibastuz GRES-1 in February 2010.
Under the joint venture agreement introduced as part of the transaction, the power plant will be operationally managed by a Kazakhmys appointed team for the next five years, following which a team selected by Samruk will assume management for a five year xed term.
A supervisory board has been created, containing representatives of both owners, to oversee the plants management team.
The business has been classified as held for sale at the 2009 year end under IFRS, as, following the sale of 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-1 to Samruk, the business will be equity accounted as a joint venture.
Going forward, Ekibastuz GRES-1 is expected to source coal almost exclusively from the Bogatyr mine, which is jointly owned by Samruk and UC RUSAL.
The strategic value in owning the Maikuben West coal mine has consequently been reduced and Kazakhmys has determined that the mine is now held for sale.
OPERATIONS: Demand Location: North Kazakhstan The economic downturn had a significant impact on electricity Divisional operations: Ekibastuz GRES-1 power plant demand in Kazakhstan and Russia as industrial output fell.
In the and Maikuben West coal mine first quarter of 2009, with energy intensive industrial users reducing electricity usage, demand was weak and additional supply entered PRODUCTION OVERVIEW: the market as industrial groups with captive power generation used surplus power to supply external customers.
Net dependable capacity: 2,012 MW Net power generated: 9,737 GWh From the second quarter of 2009, demand for electricity improved as industrial production in Kazakhstan and Russia recovered and FINANCIAL OVERVIEW: industrial groups with captive power generation used an increased proportion of energy production internally.

Coal prices for sales to third parties remained largely unchanged from 2008.
com 29 EBITDA excluding special items AT A GLANCE Almost 90% of Kazakhmys Powers EBITDA is generated by Ekibastuz GRES-1.
Due to the challenging marketplace in the first half of the KAZAKHMYS PETROLEUM year, Kazakhmys Powers EBITDA by the end of June 2009 was only $41 million, compared to the second half EBITDA of $79 million, driven by higher sales volumes and prices.
The coal used by Ekibastuz GRES-1, largely sourced from the nearby Bogatyr mine, forms the main operating cost of the power plant.
Coal prices at the start of the year were 10% above those in 2008.
During the year, Bogatyr raised prices further and Ekibastuz GRES-1 began purchasing varying grades of coal to keep the average cost down.
To further control costs, Kazakhmys Power took a number of actions in 2009 including carrying out repair and maintenance work internally and implementing projects to improve the efficiency of the power plant.
The majority of Kazakhmys Powers operating costs are denominated in tenge and therefore partially mitigated the impact of the tenge devaluation on revenue when reported in US dollars.

GVA fell by 24% in 2009, principally due to the economic weakness MKM in Europe, MKMs core marketplace, which accounts for almost 90% of sales volumes.
Industrial output in the region was severely impacted by the economic downturn, which led to lower demand across all product lines.
The lack of availability of debtor insurance which forms part of MKMs risk management policy, forced MKM to limit sales to certain customers.
These factors led to sales volumes falling by 13% from 273 kt to 237 kt, with reductions across all three sections.
To support sales activities, MKM maintained higher levels of inventory which enabled more short-term orders to be accepted.
Management also made a number of changes to the structure of the sales force.
MKM was forced to accept lower margins to protect its market position.
Within the wire section, wire rod sales volumes were supported by high demand in eastern Europe, however, overall volumes were lower as sales to MKMs core markets declined.
