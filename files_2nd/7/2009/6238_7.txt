MINES IN OPERATION During 2009 the Fresnillo Group had three producing mines, all located in Mexico.
Attributable silver production in the year reached a new record of 37.9 million ounces, 8.8% higher than in 2008.
In addition to silver produced from Fresnillos operating mines, the equivalent of 3.0 million ounces of payable silver 2008: 2.5 Moz was realised through the Silverstream Contract between Fresnillo and Peoles.
Attributable gold production for 2009 of 276,584 ounces surpassed expectations, rising 4.9%, as a result of strong performance at Herradura and the stabilisation of gold grade at Cinega.
FRESNILLO Fresnillo is the worlds largest primary silver mine.
It has been in near continuous operation since 1550.
Total anOwnership: 100% Fresnillo plc nual silver production in 2009 reached a new record high of 35.4 million ounces as a result of the increase in ore Location: Zacatecas milled.

Water treatment plant at Fresnillo Productivity and cost reduction initiatives A new water treatment plant became fully operational in November, following an investment of US$4.3 million.
This project allows sewage water from the Fresnillo municipality to be obtained at no cost, and once treated, it is used in the milling process instead of fresh water.
This preserves local aquifers, reduces the Groups fresh water costs and lowers the municipalitys water treatment costs.
The plant has capacity to treat 150 litres per second: and cost savings from the reduction of fresh water consumption will be fully realised in 2010 onwards.
Construction of a new shaft to extract mineral from the western zone of the San Carlos vein is underway, with the structure of the concrete head frame completed in December.
Sinking advanced 342 metres of a planned total 557 metres.
This US$19.1 million project, which will reduce haulage costs, is expected to be concluded by 1H 2011.
The second stage of the project will be developed six or seven years after the shaft is operational, to access ore resources at deeper levels.
In 2009 implementation of Six Sigma quality control methodology was initiated at the beneficiation plant to increase milling capacity and recoveries.
LEADERSHIP: Worlds largest primary silver mine.
CINEGA Annual gold production decreased by an expected 11.5% as a result of the decline in ore grade in the early part of the year.

Silver production for the full year increased due to the higher ore grade and ore milled.
Lead and zinc production decreased as a result of lower ore grades.
Surface and in-mine diamond drilling totalled 56,712 metres in 2009.
Based on proven and probable reserves, the expected life of the mine at current milling capacity is 13.5 years, compared to 13.2 years in 2008.
