ENRC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 20 Business Review Operating Review Overview ENRC is a leading diversified natural resources group, performing integrated mining, processing, energy, logistics and marketing operations.
The operations of the Group comprise: the mining and processing of chrome, manganese and iron ore: the smelting of ferroalloys: the production of iron ore pellets: the mining and processing of bauxite for the extraction of alumina and the production of aluminium: coal extraction and electricity generation: the transportation and sales of the Groups products: and, the production of copper and cobalt.
ENRCs production assets are largely located in the Republic of Kazakhstan: other assets, notably the Other Non-ferrous Division, are mainly located in Africa.
In 2009, the Group accounted for approximately 3% of Kazakhstans GDP.
The Group currently sells the majority of its products to Russia, China, Japan, Western Europe and the United States.
The Groups entities in 2009 employed approximately 70,300 2008: 67,600 people.
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group had revenue of US$3,831 million 2008: US$6,823 million and profit attributable to equity shareholders of US$1,045 million 2008: US$2,642 million.
ENRC has six key divisions: Ferroalloys, Iron Ore, Alumina and Aluminium, Energy, Logistics and Other Non-ferrous.
ENRC is a UK company with its registered office in London.
ENRCs shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange LSE and the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange KASE.
Production in the Ferroalloys Division was adversely affected by the much reduced demand for mediumand low-carbon ferrochrome and ferrosilicochrome and ferrosilicon.
In contrast, high-carbon ferrochrome production in Kazakhstan remained broadly steady on 2008.
Ferroalloys capacity utilisation at Kazchrome in 2009 was 83% 2008: 90%, rising to about 97% in Q4 2009 with only one furnace not in production at the year end.
Serov was more affected in 2009 as more capacity is committed to mediumand low-carbon ferrochrome and had capacity utilisation of 51% for 2009 Q2Q4 2008: 79%.
At the end of 2009 Serov had 11 of 17 furnaces in operation, with a capacity utilisation in Q4 2009 of about 77%.
Similarly, the higher cost Tuoli high-carbon ferrochrome facility remained closed until late Q2 2009 and capacity utilisation was 32% through 2009 Q4 2008: 19%.
At the end of 2009 three of four furnaces were in operation, with a capacity utilisation in Q4 2009 of about 75%.
Production of primary concentrate in the Iron Ore Division was broadly in line with 2008.
There was a switch in the production mix in H1 2009, as customer demand increased for the cheaper saleable concentrate product.
In H2 2009 demand for pellet recovered and increased significantly with production more balanced in this period.
In H2 2009 overall primary concentrate capacity utilisation for the Iron Ore Division was 99% H1 2009: 70%.
Production in the Alumina and Aluminium Division increased, with the benefit of a build-up in production at the aluminium smelter, which attained its full Phase 1 run rate in Q2 2008, and with Phase 2 production partially initiated in late 2009.
The Energy Division saw increased coal production and much increased electricity generation.
These particularly reflected the recovery in the Groups Kazakhstan-based production and greater third-party sales, and also increased power generation capacity being made available, having been taken off-line in late 2008 in response to the fall in demand.
Logistics Division shipments recovered progressively through the year to be broadly in line with 2008.

ENRC believes, based on 2009 data, that the Alumina and Aluminium Division is the worlds sixth largest supplier of traded After a weak start to the year, as a result of the global economic alumina by volume and is at the lower end of the global industry cost crisis, demand for aluminium started to pick up in mid-2009, curve for alumina and aluminium.
although commentators have suggested that a significant proportion of physical aluminium stocks were tied up in financial transactions.
The Alumina and Aluminium Divisions vertically integrated Worldwide aluminium stocks at the London Metal Exchange LME operations include: bauxite mines: a limestone mine: an alumina stood at 4.6 million tonnes at the end of 2009, double the 2.3 million refinery: an aluminium smelter: and a power station.
The smelter tonnes at the beginning of the year, with total inventories at 10 weeks allows the Alumina and Aluminium Division to process its own consumption.
Stronger demand combined with reduced availability alumina into aluminium.

Construction of a further 125 kt annual capacity, bringing tonne 2008: US$2,574 per tonne.
Consumption of aluminium is the total annual capacity to 250 kt per annum, is well underway and believed to have fallen in 2009 by about 2.9 million tonnes, or 8%, to is expected to be completed no later than Q2 2010, well ahead of the 34.5 million tonnes.
Production of aluminium is estimated to have original schedule.

ENRC believes aluminium production in 2009 to have exceeded consumption by as Competitive position much as 3 million tonnes.
Many aluminium producers implemented The Divisions focus on cost control, with the implementation of significant cuts in production capacity.
ENRC believes these cuts to several cost-reduction programmes in 2009, enabled ENRC to retain be mostly permanent at Western smelters but anticipates lots of its competitive cost position.
The Groups bauxite reserves idled capacity, notably in China, to be restarted, driven by the LME guarantee an on-going low-cost supply of raw materials for alumina aluminium price having risen to levels above US$2,000 per tonne.
Alumina and aluminium production benefit from the ability to buy low-cost energy from internal Group sources.
As a ENRC believes that in 2010 the aluminium production surplus will be result, ENRCs alumina and aluminium are both at the lower end of more limited as consumption is expected to rise by as much as 10%.
Restarting of idle capacity, LME-inventories becoming available for consumption and new capacity coming on-stream are factors which Production summary ENRC believes could negatively affect the LME aluminium price in The following table sets out the production volumes for each of the 2010.
