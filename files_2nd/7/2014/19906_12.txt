The proportion of capital committed to development will start to increase again in 2015 and 2016 as we make further progress with the 2015 and 2016 schemes and start committing capital to the 2017 and 2018 deliveries.
However, we expect the development weighting of our balance sheet to remain within our internal cap of 20% going forward.
The acceleration of our regional development activity during 2014 means that the London weighting is likely to fall to around 40% as the portfolio is built out.
STUDENT ACCOMMODATION YIELDS Over 2014, yields for student accommodation started to show some signs of modest compression.
Across our portfolio net initial yields moved from 6.5% to 6.3%, reflecting a change of 20bps from December 2013.
Around a quarter of this fall was due to portfolio mix as we completed two large London developments during the year.
The remainder of the movement reflects the increasing level of demand for good quality, well located purpose built student accommodation.
