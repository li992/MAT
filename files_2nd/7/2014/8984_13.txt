4,628 kt Ore extraction from the East Region and Bozymchak increased to 4,628 kt in 2014, 6% above the prior year.
The increase was ORE PRODUCTION primarily due to additional output from the commissioning of Bozymchak during 2014.
Ore production from the mature  mine was lower in 2014 with the 83.5 kt mine expected to cease operation within the next two years.
COPPER CATHODE PRODUCTION Ore output from the Orlovsky and Artemyevsky mines was consistent with the prior year and they produced 74% of the continuing operations copper in ore in 2014.

Copper in ore output benefited from the mining 3,435 koz of copper rich sections at Orlovsky in the first half of 2014 with grades exceeding 3.80% before reducing to just above 3% by the SILVER GRANULE PRODUCTION end of the year.
The average copper grade at Artemyevsky was also higher at an average of 1.78% compared to 1.68% in the prior year.
