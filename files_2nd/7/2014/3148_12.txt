Strategic report Operational review In this section we feature our operational Health and safety Sukari The LTIFR for 2014 was 0.39 per 200,000 manhours performance, exploration 2013: 0.36 per 200,000 manhours, with a total review, principal of 5,620,444 manhours worked during 2014 2013: 6,702,908.

frequency rate as a solid achievement considering Sukari is the first modern gold mine in Egypt.
Open pit The open pit delivered total material movement of 44,820kt for the year, an increase of 7% on the prior year and related to an increase in mining fleet capacity.
Whilst mining rates for the year were below the original forecast, as a result of delays in receipt of government approval for an increase in daily usage of AN received in October 2014, this did not impact production and rates have increased to the required level to feed the expanded plant.
The additional AN has allowed us to review our cut back strategies to ensure a continuous supply of ore from the open pit to feed the plant.
Ore production from the open pit was 10.94Mt at 0.80g t with an average head grade fed to the plant of 0.97g t. The ROM ore stockpile balance increased by 0.42kt to 2.17kt by the end of the year.
Mining was primarily from the Stage 3A area, which provided access to highergrade sulphide portions of the orebody during the second half of the year.
Underground mine Ore production from the underground mine was a record 968kt, a 65% increase on 2013.
The ratio of stopingtodevelopment ore mined increased, with 52% of stoping ore 504kt and 48% of development ore 464kt.
Ore tonnages from stopes increased by 78% on the previous year.
An average head grade of 6.1g t was mined in 2014, with stope production grade of 6.6g t and development grade of 5.5g t during the year.
Grade from development ore was below original expectations and was a decline from 2013, impacted by mining dilution with locally complex geological structures offsetting some areas of highgrade mineralisation.
Drill results support continuity of the higher grades into areas planned for further development.

32 | Centamin plc Annual report 2014 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements Shareholder information Exploration Sukari Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari exploration programme and drilling rates were progressively increased as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential highgrade extensions of the deposit.
The ore body has not yet been closed off to the north, south or at depth and further underground drilling of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2015, predominantly from both the Amun and Ptah declines.
2 Seven other prospects besides Sukari Hill have been identified on the 160km Sukari tenement area and exploration is being conducted under the principle that ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing processing plant.
Reverse circulation 24,441m and diamond drilling 703m programmes were completed during 2014 on the Quartz Ridge prospect to the east of the hill.
Diamond drilling to the south at the Kurdeman prospect 1,459m was also completed.
