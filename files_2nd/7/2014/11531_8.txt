Review of operations Ophir has 35 blocks in nine countries across Africa and Asia.
In Africa we have stakes in LNG and FLNG projects in Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea respectively.
In Asia, we have recently been awarded one deepwater block in Myanmar and agreed to acquire seven deepwater blocks inIndonesia.
During 2014 Ophir achieved two significant operational milestones the simultaneous operation of two deepwater drilling rigs and the first operated drill stem test DST, which resulted in the testing of hydrocarbons at the surface in Block R, Equatorial Guinea.
These successes demonstrate our substantial and continually growing capabilities as 6 an operator.
Our exploration and appraisal activity saw the addition of 97 mmboe of contingent resource with six out of 11 wells being successful.
Considerable progress was made in carrying forward the Equatorial Guinea FLNG project, which delivered all key milestones for the year.
1 In addition, during the year the Company has taken decisive action, acting countercyclically, to rebuild its exploration footprint.
2 Ophir was among the first to exploit a marked shift in the sector that allowed us to significantly 4 7 expand our footprint in new, untested plays 5 at compelling costs, thereby safeguarding 3 our strong balance sheet.

30 Ophir Energy plc Timor-Leste Governance Financial Supplementary Strategic report report statements information Overview Strategy Performance Outlook Successfully integrating Salamander within the Group will be among the key priorities in 2015.
This will include the integration of the asset base within our portfolio, as well as the teams and capabilities that Salamander will bring to Ophir.
Further priorities for 2015 are two-fold: continue to achieve operational milestones on existing assets, and, in line with our longer-term strategic priorities, continue to analyse and assess our new acreage with the aim to prepare Ophir for its next drilling campaign.
Exploration drilling in 2015 is likely to centre round the low cost, high value prospects in the G4 50 Block, Gulf of Thailand.
Elsewhere in the portfolio exploration activity will be focused on acquisition and interpretation of seismic data in Indonesia, Myanmar, Seychelles and Gabon.
There is one commitment well across the entirety of this portfolio.
Through the Salamander acquisition we now have production from the Sinphuhorm gas field and Bualuang oil field in Thailand.
This is expected to generate around $150 million of cash in 2015.
Work is also ongoing to determine the most capital efficient means of bringing the Bualuang contingent resource onstream.
The Kerendan gas field in Indonesia is likely to deliver first gas in H2 2016 once PLN has finished work on the transmission network.
In the second half of 2015 we expect to be in a position to high grade our prospect inventory and determine which blocks contain prospects that merit drilling and then be in position to take advantage of the softening rig market to contract rigs for our 2016 2017 drilling programme.
