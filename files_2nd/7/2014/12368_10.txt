Dukats total cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold decreased by 25% year-on-year to US$8.7 oz.
Beyond the effect All-in sustaining cash costs by mines were represented as follows: of the Rouble depreciation, this decrease in cash costs has been achieved as a result of stable grades and solid improvement in throughput at both the Omsukchan and Lunnoye plants.

The key driver of cost dynamics was the discontinued use of purchased ore with relatively low grade and higher cost, as well as higher recoveries at the CIP plant and higher production at the heap leach facility.
This cost performance was supported by the significant devaluation of the Russian Rouble, which offset the scheduled decline in average grade processed from 5.7 g t to 5.3 GE g t Khakanja 909 1,065 -15% year-on-year.
