Operations 1 We were pleased with our mining performance during the year with each key area showing record output.
At 880,000 tonnes, mined metal production showed an increase of 1.1%.
Production in the second half of FY2014 was lower than what we had planned initially due to slower than expected ramp up of underground mining projects and changes in mining sequence, wherein preference was given to primary mine development.
The integrated production of refined zinc was 743,000 tonnes.
This 12.6% increase over the previous year was driven by three main factors: higher mined metal production, improved operational efficiencies and higher roaster availability.
There were no sales of Zinc MIC whereas 61,000 tonnes were sold in FY201213.
Integrated production of refined lead was up 10.3% at 118,000 tonnes due to better utilisation of smelter capacity.

This was caused by an unplanned maintenance shut down at Skorpion after a tank failure in Q3 FY2013 14.
Accidents at Lisheen and BMM in Q1 FY201314 also impacted the production.
2 Markets As stated earlier the global market including the south African market is seeing a rise in demand due to higher consumption and thereby leading to higher premiums.
Unit costs We saw an increase in the unit cost of production to US$1,167 per tonne, up from US$1,092 per tonne in FY201213.
This was mainly driven by lower production due to lower ore grades and increasing treatment and refining charges.

Operating profit was US$76.1 million, down by 31.2%.
This was the result of lower volumes, lower zinc and lead prices, and higher costs.
THE COMING YEAR Outlook The Lisheen mine is scheduled for closure in FY201415 and we are looking at further exploration opportunities.
At Skorpion and BMM, we are conducting studies to extend mine life.

This was mainly due to lower sales by the BALCO 270MW power plant, resulting from lower power tariffs and weak demand.
This was partially offset by marginal higher volumes from the Jharsuguda 2,400MW power plant.
