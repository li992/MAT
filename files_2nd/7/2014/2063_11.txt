20 STRATEGIC REPORT OPERATING REVIEW Despite the challenges of a lower oil price and the many risks we have to manage on a daily basis, I expect to see us deliver higher volumes in 2015.
SAMI ISKANDER | CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER 2014 was a year of solid progress in our Upstream business February.
The plant is operating at levels of capacity UPSTREAM as production increases from our growth assets in Brazil and to be expected during a commissioning phase.
The Australia largely offset a 13% decline from our base assets, current expectation is to start LNG production from a TOTAL OPERATING PROFIT driven principally by reductions in Egypt and the USA.
This should enable BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Intotal, production volumes declined by 4% in 2014. us toreach plateau production ofaround 8mtpa in mid-2016.
Increased production from Brazil also drove an increase $3 947m in the proportion of oil in our portfolio from 15% to 22% In Brazil, we saw significant production growth as the first of the total, although this was offset by lower average three FPSOs in the Santos Basin reached full capacity, and 2014 21% realised oil prices which were down around 9% before the we commissioned two further FPSOs at Iracema South and 2013 $4 967m benefit ofour programme of hedging the Brent oil price.
This enabled net production to double in2014 to an average rate of 78 kboed over the year, and The result was total revenues of $12.0 billion, down 1% inJanuary 2015, we were producing at around 130 kboed, EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION from 2013. making Brazil our highest producing country.
In2015, VOLUMES NET Costs increased during the year due to the ramp-up we expect to see further production increases as the ofproduction in Brazil and higher maintenance costs and Iracema South and Sapinho North FPSOs continue 606kboed higher costs arising from new developments coming their ramp up.
We are on track to commission our sixth onstream in the UK.
As a result, Upstream operating FPSO at Iracema North towards the end of 2015.

Despite the challenges of a lower oil price and the 2013 633 kboed We made good progress with our key growth projects.
many risks we have to manage on a daily basis, I expect to see us deliver higher volumes in 2015.
Iwould like to At our QCLNG project in Australia, despite the thank all of our employees for the commitment and challenges and cost overruns encountered during dedication they have shown throughout the year and construction, we achieved themajor milestone look forward to building onour successes in 2015. of start-up of the first LNG train.
