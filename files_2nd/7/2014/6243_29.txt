Fresnillo Strategic Corporate Financial Today Report Governance Statements Strategy Performance Review of Operations The challenges encountered this year provided us with an opportunity to adapt, innovate, modify and enhance our operations such that our long-term outlook is secure.
We produced a record 45.0 million ounces of silver in 2014 including the Silverstream mainly as a result of higher ore throughput and maintenance efficiencies at Saucito and greater contribution from the Silverstream: these factors more than offset the expected lower ore grade at Fresnillo and higher dilution and development delays in some of that mines stopes, as well as lower than expected silverore grade at Cinega.
Gold production of 596 thousand ounces declined slightly from 2013, mainly as a result of the stoppage of operations at Soledad-Dipolos and the expected lower ore grade at Cinega, as well as technical and capacity issues associated with the ramp-up of operations at Herradura: an increase in ore deposited at Noche Buena and higher contribution from Saucito supported gold production levels.
We took vital steps to increase development rates and mitigate the decrease in ore grades at Fresnillo: optimised milling capacity at Cinega: started up the dynamic leaching plant at Herradura and ramped up production at the mine following the temporary explosives suspension from the previous year, putting in place the steps to address technical and capacity issues in 2015: acquired Newmonts 44% stake in Penmont, consolidating our position in one of Mexicos richest gold belts: and ramped up capacity at Noche Buena following an expansion of the processing plant.
Our development projects advanced according to plan, with the completion of Saucito II on time and budget, and construction advancing at San Julin toward its expected commencement in 4Q2015.
Exploration mainly focused on areas of influence at current operating mines and key exploration projects, with notable findings at MegaCentauro, Centauro Deep, Guanajuato and Rodeo.
Despite the lower price assumptions used to estimate resources and reserves, gold resources and reserves increased 1.7% and 45.0% respectively: silver reserves rose 21.3% and resources declined 6.2%.
We also obtained OHSAS 18001 certification at Fresnillo, Penmont and Cinega, an international occupational health and safety standard: implemented safety action plans following situational assessment audits at every unit: adopted new industry best practices in stakeholder engagement within our communities: and improved the gender balance in our operations.
Despite the increase in unit prices of key materials such as diesel and electricity, as well as the 5.5% increase in wages paid in Mexican pesos, our focus on efficiency gains and cost controls, combined with the benefit of the 4.1% devaluation of the average Mexican peso US dollar exchange rate, allowed us to reduce cash cost per ounce of metal produced at almost every mine this year, maintaining our position asalow cost producer.
