Kodos-1, in the Kerio Basin encountered hydrocarbon shows close to the basin bounding fault.
The next well in the basin, Epir-1, which lies 25 km north of Kodos-1, was drilled and encountered encouraging oil and wet gas shows during January 2015.
Both wells demonstrated a working hydrocarbon system and further exploration activities will be considered in the basin following evaluation of the data.
Further exploration drilling will be carried out in 2015 with the aim of opening a new oil basin.

The French Guiana drilling programme was completed in 2013 and Tullow is currently incorporating the results from the 2013 wells into our geological model so we can better understand the considerable remaining prospectivity and determine the future licence work programme.
Although the costs relating to the Zaedyus discovery and associated licence have been written-off due to current oil prices and as no capital is being allocated to this area in the foreseeable future, Tullow believes that French Guiana remains highly prospective.
