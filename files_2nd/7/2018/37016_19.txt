Strategic report Operating review Our operating review analyses how we have performed in the year against our strategy Valuation Property values fell in the year driven by adverse conditions in the UK retail market and weakening sentiment in the retail property investment market as illustrated by the low levels of transactions.
With valuers assuming that investors have increased their focus on current income, their valuations reflect a greater weighting in the overall opinion towards net initial yields.
The table below shows the main components of the 1,405.0 million property revaluation deficit: UK super-regional centres: performed stronger than other intu UK assets, recognising the continuing attraction of this asset class which remains key to retailers requirements.
These centres have reduced in value by 13 per cent in aggregate, with intu Braehead an outlier, down 20 per cent, as it continues to be impacted by the relatively weaker economic and uncertain political situation in Scotland UK major city centres: on average values have fallen by 16 per cent reflecting weaker investor demand for some of these centres.
Within this category, those super-prime assets in the busiest city centres have performed better, with smaller reductions at the likes of Manchester Arndale, intu Eldon Square, Newcastle and intu Milton Keynes Spanish centres: valuations have increased marginally given the continued demand for top-quality Spanish centres Spanish developments: small decrease due to pre-development expenditure in the year on intu Costa del Sol UK other including developments: predominantly represents valuation movements on developments and assets valued below 200 million each.
These assets, which represent only a small proportion of the portfolio, have seen higher revaluation deficits due to lower levels of potential asset management opportunities.
This category also includes intu Watford non like-for-like and intu Chapelfield 31 December 2017 included at 100 per cent and 31 December 2018 included at 50 per cent Valuation Market value Like-for-like revaluation At 31 December At 31 December Deficit Deficit 2018 2017 surplus surplus m m m % UK super-regional centres 5,613.6 6,373.7 824.7 13.0 UK major city centres 1,875.2 2,223.4 363.1 16.3 Spanish centres 628.8 606.8 8.8 1.5 Total like-for-like 8,117.6 9,203.9 1,179.0 11.8 Spanish developments 232.3 212.8 7.2 3.4 UK other including developments 817.5 1,112.5 218.8 20.3 Total 9,167.4 10,529.2 1,405.0 13.3 The weighted average net initial yield topped-up at 31 December 2018 increased by 62 basis points in the year to 4.98 per cent.
On a like-for-like basis, ERV decreased by 3.9 per cent as valuers have in general taken a more conservative view on rental values for larger space units and on the overall intu Puerta Venecia: there is continued rental values at intu Braehead, intu Victoria Centre and intu Potteries.

The divergence from intus performance is considered most likely to represent a timing difference with intus valuations.
In our view, once the near-term yield correction has taken place, income performance rather than changing yields is then likely to be, for a time, the main driver of valuations.
Growing like-for-like net rental income Like-for-like net rental income growth is our key income measure.
In the year, we grew like-for-like net rental income by 0.6 per cent, similar to the increase of 0.5 per cent in 2017.
The key components of the growth are shown in the table below: Group like-for-like net rental income 2018 2017 % % Rent reviews and improved lettings 1.3 2.2 Capital investment 0.2 0.4 Vacancy impact -0.1 -0.4 1 Administrations and CVAs -1.9 -1.4 Other eg: bad debt: surrender premiums: headlease adjustments 1.1 -0.3 Increase in like-for-like net rental income 0.6 0.5 1 2 017 was originally disclosed as units held for redevelopment.

Delivering operational excellence The objective of delivering operational excellence underpins how we operate our centres.
Through a range of metrics, we monitor our performance to ensure we are meeting both our customer and retailer requirements.
Operational metrics 2018 2017 Footfall -1.6% 0.1% Retailer sales like-for-like centres -2.3% -2.1% Rent to estimated sales excluding anchors and major space users 12.4% 12.1% Net promoter score 75 70 Unprompted brand awareness 28% 26% Prompted brand awareness 76% 71% Footfall in our centres has been robust considering the unusual weather events in 2018 with periods of severe snow followed by the high temperatures through the summer.

The growth was driven by promotional activity which included Stylist Operations Director Lives first consumer event outside London at intu Trafford Centre and increased demand from global brands such as Christian Dior and Calvin Klein using our high footfall centres to reach a wider audience.
Optimising our winning destinations Our focus is to ensure our centres continue to be the winning destinations, where customers and retailers want to be, both now and in the future.
Over the last four years, from 2015 to 2018, intu and our tenants have invested over 1 billion in our centres, with over 500 million coming from intu and a similar level coming from our tenants, predominantly introducing their latest shopfits.
Our near-term pipeline consists of projects that improve the position of our flagship centres to meet customer and retailer needs as we evolve the retail environments, enhance the catering mix and expand the leisure offer.
Investment in 2018 In 2018 we have invested 201 million in our centres on projects enhancing the value and appeal of these destinations.
This includes: 67 million on completing the 380,000 sq ft intu Watford extension which opened in September 2018.
Around 80 per cent of the space is now open or exchanged, with the latest signings including Uniqlo, Hollister and Hugo Boss.
A further 15 per cent is in advanced negotiations and we anticipate 95 per cent of the space will be open and trading by spring 2019 40 million on the leisure extension at intu Lakeside.
This scheme is 93 per cent pre-let with Market Halls, a new communal dining hall concept, the most recent signing.

Revenue generated by intu Experiences We are committed to investing 238 million: at intu Broadmarsh we appointed the main contractor for this mixed-use regeneration project which is anticipated to cost 89 million in total and expected to deliver a 23m stabilised initial yield of around 7 per cent.
We have signed The Light cinema and Hollywood Bowl, with 45 per cent of the project either exchanged or in advanced negotiations.
The redevelopment is expected to complete in the second half of 2021 at intu Trafford Centre, we have commenced construction of the expansion and transformation of Barton Square with 62 per cent of the space pre-let and a further 11 per cent in advanced negotiations.
The 75 million project, expected to deliver a return of between 6 and 7 per cent, involves enclosing the courtyard, enhancing interiors, trading from an additional level and providing a fashion offer for the first time at Barton Square with Primark anchoring the development, which is expected to open in early 2020 at intu Lakeside and intu Watford, we have the remaining costs to complete these projects at intu Costa del Sol, we have committed 12 million to complete the final designs and resolve any outstanding planning matters.
We have started the tendering process for some of the key construction packages see below for more details on the full project active asset management projects total 40 million and include 12 million for enhancing the look and feel of intu Merry Hill and 8 million for a mall refresh at intu Lakeside to tie in with the opening of the leisure extension.
Other projects are across all centres and are expected to deliver a range of returns between 6 and 10 per cent dependent on the nature of the individual project Our pipeline of planned projects amounts to 190 million: at intu Costa del Sol, we expect to clear the final planning matters in 2019.
With work on the final design ongoing, we are also targeting our required level of pre-lets in the next 12 months.
This 255,000 sq m development is expected to cost around 670 million.
Our business plan provides for the introduction of a joint venture partner at the start of construction and limits our outlay on the project Management viewpoint to around 188 million which we expect to be mostly funded by borrowings specific to the project There is no doubt that active asset management projects total 120 million and are for projects of varying there is great synergy between sizes across all centres hotel and residential uses and our unique destinations such Mixed-use opportunities as intu Lakeside.

The city centre locations also offer opportunities for destinations thrive.
Rebecca Ryman Regional Managing Director Mixed-use opportunities being evaluated include residential, hotels and other uses.
Initial work has highlighted the potential for around 5,000 residential units and nearly 600 hotel rooms.
Initially,  residential opportunities to create a total of circa 1,700 units have been identified which, if fully developed, could in aggregate produce a yield 46 intu properties plc Annual report 2018 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information of around 5 per cent on total development costs, excluding land, of around 240 million.
The most advanced of these projects is at intu Lakeside, where we could deliver around 1,000 residential units.
In addition to the residential and hotel opportunities, further mixed-use opportunities relating to office, flexible working spaces, business lounges and service-oriented uses have been identified that could generate attractive incremental returns to our current rental income stream.
Many of these options have a relatively low capital outlay, are quick to implement and take advantage of the current configuration of the centres.
Our plan for 1,000 residential units at All these opportunities, which are under active consideration, would create value intu Lakeside directly but moreover would increase the overall attractiveness and catchment of the centres.
Making smart use of capital In line with our strategy, we continue to recycle capital to focus on our winning destinations where we have the opportunity to deliver superior returns.
Financial strength We consider the structure of our borrowings, predominantly using flexible asset specific non-recourse arrangements 84 per cent of overall debt, to be appropriate for our concentrated portfolio.
We have refinanced or entered new facilities of over 500 million in 2018 see financial review at competitive rates illustrating that debt markets continue to be supportive of the highest quality retail property.
We will continue to undertake debt refinancing activity on a timely basis or where it is attractive for the Group to do so.
Cash and available facilities at 31 December 2018 were 548 million and our debt to assets ratio was 53.1 per cent.
As stated in our strategy, we are targeting to reduce this to below 50 per cent over time and ensure we maintain adequate financial headroom.
Our facilities have covenant headroom to deal with falls in valuations.
By way of example, a 10 per cent fall in capital values, from the December 2018 valuations, would create a covenant shortfall of only 1 million which could be cured from available facilities.
We have minimal debt maturities before 2021, with a weighted average debt maturity of 5.8 years at 31 December 2018.
With more than 5 billion of debt refinanced over the last six years, we have proven we have very good access to both the public and private capital markets and over this period reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 5.2 per cent to 4.2 per cent.
Our average cost of debt includes legacy debt on intu Trafford Centre 0.7 billion: cost of debt 6.0 per cent, which pre-dates the asset becoming part of the intu portfolio in 2011 and a first mortgage debenture stock 2027 0.2 billion: cost of debt 9.9 per cent originally issued over 25 years ago.
Excluding these two facilities, the weighted average cost of debt of all other facilities is 3.5 per cent.
Disposals In January 2018, we completed the formation of a joint venture with LaSalle Investment Management for them to take ownership of 50 per cent of intu Chapelfield, Norwich for an initial net consideration of 148 million.
In line with our strategy, in late 2018 we disposed of 23 million of sundry assets at 6 per cent above their December 2017 book values.
Our disposals in the last four years are over 1 billion as we have disposed of noncore assets and introduced partners on other centres.
We have flexibility for further disposals or part disposals, as around two-thirds, by value, of our portfolio is intu Milton Keynes successfully refinanced 100 per cent owned.
