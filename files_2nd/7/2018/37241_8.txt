The separate clay plant, which can process a further 5 million as less clay material was stripped to provide access to future tonnes per annum, began commissioning in the fourth quarter of sulphide sections.
As a result, total ore extraction was 11% lower 2016 and achieved commercial production on 1 July 2017. than the prior year as the reduced clay extraction more than offset the increase in sulphide extraction to feed the main plant.
