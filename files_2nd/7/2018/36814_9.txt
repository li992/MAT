HomeServe plc Annual Report & Accounts 2018 35 Operating review HomeServe had a very good year with strong underlying performance boosted by strategic acquisitions, notably in North America with the policy book of Dominion Products and Services Inc. DPS, in the UK with Help-Link Limited and the AAs home emergency policy book and in France where the acquisition of Electrogaz marked a first step into HVAC installations.
Total customers increased to 8.4m from 7.8m and the Group now has over 570 affinity partner relationships that provide access to 109m households, up from 102m in the prior year.
Customers continue to value HomeServes products and the Group retention rate remained strong at 82%.
The continued organic success of the North American business allied to the acquisition of DPS and the successful integration of Utility Service Partners USP saw North American adjusted operating profit grow by 129% to 48.6m, as the Group delivered total adjusted operating profit of 153.4m, up 29%.
Over half of the Groups profits are now generated overseas, with further profit progression in France and Spain complementing outstanding growth in North America.
The UK remains highly cash generative and the largest single contributor to Group profits.
The New Markets segment contains the Groups investments in international development, the Home Experts opportunity via Checkatrade and Habitissimo and its Italian associate.
