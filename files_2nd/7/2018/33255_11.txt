STRATEGIC REPORT OPERATING REVIEW Operational performance Full year production of 521,980 ounces was ahead of the initial 2018 production guidance of 435,000 to 475,000 ounces for the year, due to the strong operating performance at all three sites, despite the challenging operating environment, although 32% lower than 2017 due to the transition to reduced operations at Bulyanhulu and to stockpile processing at Buzwagi.
Full year gold sales of 520,380 ounces were broadly in line with production.
AISC of US$905 per ounce sold and cash costs of US$680 per ounce sold were both below the 2018 full year guidance ranges of US$935 to US$985 per ounce for AISC and US$690 to US$720 per ounce for cash costs, mainly driven by the higher production while AISC was further assisted by lower capital expenditure.
Total tonnes mined during the year amounted to 17.4 million tonnes, 47% lower than 2017, while ore tonnes mined of 4 million tonnes were 70% lower than 2017, mainly as a result of the 01 cessation of mining activities and the focus on 01 North Mara 03 stockpile processing at Buzwagi and reduced 02 Gold production 336,055oz operations at Bulyanhulu.
AISC US$866 oz Ore tonnes processed amounted to 9.3 million SEE PAGE 38 tonnes, 6% higher than 2017 driven by the improved throughput of reprocessed tailings 02 Buzwagi at Bulyanhulu and better than expected Gold production 145,440oz processing plant performance at Buzwagi.
Head AISC US$977 oz grade for the year excluding tailings retreatment of 2.2g t was 33% lower than the corresponding SEE PAGE 40 figure of 3.3g t in 2017.
This was due to 03 Bulyanhulu increased processing of lower grade stockpiles Gold production 40,485oz at Buzwagi, which was partly offset by higher AISC US$786 oz head grades at North Mara as a result of the higher grades received from the open pit mine.
