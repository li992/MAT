Strategic report Governance Financials GROUP OPERATING REVIEW Continuing to deliver growth BCA performance The Group has delivered another year of strong profit growth, performing above market expectations with continued progress in all divisions.
The result was driven by a combination of organic volume growth, increasing penetration of services, improved efficiency and the benefits of greater operational integration of the acquired businesses.

The significant increases in revenue arose from the sale of more vehicles acquired through the Vehicle Buying division, more vehicles sold under outsourced remarketing contracts where the full sales value is included in revenue in the UK Vehicle Remarketing division, and the full year impact of the Paragon acquisition along with continued organic growth of services across all divisions.
Strong volume performance in each of the divisions, increased penetration of services, and internal efficiencies, including through increased internal transport, all contributed to an adjusted EBITDA for the year of 159.5m 2017: 135.6m, an increase of 17.6%.
UK Vehicle Remarketing adjusted EBITDA grew by 17.6% driven by 6.5% growth in vehicle sold volumes, the increased penetration of BCA Partner Finance and the execution of outsourced remarketing contracts.
International Vehicle Remarketing saw a 4.3% increase in volumes which, together with higher export volumes, increased penetration of transport services and a favourable exchange rate, generated a 14.9% increase in adjusted EBITDA.
Vehicle Buying adjusted EBITDA increased by 17.9% as a result of a 12.9% increase in WeBuyAnyCar volume and a slightly higher average sale value per vehicle, delivered while maintaining control of the cost base.
Automotive Services adjusted EBITDA increased by 25.0% due to the increased use of the Groups own internal transport fleet and the full year impact of the Paragon and Supreme Wheels acquisitions.
Non-GAAP measures Key Performance Indicator adjusted EBITDA Management uses an adjusted profit measure to monitor the ongoing profitability of the Group, which is defined as Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA adjusted for significant or non-recurring items SONR.
The significant or non-recurring items that are excluded from EBITDA to calculate adjusted EBITDA are as follows: acquisition expenses and gains and losses on business combinations, disposals and changes in ownership: income and expenses that are significant or non-recurring or non-trading in nature, including business closure costs, restructuring costs and onerous lease provisions: impairment charges and accelerated depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill: amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition of businesses.
The Directors primarily use the adjusted EBITDA measure when making decisions about the Groups activities as it is the most reliable and relevant profit measure across all segments.
As this is a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA measures used by other entities may not be calculated in the same way and hence are not directly comparable.
Key Performance Indicator adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is presented in addition to the disclosures required by IAS 33, Earnings per Share, to align the adjusted earnings measure with the performance measure reviewed by the Directors.
The Directors consider that this gives a more appropriate indication of underlying performance.
Adjusted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders, adjusted for significant or non-recurring items and their associated tax impact by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the period.

Operating profit of 87.6m increased by 13.3m, driven by the 23.9m growth in adjusted EBITDA set out above.
This was offset by an increase in amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 1.7m to 40.2m as a result of the full year impact of the Paragon acquisition and a 7.2m increase in other SONR items.
The current year other SONR items included 5.5m of management restructuring costs as part of our efficiency improvement programme and 1.0m of costs related to the move to a Premium Listing, partially offset by a 1.7m profit on the sale and leaseback of site developments at Manchester and Bedford.
In the prior year, other SONR items amounted to an income of 2.4m, which comprised a 5.3m profit on the sale and leaseback of the Birmingham Perry Barr site, offset by acquisition related costs of 2.9m.

The volume of vehicles sold through our UK auctions has continued to grow, up 6.5% on prior year.
This was driven by strong growth in volume sourced from the Vehicle Buying division, alongside new customer wins in both the OEM and franchise and non-franchise dealer sectors, with increasing volumes from existing customers.
UK Vehicle Remarketing revenue increased by 24.9% to 941.4m, driven primarily by the growth of outsourced remarketing contract volume where the full sales value is included within revenue as well as growth of remarketing volume and penetration of remarketing services.
Outsourced remarketing has grown as vendors are attracted to the speed, liquidity and simplicity the service provides, while allowing them to remove the costs of running what is to them a non-core operation.
Penetration of auction services including valeting, BCA Assured and smart repairs continues to grow year-on-year.
A greater number of customers have also incorporated additional services including the Groups Dealer Pro see page 13 and AutosOnShow see page 32 applications to improve control of their valuation, inventory management and imaging.
The ability for selected partners to fund part-exchange vehicles and the introduction of dedicated BCA Partner Finance branded sales programmes have contributed to an increase in the number of vehicles funded through BCA Partner Finance.
Penetration has increased to 12.6% of all UK Vehicle Remarketing vehicles sold in March 2018 March 2017: 11.3%.
The resultant asset-backed loan book grew to 148.4m 2017: 113.4m reflecting the increased volume and a higher average value of the vehicles financed at the year end.
BCA Partner Finance funded 841m of vehicles during the year 2017: 577m.
Adjusted EBITDA per vehicle increased by 10.2% to 97, reflecting the increased penetration of products and services, improved operational efficiency through increased volume throughput and expanded sales programmes.
This was achieved despite a backdrop of legislative changes leading to higher costs of labour, business rates and insurance premium tax.
Adjusted EBITDA margin in the UK of 10.5% 2017: 11.1% is slightly lower as a result of increased outsourced remarketing contracts, where we recognise the full vehicle sale revenue, reducing the reported margin percentage.

Increased volume, service uptake and favourable exchange rates delivered revenue of 154.3m, a growth of 14.0% 8.4% at constant exchange rates.
Adjusted EBITDA growth of 14.9% 9.2% at constant exchange rates, reflects the increased volume and operational gearing from the extensively online model.
If measured at constant prior year exchange rates, revenue and adjusted EBITDA per unit would have been 406 and 79 2017: 390 and 76, growth of 4.1% and 3.9% respectively.
The average exchange rate for the year was 1.136:1 compared to 1.194:1 in the prior year.
Management continues to promote auction as a disposal channel and is building strong relationships with vendors and buyers across Europe.
In the year BCA MarketPrice, the Groups European dealer-focused part-exchange valuation tool, drove growth in remarketing volumes, while helping vendors to maximise their part-exchange performance.
BCA MarketPrice provided 1.2m valuations 2017: 1.1m to a dealer base that has grown to 2,200 dealers 2017: 1,800.
The Groups geographical coverage, flexible sites and online platforms, supported by its ability to collect, inspect, store and deliver vehicles, ensures accessibility to a large number of buyers through both physical and digital auctions.
This infrastructure has the capacity to allow efficient growth as demand from vendors and buyers increases across Europe and beyond see more on vehicle exports on page 29.
The newly created European transport brokerage operation continues to develop by sourcing and managing the efficient movement of vehicles to support the increasing volume of exports.
During the year, our operations in Europe have experienced differing underlying market conditions ranging from favourable markets driven by vehicle exports in Denmark and Sweden, stable markets in the majority of countries and more challenging market conditions in Germany and Italy.
Our international portfolio of established vehicle remarketing operations allows us to sustain development in comparison to nationally focused competitors.
Vehicle Buying The Vehicle Buying division incorporates WeBuyAnyCar in the UK and vehicle buying operations in Europe.

The increased volume and higher average price per vehicle drove revenue 15.3% higher to 920.3m.
Rigorous inventory management and a varied auction programme across a number of the Groups vehicle remarketing centres, allow us to consistently sell WeBuyAnyCar vehicles within an average of ten days from purchase, minimising holding risks.
The business model and evolving advertising have focused on communicating and delivering an easy, trusted, convenient and secure experience to consumers.
With a network of over 225 branches, WeBuyAnyCar is conveniently located, close to customers throughout the UK, and makes offers on all vehicles, regardless of mileage, age or condition.
Our business model attracts a diverse range of vehicles and during the year we have purchased across the whole spectrum, from 58,000 superminis to 108 super cars including a 216,000 Rolls-Royce Wraith Coupe.
The oldest car purchased was a 40 year old MG Midget 1500, and the rarest purchases included a Corvette Stingray, a Ford Dorchester, a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder and a Pontiac Firebird.
BCA Marketplace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2018 19 GROUP OPERATING REVIEW continued We are proud that in the year, webuyanycar.
com maintained 5 stars out of 5 in Trust-pilot ratings.
We continue to focus on providing a transparent service and earning increased customer trust in the service we provide.
The increased volume of vehicles sold drove a 17.9% improvement in adjusted EBITDA to 23.0m 2017: 19.5m.
The ongoing refinement of our valuation process allows margins to be tightly controlled while continuing to deliver growth in volumes.
In Europe, our vehicle buying businesses focus on purchasing batches of vehicles to remarket through the International Vehicle Remarketing division.
They target opportunities to drive increased remarketing volume, raise awareness of auctions and deliver increased value or efficiency for OEMs and corporates.
Revenue in International Vehicle Buying increased to 60.2m, up 54.8%.
These operations enrich the variety of vehicles available to the International Vehicle Remarketing division, so are managed to cover operating costs within the Vehicle Buying division.
Automotive Services The Automotive Services division was created to bring together the Groups new and used vehicle storage, preparation, handling, enhancement, refurbishment and transport capabilities.
This integration has enabled the Group to provide a comprehensive suite of services to customers in a more connected manner.

BCA Vehicle Services won the tender as port of entry operator for the  Alliance at Southampton.
The anticipated slowdown in new car sales slightly suppressed profitability, while increased inspections and storage volumes were handled, and improved incentivised customer service levels were achieved.
BCA Fleet Solutions continued to drive customer service improvements and develop new relationships with rental and fleet companies resulting in a number of new long-term contracts.
Linked to these service developments, BCA Fleet Solutions is investing in state of the art technology including facilities for handling electric and hybrid vehicles.
Further progress has been made in the efficiency of refurbishment of BCA's own vehicles, delivering a better quality inventory for buyers whilst protecting residual value.
During the year, BCA Logistics continued to perform well, driven by prior year improvements in operating efficiencies, increased inspect and collect volumes and vehicle movements.
The inspection platform was enhanced and the majority of inspections including branch based inspections were migrated to the new platform, delivering improved customer service levels.
The business unit completed its move to a new centralised operational headquarters located in Solihull providing increased capacity for this growing operation.
Three years ago we performed no internal transport, but over 46% of the vehicle movements arranged by the UK Vehicle Remarketing division are now delivered internally by BCA Automotive, increasing the overall integration of the business and efficiency of transport.
Vehicle movement costs have reduced for BCA Automotive and BCA Logistics through the use of hub and spoke transport routes.

Divisional operating reviews focus on adjusted EBITDA in order to give a more meaningful analysis, since depreciation, interest and tax are principally managed centrally on behalf of the Group and SONR items do not directly correlate to continuing divisional operating performance.
A reconciliation of divisional adjusted EBITDA to operating profit is provided above.
Year ended Year ended 2 1 April 2018 April 2017 m m 1 Total adjusted EBITDA 159.5 135.6 Less: Depreciation and amortisation 26.9 25.2 2 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 40.2 38.5 2 Other SONR 4.8 2.4 Operating profit 87.6 74.3 Net finance costs 11.7 17.9 Profit before income tax 75.9 56.4 Taxation 18.9 15.3 Non controlling interest 0.5 0.2 Retained profit 56.5 40.9 Financing costs The net finance costs in the year were 11.7m 2017: 17.9m.
The lower net finance costs were driven by the full year impact of the February 2017 refinancing and lower amortisation of capitalised debt issue costs, partially offset by an increase in LIBOR during the year.
The prior year finance costs included the non-recurring write off of 4.9m of debt issue costs in relation to the previous facility.
Taxation The tax charge of 18.9m 2017: 15.3m included a 9.1m net tax credit in relation to SONR items, including 8.2m relating to amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
This resulted in an effective tax rate for the year of 24.9% 2017: 27.1%.
Excluding the impact of the other SONR items in the year, the Group had an underlying tax rate of 23.1% 2017: 21.8%.
The effective tax rate for the year of 24.9% was higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 19.0% as a result of permanent disallowable items, adjustments in respect of prior periods in both the UK and overseas, and the impact of higher income tax rates in Europe.
Permanently disallowable items comprise expenditure incurred that does not qualify for a tax deduction in the territory in which it arises.
The increase in permanently disallowable expenditure is a result of the higher level of cost incurred in the year as well as a remeasurement of tax risk in key overseas territories.
Prior period adjustments relate to changes in the composition of deferred tax assets in the UK which is offset by additional income tax payable in respect of prior periods in Europe following the closure of a tax audit overseas.
Management expects the Groups underlying tax rate to remain in the low twenties over the short to medium term, before the anticipated impact of the UKs future reduction in the corporation tax rate from 19.0% to 17.0% reduces the overall tax rate from 2020 onwards.
The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates.
Where points are investigated, the Group considers each issue on its merits and, where appropriate, holds a provision in respect of the potential tax liability which may arise.
There are no provisions that are individually or collectively material.
