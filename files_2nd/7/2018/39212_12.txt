Portfolio positioning by business plan Each asset in the portfolio has an income led business plan and is viewed in terms of its ability to deliver sustainable income returns and or growth.
Approximately 79 per cent of the current portfolio is classified as either Core income or Growth income.
Core income assets typically exhibit long lease lengths, high cash on cash returns and are predominantly multilet, often with some form of indexation.
Growth income assets constitute approximately 37 per cent of the current portfolio.
These assets are typically lower yielding but with higher intrinsic growth prospects.
18 per cent of the portfolio comprises properties which have shorter term, more intensive asset management plans underway.
These opportunities are typically income led with a significant percentage of pre-let income being secured before development commences.
The Companys ability to create marginal revenue and enhance the quality of assets is fundamental to its overall strategy.
Where RDI has maximised the potential of individual assets or where the market is prepared to pay a higher price than its view of the assets intrinsic value, the Company will look to sell and recycle that capital into new opportunities.
Approximately 3 per cent of the portfolio is currently considered mature with a number of those assets being considered for sale.

On a local currency basis, likeforlike valuations increased by 0.6 per cent.

The overall portfolio currently reflects a 5.8 per cent EPRA topped up net initial yield and a 6.3 per cent reversionary yield.
The UK Commercial portfolio delivered the strongest growth, increasing 23.1 million or 7.5 per cent, largely as a result of the strength of the industrial and distribution portfolio which increased 17.7 per cent or 20.2 million, and London offices which were up 1.8 per cent or 1.7million.

Acquisitions The first half of the year included the acquisition of both the IHL hotel portfolio and the LSO portfolio.
These acquisitions have increased our exposure to London and the South East, and represent sectors and operating platforms which provide yield premiums from high quality real estate.
Both of these acquisitions were successfully integrated into the portfolio during the second half of the year.
This capital allocation has created a stronger alignment of the portfolio to sectors supported by strong occupier demand and positive structural change.
Post the year end, exposure to the industrial and distribution sector was increased through a 26.0 million forward funding of a development of twomodern distribution units in Bicester and the acquisition of a multi-let industrial estate in Farnborough for 26.3 million, at a net initial yield of6.2 per cent.
