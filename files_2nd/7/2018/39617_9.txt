Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Financial review Reported results and Alternative Performance Measures APMs Reported results are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
Reported results are set out in the section entitled Presentation of results and Alternative Performance Measures on pages 34 to 35 and the audited Financial Statements on pages 106 to 110.
In addition to reported results, the Groups performance in this Financial Review is also explained through the use of APMs that are not defined under IFRS.
Management considers that these measures provide a more meaningful basis on which to analyse business performance.
They are consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by Management and reported to the Board.
The APMs used are explained in the paragraphs entitled Alternative Performance Measures on pages 35 to 38 and reconciliations to the closest measure prescribed under IFRS are provided where appropriate.
The analysis of underlying movements in adjusted results is set out in the paragraph entitled Underlying change adjustments on page 39.
Commentary is provided on both reported and adjusted results.

2 Stamped, metered and other prepaid revenue channels are subject to statistical sampling surveys to derive the revenue relating to parcels, marketing mail and letters.
These surveys are subject to continuous refinement, which may over time reallocate revenue between the products above, and which may occasionally lead to a consequent change to this estimate.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 | 21 Royal Mail plc | UK Parcels, International & Letters UKPIL Adjusted Adjusted 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended Underlying 1 25 March 2018 26 March 2017 change Volumes m Letters Addressed letters 11,269 11,922 5% Unaddressed letters 3,109 2,934 6% Parcels Core network 1,132 1,073 6% Parcelforce Worldwide 98 96 2% Total 1,230 1,169 5% UKPIL delivered a resilient performance.
Revenue was flat on an underlying basis.
Total parcel revenue was up four per cent, offsetting total letter revenue which was down four per cent.
Total parcel volumes increased by five per cent on an underlying basis.
Performance in the last month of the year was impacted by adverse weather conditions in the UK.
Total parcel revenue growth of four per cent reflects the mix in domestic and international traffic channels.
Royal Mail domestic account parcels saw good growth.
We won new customers and gained more traffic from existing customers.
Royal Mail domestic account parcel volumes, excluding Amazon, were up four per cent on an underlying basis.
Royal Mail Tracked 24 48 and Tracked Returns, our key e-commerce products, grew by 28 per cent.
We expect growth from these products to moderate in 2018-19 due to the strong historic performance.
Amazon parcel traffic grew strongly due to higher volumes of letterbox-sized parcels.
We continue to launch new initiatives to win more volumes.
They include providing later LATs for next day delivery.
Our international parcels business benefitted from our new initiative to attract cross-border traffic mainly from Asia into Europe.
This accounted for around two percentage points of the underlying parcel volume growth and around one percentage point of the parcel revenue growth in the year, contributing 48 million of revenue.
We are targeting continued growth in this product as we plan to expand the service to the US in 2018-19.
We saw improved import volumes outside our cross-border initiative, however contract export volumes were flat due to the competitive market.
Parcelforce Worldwide volumes increased by two per cent.
This was driven by new contract wins and growth in existing customers in a highly competitive express parcels market.
Addressed letter volumes excluding political parties election mailings declined by five per cent on an underlying basis, in line with our expectations.
Low average unit revenue AUR unaddressed letter volumes were up six per cent reflecting recent initiatives to encourage incremental volumes.
Total letter revenue including marketing mail decreased by four per cent, benefiting from revenue from mailings associated with the 2017 General Election.
Marketing mail revenue, which includes redirections and our Address Management Unit, increased by one per cent following last years sharp slowdown due to business uncertainty.
We are monitoring the impact of continuing business uncertainty in the UK on letter volumes.
We are also monitoring the potential impact of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR, which takes effect from 25 May 2018.
This may lead to a decline in marketing mail volumes.
We maintain our medium-term outlook for an annual decline of four to six per cent in addressed letter volumes excluding political parties election mailings.
However, due to the potential impact of GDPR and, or, if business uncertainty persists, we expect that addressed letter volume decline will be at the higher end of the four to six per cent range in 2018-19 and may fall outside the range in a period.
Operating costs before transformation costs Adjusted Adjusted 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended Underlying 1 m 25 March 2018 26 March 2017 change People costs 4,908 4,865 Flat Non-people costs 2,204 2,245 2% Distribution and conveyance costs 798 828 4% Infrastructure costs 751 740 1% Other operating costs 655 677 3% Total 7,112 7,110 Flat Total adjusted operating costs before transformation costs were flat on an underlying basis.
Whilst we have seen an increase in semi-variable costs associated with the growth in tracked and international parcel volumes, this was largely offset by our cost avoidance programme.
The cost avoidance programme in UKPIL was ahead of our expectations.
It delivered 235 million of costs avoided in the year, comprising people costs of 90 million and non-people costs of 145 million.
We delivered benefits across a number of initiatives during the year.
They included distribution optimisation, transformation of our IT infrastructure, management headcount reduction, improvements in network productivity, terminal dues revenue protection activities, lower property costs and supplier contract renegotiations.
We avoided annualised operating costs of 642 million over the past three financial years, ahead of our 600 million target.
We are planning to avoid a further 230 million of costs in 2018-19, including absorption of the shorter working week for full-time employees covered in the new Pensions, Pay and Pipeline agreement.
22 | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017-18 Strategic report | Governance | Financial statements | Other information Adjusted people costs were flat on an underlying basis.
The five per cent frontline pay award effective from October 2017 was partially offset by our cost avoidance programme activities, largely management headcount reduction and network productivity.
The frontline pay award of 101 million has been accrued this year and was paid in the first quarter of 2018-19.
Bonus costs were 15 million lower as we missed our annual bonus targets on productivity, complaints and Quality of Service.
Taking into account factors including a challenging industrial relations environment, severe weather, Cyber Week and Australian flu, we estimate we would have achieved our First Class Target and exceeded the Second Class one.
Higher volumes in Parcelforce Worldwide led to incremental people costs.
We saw a one per cent improvement in core network productivity.
This was achieved through a 0.9 per cent reduction in core network hours, with workload 0.1 per cent higher as the increase in parcel volumes was partially offset by declining letter volumes.
Productivity was lower than our annual improvement target of two to three per cent due to the industrial relations environment, high levels of sickness-related absence and adverse weather conditions in the second half, which drove an increase in variable hours.
We are targeting productivity improvement towards the upper end of our two to three per cent target range in 2018-19.
The first year impact of the Apprenticeship Levy was 20 million, which we have excluded from underlying movements.
As previously disclosed, further changes in wage legislation such as the Working Time Directive may also impact people costs in the future.
Non-people costs decreased by two per cent on an underlying basis.
Distribution and conveyance costs decreased by four per cent.
This was mainly due to terminal dues 14 million lower as increases of 6 million driven largely by volume were more than offset by savings from revenue protection activities.
Total diesel and jet fuel costs of 147 million were 12 million lower than the prior year due to lower pricing and improved fleet management.
We expect diesel and jet fuel costs to be broadly flat in 2018-19.
Infrastructure costs were one per cent higher on an underlying basis.
This was largely driven by a 36 million increase in depreciation and amortisation from investment in IT, new vehicles and other assets.
We expect depreciation costs to increase by around 10 million in 2018-19.
Increased utilisation of technology to support growth in tracked parcels led to an increase in infrastructure costs in the year.
We expect growth in tracked parcel volumes to continue in 2018-19, driving a further increase in IT costs of around 15 million.
Within infrastructure costs, the cost avoidance programme delivered benefits in property through the integration of the Romec business, supplier contract renegotiations and lower discretionary spend across the estate.
Other operating costs decreased by three per cent on an underlying basis due to cost avoidance activities, including savings on other supplier contract renegotiations and lower marketing and discretionary spend.
This more than offset an increase in customer service costs driven by higher tracked parcel volumes.
Transformation costs Adjusted Adjusted 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended m 25 March 2018 26 March 2017 Voluntary redundancy 44 62 Project costs 69 75 Total 113 137 Transformation costs of 113 million were below our expectation of around 130 million.
This was due to the industrial relations environment, which affected the pace of change and therefore voluntary redundancies in the year.
There was a net decrease of around 660 employees in the 3 year largely reflecting management headcount reductions.
At the year end, full time equivalent employees FTEs reduced by 185 to 147,985 FTEs reflecting the higher level of variable hours in the network to recover from the impact of adverse weather and sickness-related absences.
Project costs largely comprised initiatives supporting the cost avoidance programme.
We continue to forecast transformation costs of between 130-150 million per annum.
However, we expect transformation costs to be at the higher end of the range in 2018-19 as we continue to drive network productivity improvements.
Operating profit after transformation costs Adjusted operating profit after transformation costs of 390 million was up four per cent on an underlying basis due to lower transformation costs.
Operating profit margin after transformation costs was 5.1 per cent.
It is up 20 basis points compared with the prior year.
3 FTE numbers relate to the total number of paid hours including part-time, full-time and agency hours divided by the standard full-time working hours in the same period.
