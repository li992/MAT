24 Hochschild Mining PLC OPERATING REVIEW WORLD-CLASS PRODUCTION GROWTH IN THE AMERICAS Production In 2018, Hochschild exceeded its revised full year production guidance of 38.5 million silver ounces equivalent ounces 520,000 gold equivalent ounces.
Production was a record 39.0 million silver equivalent ounces 526,650 gold equivalent ounces comprising 260,436 ounces of gold and 19.7 million ounces of silver.
This was mostly due to a record year at Inmaculada as well as higher production from Pallancata.
The overall attributable production target for 2019 is 457,000 gold equivalent ounces or 37.0 million silver equivalent ounces.
