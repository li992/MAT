The catalyst for this at Strathkelvin has been our agreement with B&Q to take a surrender of their lease of a 3,716 sq m unit at one end of the park and construct a new 9,569 sq m unit at the other end.
The local authority resolved to grant planning permission for this last September and the Section 75 Agreement has just been concluded.
