Review of Operations During 2003, the Morila mine maintained its position as one of the worlds lowest cost and largest producers.
By year end, after three years of production, the mine had produced 2.62 million ounces of gold at a total cash cost of US$89 per ounce.
16 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2003 OPERATIONS AND PROJECTS West Africa Areas of interest Morila Gold Mine In 2003 the Morila Mine confirmed its status as one of the worlds leading gold mines both in terms of ounces of gold produced and production costs.
The mine produced almost 800 000 ounces at a total cash cost of US$100 per ounce.
This degree of profitability enabled substantial dividends to be paid and has allowed Randgold Resources to further strengthen its balance sheet.
The Morila Gold Mine is owned by a Malian company, Morila SA which in turn is owned 80% by Morila Limited and 20% by the State of Mali.
Morila Limited is jointly owned by Randgold Resources and AngloGold.
The mine is controlled by a 50:50 joint venture management committee.
Dayto-day operations are the responsibility of a Malian subsidiary of AngloGold Limited.
During the third quarter of the year the mine passed the milestone of 2.5 million ounces of gold, produced in just three full years since inception.
By year end the mine had produced 2.62 million ounces of gold at a total cash cost of US$89 per ounce.
In total for the year 2003, the mine produced 793 992 ounces at US$76 per ounce cash operating cost and US$100 per ounce total cash cost.
This performance maintains Morilas position as one of the lowest cost and largest gold producers for this period worldwide.
Total cash profit for the year was US$195 million and distributions to shareholders totalled US$174 million.
The total dividend paid to Randgold Resources during the year amounted to US$69.6 million.

Annual Report 2003 Randgold Resources 21 Loulo Mine Infrastructure In December 2003 the development of a six year opencast project at Loulo was approved by the Board of Randgold Resources.
22 22 Randgold Resour Randgold Resources ces Annual Repor Annual Report 2003 t 2003 Loulo Project The Loulo Mine Project is situated in western Mali adjacent to the Falm River which forms the frontier with Senegal.
It is located 350 kilometres west of Bamako and 220 kilometres south of Kayes.
Loulo falls within the Birrimian sequence of the Kenieba inlier.
This succession of volcanosedimentary and clastic rocks contain several major regional shear structures hosting gold deposits such as Sadiola, Segala, Tabakoto and Loulo.
Loulo is situated 96 kilometres from Sadiola and approximately 25 kilometres from Segala and Tabakoto.
The original Loulo 0 gold deposit was discovered by Syndicat Or a joint venture between Bureau fide Recherches Gologiques et Minires BRGM and Direction Nationale fide la Gologie et des Mines DNGM in 1981.
Syndicat Or continued with exploration until 1989 and concluded with a feasibility study showing that the Loulo 0 deposit was subeconomic.
In June 1992, BHP entered into an option and share purchase agreement with BRGM and the Malian government, referred to as the Somilo Joint Venture.
In October 1996, BHP Minerals Mali Inc was acquired by Randgold Resources which thereby took control of the Loulo Project.
At this stage, project resources stood at 1.03 million ounces being the BHP estimate at Loulo 0.
A period of rapid exploration followed, resulting in the discovery of the Yalea deposit.
A feasibility study was completed which envisaged a 120 000 tonnes per month operation mining ore from the two identified orebodies, Loulo 0 and Yalea for a period of 10 years.
Submission and approval of the feasibility study by the Board of Socit des Mines fide Loulo SA Somilo allowed Randgold Resources to increase its stake in the project to 51%.
However, the project was put on hold as a result of the rapid drop in gold price.
The confidence Randgold Resources has in the project was amply demonstrated by the acquisition of a further 29% of the project from Normandy La Source SAS in April 2001, bringing the Companys share to 80%.
The other 20% is held by the State of Mali.
The shares are held through the Malian company, Somilo.
Since the completion of an updated feasibility study on the Loulo Project in March 2003, considerable progress has been made in further defining a viable project.
Apart from the gold price, which has increased considerably from the US$300 oz level at which the cashflows were previously run, several technical issues were re-investigated in detail.
These issues were: The orebody model and additional drilling along strike and down dip Pit optimisation Pit design and scheduling Process development Tailings deposition procedure Closure estimate Financial Mining costs were also refined and some gold price protection was considered in the evaluation of the project.
In total the re-investigation of the issues resulted in better definition of a viable project with an improved understanding of the risks involved.
An addendum to the March 2003 feasibility study was completed in December 2003 and the development of a six year opencast project was approved by the board of Randgold Resources in the same month.

30 Randgold Resources Annual Report 2003 EXPLORATION REVIEW Exploration activities in 2003 focused on the conversion of resources to reserves and the expansion of the resource base at Loulo: the outlining of new mineralised systems for drill testing in Loulo, within the Morila region and in Senegal: the generation of new target areas and acquisition of holdings in Mali South, Mali West and Tanzania: and finally, pursuing new opportunities in Burkina Faso and Ghana.
The geological model for Morila has evolved and facilitated the identification of new mineralised systems both on and off lease in the Morila region with reconnaissance drilling returning positive intercepts at the Ntiola target and a new target being outlined on the OMRD joint venture.
At Loulo, an aggressive drilling programme is converting resources to reserves on the satellite deposits and confirms continuity of geology and grade to depths of 300 to 400 metres below surface at the Loulo 0 and Yalea deposits, which are still open.
This drilling also highlighted the presence of hidden, high grade payshoots that do not come to surface within both orebodies.
In addition to the resource conversion work, new conceptual targets are being drill tested and a wide zone of mineralisation has been outlined at Baboto with significant intercepts and potential for a plus two kilometre strike length.
In Senegal, exploration work has highlighted a plus six kilometre soil anomaly with values of up to 8.9g t and bedrock samples of up to 9.8g t. The anomaly locates within a north-south structure and can be linked to the Sabodala Mine in the north and the KB target on our Kanoumering Permit.
A further two drill targets are being defined on the Tomboronkoto Permit referred to as BA and TA.
In Tanzania work has focused on consolidating a strong position within the Lake Victoria Goldfields, which includes a thirty kilometre contiguous strike length on the Musoma Greenstone Belt.
A joint venture has been signed with Australian junior, Goldstream NL, over an area where a previous helicopter magnetic survey highlights untested structural zones associated with gold mineralisation.
During the year the Company continued to consolidate its portfolio and now boasts the premier footprint on the major gold bearing belts within its priority countries of Mali, Senegal and Cte dIvoire.
This footprint is expanding with the acquisition of mineral rights within new belts in Burkina Faso and Tanzania as well as consolidation in existing areas.
In Mali West the Company holds the dominant position around Loulo and has expanded its portfolio by undertaking a collaborative initiative with the Sitakili artisanal community to explore the Sitakili Prospect.
In the 2 Morila region the Company still holds more than 2 500 km around the 2 mine area and has acquired two new permits covering 500 km in southern Mali.
In Senegal the Company has secured the premier position along the Sabodala Belt locating just south of the Sabodala deposit.
In 2 Cte dIvoire the Company holds title to over 3 000 km on the SenefouBoundiali Belts and its extension north to Syama in Mali.
In Burkina Faso the Company has two permit applications pending on potential drill targets.
Finally, in Tanzania the Company now hold 13 licences covering 2 710 km within the Lake Victorian Goldfields.
Randgold Resources portfolio of projects in West Africa and elsewhere reflects its strategically driven exploration approach and overriding objective, which is to build sustainable mining projects with significant returns.
This strategy is attested to by its discovery and development track record.
The Companys projects are well balanced across the various levels of its resource triangle.
The immediate aim now is to drive projects up to the production pinnacle of the triangle through the delineation and development of economically exploitable resources.
